a deep rift has emerged over a string of issues from trade to terrorism to the un war crimes court . when president george bush arrived in europe in may under clear blue skies to garner support for his war on terrorism , it seemed that not a single dark cloud would mar what appeared a strained yet cordial transatlantic relationship .
just two months later , the same transatlantic relationship has gone from " cordial " to " sour " as a fallout over a series of recent thorny issues have added to gathering storm clouds over us-european relations .
tensions over icc buffet fragile us-european ties the latest row over the jurisdiction of the new international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- has delivered a strong blow to an already shaky transatlantic relationship .
europeans are outraged at what they see as a us attempt to emasculate the newly established international court , by demanding judicial immunity for its own soldiers and peacekeepers .
the us has further raised european hackles with washington threatening to veto a un police mission in bosnia .
at a parliamentary conference of the osce -lrb- organisation for security and co-operation in europe -rrb- in berlin on saturday , several german politicians including the german foreign minister joschka fischer strongly criticised the us ' blocking stance towards the international criminal court .
fischer said that the us was defeating the very purpose of the court which was to ensure that individuals accused of committing grave crimes against humanity would not get away with impunity .
us criticism growing in europe fischer ’ s words echo a general wave of us criticism sweeping across the european union and especially within the european media .
earlier this year , the european union commissioner for external affairs , chris patten told the guardian newspaper that he hoped the united states would n't go into " unilateralist overdrive " .
though few doubt that us criticism in europe has been especially fuelled by the latest transatlantic dispute over the international criminal court , bush 's long-awaited middle east policy speech last month which tilted in israel 's favour also played a role in prompting the latest wave of us criticism in europe .
europeans exasperated by bush 's mid-east proposals bush ’ s proposal of replacing palestinian president yasser arafat by leaders " not compromised by terror " was officially met with caution and politeness by eu leaders , who stressed the positive elements of his support for a palestinian state .
but privately , several eu leaders in interviews with the news agency reuters , said they were dismayed at the absence of us attempts to restrain israeli forces occupying west bank cities or back an international peace conference , to which washington had previously agreed .
" america is so powerful and touchy now that no one wants to contradict bush publicly " , one eu diplomat said .
differences have also arisen over the eu ’ s funding of yasser arafat ’ s palestinian authority even as the us denounces it .
even britain , washington ’ s closest european ally , has been notably unsupportive of bush ’ s call to replace arafat , saying it was up to the palestinians to choose their leaders .
two different ways of looking at the world political analysts believe that the two latest rifts between the us and europe have underlined the fundamental differences in us and european perspectives of viewing the world , specifically after the september 11 terrorist attacks last year in new york .
in many american eyes , europeans appear cowardly in the " war against terrorism " , seek to restrain washington and are complacent about threats from so-called " rogue states " suspected of developing weapons of mass destruction .
for their part , several europeans believe that washington is only keen to eradicate the symptoms of terror rather than get to the root of it by branding potentially hostile nations an " axis of evil " and see " unilateralist " hawks in the us administration seeking to tear up the international rule-book .
following bush 's controversial state of the union speech in february this year , french foreign minister , hubert vedrine said in an interview with france inter , " we are currently threatened by a simplified approach which reduces all problems of the world to the mere struggle against terrorism .
the americans are acting on a unilateral basis , without consulting anyone else , and their decisions are guided exclusively by their own individual views and interests . "
further , european leaders are also wary about an american military attack on iraq to overthrow iraqi president saddam hussein , fearing that this would destabilise the region and deflect attention from the israel-palestinian conflict which is more pressing .
string of niggling disputes plague transatlantic relations away from the blatant differences related to the " war on terrorism " , an array of other disagreements have continued to hobble the transatlantic relationship .
specific clashes include a ban on anti-personnel land mines , a comprehensive test ban treaty , and more famously , the kyoto treaty on climate change – all of which are supported in europe and opposed by the us .
to make matters worse , trade disputes over us steel tariffs , export and farm subsidies and eu efforts to obstruct the import of genetically-modified foods make the gap between america and europe a yawning one .
" it is time to stop pretending that europeans and americans share a common view of the world , or even that they occupy the same world " , robert kagan of the carnegie endowment for international peace wrote in the journal " policy review " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un missions in jeopardy ?
of the 45,145 un peacekeepers stationed around the world , only 704 are american .
but the current dispute over the bosnia mission brings to question , what role the us ’ s withdrawal plays in the future of un peacekeeping .

though few doubt that us criticism in europe has been especially fuelled by the latest transatlantic dispute over the international criminal court , bush 's long-awaited middle east policy speech last month which tilted in israel 's favour also played a role in prompting the latest wave of us criticism in europe .
europeans exasperated by bush 's mid-east proposals bush ’ s proposal of replacing palestinian president yasser arafat by leaders " not compromised by terror " was officially met with caution and politeness by eu leaders , who stressed the positive elements of his support for a palestinian state .
but privately , several eu leaders in interviews with the news agency reuters , said they were dismayed at the absence of us attempts to restrain israeli forces occupying west bank cities or back an international peace conference , to which washington had previously agreed .
" america is so powerful and touchy now that no one wants to contradict bush publicly " , one eu diplomat said .
differences have also arisen over the eu ’ s funding of yasser arafat ’ s palestinian authority even as the us denounces it .
even britain , washington ’ s closest european ally , has been notably unsupportive of bush ’ s call to replace arafat , saying it was up to the palestinians to choose their leaders .
two different ways of looking at the world political analysts believe that the two latest rifts between the us and europe have underlined the fundamental differences in us and european perspectives of viewing the world , specifically after the september 11 terrorist attacks last year in new york .
in many american eyes , europeans appear cowardly in the " war against terrorism " , seek to restrain washington and are complacent about threats from so-called " rogue states " suspected of developing weapons of mass destruction .
for their part , several europeans believe that washington is only keen to eradicate the symptoms of terror rather than get to the root of it by branding potentially hostile nations an " axis of evil " and see " unilateralist " hawks in the us administration seeking to tear up the international rule-book .
following bush 's controversial state of the union speech in february this year , french foreign minister , hubert vedrine said in an interview with france inter , " we are currently threatened by a simplified approach which reduces all problems of the world to the mere struggle against terrorism .
the americans are acting on a unilateral basis , without consulting anyone else , and their decisions are guided exclusively by their own individual views and interests . "
further , european leaders are also wary about an american military attack on iraq to overthrow iraqi president saddam hussein , fearing that this would destabilise the region and deflect attention from the israel-palestinian conflict which is more pressing .
string of niggling disputes plague transatlantic relations away from the blatant differences related to the " war on terrorism " , an array of other disagreements have continued to hobble the transatlantic relationship .
specific clashes include a ban on anti-personnel land mines , a comprehensive test ban treaty , and more famously , the kyoto treaty on climate change – all of which are supported in europe and opposed by the us .
to make matters worse , trade disputes over us steel tariffs , export and farm subsidies and eu efforts to obstruct the import of genetically-modified foods make the gap between america and europe a yawning one .
" it is time to stop pretending that europeans and americans share a common view of the world , or even that they occupy the same world " , robert kagan of the carnegie endowment for international peace wrote in the journal " policy review " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un missions in jeopardy ?
of the 45,145 un peacekeepers stationed around the world , only 704 are american .
but the current dispute over the bosnia mission brings to question , what role the us ’ s withdrawal plays in the future of un peacekeeping .

a deep rift has emerged over a string of issues from trade to terrorism to the un war crimes court . when president george bush arrived in europe in may under clear blue skies to garner support for his war on terrorism , it seemed that not a single dark cloud would mar what appeared a strained yet cordial transatlantic relationship .

at a parliamentary conference of the osce -lrb- organisation for security and co-operation in europe -rrb- in berlin on saturday , several german politicians including the german foreign minister joschka fischer strongly criticised the us ' blocking stance towards the international criminal court .

a deep rift has emerged over a string of issues from trade to terrorism to the un war crimes court . when president george bush arrived in europe in may under clear blue skies to garner support for his war on terrorism , it seemed that not a single dark cloud would mar what appeared a strained yet cordial transatlantic relationship .
just two months later , the same transatlantic relationship has gone from " cordial " to " sour " as a fallout over a series of recent thorny issues have added to gathering storm clouds over us-european relations .
tensions over icc buffet fragile us-european ties the latest row over the jurisdiction of the new international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- has delivered a strong blow to an already shaky transatlantic relationship .
europeans are outraged at what they see as a us attempt to emasculate the newly established international court , by demanding judicial immunity for its own soldiers and peacekeepers .
the us has further raised european hackles with washington threatening to veto a un police mission in bosnia .
at a parliamentary conference of the osce -lrb- organisation for security and co-operation in europe -rrb- in berlin on saturday , several german politicians including the german foreign minister joschka fischer strongly criticised the us ' blocking stance towards the international criminal court .
fischer said that the us was defeating the very purpose of the court which was to ensure that individuals accused of committing grave crimes against humanity would not get away with impunity .
us criticism growing in europe fischer ’ s words echo a general wave of us criticism sweeping across the european union and especially within the european media .
earlier this year , the european union commissioner for external affairs , chris patten told the guardian newspaper that he hoped the united states would n't go into " unilateralist overdrive " .
though few doubt that us criticism in europe has been especially fuelled by the latest transatlantic dispute over the international criminal court , bush 's long-awaited middle east policy speech last month which tilted in israel 's favour also played a role in prompting the latest wave of us criticism in europe .
europeans exasperated by bush 's mid-east proposals bush ’ s proposal of replacing palestinian president yasser arafat by leaders " not compromised by terror " was officially met with caution and politeness by eu leaders , who stressed the positive elements of his support for a palestinian state .
but privately , several eu leaders in interviews with the news agency reuters , said they were dismayed at the absence of us attempts to restrain israeli forces occupying west bank cities or back an international peace conference , to which washington had previously agreed .
" america is so powerful and touchy now that no one wants to contradict bush publicly " , one eu diplomat said .
differences have also arisen over the eu ’ s funding of yasser arafat ’ s palestinian authority even as the us denounces it .
even britain , washington ’ s closest european ally , has been notably unsupportive of bush ’ s call to replace arafat , saying it was up to the palestinians to choose their leaders .
two different ways of looking at the world political analysts believe that the two latest rifts between the us and europe have underlined the fundamental differences in us and european perspectives of viewing the world , specifically after the september 11 terrorist attacks last year in new york .
in many american eyes , europeans appear cowardly in the " war against terrorism " , seek to restrain washington and are complacent about threats from so-called " rogue states " suspected of developing weapons of mass destruction .
for their part , several europeans believe that washington is only keen to eradicate the symptoms of terror rather than get to the root of it by branding potentially hostile nations an " axis of evil " and see " unilateralist " hawks in the us administration seeking to tear up the international rule-book .
following bush 's controversial state of the union speech in february this year , french foreign minister , hubert vedrine said in an interview with france inter , " we are currently threatened by a simplified approach which reduces all problems of the world to the mere struggle against terrorism .
the americans are acting on a unilateral basis , without consulting anyone else , and their decisions are guided exclusively by their own individual views and interests . "
further , european leaders are also wary about an american military attack on iraq to overthrow iraqi president saddam hussein , fearing that this would destabilise the region and deflect attention from the israel-palestinian conflict which is more pressing .
string of niggling disputes plague transatlantic relations away from the blatant differences related to the " war on terrorism " , an array of other disagreements have continued to hobble the transatlantic relationship .
specific clashes include a ban on anti-personnel land mines , a comprehensive test ban treaty , and more famously , the kyoto treaty on climate change – all of which are supported in europe and opposed by the us .

a top health official has warned that some african countries could lose a quarter of their workforce to aids in the next 20 years .
this could have serious implications on these nations ’ already fragile economies . the barcelona international aids conference began its first full day on monday with a packed schedule of scientific briefings and updates on aids .
bernhard schwartländer , director of the hiv / aids department of the world health organization , said more than 20 percent of adults in seven sub-saharan african countries had the virus that causes aids .
in botswana , lesotho , swaziland and zimbabwe the rate is one in three .
schwartländer warned that the loss of workers due to aids could hurt economic growth and undermine key sectors of society in the worst-hit countries .
" by 2020 , more than 25 percent of the workforce in some countries may be lost to aids , " he said .
already in kenya , aids accounts for up to three of every four deaths in the police force , schwartländer said .
swaziland would have to train 13,000 new teachers over the next 17 years to maintain services - 7,000 more than if there were no aids deaths .
asia is a further region particularly threatened by the deadly epidemic .
health experts told the international conference that asia is sweeping aids under the carpet , endangering the lives of millions in the world 's two most populous countries , china and india .
new hope activists and officials were united in calling for cheap , life-saving drugs to be made available to fight aids in poor countries .
the us biotechnology company vaxgen inc announced at the conference that it was working on a new vaccine against hiv / aids .
it could be available by 2005 if results from human safety and efficacy trials are as good as expected , said donald francis , president and co-founder of the company .
early results from phase iii trials of the vaccine will not be available until early next year .
but francis said vaxgen is optimistic it would work .
" i think we will get protection -lrb- from the virus -rrb- , but i do n't know what level we will get , " he told the delegates .
treatment in the wrong place a vaccine is considered the best hope of getting the rampant virus under control .
drug cocktails that can reduce the virus to undetectable levels , so-called " anti-retroviral " drugs , can extend the lives of people with aids .
but this is mainly the case in rich western countries .
such treatment is hardly available in poor nations .
many speakers at the barcelona conference condemned the poor response to united nations secretary general kofi annan 's global aids fund , intended to raise money to fight the epidemic .
less than $ 3 billion has so far been raised of the fund 's $ 10 billion goal .
" we need more resources to be put into the global fund to be able to get this money to where people are suffering , " uganda 's milly katana of the hiv / aids community movement said .

the us biotechnology company vaxgen inc announced at the conference that it was working on a new vaccine against hiv / aids .
it could be available by 2005 if results from human safety and efficacy trials are as good as expected , said donald francis , president and co-founder of the company .
early results from phase iii trials of the vaccine will not be available until early next year .
but francis said vaxgen is optimistic it would work .
" i think we will get protection -lrb- from the virus -rrb- , but i do n't know what level we will get , " he told the delegates .
treatment in the wrong place a vaccine is considered the best hope of getting the rampant virus under control .
drug cocktails that can reduce the virus to undetectable levels , so-called " anti-retroviral " drugs , can extend the lives of people with aids .
but this is mainly the case in rich western countries .
such treatment is hardly available in poor nations .
many speakers at the barcelona conference condemned the poor response to united nations secretary general kofi annan 's global aids fund , intended to raise money to fight the epidemic .
less than $ 3 billion has so far been raised of the fund 's $ 10 billion goal .
" we need more resources to be put into the global fund to be able to get this money to where people are suffering , " uganda 's milly katana of the hiv / aids community movement said .
" if there is one thing that really should be globalized , that is the right to a healthy life , " said stefano vella , president of the international aids society . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chilling facts turn the heat on aids conference thousands of aids experts have converged on barcelona to map out new strategies for halting the spread of a disease that has killed 20 million worldwide and 19,000 in germany .

a deep rift has emerged over a string of issues from trade to terrorism to the un war crimes court . when president george bush arrived in europe in may under clear blue skies to garner support for his war on terrorism , it seemed that not a single dark cloud would mar what appeared a strained yet cordial transatlantic relationship .
just two months later , the same transatlantic relationship has gone from " cordial " to " sour " as a fallout over a series of recent thorny issues have added to gathering storm clouds over us-european relations .
tensions over icc buffet fragile us-european ties the latest row over the jurisdiction of the new international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- has delivered a strong blow to an already shaky transatlantic relationship .
europeans are outraged at what they see as a us attempt to emasculate the newly established international court , by demanding judicial immunity for its own soldiers and peacekeepers .
the us has further raised european hackles with washington threatening to veto a un police mission in bosnia .
at a parliamentary conference of the osce -lrb- organisation for security and co-operation in europe -rrb- in berlin on saturday , several german politicians including the german foreign minister joschka fischer strongly criticised the us ' blocking stance towards the international criminal court .
fischer said that the us was defeating the very purpose of the court which was to ensure that individuals accused of committing grave crimes against humanity would not get away with impunity .
us criticism growing in europe fischer ’ s words echo a general wave of us criticism sweeping across the european union and especially within the european media .
earlier this year , the european union commissioner for external affairs , chris patten told the guardian newspaper that he hoped the united states would n't go into " unilateralist overdrive " .
though few doubt that us criticism in europe has been especially fuelled by the latest transatlantic dispute over the international criminal court , bush 's long-awaited middle east policy speech last month which tilted in israel 's favour also played a role in prompting the latest wave of us criticism in europe .
europeans exasperated by bush 's mid-east proposals bush ’ s proposal of replacing palestinian president yasser arafat by leaders " not compromised by terror " was officially met with caution and politeness by eu leaders , who stressed the positive elements of his support for a palestinian state .
but privately , several eu leaders in interviews with the news agency reuters , said they were dismayed at the absence of us attempts to restrain israeli forces occupying west bank cities or back an international peace conference , to which washington had previously agreed .
" america is so powerful and touchy now that no one wants to contradict bush publicly " , one eu diplomat said .
differences have also arisen over the eu ’ s funding of yasser arafat ’ s palestinian authority even as the us denounces it .
even britain , washington ’ s closest european ally , has been notably unsupportive of bush ’ s call to replace arafat , saying it was up to the palestinians to choose their leaders .
two different ways of looking at the world political analysts believe that the two latest rifts between the us and europe have underlined the fundamental differences in us and european perspectives of viewing the world , specifically after the september 11 terrorist attacks last year in new york .
in many american eyes , europeans appear cowardly in the " war against terrorism " , seek to restrain washington and are complacent about threats from so-called " rogue states " suspected of developing weapons of mass destruction .
for their part , several europeans believe that washington is only keen to eradicate the symptoms of terror rather than get to the root of it by branding potentially hostile nations an " axis of evil " and see " unilateralist " hawks in the us administration seeking to tear up the international rule-book .
following bush 's controversial state of the union speech in february this year , french foreign minister , hubert vedrine said in an interview with france inter , " we are currently threatened by a simplified approach which reduces all problems of the world to the mere struggle against terrorism .
the americans are acting on a unilateral basis , without consulting anyone else , and their decisions are guided exclusively by their own individual views and interests . "
further , european leaders are also wary about an american military attack on iraq to overthrow iraqi president saddam hussein , fearing that this would destabilise the region and deflect attention from the israel-palestinian conflict which is more pressing .
string of niggling disputes plague transatlantic relations away from the blatant differences related to the " war on terrorism " , an array of other disagreements have continued to hobble the transatlantic relationship .
specific clashes include a ban on anti-personnel land mines , a comprehensive test ban treaty , and more famously , the kyoto treaty on climate change – all of which are supported in europe and opposed by the us .
to make matters worse , trade disputes over us steel tariffs , export and farm subsidies and eu efforts to obstruct the import of genetically-modified foods make the gap between america and europe a yawning one .
" it is time to stop pretending that europeans and americans share a common view of the world , or even that they occupy the same world " , robert kagan of the carnegie endowment for international peace wrote in the journal " policy review " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un missions in jeopardy ?
of the 45,145 un peacekeepers stationed around the world , only 704 are american .
but the current dispute over the bosnia mission brings to question , what role the us ’ s withdrawal plays in the future of un peacekeeping .

a top health official has warned that some african countries could lose a quarter of their workforce to aids in the next 20 years .
this could have serious implications on these nations ’ already fragile economies . the barcelona international aids conference began its first full day on monday with a packed schedule of scientific briefings and updates on aids .
bernhard schwartländer , director of the hiv / aids department of the world health organization , said more than 20 percent of adults in seven sub-saharan african countries had the virus that causes aids .
in botswana , lesotho , swaziland and zimbabwe the rate is one in three .
schwartländer warned that the loss of workers due to aids could hurt economic growth and undermine key sectors of society in the worst-hit countries .
" by 2020 , more than 25 percent of the workforce in some countries may be lost to aids , " he said .
already in kenya , aids accounts for up to three of every four deaths in the police force , schwartländer said .
swaziland would have to train 13,000 new teachers over the next 17 years to maintain services - 7,000 more than if there were no aids deaths .

a deep rift has emerged over a string of issues from trade to terrorism to the un war crimes court . when president george bush arrived in europe in may under clear blue skies to garner support for his war on terrorism , it seemed that not a single dark cloud would mar what appeared a strained yet cordial transatlantic relationship .
just two months later , the same transatlantic relationship has gone from " cordial " to " sour " as a fallout over a series of recent thorny issues have added to gathering storm clouds over us-european relations .
tensions over icc buffet fragile us-european ties the latest row over the jurisdiction of the new international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- has delivered a strong blow to an already shaky transatlantic relationship .
europeans are outraged at what they see as a us attempt to emasculate the newly established international court , by demanding judicial immunity for its own soldiers and peacekeepers .
the us has further raised european hackles with washington threatening to veto a un police mission in bosnia .
at a parliamentary conference of the osce -lrb- organisation for security and co-operation in europe -rrb- in berlin on saturday , several german politicians including the german foreign minister joschka fischer strongly criticised the us ' blocking stance towards the international criminal court .
fischer said that the us was defeating the very purpose of the court which was to ensure that individuals accused of committing grave crimes against humanity would not get away with impunity .
us criticism growing in europe fischer ’ s words echo a general wave of us criticism sweeping across the european union and especially within the european media .
earlier this year , the european union commissioner for external affairs , chris patten told the guardian newspaper that he hoped the united states would n't go into " unilateralist overdrive " .
though few doubt that us criticism in europe has been especially fuelled by the latest transatlantic dispute over the international criminal court , bush 's long-awaited middle east policy speech last month which tilted in israel 's favour also played a role in prompting the latest wave of us criticism in europe .
europeans exasperated by bush 's mid-east proposals bush ’ s proposal of replacing palestinian president yasser arafat by leaders " not compromised by terror " was officially met with caution and politeness by eu leaders , who stressed the positive elements of his support for a palestinian state .
but privately , several eu leaders in interviews with the news agency reuters , said they were dismayed at the absence of us attempts to restrain israeli forces occupying west bank cities or back an international peace conference , to which washington had previously agreed .
" america is so powerful and touchy now that no one wants to contradict bush publicly " , one eu diplomat said .
differences have also arisen over the eu ’ s funding of yasser arafat ’ s palestinian authority even as the us denounces it .
even britain , washington ’ s closest european ally , has been notably unsupportive of bush ’ s call to replace arafat , saying it was up to the palestinians to choose their leaders .
two different ways of looking at the world political analysts believe that the two latest rifts between the us and europe have underlined the fundamental differences in us and european perspectives of viewing the world , specifically after the september 11 terrorist attacks last year in new york .
in many american eyes , europeans appear cowardly in the " war against terrorism " , seek to restrain washington and are complacent about threats from so-called " rogue states " suspected of developing weapons of mass destruction .
for their part , several europeans believe that washington is only keen to eradicate the symptoms of terror rather than get to the root of it by branding potentially hostile nations an " axis of evil " and see " unilateralist " hawks in the us administration seeking to tear up the international rule-book .
following bush 's controversial state of the union speech in february this year , french foreign minister , hubert vedrine said in an interview with france inter , " we are currently threatened by a simplified approach which reduces all problems of the world to the mere struggle against terrorism .
the americans are acting on a unilateral basis , without consulting anyone else , and their decisions are guided exclusively by their own individual views and interests . "
further , european leaders are also wary about an american military attack on iraq to overthrow iraqi president saddam hussein , fearing that this would destabilise the region and deflect attention from the israel-palestinian conflict which is more pressing .
string of niggling disputes plague transatlantic relations away from the blatant differences related to the " war on terrorism " , an array of other disagreements have continued to hobble the transatlantic relationship .
specific clashes include a ban on anti-personnel land mines , a comprehensive test ban treaty , and more famously , the kyoto treaty on climate change – all of which are supported in europe and opposed by the us .
to make matters worse , trade disputes over us steel tariffs , export and farm subsidies and eu efforts to obstruct the import of genetically-modified foods make the gap between america and europe a yawning one .
" it is time to stop pretending that europeans and americans share a common view of the world , or even that they occupy the same world " , robert kagan of the carnegie endowment for international peace wrote in the journal " policy review " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un missions in jeopardy ?
of the 45,145 un peacekeepers stationed around the world , only 704 are american .

a top health official has warned that some african countries could lose a quarter of their workforce to aids in the next 20 years .
this could have serious implications on these nations ’ already fragile economies . the barcelona international aids conference began its first full day on monday with a packed schedule of scientific briefings and updates on aids .
bernhard schwartländer , director of the hiv / aids department of the world health organization , said more than 20 percent of adults in seven sub-saharan african countries had the virus that causes aids .
in botswana , lesotho , swaziland and zimbabwe the rate is one in three .
schwartländer warned that the loss of workers due to aids could hurt economic growth and undermine key sectors of society in the worst-hit countries .
" by 2020 , more than 25 percent of the workforce in some countries may be lost to aids , " he said .
already in kenya , aids accounts for up to three of every four deaths in the police force , schwartländer said .
swaziland would have to train 13,000 new teachers over the next 17 years to maintain services - 7,000 more than if there were no aids deaths .
asia is a further region particularly threatened by the deadly epidemic .
health experts told the international conference that asia is sweeping aids under the carpet , endangering the lives of millions in the world 's two most populous countries , china and india .
new hope activists and officials were united in calling for cheap , life-saving drugs to be made available to fight aids in poor countries .
the us biotechnology company vaxgen inc announced at the conference that it was working on a new vaccine against hiv / aids .
it could be available by 2005 if results from human safety and efficacy trials are as good as expected , said donald francis , president and co-founder of the company .
early results from phase iii trials of the vaccine will not be available until early next year .
but francis said vaxgen is optimistic it would work .
" i think we will get protection -lrb- from the virus -rrb- , but i do n't know what level we will get , " he told the delegates .
treatment in the wrong place a vaccine is considered the best hope of getting the rampant virus under control .
drug cocktails that can reduce the virus to undetectable levels , so-called " anti-retroviral " drugs , can extend the lives of people with aids .
but this is mainly the case in rich western countries .
such treatment is hardly available in poor nations .
many speakers at the barcelona conference condemned the poor response to united nations secretary general kofi annan 's global aids fund , intended to raise money to fight the epidemic .
less than $ 3 billion has so far been raised of the fund 's $ 10 billion goal .
" we need more resources to be put into the global fund to be able to get this money to where people are suffering , " uganda 's milly katana of the hiv / aids community movement said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.07.2002 transatlantic turbulence reaches new low großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a picture of cordiality before the latest transatlantic rows - president george bush with german president johannes rau in berlin in may , 2002 relations between the united states and europe have hit rock bottom since president george bush took office .
a deep rift has emerged over a string of issues from trade to terrorism to the un war crimes court . when president george bush arrived in europe in may under clear blue skies to garner support for his war on terrorism , it seemed that not a single dark cloud would mar what appeared a strained yet cordial transatlantic relationship .
just two months later , the same transatlantic relationship has gone from " cordial " to " sour " as a fallout over a series of recent thorny issues have added to gathering storm clouds over us-european relations .
tensions over icc buffet fragile us-european ties the latest row over the jurisdiction of the new international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- has delivered a strong blow to an already shaky transatlantic relationship .
europeans are outraged at what they see as a us attempt to emasculate the newly established international court , by demanding judicial immunity for its own soldiers and peacekeepers .
the us has further raised european hackles with washington threatening to veto a un police mission in bosnia .
at a parliamentary conference of the osce -lrb- organisation for security and co-operation in europe -rrb- in berlin on saturday , several german politicians including the german foreign minister joschka fischer strongly criticised the us ' blocking stance towards the international criminal court .
fischer said that the us was defeating the very purpose of the court which was to ensure that individuals accused of committing grave crimes against humanity would not get away with impunity .
us criticism growing in europe fischer ’ s words echo a general wave of us criticism sweeping across the european union and especially within the european media .
earlier this year , the european union commissioner for external affairs , chris patten told the guardian newspaper that he hoped the united states would n't go into " unilateralist overdrive " .
though few doubt that us criticism in europe has been especially fuelled by the latest transatlantic dispute over the international criminal court , bush 's long-awaited middle east policy speech last month which tilted in israel 's favour also played a role in prompting the latest wave of us criticism in europe .
europeans exasperated by bush 's mid-east proposals bush ’ s proposal of replacing palestinian president yasser arafat by leaders " not compromised by terror " was officially met with caution and politeness by eu leaders , who stressed the positive elements of his support for a palestinian state .
but privately , several eu leaders in interviews with the news agency reuters , said they were dismayed at the absence of us attempts to restrain israeli forces occupying west bank cities or back an international peace conference , to which washington had previously agreed .
" america is so powerful and touchy now that no one wants to contradict bush publicly " , one eu diplomat said .
differences have also arisen over the eu ’ s funding of yasser arafat ’ s palestinian authority even as the us denounces it .
even britain , washington ’ s closest european ally , has been notably unsupportive of bush ’ s call to replace arafat , saying it was up to the palestinians to choose their leaders .
two different ways of looking at the world political analysts believe that the two latest rifts between the us and europe have underlined the fundamental differences in us and european perspectives of viewing the world , specifically after the september 11 terrorist attacks last year in new york .
in many american eyes , europeans appear cowardly in the " war against terrorism " , seek to restrain washington and are complacent about threats from so-called " rogue states " suspected of developing weapons of mass destruction .
for their part , several europeans believe that washington is only keen to eradicate the symptoms of terror rather than get to the root of it by branding potentially hostile nations an " axis of evil " and see " unilateralist " hawks in the us administration seeking to tear up the international rule-book .
following bush 's controversial state of the union speech in february this year , french foreign minister , hubert vedrine said in an interview with france inter , " we are currently threatened by a simplified approach which reduces all problems of the world to the mere struggle against terrorism .
the americans are acting on a unilateral basis , without consulting anyone else , and their decisions are guided exclusively by their own individual views and interests . "
further , european leaders are also wary about an american military attack on iraq to overthrow iraqi president saddam hussein , fearing that this would destabilise the region and deflect attention from the israel-palestinian conflict which is more pressing .
string of niggling disputes plague transatlantic relations away from the blatant differences related to the " war on terrorism " , an array of other disagreements have continued to hobble the transatlantic relationship .
specific clashes include a ban on anti-personnel land mines , a comprehensive test ban treaty , and more famously , the kyoto treaty on climate change – all of which are supported in europe and opposed by the us .
to make matters worse , trade disputes over us steel tariffs , export and farm subsidies and eu efforts to obstruct the import of genetically-modified foods make the gap between america and europe a yawning one .
" it is time to stop pretending that europeans and americans share a common view of the world , or even that they occupy the same world " , robert kagan of the carnegie endowment for international peace wrote in the journal " policy review " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un missions in jeopardy ?
of the 45,145 un peacekeepers stationed around the world , only 704 are american .
but the current dispute over the bosnia mission brings to question , what role the us ’ s withdrawal plays in the future of un peacekeeping .

a top health official has warned that some african countries could lose a quarter of their workforce to aids in the next 20 years .
this could have serious implications on these nations ’ already fragile economies . the barcelona international aids conference began its first full day on monday with a packed schedule of scientific briefings and updates on aids .
bernhard schwartländer , director of the hiv / aids department of the world health organization , said more than 20 percent of adults in seven sub-saharan african countries had the virus that causes aids .
in botswana , lesotho , swaziland and zimbabwe the rate is one in three .
schwartländer warned that the loss of workers due to aids could hurt economic growth and undermine key sectors of society in the worst-hit countries .
" by 2020 , more than 25 percent of the workforce in some countries may be lost to aids , " he said .
already in kenya , aids accounts for up to three of every four deaths in the police force , schwartländer said .
swaziland would have to train 13,000 new teachers over the next 17 years to maintain services - 7,000 more than if there were no aids deaths .
asia is a further region particularly threatened by the deadly epidemic .
health experts told the international conference that asia is sweeping aids under the carpet , endangering the lives of millions in the world 's two most populous countries , china and india .
new hope activists and officials were united in calling for cheap , life-saving drugs to be made available to fight aids in poor countries .
the us biotechnology company vaxgen inc announced at the conference that it was working on a new vaccine against hiv / aids .
it could be available by 2005 if results from human safety and efficacy trials are as good as expected , said donald francis , president and co-founder of the company .
early results from phase iii trials of the vaccine will not be available until early next year .
but francis said vaxgen is optimistic it would work .
" i think we will get protection -lrb- from the virus -rrb- , but i do n't know what level we will get , " he told the delegates .
treatment in the wrong place a vaccine is considered the best hope of getting the rampant virus under control .
drug cocktails that can reduce the virus to undetectable levels , so-called " anti-retroviral " drugs , can extend the lives of people with aids .
but this is mainly the case in rich western countries .
such treatment is hardly available in poor nations .

a top health official has warned that some african countries could lose a quarter of their workforce to aids in the next 20 years .
this could have serious implications on these nations ’ already fragile economies . the barcelona international aids conference began its first full day on monday with a packed schedule of scientific briefings and updates on aids .
bernhard schwartländer , director of the hiv / aids department of the world health organization , said more than 20 percent of adults in seven sub-saharan african countries had the virus that causes aids .
in botswana , lesotho , swaziland and zimbabwe the rate is one in three .
schwartländer warned that the loss of workers due to aids could hurt economic growth and undermine key sectors of society in the worst-hit countries .
" by 2020 , more than 25 percent of the workforce in some countries may be lost to aids , " he said .
already in kenya , aids accounts for up to three of every four deaths in the police force , schwartländer said .
swaziland would have to train 13,000 new teachers over the next 17 years to maintain services - 7,000 more than if there were no aids deaths .
asia is a further region particularly threatened by the deadly epidemic .
health experts told the international conference that asia is sweeping aids under the carpet , endangering the lives of millions in the world 's two most populous countries , china and india .
new hope activists and officials were united in calling for cheap , life-saving drugs to be made available to fight aids in poor countries .
the us biotechnology company vaxgen inc announced at the conference that it was working on a new vaccine against hiv / aids .
it could be available by 2005 if results from human safety and efficacy trials are as good as expected , said donald francis , president and co-founder of the company .
early results from phase iii trials of the vaccine will not be available until early next year .
but francis said vaxgen is optimistic it would work .
" i think we will get protection -lrb- from the virus -rrb- , but i do n't know what level we will get , " he told the delegates .
treatment in the wrong place a vaccine is considered the best hope of getting the rampant virus under control .
drug cocktails that can reduce the virus to undetectable levels , so-called " anti-retroviral " drugs , can extend the lives of people with aids .
but this is mainly the case in rich western countries .
such treatment is hardly available in poor nations .

a deep rift has emerged over a string of issues from trade to terrorism to the un war crimes court . when president george bush arrived in europe in may under clear blue skies to garner support for his war on terrorism , it seemed that not a single dark cloud would mar what appeared a strained yet cordial transatlantic relationship .
just two months later , the same transatlantic relationship has gone from " cordial " to " sour " as a fallout over a series of recent thorny issues have added to gathering storm clouds over us-european relations .
tensions over icc buffet fragile us-european ties the latest row over the jurisdiction of the new international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- has delivered a strong blow to an already shaky transatlantic relationship .
europeans are outraged at what they see as a us attempt to emasculate the newly established international court , by demanding judicial immunity for its own soldiers and peacekeepers .
the us has further raised european hackles with washington threatening to veto a un police mission in bosnia .
at a parliamentary conference of the osce -lrb- organisation for security and co-operation in europe -rrb- in berlin on saturday , several german politicians including the german foreign minister joschka fischer strongly criticised the us ' blocking stance towards the international criminal court .
fischer said that the us was defeating the very purpose of the court which was to ensure that individuals accused of committing grave crimes against humanity would not get away with impunity .
us criticism growing in europe fischer ’ s words echo a general wave of us criticism sweeping across the european union and especially within the european media .
earlier this year , the european union commissioner for external affairs , chris patten told the guardian newspaper that he hoped the united states would n't go into " unilateralist overdrive " .
though few doubt that us criticism in europe has been especially fuelled by the latest transatlantic dispute over the international criminal court , bush 's long-awaited middle east policy speech last month which tilted in israel 's favour also played a role in prompting the latest wave of us criticism in europe .
europeans exasperated by bush 's mid-east proposals bush ’ s proposal of replacing palestinian president yasser arafat by leaders " not compromised by terror " was officially met with caution and politeness by eu leaders , who stressed the positive elements of his support for a palestinian state .
but privately , several eu leaders in interviews with the news agency reuters , said they were dismayed at the absence of us attempts to restrain israeli forces occupying west bank cities or back an international peace conference , to which washington had previously agreed .
" america is so powerful and touchy now that no one wants to contradict bush publicly " , one eu diplomat said .
differences have also arisen over the eu ’ s funding of yasser arafat ’ s palestinian authority even as the us denounces it .
even britain , washington ’ s closest european ally , has been notably unsupportive of bush ’ s call to replace arafat , saying it was up to the palestinians to choose their leaders .
two different ways of looking at the world political analysts believe that the two latest rifts between the us and europe have underlined the fundamental differences in us and european perspectives of viewing the world , specifically after the september 11 terrorist attacks last year in new york .
in many american eyes , europeans appear cowardly in the " war against terrorism " , seek to restrain washington and are complacent about threats from so-called " rogue states " suspected of developing weapons of mass destruction .
for their part , several europeans believe that washington is only keen to eradicate the symptoms of terror rather than get to the root of it by branding potentially hostile nations an " axis of evil " and see " unilateralist " hawks in the us administration seeking to tear up the international rule-book .
following bush 's controversial state of the union speech in february this year , french foreign minister , hubert vedrine said in an interview with france inter , " we are currently threatened by a simplified approach which reduces all problems of the world to the mere struggle against terrorism .
the americans are acting on a unilateral basis , without consulting anyone else , and their decisions are guided exclusively by their own individual views and interests . "
further , european leaders are also wary about an american military attack on iraq to overthrow iraqi president saddam hussein , fearing that this would destabilise the region and deflect attention from the israel-palestinian conflict which is more pressing .
string of niggling disputes plague transatlantic relations away from the blatant differences related to the " war on terrorism " , an array of other disagreements have continued to hobble the transatlantic relationship .
specific clashes include a ban on anti-personnel land mines , a comprehensive test ban treaty , and more famously , the kyoto treaty on climate change – all of which are supported in europe and opposed by the us .
to make matters worse , trade disputes over us steel tariffs , export and farm subsidies and eu efforts to obstruct the import of genetically-modified foods make the gap between america and europe a yawning one .

a deep rift has emerged over a string of issues from trade to terrorism to the un war crimes court . when president george bush arrived in europe in may under clear blue skies to garner support for his war on terrorism , it seemed that not a single dark cloud would mar what appeared a strained yet cordial transatlantic relationship .
just two months later , the same transatlantic relationship has gone from " cordial " to " sour " as a fallout over a series of recent thorny issues have added to gathering storm clouds over us-european relations .
tensions over icc buffet fragile us-european ties the latest row over the jurisdiction of the new international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- has delivered a strong blow to an already shaky transatlantic relationship .
europeans are outraged at what they see as a us attempt to emasculate the newly established international court , by demanding judicial immunity for its own soldiers and peacekeepers .
the us has further raised european hackles with washington threatening to veto a un police mission in bosnia .
at a parliamentary conference of the osce -lrb- organisation for security and co-operation in europe -rrb- in berlin on saturday , several german politicians including the german foreign minister joschka fischer strongly criticised the us ' blocking stance towards the international criminal court .
fischer said that the us was defeating the very purpose of the court which was to ensure that individuals accused of committing grave crimes against humanity would not get away with impunity .
us criticism growing in europe fischer ’ s words echo a general wave of us criticism sweeping across the european union and especially within the european media .
earlier this year , the european union commissioner for external affairs , chris patten told the guardian newspaper that he hoped the united states would n't go into " unilateralist overdrive " .
though few doubt that us criticism in europe has been especially fuelled by the latest transatlantic dispute over the international criminal court , bush 's long-awaited middle east policy speech last month which tilted in israel 's favour also played a role in prompting the latest wave of us criticism in europe .
europeans exasperated by bush 's mid-east proposals bush ’ s proposal of replacing palestinian president yasser arafat by leaders " not compromised by terror " was officially met with caution and politeness by eu leaders , who stressed the positive elements of his support for a palestinian state .
but privately , several eu leaders in interviews with the news agency reuters , said they were dismayed at the absence of us attempts to restrain israeli forces occupying west bank cities or back an international peace conference , to which washington had previously agreed .
" america is so powerful and touchy now that no one wants to contradict bush publicly " , one eu diplomat said .
differences have also arisen over the eu ’ s funding of yasser arafat ’ s palestinian authority even as the us denounces it .
even britain , washington ’ s closest european ally , has been notably unsupportive of bush ’ s call to replace arafat , saying it was up to the palestinians to choose their leaders .
two different ways of looking at the world political analysts believe that the two latest rifts between the us and europe have underlined the fundamental differences in us and european perspectives of viewing the world , specifically after the september 11 terrorist attacks last year in new york .
in many american eyes , europeans appear cowardly in the " war against terrorism " , seek to restrain washington and are complacent about threats from so-called " rogue states " suspected of developing weapons of mass destruction .
for their part , several europeans believe that washington is only keen to eradicate the symptoms of terror rather than get to the root of it by branding potentially hostile nations an " axis of evil " and see " unilateralist " hawks in the us administration seeking to tear up the international rule-book .
following bush 's controversial state of the union speech in february this year , french foreign minister , hubert vedrine said in an interview with france inter , " we are currently threatened by a simplified approach which reduces all problems of the world to the mere struggle against terrorism .
the americans are acting on a unilateral basis , without consulting anyone else , and their decisions are guided exclusively by their own individual views and interests . "
further , european leaders are also wary about an american military attack on iraq to overthrow iraqi president saddam hussein , fearing that this would destabilise the region and deflect attention from the israel-palestinian conflict which is more pressing .
string of niggling disputes plague transatlantic relations away from the blatant differences related to the " war on terrorism " , an array of other disagreements have continued to hobble the transatlantic relationship .
specific clashes include a ban on anti-personnel land mines , a comprehensive test ban treaty , and more famously , the kyoto treaty on climate change – all of which are supported in europe and opposed by the us .
to make matters worse , trade disputes over us steel tariffs , export and farm subsidies and eu efforts to obstruct the import of genetically-modified foods make the gap between america and europe a yawning one .
" it is time to stop pretending that europeans and americans share a common view of the world , or even that they occupy the same world " , robert kagan of the carnegie endowment for international peace wrote in the journal " policy review " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un missions in jeopardy ?
of the 45,145 un peacekeepers stationed around the world , only 704 are american .
but the current dispute over the bosnia mission brings to question , what role the us ’ s withdrawal plays in the future of un peacekeeping .

us criticism growing in europe fischer ’ s words echo a general wave of us criticism sweeping across the european union and especially within the european media .
earlier this year , the european union commissioner for external affairs , chris patten told the guardian newspaper that he hoped the united states would n't go into " unilateralist overdrive " .
though few doubt that us criticism in europe has been especially fuelled by the latest transatlantic dispute over the international criminal court , bush 's long-awaited middle east policy speech last month which tilted in israel 's favour also played a role in prompting the latest wave of us criticism in europe .
europeans exasperated by bush 's mid-east proposals bush ’ s proposal of replacing palestinian president yasser arafat by leaders " not compromised by terror " was officially met with caution and politeness by eu leaders , who stressed the positive elements of his support for a palestinian state .
but privately , several eu leaders in interviews with the news agency reuters , said they were dismayed at the absence of us attempts to restrain israeli forces occupying west bank cities or back an international peace conference , to which washington had previously agreed .
" america is so powerful and touchy now that no one wants to contradict bush publicly " , one eu diplomat said .
differences have also arisen over the eu ’ s funding of yasser arafat ’ s palestinian authority even as the us denounces it .
even britain , washington ’ s closest european ally , has been notably unsupportive of bush ’ s call to replace arafat , saying it was up to the palestinians to choose their leaders .
two different ways of looking at the world political analysts believe that the two latest rifts between the us and europe have underlined the fundamental differences in us and european perspectives of viewing the world , specifically after the september 11 terrorist attacks last year in new york .
in many american eyes , europeans appear cowardly in the " war against terrorism " , seek to restrain washington and are complacent about threats from so-called " rogue states " suspected of developing weapons of mass destruction .
for their part , several europeans believe that washington is only keen to eradicate the symptoms of terror rather than get to the root of it by branding potentially hostile nations an " axis of evil " and see " unilateralist " hawks in the us administration seeking to tear up the international rule-book .
following bush 's controversial state of the union speech in february this year , french foreign minister , hubert vedrine said in an interview with france inter , " we are currently threatened by a simplified approach which reduces all problems of the world to the mere struggle against terrorism .
the americans are acting on a unilateral basis , without consulting anyone else , and their decisions are guided exclusively by their own individual views and interests . "
further , european leaders are also wary about an american military attack on iraq to overthrow iraqi president saddam hussein , fearing that this would destabilise the region and deflect attention from the israel-palestinian conflict which is more pressing .
string of niggling disputes plague transatlantic relations away from the blatant differences related to the " war on terrorism " , an array of other disagreements have continued to hobble the transatlantic relationship .
specific clashes include a ban on anti-personnel land mines , a comprehensive test ban treaty , and more famously , the kyoto treaty on climate change – all of which are supported in europe and opposed by the us .
to make matters worse , trade disputes over us steel tariffs , export and farm subsidies and eu efforts to obstruct the import of genetically-modified foods make the gap between america and europe a yawning one .
" it is time to stop pretending that europeans and americans share a common view of the world , or even that they occupy the same world " , robert kagan of the carnegie endowment for international peace wrote in the journal " policy review " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un missions in jeopardy ?
of the 45,145 un peacekeepers stationed around the world , only 704 are american .
but the current dispute over the bosnia mission brings to question , what role the us ’ s withdrawal plays in the future of un peacekeeping .

a top health official has warned that some african countries could lose a quarter of their workforce to aids in the next 20 years .
this could have serious implications on these nations ’ already fragile economies . the barcelona international aids conference began its first full day on monday with a packed schedule of scientific briefings and updates on aids .
bernhard schwartländer , director of the hiv / aids department of the world health organization , said more than 20 percent of adults in seven sub-saharan african countries had the virus that causes aids .
in botswana , lesotho , swaziland and zimbabwe the rate is one in three .
schwartländer warned that the loss of workers due to aids could hurt economic growth and undermine key sectors of society in the worst-hit countries .
" by 2020 , more than 25 percent of the workforce in some countries may be lost to aids , " he said .
already in kenya , aids accounts for up to three of every four deaths in the police force , schwartländer said .
swaziland would have to train 13,000 new teachers over the next 17 years to maintain services - 7,000 more than if there were no aids deaths .
asia is a further region particularly threatened by the deadly epidemic .
health experts told the international conference that asia is sweeping aids under the carpet , endangering the lives of millions in the world 's two most populous countries , china and india .
new hope activists and officials were united in calling for cheap , life-saving drugs to be made available to fight aids in poor countries .
the us biotechnology company vaxgen inc announced at the conference that it was working on a new vaccine against hiv / aids .
it could be available by 2005 if results from human safety and efficacy trials are as good as expected , said donald francis , president and co-founder of the company .
early results from phase iii trials of the vaccine will not be available until early next year .
but francis said vaxgen is optimistic it would work .
" i think we will get protection -lrb- from the virus -rrb- , but i do n't know what level we will get , " he told the delegates .
treatment in the wrong place a vaccine is considered the best hope of getting the rampant virus under control .
drug cocktails that can reduce the virus to undetectable levels , so-called " anti-retroviral " drugs , can extend the lives of people with aids .
but this is mainly the case in rich western countries .
such treatment is hardly available in poor nations .
many speakers at the barcelona conference condemned the poor response to united nations secretary general kofi annan 's global aids fund , intended to raise money to fight the epidemic .
less than $ 3 billion has so far been raised of the fund 's $ 10 billion goal .
" we need more resources to be put into the global fund to be able to get this money to where people are suffering , " uganda 's milly katana of the hiv / aids community movement said .

a deep rift has emerged over a string of issues from trade to terrorism to the un war crimes court . when president george bush arrived in europe in may under clear blue skies to garner support for his war on terrorism , it seemed that not a single dark cloud would mar what appeared a strained yet cordial transatlantic relationship .
just two months later , the same transatlantic relationship has gone from " cordial " to " sour " as a fallout over a series of recent thorny issues have added to gathering storm clouds over us-european relations .
tensions over icc buffet fragile us-european ties the latest row over the jurisdiction of the new international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- has delivered a strong blow to an already shaky transatlantic relationship .
europeans are outraged at what they see as a us attempt to emasculate the newly established international court , by demanding judicial immunity for its own soldiers and peacekeepers .
the us has further raised european hackles with washington threatening to veto a un police mission in bosnia .
at a parliamentary conference of the osce -lrb- organisation for security and co-operation in europe -rrb- in berlin on saturday , several german politicians including the german foreign minister joschka fischer strongly criticised the us ' blocking stance towards the international criminal court .
fischer said that the us was defeating the very purpose of the court which was to ensure that individuals accused of committing grave crimes against humanity would not get away with impunity .
us criticism growing in europe fischer ’ s words echo a general wave of us criticism sweeping across the european union and especially within the european media .
earlier this year , the european union commissioner for external affairs , chris patten told the guardian newspaper that he hoped the united states would n't go into " unilateralist overdrive " .
though few doubt that us criticism in europe has been especially fuelled by the latest transatlantic dispute over the international criminal court , bush 's long-awaited middle east policy speech last month which tilted in israel 's favour also played a role in prompting the latest wave of us criticism in europe .
europeans exasperated by bush 's mid-east proposals bush ’ s proposal of replacing palestinian president yasser arafat by leaders " not compromised by terror " was officially met with caution and politeness by eu leaders , who stressed the positive elements of his support for a palestinian state .
but privately , several eu leaders in interviews with the news agency reuters , said they were dismayed at the absence of us attempts to restrain israeli forces occupying west bank cities or back an international peace conference , to which washington had previously agreed .
" america is so powerful and touchy now that no one wants to contradict bush publicly " , one eu diplomat said .
differences have also arisen over the eu ’ s funding of yasser arafat ’ s palestinian authority even as the us denounces it .
even britain , washington ’ s closest european ally , has been notably unsupportive of bush ’ s call to replace arafat , saying it was up to the palestinians to choose their leaders .
two different ways of looking at the world political analysts believe that the two latest rifts between the us and europe have underlined the fundamental differences in us and european perspectives of viewing the world , specifically after the september 11 terrorist attacks last year in new york .
in many american eyes , europeans appear cowardly in the " war against terrorism " , seek to restrain washington and are complacent about threats from so-called " rogue states " suspected of developing weapons of mass destruction .
for their part , several europeans believe that washington is only keen to eradicate the symptoms of terror rather than get to the root of it by branding potentially hostile nations an " axis of evil " and see " unilateralist " hawks in the us administration seeking to tear up the international rule-book .
following bush 's controversial state of the union speech in february this year , french foreign minister , hubert vedrine said in an interview with france inter , " we are currently threatened by a simplified approach which reduces all problems of the world to the mere struggle against terrorism .
the americans are acting on a unilateral basis , without consulting anyone else , and their decisions are guided exclusively by their own individual views and interests . "
further , european leaders are also wary about an american military attack on iraq to overthrow iraqi president saddam hussein , fearing that this would destabilise the region and deflect attention from the israel-palestinian conflict which is more pressing .
string of niggling disputes plague transatlantic relations away from the blatant differences related to the " war on terrorism " , an array of other disagreements have continued to hobble the transatlantic relationship .
specific clashes include a ban on anti-personnel land mines , a comprehensive test ban treaty , and more famously , the kyoto treaty on climate change – all of which are supported in europe and opposed by the us .
to make matters worse , trade disputes over us steel tariffs , export and farm subsidies and eu efforts to obstruct the import of genetically-modified foods make the gap between america and europe a yawning one .
" it is time to stop pretending that europeans and americans share a common view of the world , or even that they occupy the same world " , robert kagan of the carnegie endowment for international peace wrote in the journal " policy review " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un missions in jeopardy ?
of the 45,145 un peacekeepers stationed around the world , only 704 are american .
but the current dispute over the bosnia mission brings to question , what role the us ’ s withdrawal plays in the future of un peacekeeping .

just two months later , the same transatlantic relationship has gone from " cordial " to " sour " as a fallout over a series of recent thorny issues have added to gathering storm clouds over us-european relations .
tensions over icc buffet fragile us-european ties the latest row over the jurisdiction of the new international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- has delivered a strong blow to an already shaky transatlantic relationship .
europeans are outraged at what they see as a us attempt to emasculate the newly established international court , by demanding judicial immunity for its own soldiers and peacekeepers .
the us has further raised european hackles with washington threatening to veto a un police mission in bosnia .
at a parliamentary conference of the osce -lrb- organisation for security and co-operation in europe -rrb- in berlin on saturday , several german politicians including the german foreign minister joschka fischer strongly criticised the us ' blocking stance towards the international criminal court .
fischer said that the us was defeating the very purpose of the court which was to ensure that individuals accused of committing grave crimes against humanity would not get away with impunity .
us criticism growing in europe fischer ’ s words echo a general wave of us criticism sweeping across the european union and especially within the european media .
earlier this year , the european union commissioner for external affairs , chris patten told the guardian newspaper that he hoped the united states would n't go into " unilateralist overdrive " .
though few doubt that us criticism in europe has been especially fuelled by the latest transatlantic dispute over the international criminal court , bush 's long-awaited middle east policy speech last month which tilted in israel 's favour also played a role in prompting the latest wave of us criticism in europe .
europeans exasperated by bush 's mid-east proposals bush ’ s proposal of replacing palestinian president yasser arafat by leaders " not compromised by terror " was officially met with caution and politeness by eu leaders , who stressed the positive elements of his support for a palestinian state .
but privately , several eu leaders in interviews with the news agency reuters , said they were dismayed at the absence of us attempts to restrain israeli forces occupying west bank cities or back an international peace conference , to which washington had previously agreed .
" america is so powerful and touchy now that no one wants to contradict bush publicly " , one eu diplomat said .
differences have also arisen over the eu ’ s funding of yasser arafat ’ s palestinian authority even as the us denounces it .
even britain , washington ’ s closest european ally , has been notably unsupportive of bush ’ s call to replace arafat , saying it was up to the palestinians to choose their leaders .
two different ways of looking at the world political analysts believe that the two latest rifts between the us and europe have underlined the fundamental differences in us and european perspectives of viewing the world , specifically after the september 11 terrorist attacks last year in new york .
in many american eyes , europeans appear cowardly in the " war against terrorism " , seek to restrain washington and are complacent about threats from so-called " rogue states " suspected of developing weapons of mass destruction .
for their part , several europeans believe that washington is only keen to eradicate the symptoms of terror rather than get to the root of it by branding potentially hostile nations an " axis of evil " and see " unilateralist " hawks in the us administration seeking to tear up the international rule-book .
following bush 's controversial state of the union speech in february this year , french foreign minister , hubert vedrine said in an interview with france inter , " we are currently threatened by a simplified approach which reduces all problems of the world to the mere struggle against terrorism .
the americans are acting on a unilateral basis , without consulting anyone else , and their decisions are guided exclusively by their own individual views and interests . "
further , european leaders are also wary about an american military attack on iraq to overthrow iraqi president saddam hussein , fearing that this would destabilise the region and deflect attention from the israel-palestinian conflict which is more pressing .
string of niggling disputes plague transatlantic relations away from the blatant differences related to the " war on terrorism " , an array of other disagreements have continued to hobble the transatlantic relationship .

a top health official has warned that some african countries could lose a quarter of their workforce to aids in the next 20 years .
this could have serious implications on these nations ’ already fragile economies . the barcelona international aids conference began its first full day on monday with a packed schedule of scientific briefings and updates on aids .
bernhard schwartländer , director of the hiv / aids department of the world health organization , said more than 20 percent of adults in seven sub-saharan african countries had the virus that causes aids .
in botswana , lesotho , swaziland and zimbabwe the rate is one in three .
schwartländer warned that the loss of workers due to aids could hurt economic growth and undermine key sectors of society in the worst-hit countries .
" by 2020 , more than 25 percent of the workforce in some countries may be lost to aids , " he said .
already in kenya , aids accounts for up to three of every four deaths in the police force , schwartländer said .
swaziland would have to train 13,000 new teachers over the next 17 years to maintain services - 7,000 more than if there were no aids deaths .
asia is a further region particularly threatened by the deadly epidemic .
health experts told the international conference that asia is sweeping aids under the carpet , endangering the lives of millions in the world 's two most populous countries , china and india .
new hope activists and officials were united in calling for cheap , life-saving drugs to be made available to fight aids in poor countries .
the us biotechnology company vaxgen inc announced at the conference that it was working on a new vaccine against hiv / aids .
it could be available by 2005 if results from human safety and efficacy trials are as good as expected , said donald francis , president and co-founder of the company .
early results from phase iii trials of the vaccine will not be available until early next year .
but francis said vaxgen is optimistic it would work .
" i think we will get protection -lrb- from the virus -rrb- , but i do n't know what level we will get , " he told the delegates .
treatment in the wrong place a vaccine is considered the best hope of getting the rampant virus under control .
drug cocktails that can reduce the virus to undetectable levels , so-called " anti-retroviral " drugs , can extend the lives of people with aids .
but this is mainly the case in rich western countries .
such treatment is hardly available in poor nations .
many speakers at the barcelona conference condemned the poor response to united nations secretary general kofi annan 's global aids fund , intended to raise money to fight the epidemic .
less than $ 3 billion has so far been raised of the fund 's $ 10 billion goal .
" we need more resources to be put into the global fund to be able to get this money to where people are suffering , " uganda 's milly katana of the hiv / aids community movement said .

a deep rift has emerged over a string of issues from trade to terrorism to the un war crimes court . when president george bush arrived in europe in may under clear blue skies to garner support for his war on terrorism , it seemed that not a single dark cloud would mar what appeared a strained yet cordial transatlantic relationship .
just two months later , the same transatlantic relationship has gone from " cordial " to " sour " as a fallout over a series of recent thorny issues have added to gathering storm clouds over us-european relations .
tensions over icc buffet fragile us-european ties the latest row over the jurisdiction of the new international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- has delivered a strong blow to an already shaky transatlantic relationship .
europeans are outraged at what they see as a us attempt to emasculate the newly established international court , by demanding judicial immunity for its own soldiers and peacekeepers .
the us has further raised european hackles with washington threatening to veto a un police mission in bosnia .
at a parliamentary conference of the osce -lrb- organisation for security and co-operation in europe -rrb- in berlin on saturday , several german politicians including the german foreign minister joschka fischer strongly criticised the us ' blocking stance towards the international criminal court .
fischer said that the us was defeating the very purpose of the court which was to ensure that individuals accused of committing grave crimes against humanity would not get away with impunity .
us criticism growing in europe fischer ’ s words echo a general wave of us criticism sweeping across the european union and especially within the european media .
earlier this year , the european union commissioner for external affairs , chris patten told the guardian newspaper that he hoped the united states would n't go into " unilateralist overdrive " .
though few doubt that us criticism in europe has been especially fuelled by the latest transatlantic dispute over the international criminal court , bush 's long-awaited middle east policy speech last month which tilted in israel 's favour also played a role in prompting the latest wave of us criticism in europe .
europeans exasperated by bush 's mid-east proposals bush ’ s proposal of replacing palestinian president yasser arafat by leaders " not compromised by terror " was officially met with caution and politeness by eu leaders , who stressed the positive elements of his support for a palestinian state .
but privately , several eu leaders in interviews with the news agency reuters , said they were dismayed at the absence of us attempts to restrain israeli forces occupying west bank cities or back an international peace conference , to which washington had previously agreed .
" america is so powerful and touchy now that no one wants to contradict bush publicly " , one eu diplomat said .
differences have also arisen over the eu ’ s funding of yasser arafat ’ s palestinian authority even as the us denounces it .
even britain , washington ’ s closest european ally , has been notably unsupportive of bush ’ s call to replace arafat , saying it was up to the palestinians to choose their leaders .
two different ways of looking at the world political analysts believe that the two latest rifts between the us and europe have underlined the fundamental differences in us and european perspectives of viewing the world , specifically after the september 11 terrorist attacks last year in new york .
in many american eyes , europeans appear cowardly in the " war against terrorism " , seek to restrain washington and are complacent about threats from so-called " rogue states " suspected of developing weapons of mass destruction .
for their part , several europeans believe that washington is only keen to eradicate the symptoms of terror rather than get to the root of it by branding potentially hostile nations an " axis of evil " and see " unilateralist " hawks in the us administration seeking to tear up the international rule-book .
following bush 's controversial state of the union speech in february this year , french foreign minister , hubert vedrine said in an interview with france inter , " we are currently threatened by a simplified approach which reduces all problems of the world to the mere struggle against terrorism .
the americans are acting on a unilateral basis , without consulting anyone else , and their decisions are guided exclusively by their own individual views and interests . "
further , european leaders are also wary about an american military attack on iraq to overthrow iraqi president saddam hussein , fearing that this would destabilise the region and deflect attention from the israel-palestinian conflict which is more pressing .
string of niggling disputes plague transatlantic relations away from the blatant differences related to the " war on terrorism " , an array of other disagreements have continued to hobble the transatlantic relationship .
specific clashes include a ban on anti-personnel land mines , a comprehensive test ban treaty , and more famously , the kyoto treaty on climate change – all of which are supported in europe and opposed by the us .
to make matters worse , trade disputes over us steel tariffs , export and farm subsidies and eu efforts to obstruct the import of genetically-modified foods make the gap between america and europe a yawning one .
" it is time to stop pretending that europeans and americans share a common view of the world , or even that they occupy the same world " , robert kagan of the carnegie endowment for international peace wrote in the journal " policy review " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un missions in jeopardy ?
of the 45,145 un peacekeepers stationed around the world , only 704 are american .
but the current dispute over the bosnia mission brings to question , what role the us ’ s withdrawal plays in the future of un peacekeeping .

us criticism growing in europe fischer ’ s words echo a general wave of us criticism sweeping across the european union and especially within the european media .
earlier this year , the european union commissioner for external affairs , chris patten told the guardian newspaper that he hoped the united states would n't go into " unilateralist overdrive " .
though few doubt that us criticism in europe has been especially fuelled by the latest transatlantic dispute over the international criminal court , bush 's long-awaited middle east policy speech last month which tilted in israel 's favour also played a role in prompting the latest wave of us criticism in europe .
europeans exasperated by bush 's mid-east proposals bush ’ s proposal of replacing palestinian president yasser arafat by leaders " not compromised by terror " was officially met with caution and politeness by eu leaders , who stressed the positive elements of his support for a palestinian state .
but privately , several eu leaders in interviews with the news agency reuters , said they were dismayed at the absence of us attempts to restrain israeli forces occupying west bank cities or back an international peace conference , to which washington had previously agreed .
" america is so powerful and touchy now that no one wants to contradict bush publicly " , one eu diplomat said .
differences have also arisen over the eu ’ s funding of yasser arafat ’ s palestinian authority even as the us denounces it .
even britain , washington ’ s closest european ally , has been notably unsupportive of bush ’ s call to replace arafat , saying it was up to the palestinians to choose their leaders .
two different ways of looking at the world political analysts believe that the two latest rifts between the us and europe have underlined the fundamental differences in us and european perspectives of viewing the world , specifically after the september 11 terrorist attacks last year in new york .
in many american eyes , europeans appear cowardly in the " war against terrorism " , seek to restrain washington and are complacent about threats from so-called " rogue states " suspected of developing weapons of mass destruction .
for their part , several europeans believe that washington is only keen to eradicate the symptoms of terror rather than get to the root of it by branding potentially hostile nations an " axis of evil " and see " unilateralist " hawks in the us administration seeking to tear up the international rule-book .
following bush 's controversial state of the union speech in february this year , french foreign minister , hubert vedrine said in an interview with france inter , " we are currently threatened by a simplified approach which reduces all problems of the world to the mere struggle against terrorism .
the americans are acting on a unilateral basis , without consulting anyone else , and their decisions are guided exclusively by their own individual views and interests . "
further , european leaders are also wary about an american military attack on iraq to overthrow iraqi president saddam hussein , fearing that this would destabilise the region and deflect attention from the israel-palestinian conflict which is more pressing .
string of niggling disputes plague transatlantic relations away from the blatant differences related to the " war on terrorism " , an array of other disagreements have continued to hobble the transatlantic relationship .
specific clashes include a ban on anti-personnel land mines , a comprehensive test ban treaty , and more famously , the kyoto treaty on climate change – all of which are supported in europe and opposed by the us .
to make matters worse , trade disputes over us steel tariffs , export and farm subsidies and eu efforts to obstruct the import of genetically-modified foods make the gap between america and europe a yawning one .
" it is time to stop pretending that europeans and americans share a common view of the world , or even that they occupy the same world " , robert kagan of the carnegie endowment for international peace wrote in the journal " policy review " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un missions in jeopardy ?
of the 45,145 un peacekeepers stationed around the world , only 704 are american .
but the current dispute over the bosnia mission brings to question , what role the us ’ s withdrawal plays in the future of un peacekeeping .

a top health official has warned that some african countries could lose a quarter of their workforce to aids in the next 20 years .
this could have serious implications on these nations ’ already fragile economies . the barcelona international aids conference began its first full day on monday with a packed schedule of scientific briefings and updates on aids .
bernhard schwartländer , director of the hiv / aids department of the world health organization , said more than 20 percent of adults in seven sub-saharan african countries had the virus that causes aids .
in botswana , lesotho , swaziland and zimbabwe the rate is one in three .
schwartländer warned that the loss of workers due to aids could hurt economic growth and undermine key sectors of society in the worst-hit countries .
" by 2020 , more than 25 percent of the workforce in some countries may be lost to aids , " he said .
already in kenya , aids accounts for up to three of every four deaths in the police force , schwartländer said .
swaziland would have to train 13,000 new teachers over the next 17 years to maintain services - 7,000 more than if there were no aids deaths .
asia is a further region particularly threatened by the deadly epidemic .
health experts told the international conference that asia is sweeping aids under the carpet , endangering the lives of millions in the world 's two most populous countries , china and india .
new hope activists and officials were united in calling for cheap , life-saving drugs to be made available to fight aids in poor countries .
the us biotechnology company vaxgen inc announced at the conference that it was working on a new vaccine against hiv / aids .
it could be available by 2005 if results from human safety and efficacy trials are as good as expected , said donald francis , president and co-founder of the company .
early results from phase iii trials of the vaccine will not be available until early next year .
but francis said vaxgen is optimistic it would work .
" i think we will get protection -lrb- from the virus -rrb- , but i do n't know what level we will get , " he told the delegates .
treatment in the wrong place a vaccine is considered the best hope of getting the rampant virus under control .
drug cocktails that can reduce the virus to undetectable levels , so-called " anti-retroviral " drugs , can extend the lives of people with aids .
but this is mainly the case in rich western countries .
such treatment is hardly available in poor nations .
many speakers at the barcelona conference condemned the poor response to united nations secretary general kofi annan 's global aids fund , intended to raise money to fight the epidemic .
less than $ 3 billion has so far been raised of the fund 's $ 10 billion goal .
" we need more resources to be put into the global fund to be able to get this money to where people are suffering , " uganda 's milly katana of the hiv / aids community movement said .

reports from the capital abidjan said turnout appeared to be low with would-be voters unable to cast their ballot , because they did n't have the right identity cards .
one opposition party blamed the government for the low turnout , saying the ivorian president , laurent gbagbo , had refused to allow the same id cards as in previous elections .
a prominent member of the opposition , alassane ouattara , said his rdr party would n't accept the results as legitimate .
there were angry scenes at polling-stations as officials refused to accept old-style forms of id despite the government 's own failure to distribute new cards to the whole population . "
the work of an amateur which merits a red card " state tv 's assessment of the polls pre-election violence in the central town of daloa claimed the lives of four people and there had been fears of ethnic and religious bloodshed on the same scale as after the 1999 coup .
the government admits that many voters were left without id cards , although before the elections it estimated that 4.5 million voters , out of an electorate of 5.1 million , would receive them .

the charges involve more than r1m -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- allegedly obtained by fraud through her work for the ruling african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- .
she and a colleague are accused of obtaining bank loans for fictitious members of the anc 's women 's league , which she heads .
it is the latest in a long line of personal scandals to hit ms madikizela-mandela , who insists she is innocent and continues to enjoy widespread support in the country .
prosecutors suspect the 65-year-old and broker addy moolman of a scam involving the use of ms madikizela-mandela 's signature to obtain the bank loans fraudulently .
both defendants are expected to appear in the court in pretoria .
ms madikizela-mandela , who separated from the former south african president in 1992 , says she is being persecuted .
' mother ' to ' mugger ' the bbc 's alistair leithead says she is still one of the most famous women in south africa , widely regarded as a champion of the poor .
but the reputation of the sitting mp has been damaged by a succession of episodes , which led to the " mother of the nation " being nicknamed " mugger of the nation " .
the most dramatic event involved the murder of a young boy : in 1991 she was convicted of kidnapping 14-year-old township activist stompie seipei in soweto after his body was found with his throat cut near her home - her six-year prison sentence was reduced to a fine on appeal .
in 1996 nelson mandela finally divorced her for adultery .
in february of this year , she was evicted from the soweto house she used to share with mr mandela before he went to prison under the apartheid regime .
the house is due to become a museum .
this june she snubbed a parliamentary committee which had summoned her to explain how she lived a lavish lifestyle on her mp 's salary .

the average return dropped to 8.03 % in the year to march compared with 9.73 % over the previous 12 months , according to survey of scottish companies by experian .
the information technology -lrb- it -rrb- sector has already seen hundreds of jobs shed by firms like motorola and nec , prompting experian to warn that scotland faces a " second generation of economic collapse " .
last week computer giant hewlett-packard announced it was making 630 staff redundant in erskine , renfrewshire , following its merger with compaq .
high tech industries have fared badly recently the new figures follow a recent report by the fraser of allander institute which predicted a slowdown in economic growth as a result of the manufacturing slump in scotland .
however , experian 's corporate health check found scotland was faring better than the uk overall , where the average return on capital fell from 10.84 % to 8.37 % .
the biggest losses were in the it and telecoms sector , both of which experienced a fall-off of more than 30 % .
engineering 's profitability dropped to 4.81 % , a 60 % slump over three years .
report author peter brooker said : " scotland has been hit by a second generation of industrial collapse ; much of the new employment attracted to the region following the demise of its traditional industrial base was in the new sectors of it and telecoms .
" the depth of the decline in profitability , combined with uncertainty over the future , has led to a dramatic fall in investment nationally . "
he added : " the continuing paradox is that , while business is suffering , consumers remain confident , which has enabled the uk economy to keep growing in 2001 and in 2002 . "

other areas with an increase in closures were scotland , london and south west england .
only three regions - the east midlands , north east and eastern - registered a decrease in the number of business failures .
within the six-month period covered by the study though , the rate of closures across the uk was dropping - more of the firms went bust in the first quarter of the year than the second quarter .

sixty-one percent of global operators said a lack of skills , including " internationalised thinking " , was their major barrier to such growth .

however , the head of the small firms unit at cardiff business school has played down the significance of the survey .
brian morgan said the figure of 847 bankruptcies and liquidations represented a failure rate of only 0.5 % - and he did not see any other evidence that firms had failed in unusual numbers .
welsh businesses looking to trade overseas stand to benefit from an £ 8.6m initiative , launched on monday .
almost £ 4m of objective one money is going towards the welsh assembly scheme , aimed at encouraging the development of international trade .
the balance will come from the assembly pathway to prosperity fund and the private sector .
the initiative is aimed at small and medium sized businesses looking to export for the first time or who are keen to develop new international market opportunities .

the loch lomond and the trossachs national park will be overseen by a 25-member board , which began its work on monday .
critics have warned the park could become a honey pot , swamping the area with visitors and new development .
but its supporters believe it offers a chance to improve the area and facilities for locals and tourists , while protecting the landscape .
the appointment of the board members - who are drawn from local councils , interested bodies and those who have relevant expertise - was confirmed by environment and rural development minister ross finnie .
he said the creation of the park was hoped to : conserve and enhance the natural and cultural heritage of the area promote sustainable use of the natural resources promote understanding and enjoyment of the area 's special qualities promote sustainable economic and social development of the area 's communities .
loch lomond attracts five million visitors every year .
it is hoped that national park status will allow all the area 's conflicting interests to be managed effectively , so that people do not destroy the landscape and wildlife they have come to see .
the park authority can now meet and elect a convenor , ready to take over full planning powers from local authorities in the area later in july .
the creation of the national park has been debated for about 50 years .
mr finnie said : " the establishment of the board of scotland 's first national park is without doubt an important and historic event .
" i am impressed by the quality and breadth of experience of those persons who have agreed to serve as members of the authority in what will be an exciting and challenging time .
" i am in no doubt about the high level of commitment that they , and those members returned under the recent election process , will bring to the task of ensuring that the loch lomond and the trossachs national park gets off to the best start . "

the capital , manila , has been particularly badly affected with as much rain falling in the last few days as usually comes down in a month .
the monsoon has been worsened by tropical depressions elsewhere in the western pacific .
much of manila is flooded nearly every year because developers have built over many storm drains , while squatters in shanty towns throw huge amounts of rubbish into them .
some people were returning to their homes on monday , although weather officials forecast more rain in coming days .
boat capsized among those killed were three south korean tourists whose motorized outrigger capsized in stormy seas in batangas province , while they were travelling to an island resort in the central philippines .
the philippines rainy season begins in july the victims , all female , included a four-year-old girl .
three other people , including two south koreans from the same party , are missing .
landslides , drownings and a road accident caused the 11 other recorded deaths .
the koreans were from a christian missionary organisation .
a coast guard official said that the boat was travelling without permission , after small boats had been banned due to heavy seas .
the crew of the boat disappeared after the accident and are being sought ashore .
they may face criminal charges .
a family of four was buried by a landslide in batangas , after rains loosened the terrain .
in the northern city of olongapo , a group of boys was injured when a rubbish heap on which they were scavenging collapsed .
the waters in some parts of manila were chest-deep , with many streets not passable for small vehicles .
other roads were closed completely .
our correspondent in manila , john mclean , says human negligence is as much to blame as the weather .
this year , president gloria arroyo has responded by transferring responsibility for flood prevention in manila from the central government to the local government .
even so , an effective flood control programme is expected to take at least four years to complete .

xiao yang , president of the supreme people 's court , said " incompetent " judges were making the system unfair .
courts have often been taken as branches of the government xiao tang , president of the supreme people 's court most of china 's more than 200,000 judges have no legal training and have traditionally being appointed for political reasons .
but under a five-year reform plan , judges would have to pass professional exams or lose their jobs , mr xiao was quoted as saying .
" judges must have the qualifications civil servants have , but they must also have professional qualifications , " mr xiao told a weekend legal conference .
" some judges without proper educational background and professional knowledge and experience have been selected . "
new judges more than two thirds of judges do not even have a college degree , only a vocational training degree and not necessarily in law , according to earlier reports by chinese media .
starting this year , new judges would have to pass two exams and undergo professional training , mr xiao said .
in another major change , clerks would no longer be eligible to be promoted to the bench after a number of years in office .
the reforms should mean that judges would no longer blindly follow orders from superiors , mr xiao said .
" courts have often been taken as branches of the government , and judges viewed as civil servants who have to follow orders from superiors , which prevents them from exercising mandated legal duties like other members of the judiciary , " he said .
china has made several promises to overhaul its legal system but now that china is a member of the world trade organisation , it is under greater scrutiny from foreign investors .
the bbc 's shanghai correspondent , francis markus , says mr xiao 's comments suggest that implementing this raft of reforms throughout china is still a tough challenge .
such issues as how to fund the court system , allowing it to operate without interference from local officials , remain unresolved .
even if the chief justice is successful , some western legal experts in china say his changes still fall short of deeper institutional reforms .

scientists at imperial college , london , are working on eye-tracking technology that analyses the way we look at things .
the team is trying to gain an insight into visual knowledge - the way we see objects and translate that information into actions .
" eye-trackers will one day be so reliable and so simple that they will become yet another input device on your computer , like a much more sophisticated mouse , " said professor guang-zhong yang of the department of computing at imperial college .

yang : act of looking is very sophisticated for the research , people have been shown an image and given a limited amount of time to find a specific target , such as a waving hand in a crowd .

professor yang believes eye-tracking technology could also help the way we interact with machines , such as computers .
other potential applications include installing an eye-tracker in a car dashboard to warn a driver who is falling asleep , or enable a fighter pilot to aim missiles by simply looking at a target .
professor yang was presenting his work at the royal society summer science exhibition in london , which showcases researchers at the cutting edge of science in the uk .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- q & a : ivf ' mix-up ' bbc news bbc sport > > graphics version > > change to uk edition > > news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point health contents : medical notes monday , 8 july , 2002 , 08:55 gmt 09:55 uk q & a : ivf ' mix-up ' a blunder at a nhs fertility clinic has reportedly led to a white couple having black twins as a result of ivf treatment .
although the full facts of the case have yet to emerge , it is suggested that either an embryo created from eggs and sperm from a black couple - or sperm from a black man - was used by error in the treatment of the white couple .
q : what happens to eggs and sperm at a fertility clinic ?
a : fertility treatments involve fertilising eggs with sperm outside the body .
in simple ivf , a number of eggs are " harvested " from the mother 's ovaries , and a sample of sperm obtained " fresh " from the father , or thawed from a frozen sample stored earlier .
this is immediately combined with the eggs in a laboratory dish and hopefully embryos will develop , which can then be placed back into the mother .
in a busy clinic , the laboratory staff will be responsible for combining the right sperm with the right eggs for several couples every day .
once they have done this , they have to make sure that the right resulting embryos are put back into the woman .
sometimes , embryos can be stored for later use - so staff have to make sure they thaw the right ones when the time comes .
no genetic tests are carried out to check - and obviously all embryos look the same - so staff are reliant on correct labelling of eggs , sperm and embryos .
q : is this the first case of its kind in this country ?
a : fertility expert mohamed taranissi , medical director of the assisted reproduction and gynaecological centre , a private london clinic , said this was a rare case .
he said : " this is the first case i have come across in this country .
it has been reported elsewhere but i am not aware of any such incidences in this country prior to this one , if it is genuine . "
q : how could this have happened ?
professor taranissi said : " human error is always a possibility , albeit very rare .
" some couples use either donor sperm or donor eggs .
" when you do these things you have to make sure you try and match the physical characteristics .
" or , it could be a rare disorder with pigmentation of the skin .
this is more common where you have a black couple with a white baby .
it could be an indication of a disease .
you would not discover this while the woman was pregnant .
q : how tight are the controls to stop such mistakes happening ?
professor taranissi said : " i would say this is extremely unlikely to happen .
there are always double checks on every step of the way .
" with insemination , checking for eggs and putting the embryos back is always checked by two people to make sure these kind of incidences do not happen . "
labs in fertility clinics use colour-coding , date of birth , and name checks .
unless all of these tally up on patient and embryo , the treatment does not proceed .
in some labs , two embryologists have to be on hand at the same time to double-check each other 's work .
professor robert winston , from hammersmith hospital in london , said : " that is about as failsafe as you can get . "
but he said that ultimately , errors could happen in any system involving humans .
the human fertilisation and embryology authority -lrb- hfea -rrb- sends inspectors to check that clinics are taking sufficient precautions .
they check that clinics have procedures in place to double-check the identification of people undergoing treatment , the sperm and eggs at the time of insemination and the embryos and the patient at the time of embryo transfer .
the hfea , in a statement issued today , said this " should minimise the risk of the wrong sperm , eggs or embryos being used " .
q : how many ivf treatments are carried out in this country ?
a : there are just under 40,000 cycles of ivf done in this country every year .
q : what is the legal position regarding who will keep the babies ?
these are uncharted legal waters in the uk - it is possible that there could be a legal struggle over the future of these twins - but nothing is yet certain .
the law at the moment states that the woman who carries the child is the biological mother - but this may be tested in court .
q : what reassurances can be given couples embarking on ivf treatment ?
professor taranissi said : " i would say this is very rare and , without knowing the details of this case , it is going to be anybody 's guess why this happened .
it is very rare .
" ivf came in 10-11 years ago and there are 40,000 cycles each year and this is the first time we have heard about this . "
