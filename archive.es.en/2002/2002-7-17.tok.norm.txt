german environment minister trittin is hopeful despite growing differences between the eu , the us and the developing world . a decade after the landmark earth summit in rio de janeiro first put environmental issues on the global political agenda , the next un world summit on sustainable development -lrb- wssd -rrb- , kicking off in johannesburg on august 26 , is expected to take things a step further .
the agenda will be stretched as a flurry of topics clamour for attention , ranging from poverty , the environment and energy politics to water economics , globalisation and sustainable development .
hopes dim for earth summit despite the high hopes pinned on the summit , there ’ s no denying that the initial enthusiasm about tackling global environmental problems has waned as sharp differences between the united states , the european union and the developing world have emerged .
so much so that there are now fears that the johannesburg summit might merely echo broad principles adopted by different countries rather than bring about real change .
german environment minister jürgen trittin , who is at a meeting in new york today to prepare the ground for the johannesburg summit , said at a press conference that the summit can not be allowed to be dominated by expressions of overall goals .
he said binding environmental and political aims as well as clear targets and timetables need to be agreed upon .
one of the key proposals by the german government and the eu is to increase the use of renewable energies to generate electricity by 15 percent by the year 2010 .
another is to halve the number of people who have live with poor sanitation and have no access to clean drinking water .
the proposals are mainly directed at rich industrial nations , which trittin said are believed to be mainly responsible for global climate change .
opening markets one potential sticking point is a call from developing countries for a greater commitment by richer nations to open their markets to trade and the transfer of technology .
but last month at a meeting on the island of bali , a us administration official made it clear that the united states was not prepared to go beyond commitments it had already made .
trittin admitted that in this respect it wasn ’ t just the united states holding firm .
some europeans are also reluctant to open their markets .
" the main problem is the huge subsidies that some industrial countries give some of their economic sectors .
oecd countries spend $ 335 million -lrb- 331.9 million euro -rrb- a year for agricultural subsidies alone , preventing several products from developing countries getting access to the market " , he said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
in europe , trittin said , france , ireland and spain were especially reluctant to give up their agricultural subsidy systems .
will the us get on board ?
there is one big question on many minds : can the us and eu start reading off the same page when it comes to the earth 's environmental future ?
so far the us has shied away from any kind of binding commitment regarding environmental protection and has incurred the wrath of several developing and european countries who blame it for putting the brakes on environmentally friendly policies on water and sanitation , energy , agricultural productivity , bio-diversity and health .
trittin told the süddeutsche zeitung , " the us as usual has problems with such multilateral commitments " .
in a sign that the us may maintain its rigid stance , us commerce undersecretary grant aldonas told reuters on tuesday that next month ’ s summit may not produce a concrete plan for sustainable development , but still could be a successful breeding ground for new ideas .
trittin sanguine despite differences despite the yawning gap between us and european viewpoints , trittin says he sees hope that a compromise might be reached with the americans .
" once the europeans reach an agreement with the developing countries about access to markets , it will be easier to spur the americans to commit themselves to concrete aims , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung .

axel blumenthal -lrb- left -rrb- , head of germany 's largest lesbian and gay association with green party member of parliament volker beck .
germany ’ s constitutional court handed gays and lesbians a victory on wednesday when it rejected conservative arguments and ruled that a law allowing same-sex unions is not in violation of the country ’ s constitution . by a five-to-three vote on wednesday , germany ’ s highest court rejected complaints by three conservative-led federal states that the country ’ s same-sex union law collides with family values enshrined in the constitutition .
in doing so , the judges have given their imprimatur to the law passed in august 2001 that allows gays and lesbians to enter into " registered life partnerships " and enjoy many of the benefits of traditional marriage .
" a victory all the way " was how volker beck , green party politician and driving force behind the partnership law , described the court ’ s ruling , which rejected out of hand the complaints brought forward by bavaria , saxony and thuringia .
the three states had argued that same-sex partnerships would prove deleterious to marriages between a man and a woman , which enjoy special protections in the country ’ s constitution .
the result , they argued , would be fewer children being born .
" we are already having problems due to the fact that we don ’ t have enough children , " said günter beckstein , interior minister of bavaria , said in an interview on german radio before the decision was handed down .
" add to that the fact that we no longer have a clear understanding of traditional marriage and family .
we think that is wrong . "

in doing so , the judges have given their imprimatur to the law passed in august 2001 that allows gays and lesbians to enter into " registered life partnerships " and enjoy many of the benefits of traditional marriage .
" a victory all the way " was how volker beck , green party politician and driving force behind the partnership law , described the court ’ s ruling , which rejected out of hand the complaints brought forward by bavaria , saxony and thuringia .
the three states had argued that same-sex partnerships would prove deleterious to marriages between a man and a woman , which enjoy special protections in the country ’ s constitution .
the result , they argued , would be fewer children being born .
" we are already having problems due to the fact that we don ’ t have enough children , " said günter beckstein , interior minister of bavaria , said in an interview on german radio before the decision was handed down .

axel blumenthal -lrb- left -rrb- , head of germany 's largest lesbian and gay association with green party member of parliament volker beck .
germany ’ s constitutional court handed gays and lesbians a victory on wednesday when it rejected conservative arguments and ruled that a law allowing same-sex unions is not in violation of the country ’ s constitution . by a five-to-three vote on wednesday , germany ’ s highest court rejected complaints by three conservative-led federal states that the country ’ s same-sex union law collides with family values enshrined in the constitutition .
in doing so , the judges have given their imprimatur to the law passed in august 2001 that allows gays and lesbians to enter into " registered life partnerships " and enjoy many of the benefits of traditional marriage .
" a victory all the way " was how volker beck , green party politician and driving force behind the partnership law , described the court ’ s ruling , which rejected out of hand the complaints brought forward by bavaria , saxony and thuringia .
the three states had argued that same-sex partnerships would prove deleterious to marriages between a man and a woman , which enjoy special protections in the country ’ s constitution .
the result , they argued , would be fewer children being born .
" we are already having problems due to the fact that we don ’ t have enough children , " said günter beckstein , interior minister of bavaria , said in an interview on german radio before the decision was handed down .
" add to that the fact that we no longer have a clear understanding of traditional marriage and family .
we think that is wrong . "
but the red-robed judges in karlsruhe , where germany ’ s highest court is based , wrote in their 70-page decision that " marriage is neither harmed nor encroached upon by the life partnership law . "
they ruled that marriage and registered partnerships are not directed at the same sections of the population and therefore do not stand in direct " competition " with each other .
new rights the same-sex partnership law , passed in august 2001 , brought germany closer to some of its european neighbors with regards to legal recognition of homosexual relationships .

german environment minister trittin is hopeful despite growing differences between the eu , the us and the developing world . a decade after the landmark earth summit in rio de janeiro first put environmental issues on the global political agenda , the next un world summit on sustainable development -lrb- wssd -rrb- , kicking off in johannesburg on august 26 , is expected to take things a step further .
the agenda will be stretched as a flurry of topics clamour for attention , ranging from poverty , the environment and energy politics to water economics , globalisation and sustainable development .
hopes dim for earth summit despite the high hopes pinned on the summit , there ’ s no denying that the initial enthusiasm about tackling global environmental problems has waned as sharp differences between the united states , the european union and the developing world have emerged .
so much so that there are now fears that the johannesburg summit might merely echo broad principles adopted by different countries rather than bring about real change .
german environment minister jürgen trittin , who is at a meeting in new york today to prepare the ground for the johannesburg summit , said at a press conference that the summit can not be allowed to be dominated by expressions of overall goals .
he said binding environmental and political aims as well as clear targets and timetables need to be agreed upon .
one of the key proposals by the german government and the eu is to increase the use of renewable energies to generate electricity by 15 percent by the year 2010 .
another is to halve the number of people who have live with poor sanitation and have no access to clean drinking water .
the proposals are mainly directed at rich industrial nations , which trittin said are believed to be mainly responsible for global climate change .
opening markets one potential sticking point is a call from developing countries for a greater commitment by richer nations to open their markets to trade and the transfer of technology .
but last month at a meeting on the island of bali , a us administration official made it clear that the united states was not prepared to go beyond commitments it had already made .
trittin admitted that in this respect it wasn ’ t just the united states holding firm .
some europeans are also reluctant to open their markets .
" the main problem is the huge subsidies that some industrial countries give some of their economic sectors .
oecd countries spend $ 335 million -lrb- 331.9 million euro -rrb- a year for agricultural subsidies alone , preventing several products from developing countries getting access to the market " , he said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
in europe , trittin said , france , ireland and spain were especially reluctant to give up their agricultural subsidy systems .
will the us get on board ?
there is one big question on many minds : can the us and eu start reading off the same page when it comes to the earth 's environmental future ?
so far the us has shied away from any kind of binding commitment regarding environmental protection and has incurred the wrath of several developing and european countries who blame it for putting the brakes on environmentally friendly policies on water and sanitation , energy , agricultural productivity , bio-diversity and health .
trittin told the süddeutsche zeitung , " the us as usual has problems with such multilateral commitments " .
in a sign that the us may maintain its rigid stance , us commerce undersecretary grant aldonas told reuters on tuesday that next month ’ s summit may not produce a concrete plan for sustainable development , but still could be a successful breeding ground for new ideas .
trittin sanguine despite differences despite the yawning gap between us and european viewpoints , trittin says he sees hope that a compromise might be reached with the americans .

german environment minister trittin is hopeful despite growing differences between the eu , the us and the developing world . a decade after the landmark earth summit in rio de janeiro first put environmental issues on the global political agenda , the next un world summit on sustainable development -lrb- wssd -rrb- , kicking off in johannesburg on august 26 , is expected to take things a step further .
the agenda will be stretched as a flurry of topics clamour for attention , ranging from poverty , the environment and energy politics to water economics , globalisation and sustainable development .
hopes dim for earth summit despite the high hopes pinned on the summit , there ’ s no denying that the initial enthusiasm about tackling global environmental problems has waned as sharp differences between the united states , the european union and the developing world have emerged .
so much so that there are now fears that the johannesburg summit might merely echo broad principles adopted by different countries rather than bring about real change .
german environment minister jürgen trittin , who is at a meeting in new york today to prepare the ground for the johannesburg summit , said at a press conference that the summit can not be allowed to be dominated by expressions of overall goals .
he said binding environmental and political aims as well as clear targets and timetables need to be agreed upon .
one of the key proposals by the german government and the eu is to increase the use of renewable energies to generate electricity by 15 percent by the year 2010 .
another is to halve the number of people who have live with poor sanitation and have no access to clean drinking water .
the proposals are mainly directed at rich industrial nations , which trittin said are believed to be mainly responsible for global climate change .
opening markets one potential sticking point is a call from developing countries for a greater commitment by richer nations to open their markets to trade and the transfer of technology .
but last month at a meeting on the island of bali , a us administration official made it clear that the united states was not prepared to go beyond commitments it had already made .
trittin admitted that in this respect it wasn ’ t just the united states holding firm .
some europeans are also reluctant to open their markets .
" the main problem is the huge subsidies that some industrial countries give some of their economic sectors .
oecd countries spend $ 335 million -lrb- 331.9 million euro -rrb- a year for agricultural subsidies alone , preventing several products from developing countries getting access to the market " , he said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
in europe , trittin said , france , ireland and spain were especially reluctant to give up their agricultural subsidy systems .

german environment minister trittin is hopeful despite growing differences between the eu , the us and the developing world . a decade after the landmark earth summit in rio de janeiro first put environmental issues on the global political agenda , the next un world summit on sustainable development -lrb- wssd -rrb- , kicking off in johannesburg on august 26 , is expected to take things a step further .
the agenda will be stretched as a flurry of topics clamour for attention , ranging from poverty , the environment and energy politics to water economics , globalisation and sustainable development .
hopes dim for earth summit despite the high hopes pinned on the summit , there ’ s no denying that the initial enthusiasm about tackling global environmental problems has waned as sharp differences between the united states , the european union and the developing world have emerged .
so much so that there are now fears that the johannesburg summit might merely echo broad principles adopted by different countries rather than bring about real change .
german environment minister jürgen trittin , who is at a meeting in new york today to prepare the ground for the johannesburg summit , said at a press conference that the summit can not be allowed to be dominated by expressions of overall goals .
he said binding environmental and political aims as well as clear targets and timetables need to be agreed upon .
one of the key proposals by the german government and the eu is to increase the use of renewable energies to generate electricity by 15 percent by the year 2010 .
another is to halve the number of people who have live with poor sanitation and have no access to clean drinking water .
the proposals are mainly directed at rich industrial nations , which trittin said are believed to be mainly responsible for global climate change .
opening markets one potential sticking point is a call from developing countries for a greater commitment by richer nations to open their markets to trade and the transfer of technology .
but last month at a meeting on the island of bali , a us administration official made it clear that the united states was not prepared to go beyond commitments it had already made .
trittin admitted that in this respect it wasn ’ t just the united states holding firm .
some europeans are also reluctant to open their markets .
" the main problem is the huge subsidies that some industrial countries give some of their economic sectors .
oecd countries spend $ 335 million -lrb- 331.9 million euro -rrb- a year for agricultural subsidies alone , preventing several products from developing countries getting access to the market " , he said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
in europe , trittin said , france , ireland and spain were especially reluctant to give up their agricultural subsidy systems .
will the us get on board ?
there is one big question on many minds : can the us and eu start reading off the same page when it comes to the earth 's environmental future ?
so far the us has shied away from any kind of binding commitment regarding environmental protection and has incurred the wrath of several developing and european countries who blame it for putting the brakes on environmentally friendly policies on water and sanitation , energy , agricultural productivity , bio-diversity and health .
trittin told the süddeutsche zeitung , " the us as usual has problems with such multilateral commitments " .
in a sign that the us may maintain its rigid stance , us commerce undersecretary grant aldonas told reuters on tuesday that next month ’ s summit may not produce a concrete plan for sustainable development , but still could be a successful breeding ground for new ideas .
trittin sanguine despite differences despite the yawning gap between us and european viewpoints , trittin says he sees hope that a compromise might be reached with the americans .
" once the europeans reach an agreement with the developing countries about access to markets , it will be easier to spur the americans to commit themselves to concrete aims , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung .

axel blumenthal -lrb- left -rrb- , head of germany 's largest lesbian and gay association with green party member of parliament volker beck .
germany ’ s constitutional court handed gays and lesbians a victory on wednesday when it rejected conservative arguments and ruled that a law allowing same-sex unions is not in violation of the country ’ s constitution . by a five-to-three vote on wednesday , germany ’ s highest court rejected complaints by three conservative-led federal states that the country ’ s same-sex union law collides with family values enshrined in the constitutition .
in doing so , the judges have given their imprimatur to the law passed in august 2001 that allows gays and lesbians to enter into " registered life partnerships " and enjoy many of the benefits of traditional marriage .
" a victory all the way " was how volker beck , green party politician and driving force behind the partnership law , described the court ’ s ruling , which rejected out of hand the complaints brought forward by bavaria , saxony and thuringia .
the three states had argued that same-sex partnerships would prove deleterious to marriages between a man and a woman , which enjoy special protections in the country ’ s constitution .
the result , they argued , would be fewer children being born .
" we are already having problems due to the fact that we don ’ t have enough children , " said günter beckstein , interior minister of bavaria , said in an interview on german radio before the decision was handed down .
" add to that the fact that we no longer have a clear understanding of traditional marriage and family .
we think that is wrong . "
but the red-robed judges in karlsruhe , where germany ’ s highest court is based , wrote in their 70-page decision that " marriage is neither harmed nor encroached upon by the life partnership law . "
they ruled that marriage and registered partnerships are not directed at the same sections of the population and therefore do not stand in direct " competition " with each other .
new rights the same-sex partnership law , passed in august 2001 , brought germany closer to some of its european neighbors with regards to legal recognition of homosexual relationships .
several scandinavian countries as well as the netherlands , france and portugal all have versions of same-sex union laws on the books .
under the german version gays and lesbians have rights to inheritance and hospital visitation .
they may refuse to testify against their life partner in a court of law and may share a last name if they so choose .
foreigners with german partners will be allowed to remain in country indefinitely .
however , same-sex couples can not adopt children , nor do they have the tax advantages enjoyed by heterosexual spouses .
in order to get last year ’ s legislation passed and avoid the conservative-controlled bundesrat , the upper house of parliament which must approve bills concerning financial affairs of the states , partnership proponents split the law in two , leaving the tax question for a later day .
that day may be approaching , since the judges ’ ruling on tuesday can be interpreted as giving the green light for passage of tax benefits for same-sex couples .
the " protection of marriage " in the constitution , the judges wrote , " does not mean that marriage must be protected more than other forms of life partnership . "
the green party ’ s volker beck has announced he will move forward on the tax question .
conservative reaction edmund stoiber , premier of bavaria and candidate for chancellor in this fall ’ s elections , said he regretted the court ’ s decision , but added that in the event that his conservative union coalition wins on september 22nd , it will not challenge the law .
even so , the law would not have much support from such a government .
the woman seen as the probable family minister in a stoiber government , unmarried mother katherina reiche , has publicly come out against the partnership law .
stoiber has said he will vigorously fight attempts to grant gay and lesbian couples the same tax advantages heterosexual couples enjoy .
the catholic church , which vigorously fought the law last year before its adoption , has also expressed regret over the court ’ s ruling .
the head of the german bishops ’ conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the result of wednesday ’ s decision would mean the institution of marriage would suffer , and with it , society as a whole .

" we are already having problems due to the fact that we don ’ t have enough children , " said günter beckstein , interior minister of bavaria , said in an interview on german radio before the decision was handed down .
" add to that the fact that we no longer have a clear understanding of traditional marriage and family .
we think that is wrong . "
but the red-robed judges in karlsruhe , where germany ’ s highest court is based , wrote in their 70-page decision that " marriage is neither harmed nor encroached upon by the life partnership law . "
they ruled that marriage and registered partnerships are not directed at the same sections of the population and therefore do not stand in direct " competition " with each other .
new rights the same-sex partnership law , passed in august 2001 , brought germany closer to some of its european neighbors with regards to legal recognition of homosexual relationships .
several scandinavian countries as well as the netherlands , france and portugal all have versions of same-sex union laws on the books .
under the german version gays and lesbians have rights to inheritance and hospital visitation .
they may refuse to testify against their life partner in a court of law and may share a last name if they so choose .
foreigners with german partners will be allowed to remain in country indefinitely .
however , same-sex couples can not adopt children , nor do they have the tax advantages enjoyed by heterosexual spouses .
in order to get last year ’ s legislation passed and avoid the conservative-controlled bundesrat , the upper house of parliament which must approve bills concerning financial affairs of the states , partnership proponents split the law in two , leaving the tax question for a later day .
that day may be approaching , since the judges ’ ruling on tuesday can be interpreted as giving the green light for passage of tax benefits for same-sex couples .
the " protection of marriage " in the constitution , the judges wrote , " does not mean that marriage must be protected more than other forms of life partnership . "
the green party ’ s volker beck has announced he will move forward on the tax question .
conservative reaction edmund stoiber , premier of bavaria and candidate for chancellor in this fall ’ s elections , said he regretted the court ’ s decision , but added that in the event that his conservative union coalition wins on september 22nd , it will not challenge the law .
even so , the law would not have much support from such a government .
the woman seen as the probable family minister in a stoiber government , unmarried mother katherina reiche , has publicly come out against the partnership law .
stoiber has said he will vigorously fight attempts to grant gay and lesbian couples the same tax advantages heterosexual couples enjoy .
the catholic church , which vigorously fought the law last year before its adoption , has also expressed regret over the court ’ s ruling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : environment matters steering environmental issues back on the political agenda world summit opens with eu , us at odds on the green road from rio to johannesburg cooking with the sun germany -pipe- 17.07.2002 german minister keeps his faith in upcoming earth summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister juergen trittin believes that all is not lost at the earth summit in johannesburg will the much-awaited earth summit in johannesburg yield results ?
german environment minister trittin is hopeful despite growing differences between the eu , the us and the developing world . a decade after the landmark earth summit in rio de janeiro first put environmental issues on the global political agenda , the next un world summit on sustainable development -lrb- wssd -rrb- , kicking off in johannesburg on august 26 , is expected to take things a step further .
the agenda will be stretched as a flurry of topics clamour for attention , ranging from poverty , the environment and energy politics to water economics , globalisation and sustainable development .
hopes dim for earth summit despite the high hopes pinned on the summit , there ’ s no denying that the initial enthusiasm about tackling global environmental problems has waned as sharp differences between the united states , the european union and the developing world have emerged .
so much so that there are now fears that the johannesburg summit might merely echo broad principles adopted by different countries rather than bring about real change .
german environment minister jürgen trittin , who is at a meeting in new york today to prepare the ground for the johannesburg summit , said at a press conference that the summit can not be allowed to be dominated by expressions of overall goals .
he said binding environmental and political aims as well as clear targets and timetables need to be agreed upon .
one of the key proposals by the german government and the eu is to increase the use of renewable energies to generate electricity by 15 percent by the year 2010 .
another is to halve the number of people who have live with poor sanitation and have no access to clean drinking water .
the proposals are mainly directed at rich industrial nations , which trittin said are believed to be mainly responsible for global climate change .
opening markets one potential sticking point is a call from developing countries for a greater commitment by richer nations to open their markets to trade and the transfer of technology .
but last month at a meeting on the island of bali , a us administration official made it clear that the united states was not prepared to go beyond commitments it had already made .
trittin admitted that in this respect it wasn ’ t just the united states holding firm .
some europeans are also reluctant to open their markets .
" the main problem is the huge subsidies that some industrial countries give some of their economic sectors .
oecd countries spend $ 335 million -lrb- 331.9 million euro -rrb- a year for agricultural subsidies alone , preventing several products from developing countries getting access to the market " , he said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
in europe , trittin said , france , ireland and spain were especially reluctant to give up their agricultural subsidy systems .
will the us get on board ?
there is one big question on many minds : can the us and eu start reading off the same page when it comes to the earth 's environmental future ?
so far the us has shied away from any kind of binding commitment regarding environmental protection and has incurred the wrath of several developing and european countries who blame it for putting the brakes on environmentally friendly policies on water and sanitation , energy , agricultural productivity , bio-diversity and health .
trittin told the süddeutsche zeitung , " the us as usual has problems with such multilateral commitments " .
in a sign that the us may maintain its rigid stance , us commerce undersecretary grant aldonas told reuters on tuesday that next month ’ s summit may not produce a concrete plan for sustainable development , but still could be a successful breeding ground for new ideas .
trittin sanguine despite differences despite the yawning gap between us and european viewpoints , trittin says he sees hope that a compromise might be reached with the americans .
" once the europeans reach an agreement with the developing countries about access to markets , it will be easier to spur the americans to commit themselves to concrete aims , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung .
after all the us wants to be successful in johannesburg too . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

several scandinavian countries as well as the netherlands , france and portugal all have versions of same-sex union laws on the books .
under the german version gays and lesbians have rights to inheritance and hospital visitation .
they may refuse to testify against their life partner in a court of law and may share a last name if they so choose .
foreigners with german partners will be allowed to remain in country indefinitely .
however , same-sex couples can not adopt children , nor do they have the tax advantages enjoyed by heterosexual spouses .
in order to get last year ’ s legislation passed and avoid the conservative-controlled bundesrat , the upper house of parliament which must approve bills concerning financial affairs of the states , partnership proponents split the law in two , leaving the tax question for a later day .
that day may be approaching , since the judges ’ ruling on tuesday can be interpreted as giving the green light for passage of tax benefits for same-sex couples .
the " protection of marriage " in the constitution , the judges wrote , " does not mean that marriage must be protected more than other forms of life partnership . "
the green party ’ s volker beck has announced he will move forward on the tax question .
conservative reaction edmund stoiber , premier of bavaria and candidate for chancellor in this fall ’ s elections , said he regretted the court ’ s decision , but added that in the event that his conservative union coalition wins on september 22nd , it will not challenge the law .
even so , the law would not have much support from such a government .
the woman seen as the probable family minister in a stoiber government , unmarried mother katherina reiche , has publicly come out against the partnership law .
stoiber has said he will vigorously fight attempts to grant gay and lesbian couples the same tax advantages heterosexual couples enjoy .
the catholic church , which vigorously fought the law last year before its adoption , has also expressed regret over the court ’ s ruling .
the head of the german bishops ’ conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the result of wednesday ’ s decision would mean the institution of marriage would suffer , and with it , society as a whole .
rush to the altar ?
there are an estimated 47 000 same-sex couples in germany , of those about 4,500 have already tied the knot and become registered partners .
according to volker beck , part of the reason more have not done so has been the insecurity they have felt because of the court challenge .
now that has all changed .
" i don ’ t think the wedding registry offices are going to overflowing , " he said in an radio interview , " but the ruling is definitely going to give partnerships a strong push and i think we ’ re going to the numbers of them going up substantially .

german environment minister trittin is hopeful despite growing differences between the eu , the us and the developing world . a decade after the landmark earth summit in rio de janeiro first put environmental issues on the global political agenda , the next un world summit on sustainable development -lrb- wssd -rrb- , kicking off in johannesburg on august 26 , is expected to take things a step further .

german environment minister jürgen trittin , who is at a meeting in new york today to prepare the ground for the johannesburg summit , said at a press conference that the summit can not be allowed to be dominated by expressions of overall goals .
he said binding environmental and political aims as well as clear targets and timetables need to be agreed upon .
one of the key proposals by the german government and the eu is to increase the use of renewable energies to generate electricity by 15 percent by the year 2010 .
another is to halve the number of people who have live with poor sanitation and have no access to clean drinking water .
the proposals are mainly directed at rich industrial nations , which trittin said are believed to be mainly responsible for global climate change .

axel blumenthal -lrb- left -rrb- , head of germany 's largest lesbian and gay association with green party member of parliament volker beck .
germany ’ s constitutional court handed gays and lesbians a victory on wednesday when it rejected conservative arguments and ruled that a law allowing same-sex unions is not in violation of the country ’ s constitution . by a five-to-three vote on wednesday , germany ’ s highest court rejected complaints by three conservative-led federal states that the country ’ s same-sex union law collides with family values enshrined in the constitutition .
in doing so , the judges have given their imprimatur to the law passed in august 2001 that allows gays and lesbians to enter into " registered life partnerships " and enjoy many of the benefits of traditional marriage .
" a victory all the way " was how volker beck , green party politician and driving force behind the partnership law , described the court ’ s ruling , which rejected out of hand the complaints brought forward by bavaria , saxony and thuringia .
the three states had argued that same-sex partnerships would prove deleterious to marriages between a man and a woman , which enjoy special protections in the country ’ s constitution .
the result , they argued , would be fewer children being born .
" we are already having problems due to the fact that we don ’ t have enough children , " said günter beckstein , interior minister of bavaria , said in an interview on german radio before the decision was handed down .
" add to that the fact that we no longer have a clear understanding of traditional marriage and family .
we think that is wrong . "
but the red-robed judges in karlsruhe , where germany ’ s highest court is based , wrote in their 70-page decision that " marriage is neither harmed nor encroached upon by the life partnership law . "
they ruled that marriage and registered partnerships are not directed at the same sections of the population and therefore do not stand in direct " competition " with each other .
new rights the same-sex partnership law , passed in august 2001 , brought germany closer to some of its european neighbors with regards to legal recognition of homosexual relationships .
several scandinavian countries as well as the netherlands , france and portugal all have versions of same-sex union laws on the books .
under the german version gays and lesbians have rights to inheritance and hospital visitation .
they may refuse to testify against their life partner in a court of law and may share a last name if they so choose .
foreigners with german partners will be allowed to remain in country indefinitely .
however , same-sex couples can not adopt children , nor do they have the tax advantages enjoyed by heterosexual spouses .
in order to get last year ’ s legislation passed and avoid the conservative-controlled bundesrat , the upper house of parliament which must approve bills concerning financial affairs of the states , partnership proponents split the law in two , leaving the tax question for a later day .
that day may be approaching , since the judges ’ ruling on tuesday can be interpreted as giving the green light for passage of tax benefits for same-sex couples .
the " protection of marriage " in the constitution , the judges wrote , " does not mean that marriage must be protected more than other forms of life partnership . "
the green party ’ s volker beck has announced he will move forward on the tax question .
conservative reaction edmund stoiber , premier of bavaria and candidate for chancellor in this fall ’ s elections , said he regretted the court ’ s decision , but added that in the event that his conservative union coalition wins on september 22nd , it will not challenge the law .
even so , the law would not have much support from such a government .
the woman seen as the probable family minister in a stoiber government , unmarried mother katherina reiche , has publicly come out against the partnership law .
stoiber has said he will vigorously fight attempts to grant gay and lesbian couples the same tax advantages heterosexual couples enjoy .
the catholic church , which vigorously fought the law last year before its adoption , has also expressed regret over the court ’ s ruling .

axel blumenthal -lrb- left -rrb- , head of germany 's largest lesbian and gay association with green party member of parliament volker beck .
germany ’ s constitutional court handed gays and lesbians a victory on wednesday when it rejected conservative arguments and ruled that a law allowing same-sex unions is not in violation of the country ’ s constitution . by a five-to-three vote on wednesday , germany ’ s highest court rejected complaints by three conservative-led federal states that the country ’ s same-sex union law collides with family values enshrined in the constitutition .
in doing so , the judges have given their imprimatur to the law passed in august 2001 that allows gays and lesbians to enter into " registered life partnerships " and enjoy many of the benefits of traditional marriage .
" a victory all the way " was how volker beck , green party politician and driving force behind the partnership law , described the court ’ s ruling , which rejected out of hand the complaints brought forward by bavaria , saxony and thuringia .
the three states had argued that same-sex partnerships would prove deleterious to marriages between a man and a woman , which enjoy special protections in the country ’ s constitution .
the result , they argued , would be fewer children being born .
" we are already having problems due to the fact that we don ’ t have enough children , " said günter beckstein , interior minister of bavaria , said in an interview on german radio before the decision was handed down .
" add to that the fact that we no longer have a clear understanding of traditional marriage and family .
we think that is wrong . "
but the red-robed judges in karlsruhe , where germany ’ s highest court is based , wrote in their 70-page decision that " marriage is neither harmed nor encroached upon by the life partnership law . "
they ruled that marriage and registered partnerships are not directed at the same sections of the population and therefore do not stand in direct " competition " with each other .
new rights the same-sex partnership law , passed in august 2001 , brought germany closer to some of its european neighbors with regards to legal recognition of homosexual relationships .
several scandinavian countries as well as the netherlands , france and portugal all have versions of same-sex union laws on the books .
under the german version gays and lesbians have rights to inheritance and hospital visitation .
they may refuse to testify against their life partner in a court of law and may share a last name if they so choose .
foreigners with german partners will be allowed to remain in country indefinitely .
however , same-sex couples can not adopt children , nor do they have the tax advantages enjoyed by heterosexual spouses .
in order to get last year ’ s legislation passed and avoid the conservative-controlled bundesrat , the upper house of parliament which must approve bills concerning financial affairs of the states , partnership proponents split the law in two , leaving the tax question for a later day .
that day may be approaching , since the judges ’ ruling on tuesday can be interpreted as giving the green light for passage of tax benefits for same-sex couples .
the " protection of marriage " in the constitution , the judges wrote , " does not mean that marriage must be protected more than other forms of life partnership . "
the green party ’ s volker beck has announced he will move forward on the tax question .
conservative reaction edmund stoiber , premier of bavaria and candidate for chancellor in this fall ’ s elections , said he regretted the court ’ s decision , but added that in the event that his conservative union coalition wins on september 22nd , it will not challenge the law .
even so , the law would not have much support from such a government .
the woman seen as the probable family minister in a stoiber government , unmarried mother katherina reiche , has publicly come out against the partnership law .
stoiber has said he will vigorously fight attempts to grant gay and lesbian couples the same tax advantages heterosexual couples enjoy .
the catholic church , which vigorously fought the law last year before its adoption , has also expressed regret over the court ’ s ruling .

axel blumenthal -lrb- left -rrb- , head of germany 's largest lesbian and gay association with green party member of parliament volker beck .
germany ’ s constitutional court handed gays and lesbians a victory on wednesday when it rejected conservative arguments and ruled that a law allowing same-sex unions is not in violation of the country ’ s constitution . by a five-to-three vote on wednesday , germany ’ s highest court rejected complaints by three conservative-led federal states that the country ’ s same-sex union law collides with family values enshrined in the constitutition .
in doing so , the judges have given their imprimatur to the law passed in august 2001 that allows gays and lesbians to enter into " registered life partnerships " and enjoy many of the benefits of traditional marriage .
" a victory all the way " was how volker beck , green party politician and driving force behind the partnership law , described the court ’ s ruling , which rejected out of hand the complaints brought forward by bavaria , saxony and thuringia .
the three states had argued that same-sex partnerships would prove deleterious to marriages between a man and a woman , which enjoy special protections in the country ’ s constitution .
the result , they argued , would be fewer children being born .
" we are already having problems due to the fact that we don ’ t have enough children , " said günter beckstein , interior minister of bavaria , said in an interview on german radio before the decision was handed down .
" add to that the fact that we no longer have a clear understanding of traditional marriage and family .
we think that is wrong . "
but the red-robed judges in karlsruhe , where germany ’ s highest court is based , wrote in their 70-page decision that " marriage is neither harmed nor encroached upon by the life partnership law . "
they ruled that marriage and registered partnerships are not directed at the same sections of the population and therefore do not stand in direct " competition " with each other .
new rights the same-sex partnership law , passed in august 2001 , brought germany closer to some of its european neighbors with regards to legal recognition of homosexual relationships .
several scandinavian countries as well as the netherlands , france and portugal all have versions of same-sex union laws on the books .
under the german version gays and lesbians have rights to inheritance and hospital visitation .
they may refuse to testify against their life partner in a court of law and may share a last name if they so choose .
foreigners with german partners will be allowed to remain in country indefinitely .
however , same-sex couples can not adopt children , nor do they have the tax advantages enjoyed by heterosexual spouses .
in order to get last year ’ s legislation passed and avoid the conservative-controlled bundesrat , the upper house of parliament which must approve bills concerning financial affairs of the states , partnership proponents split the law in two , leaving the tax question for a later day .
that day may be approaching , since the judges ’ ruling on tuesday can be interpreted as giving the green light for passage of tax benefits for same-sex couples .
the " protection of marriage " in the constitution , the judges wrote , " does not mean that marriage must be protected more than other forms of life partnership . "
the green party ’ s volker beck has announced he will move forward on the tax question .
conservative reaction edmund stoiber , premier of bavaria and candidate for chancellor in this fall ’ s elections , said he regretted the court ’ s decision , but added that in the event that his conservative union coalition wins on september 22nd , it will not challenge the law .
even so , the law would not have much support from such a government .
the woman seen as the probable family minister in a stoiber government , unmarried mother katherina reiche , has publicly come out against the partnership law .
stoiber has said he will vigorously fight attempts to grant gay and lesbian couples the same tax advantages heterosexual couples enjoy .
the catholic church , which vigorously fought the law last year before its adoption , has also expressed regret over the court ’ s ruling .
the head of the german bishops ’ conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the result of wednesday ’ s decision would mean the institution of marriage would suffer , and with it , society as a whole .
rush to the altar ?
there are an estimated 47 000 same-sex couples in germany , of those about 4,500 have already tied the knot and become registered partners .
according to volker beck , part of the reason more have not done so has been the insecurity they have felt because of the court challenge .

german environment minister trittin is hopeful despite growing differences between the eu , the us and the developing world . a decade after the landmark earth summit in rio de janeiro first put environmental issues on the global political agenda , the next un world summit on sustainable development -lrb- wssd -rrb- , kicking off in johannesburg on august 26 , is expected to take things a step further .
the agenda will be stretched as a flurry of topics clamour for attention , ranging from poverty , the environment and energy politics to water economics , globalisation and sustainable development .
hopes dim for earth summit despite the high hopes pinned on the summit , there ’ s no denying that the initial enthusiasm about tackling global environmental problems has waned as sharp differences between the united states , the european union and the developing world have emerged .
so much so that there are now fears that the johannesburg summit might merely echo broad principles adopted by different countries rather than bring about real change .
german environment minister jürgen trittin , who is at a meeting in new york today to prepare the ground for the johannesburg summit , said at a press conference that the summit can not be allowed to be dominated by expressions of overall goals .
he said binding environmental and political aims as well as clear targets and timetables need to be agreed upon .
one of the key proposals by the german government and the eu is to increase the use of renewable energies to generate electricity by 15 percent by the year 2010 .
another is to halve the number of people who have live with poor sanitation and have no access to clean drinking water .
the proposals are mainly directed at rich industrial nations , which trittin said are believed to be mainly responsible for global climate change .
opening markets one potential sticking point is a call from developing countries for a greater commitment by richer nations to open their markets to trade and the transfer of technology .
but last month at a meeting on the island of bali , a us administration official made it clear that the united states was not prepared to go beyond commitments it had already made .
trittin admitted that in this respect it wasn ’ t just the united states holding firm .
some europeans are also reluctant to open their markets .
" the main problem is the huge subsidies that some industrial countries give some of their economic sectors .
oecd countries spend $ 335 million -lrb- 331.9 million euro -rrb- a year for agricultural subsidies alone , preventing several products from developing countries getting access to the market " , he said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
in europe , trittin said , france , ireland and spain were especially reluctant to give up their agricultural subsidy systems .
will the us get on board ?
there is one big question on many minds : can the us and eu start reading off the same page when it comes to the earth 's environmental future ?
so far the us has shied away from any kind of binding commitment regarding environmental protection and has incurred the wrath of several developing and european countries who blame it for putting the brakes on environmentally friendly policies on water and sanitation , energy , agricultural productivity , bio-diversity and health .
trittin told the süddeutsche zeitung , " the us as usual has problems with such multilateral commitments " .
in a sign that the us may maintain its rigid stance , us commerce undersecretary grant aldonas told reuters on tuesday that next month ’ s summit may not produce a concrete plan for sustainable development , but still could be a successful breeding ground for new ideas .
trittin sanguine despite differences despite the yawning gap between us and european viewpoints , trittin says he sees hope that a compromise might be reached with the americans .
" once the europeans reach an agreement with the developing countries about access to markets , it will be easier to spur the americans to commit themselves to concrete aims , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung .

axel blumenthal -lrb- left -rrb- , head of germany 's largest lesbian and gay association with green party member of parliament volker beck .
germany ’ s constitutional court handed gays and lesbians a victory on wednesday when it rejected conservative arguments and ruled that a law allowing same-sex unions is not in violation of the country ’ s constitution . by a five-to-three vote on wednesday , germany ’ s highest court rejected complaints by three conservative-led federal states that the country ’ s same-sex union law collides with family values enshrined in the constitutition .
in doing so , the judges have given their imprimatur to the law passed in august 2001 that allows gays and lesbians to enter into " registered life partnerships " and enjoy many of the benefits of traditional marriage .
" a victory all the way " was how volker beck , green party politician and driving force behind the partnership law , described the court ’ s ruling , which rejected out of hand the complaints brought forward by bavaria , saxony and thuringia .
the three states had argued that same-sex partnerships would prove deleterious to marriages between a man and a woman , which enjoy special protections in the country ’ s constitution .
the result , they argued , would be fewer children being born .
" we are already having problems due to the fact that we don ’ t have enough children , " said günter beckstein , interior minister of bavaria , said in an interview on german radio before the decision was handed down .
" add to that the fact that we no longer have a clear understanding of traditional marriage and family .
we think that is wrong . "
but the red-robed judges in karlsruhe , where germany ’ s highest court is based , wrote in their 70-page decision that " marriage is neither harmed nor encroached upon by the life partnership law . "
they ruled that marriage and registered partnerships are not directed at the same sections of the population and therefore do not stand in direct " competition " with each other .
new rights the same-sex partnership law , passed in august 2001 , brought germany closer to some of its european neighbors with regards to legal recognition of homosexual relationships .
several scandinavian countries as well as the netherlands , france and portugal all have versions of same-sex union laws on the books .
under the german version gays and lesbians have rights to inheritance and hospital visitation .
they may refuse to testify against their life partner in a court of law and may share a last name if they so choose .
foreigners with german partners will be allowed to remain in country indefinitely .
however , same-sex couples can not adopt children , nor do they have the tax advantages enjoyed by heterosexual spouses .
in order to get last year ’ s legislation passed and avoid the conservative-controlled bundesrat , the upper house of parliament which must approve bills concerning financial affairs of the states , partnership proponents split the law in two , leaving the tax question for a later day .
that day may be approaching , since the judges ’ ruling on tuesday can be interpreted as giving the green light for passage of tax benefits for same-sex couples .
the " protection of marriage " in the constitution , the judges wrote , " does not mean that marriage must be protected more than other forms of life partnership . "
the green party ’ s volker beck has announced he will move forward on the tax question .
conservative reaction edmund stoiber , premier of bavaria and candidate for chancellor in this fall ’ s elections , said he regretted the court ’ s decision , but added that in the event that his conservative union coalition wins on september 22nd , it will not challenge the law .
even so , the law would not have much support from such a government .
the woman seen as the probable family minister in a stoiber government , unmarried mother katherina reiche , has publicly come out against the partnership law .
stoiber has said he will vigorously fight attempts to grant gay and lesbian couples the same tax advantages heterosexual couples enjoy .
the catholic church , which vigorously fought the law last year before its adoption , has also expressed regret over the court ’ s ruling .
the head of the german bishops ’ conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the result of wednesday ’ s decision would mean the institution of marriage would suffer , and with it , society as a whole .
rush to the altar ?
there are an estimated 47 000 same-sex couples in germany , of those about 4,500 have already tied the knot and become registered partners .
according to volker beck , part of the reason more have not done so has been the insecurity they have felt because of the court challenge .
now that has all changed .
" i don ’ t think the wedding registry offices are going to overflowing , " he said in an radio interview , " but the ruling is definitely going to give partnerships a strong push and i think we ’ re going to the numbers of them going up substantially . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de everyday isn ’ t christopher street day csd may have attracted thousands to its glitzy celebrations this year , but homosexual reality is far from colourful .
young gays and lesbians in germany still face social discrimination , says a recent study .

german environment minister trittin is hopeful despite growing differences between the eu , the us and the developing world . a decade after the landmark earth summit in rio de janeiro first put environmental issues on the global political agenda , the next un world summit on sustainable development -lrb- wssd -rrb- , kicking off in johannesburg on august 26 , is expected to take things a step further .
the agenda will be stretched as a flurry of topics clamour for attention , ranging from poverty , the environment and energy politics to water economics , globalisation and sustainable development .
hopes dim for earth summit despite the high hopes pinned on the summit , there ’ s no denying that the initial enthusiasm about tackling global environmental problems has waned as sharp differences between the united states , the european union and the developing world have emerged .
so much so that there are now fears that the johannesburg summit might merely echo broad principles adopted by different countries rather than bring about real change .
german environment minister jürgen trittin , who is at a meeting in new york today to prepare the ground for the johannesburg summit , said at a press conference that the summit can not be allowed to be dominated by expressions of overall goals .
he said binding environmental and political aims as well as clear targets and timetables need to be agreed upon .
one of the key proposals by the german government and the eu is to increase the use of renewable energies to generate electricity by 15 percent by the year 2010 .
another is to halve the number of people who have live with poor sanitation and have no access to clean drinking water .
the proposals are mainly directed at rich industrial nations , which trittin said are believed to be mainly responsible for global climate change .
opening markets one potential sticking point is a call from developing countries for a greater commitment by richer nations to open their markets to trade and the transfer of technology .
but last month at a meeting on the island of bali , a us administration official made it clear that the united states was not prepared to go beyond commitments it had already made .
trittin admitted that in this respect it wasn ’ t just the united states holding firm .
some europeans are also reluctant to open their markets .
" the main problem is the huge subsidies that some industrial countries give some of their economic sectors .
oecd countries spend $ 335 million -lrb- 331.9 million euro -rrb- a year for agricultural subsidies alone , preventing several products from developing countries getting access to the market " , he said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
in europe , trittin said , france , ireland and spain were especially reluctant to give up their agricultural subsidy systems .
will the us get on board ?
there is one big question on many minds : can the us and eu start reading off the same page when it comes to the earth 's environmental future ?
so far the us has shied away from any kind of binding commitment regarding environmental protection and has incurred the wrath of several developing and european countries who blame it for putting the brakes on environmentally friendly policies on water and sanitation , energy , agricultural productivity , bio-diversity and health .
trittin told the süddeutsche zeitung , " the us as usual has problems with such multilateral commitments " .
in a sign that the us may maintain its rigid stance , us commerce undersecretary grant aldonas told reuters on tuesday that next month ’ s summit may not produce a concrete plan for sustainable development , but still could be a successful breeding ground for new ideas .
trittin sanguine despite differences despite the yawning gap between us and european viewpoints , trittin says he sees hope that a compromise might be reached with the americans .
" once the europeans reach an agreement with the developing countries about access to markets , it will be easier to spur the americans to commit themselves to concrete aims , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung .

axel blumenthal -lrb- left -rrb- , head of germany 's largest lesbian and gay association with green party member of parliament volker beck .
germany ’ s constitutional court handed gays and lesbians a victory on wednesday when it rejected conservative arguments and ruled that a law allowing same-sex unions is not in violation of the country ’ s constitution . by a five-to-three vote on wednesday , germany ’ s highest court rejected complaints by three conservative-led federal states that the country ’ s same-sex union law collides with family values enshrined in the constitutition .
in doing so , the judges have given their imprimatur to the law passed in august 2001 that allows gays and lesbians to enter into " registered life partnerships " and enjoy many of the benefits of traditional marriage .
" a victory all the way " was how volker beck , green party politician and driving force behind the partnership law , described the court ’ s ruling , which rejected out of hand the complaints brought forward by bavaria , saxony and thuringia .
the three states had argued that same-sex partnerships would prove deleterious to marriages between a man and a woman , which enjoy special protections in the country ’ s constitution .
the result , they argued , would be fewer children being born .
" we are already having problems due to the fact that we don ’ t have enough children , " said günter beckstein , interior minister of bavaria , said in an interview on german radio before the decision was handed down .
" add to that the fact that we no longer have a clear understanding of traditional marriage and family .
we think that is wrong . "
but the red-robed judges in karlsruhe , where germany ’ s highest court is based , wrote in their 70-page decision that " marriage is neither harmed nor encroached upon by the life partnership law . "
they ruled that marriage and registered partnerships are not directed at the same sections of the population and therefore do not stand in direct " competition " with each other .
new rights the same-sex partnership law , passed in august 2001 , brought germany closer to some of its european neighbors with regards to legal recognition of homosexual relationships .
several scandinavian countries as well as the netherlands , france and portugal all have versions of same-sex union laws on the books .
under the german version gays and lesbians have rights to inheritance and hospital visitation .
they may refuse to testify against their life partner in a court of law and may share a last name if they so choose .
foreigners with german partners will be allowed to remain in country indefinitely .
however , same-sex couples can not adopt children , nor do they have the tax advantages enjoyed by heterosexual spouses .
in order to get last year ’ s legislation passed and avoid the conservative-controlled bundesrat , the upper house of parliament which must approve bills concerning financial affairs of the states , partnership proponents split the law in two , leaving the tax question for a later day .
that day may be approaching , since the judges ’ ruling on tuesday can be interpreted as giving the green light for passage of tax benefits for same-sex couples .
the " protection of marriage " in the constitution , the judges wrote , " does not mean that marriage must be protected more than other forms of life partnership . "
the green party ’ s volker beck has announced he will move forward on the tax question .
conservative reaction edmund stoiber , premier of bavaria and candidate for chancellor in this fall ’ s elections , said he regretted the court ’ s decision , but added that in the event that his conservative union coalition wins on september 22nd , it will not challenge the law .
even so , the law would not have much support from such a government .
the woman seen as the probable family minister in a stoiber government , unmarried mother katherina reiche , has publicly come out against the partnership law .
stoiber has said he will vigorously fight attempts to grant gay and lesbian couples the same tax advantages heterosexual couples enjoy .
the catholic church , which vigorously fought the law last year before its adoption , has also expressed regret over the court ’ s ruling .
the head of the german bishops ’ conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the result of wednesday ’ s decision would mean the institution of marriage would suffer , and with it , society as a whole .
rush to the altar ?
there are an estimated 47 000 same-sex couples in germany , of those about 4,500 have already tied the knot and become registered partners .
according to volker beck , part of the reason more have not done so has been the insecurity they have felt because of the court challenge .
now that has all changed .
" i don ’ t think the wedding registry offices are going to overflowing , " he said in an radio interview , " but the ruling is definitely going to give partnerships a strong push and i think we ’ re going to the numbers of them going up substantially .

young gays and lesbians in germany still face social discrimination , says a recent study .

german environment minister trittin is hopeful despite growing differences between the eu , the us and the developing world . a decade after the landmark earth summit in rio de janeiro first put environmental issues on the global political agenda , the next un world summit on sustainable development -lrb- wssd -rrb- , kicking off in johannesburg on august 26 , is expected to take things a step further .
the agenda will be stretched as a flurry of topics clamour for attention , ranging from poverty , the environment and energy politics to water economics , globalisation and sustainable development .
hopes dim for earth summit despite the high hopes pinned on the summit , there ’ s no denying that the initial enthusiasm about tackling global environmental problems has waned as sharp differences between the united states , the european union and the developing world have emerged .
so much so that there are now fears that the johannesburg summit might merely echo broad principles adopted by different countries rather than bring about real change .
german environment minister jürgen trittin , who is at a meeting in new york today to prepare the ground for the johannesburg summit , said at a press conference that the summit can not be allowed to be dominated by expressions of overall goals .
he said binding environmental and political aims as well as clear targets and timetables need to be agreed upon .
one of the key proposals by the german government and the eu is to increase the use of renewable energies to generate electricity by 15 percent by the year 2010 .
another is to halve the number of people who have live with poor sanitation and have no access to clean drinking water .
the proposals are mainly directed at rich industrial nations , which trittin said are believed to be mainly responsible for global climate change .
opening markets one potential sticking point is a call from developing countries for a greater commitment by richer nations to open their markets to trade and the transfer of technology .
but last month at a meeting on the island of bali , a us administration official made it clear that the united states was not prepared to go beyond commitments it had already made .
trittin admitted that in this respect it wasn ’ t just the united states holding firm .
some europeans are also reluctant to open their markets .
" the main problem is the huge subsidies that some industrial countries give some of their economic sectors .
oecd countries spend $ 335 million -lrb- 331.9 million euro -rrb- a year for agricultural subsidies alone , preventing several products from developing countries getting access to the market " , he said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
in europe , trittin said , france , ireland and spain were especially reluctant to give up their agricultural subsidy systems .
will the us get on board ?
there is one big question on many minds : can the us and eu start reading off the same page when it comes to the earth 's environmental future ?
so far the us has shied away from any kind of binding commitment regarding environmental protection and has incurred the wrath of several developing and european countries who blame it for putting the brakes on environmentally friendly policies on water and sanitation , energy , agricultural productivity , bio-diversity and health .
trittin told the süddeutsche zeitung , " the us as usual has problems with such multilateral commitments " .
in a sign that the us may maintain its rigid stance , us commerce undersecretary grant aldonas told reuters on tuesday that next month ’ s summit may not produce a concrete plan for sustainable development , but still could be a successful breeding ground for new ideas .
trittin sanguine despite differences despite the yawning gap between us and european viewpoints , trittin says he sees hope that a compromise might be reached with the americans .

german environment minister jürgen trittin , who is at a meeting in new york today to prepare the ground for the johannesburg summit , said at a press conference that the summit can not be allowed to be dominated by expressions of overall goals .
he said binding environmental and political aims as well as clear targets and timetables need to be agreed upon .
one of the key proposals by the german government and the eu is to increase the use of renewable energies to generate electricity by 15 percent by the year 2010 .
another is to halve the number of people who have live with poor sanitation and have no access to clean drinking water .
the proposals are mainly directed at rich industrial nations , which trittin said are believed to be mainly responsible for global climate change .
opening markets one potential sticking point is a call from developing countries for a greater commitment by richer nations to open their markets to trade and the transfer of technology .
but last month at a meeting on the island of bali , a us administration official made it clear that the united states was not prepared to go beyond commitments it had already made .
trittin admitted that in this respect it wasn ’ t just the united states holding firm .
some europeans are also reluctant to open their markets .
" the main problem is the huge subsidies that some industrial countries give some of their economic sectors .
oecd countries spend $ 335 million -lrb- 331.9 million euro -rrb- a year for agricultural subsidies alone , preventing several products from developing countries getting access to the market " , he said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
in europe , trittin said , france , ireland and spain were especially reluctant to give up their agricultural subsidy systems .
will the us get on board ?
there is one big question on many minds : can the us and eu start reading off the same page when it comes to the earth 's environmental future ?
so far the us has shied away from any kind of binding commitment regarding environmental protection and has incurred the wrath of several developing and european countries who blame it for putting the brakes on environmentally friendly policies on water and sanitation , energy , agricultural productivity , bio-diversity and health .
trittin told the süddeutsche zeitung , " the us as usual has problems with such multilateral commitments " .
in a sign that the us may maintain its rigid stance , us commerce undersecretary grant aldonas told reuters on tuesday that next month ’ s summit may not produce a concrete plan for sustainable development , but still could be a successful breeding ground for new ideas .
trittin sanguine despite differences despite the yawning gap between us and european viewpoints , trittin says he sees hope that a compromise might be reached with the americans .
" once the europeans reach an agreement with the developing countries about access to markets , it will be easier to spur the americans to commit themselves to concrete aims , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung .
after all the us wants to be successful in johannesburg too . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

axel blumenthal -lrb- left -rrb- , head of germany 's largest lesbian and gay association with green party member of parliament volker beck .
germany ’ s constitutional court handed gays and lesbians a victory on wednesday when it rejected conservative arguments and ruled that a law allowing same-sex unions is not in violation of the country ’ s constitution . by a five-to-three vote on wednesday , germany ’ s highest court rejected complaints by three conservative-led federal states that the country ’ s same-sex union law collides with family values enshrined in the constitutition .
in doing so , the judges have given their imprimatur to the law passed in august 2001 that allows gays and lesbians to enter into " registered life partnerships " and enjoy many of the benefits of traditional marriage .
" a victory all the way " was how volker beck , green party politician and driving force behind the partnership law , described the court ’ s ruling , which rejected out of hand the complaints brought forward by bavaria , saxony and thuringia .
the three states had argued that same-sex partnerships would prove deleterious to marriages between a man and a woman , which enjoy special protections in the country ’ s constitution .
the result , they argued , would be fewer children being born .
" we are already having problems due to the fact that we don ’ t have enough children , " said günter beckstein , interior minister of bavaria , said in an interview on german radio before the decision was handed down .
" add to that the fact that we no longer have a clear understanding of traditional marriage and family .
we think that is wrong . "
but the red-robed judges in karlsruhe , where germany ’ s highest court is based , wrote in their 70-page decision that " marriage is neither harmed nor encroached upon by the life partnership law . "
they ruled that marriage and registered partnerships are not directed at the same sections of the population and therefore do not stand in direct " competition " with each other .
new rights the same-sex partnership law , passed in august 2001 , brought germany closer to some of its european neighbors with regards to legal recognition of homosexual relationships .
several scandinavian countries as well as the netherlands , france and portugal all have versions of same-sex union laws on the books .
under the german version gays and lesbians have rights to inheritance and hospital visitation .
they may refuse to testify against their life partner in a court of law and may share a last name if they so choose .
foreigners with german partners will be allowed to remain in country indefinitely .
however , same-sex couples can not adopt children , nor do they have the tax advantages enjoyed by heterosexual spouses .
in order to get last year ’ s legislation passed and avoid the conservative-controlled bundesrat , the upper house of parliament which must approve bills concerning financial affairs of the states , partnership proponents split the law in two , leaving the tax question for a later day .
that day may be approaching , since the judges ’ ruling on tuesday can be interpreted as giving the green light for passage of tax benefits for same-sex couples .
the " protection of marriage " in the constitution , the judges wrote , " does not mean that marriage must be protected more than other forms of life partnership . "
the green party ’ s volker beck has announced he will move forward on the tax question .
conservative reaction edmund stoiber , premier of bavaria and candidate for chancellor in this fall ’ s elections , said he regretted the court ’ s decision , but added that in the event that his conservative union coalition wins on september 22nd , it will not challenge the law .
even so , the law would not have much support from such a government .
the woman seen as the probable family minister in a stoiber government , unmarried mother katherina reiche , has publicly come out against the partnership law .
stoiber has said he will vigorously fight attempts to grant gay and lesbian couples the same tax advantages heterosexual couples enjoy .
the catholic church , which vigorously fought the law last year before its adoption , has also expressed regret over the court ’ s ruling .
the head of the german bishops ’ conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the result of wednesday ’ s decision would mean the institution of marriage would suffer , and with it , society as a whole .
rush to the altar ?
there are an estimated 47 000 same-sex couples in germany , of those about 4,500 have already tied the knot and become registered partners .
according to volker beck , part of the reason more have not done so has been the insecurity they have felt because of the court challenge .
now that has all changed .
" i don ’ t think the wedding registry offices are going to overflowing , " he said in an radio interview , " but the ruling is definitely going to give partnerships a strong push and i think we ’ re going to the numbers of them going up substantially .

they ruled that marriage and registered partnerships are not directed at the same sections of the population and therefore do not stand in direct " competition " with each other .
new rights the same-sex partnership law , passed in august 2001 , brought germany closer to some of its european neighbors with regards to legal recognition of homosexual relationships .
several scandinavian countries as well as the netherlands , france and portugal all have versions of same-sex union laws on the books .
under the german version gays and lesbians have rights to inheritance and hospital visitation .
they may refuse to testify against their life partner in a court of law and may share a last name if they so choose .
foreigners with german partners will be allowed to remain in country indefinitely .
however , same-sex couples can not adopt children , nor do they have the tax advantages enjoyed by heterosexual spouses .
in order to get last year ’ s legislation passed and avoid the conservative-controlled bundesrat , the upper house of parliament which must approve bills concerning financial affairs of the states , partnership proponents split the law in two , leaving the tax question for a later day .
that day may be approaching , since the judges ’ ruling on tuesday can be interpreted as giving the green light for passage of tax benefits for same-sex couples .
the " protection of marriage " in the constitution , the judges wrote , " does not mean that marriage must be protected more than other forms of life partnership . "
the green party ’ s volker beck has announced he will move forward on the tax question .
conservative reaction edmund stoiber , premier of bavaria and candidate for chancellor in this fall ’ s elections , said he regretted the court ’ s decision , but added that in the event that his conservative union coalition wins on september 22nd , it will not challenge the law .
even so , the law would not have much support from such a government .
the woman seen as the probable family minister in a stoiber government , unmarried mother katherina reiche , has publicly come out against the partnership law .
stoiber has said he will vigorously fight attempts to grant gay and lesbian couples the same tax advantages heterosexual couples enjoy .
the catholic church , which vigorously fought the law last year before its adoption , has also expressed regret over the court ’ s ruling .
the head of the german bishops ’ conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the result of wednesday ’ s decision would mean the institution of marriage would suffer , and with it , society as a whole .
rush to the altar ?
there are an estimated 47 000 same-sex couples in germany , of those about 4,500 have already tied the knot and become registered partners .
according to volker beck , part of the reason more have not done so has been the insecurity they have felt because of the court challenge .
now that has all changed .
" i don ’ t think the wedding registry offices are going to overflowing , " he said in an radio interview , " but the ruling is definitely going to give partnerships a strong push and i think we ’ re going to the numbers of them going up substantially .

"
chairman arafat is the legitimately elected leader of palestine , and while he is we will continue to maintain our relations with him " igor ivanov russian foreign minister at a meeting of the quartet in new york to draft a common approach towards middle east peace , leading international representatives made clear their reservations over us policy in the region .
un secretary general kofi annan , russian foreign minister igor ivanov and eu representatives met us secretary of state colin powell as fresh violence erupted in the region .
eight israelis died and at least 20 were injured in an attack outside a jewish settlement , an assault which indicated that israel 's re-occupation of palestinian territories was failing to fulfil its stated aim of providing its citizens with security .
it was the first high profile meeting of the quartet since president george w bush made a new middle east policy statement last month , and it left the us clearly isolated on two key issues .
while mr bush indicated that there should only be a palestinian state after the palestinians got rid of mr arafat - their democratically elected leader - washington 's quartet partners said they would continue to work with him .
" the un still recognises chairman arafat and will continue to deal with him until the palestinians decide otherwise , " said mr annan at a news conference after discussions with mr powell .
his comments were echoed by mr ivanov and the danish foreign minister , per stig moeller , both of whom stressed the need to respect the sovereignty of the palestinian people .
the foreign ministers of jordan and egypt , who met the quartet for separate round of talks , also criticised us attempts to sideline mr arafat .
" the issue is not the person of mr arafat , but the occupation . " said jordanian foreign minister marwan muasher .
sovereignty for some the group also clashed on when to start making moves to resolve the political and economic aspects of the conflict .
mr powell stood firm on president bush 's insistence that israel should not have to make any concessions to the palestinians - such as troop withdrawals or easing economic restrictions - until it was content with the security situation .
he also defended israelis ' right to act as they saw fit in response to violence .
" israel is a sovereign country and will have to reach its own decisions , " said mr powell .
" everything begins with creating a better sense of security . "
mr annan condemned tuesday 's attack on an israeli bus near the entrance to the ultra-orthodox jewish settlement of emmanuel .
but he insisted that palestinians needed to be offered hope if violence was to end , stressing the need to improve living conditions and make steps towards the resumption of negotiations for a palestinian state .
" we all agree that we should work on security but even if the security track gains some traction , unless we show some progress on the other two tracks , they will not work , that will also fail . "
the quartet did however agree that a task-force would meet at the end of august to discuss economic assistance to the palestinians , and that leaders would meet for a fresh round of talks at the un general assembly in september .
they also declared that they wanted to send a cia-led team of international intelligence experts to help with the reform of palestinian security bodies .
but the us rejected a suggestion by eu foreign policy chief javier solana that a mission would be sent out in the next two weeks .

since the beginning of 2002 , the yen has gone up almost 15 % , rising from about 135 yen to the us dollar to less than 116 on wednesday .
sony is not a buy until the yen stops its climb yoshihisa okamoto fuji investment management the relentless appreciation to a 17-month high comes despite concerted action from the bank of japan , which has got its colleagues in europe and the us to join it in selling yen and buying dollars to stem the tide .
but so far the action has had little effect , and exporters - a category which includes most of japan 's most famous corporations - are worried as a result .
dollar in decline the trouble with the yen is not so much a question of japan 's economy becoming more popular with investors as a case of the dollar finally losing its allure .
the rash of corporate scandals sweeping the us has combined with worries about the strength of the recovery there and weakening consumer confidence .
the result is that overseas investors are not putting their money in the us as once they did .
sony is just one exporter in the rising yen firing line attempts by federal reserve chairman alan greenspan to calm things by stressing the underlying strength of the us recovery have come to naught .
aside from japan , europe has also seen its currency strengthen sharply , again on dollar weakness rather than euro strength .
looking for the silver lining not everyone is so concerned about the knock-on effects .
in the regular monthly economic outlook released on wednesday , the bank of japan - which has now intervened seven times this year - upgraded its assessment for the fifth straight month , saying the economy had practically levelled out .
" japan 's economy , despite continued weakness in domestic demand , has almost stabilised as a whole , with an increasing upward impetus from exports and production , and an improvement in corporate profits and business sentiment , " it said .
but as well as pointing out the risk of unemployment and of weak capital spending , it issued a veiled warning about the danger from the yen .
" it should be heeded that further destabilisation in the foreign exchange and financial markets at home and abroad would easily exert a negative influence on the economy , " it said .
exporters in trouble what that means is that companies such as electronics giant sony are struggling to cope with the fact that their prices overseas are now almost one-sixth higher than they were in january .
in sony 's case , the pressure has driven its shares down to a low for the year , falling 5 % just on wednesday .
for every one-yen drop in the value of the dollar , sony - two-thirds of whose sales come from exports - says it loses 8bn yen in operating profit .
" i think sony 's decline can be attributed mainly to the rise in the yen , " said fuji investment management senior vice-president yoshihisa okamoto .

union officials said there would still be solid support for the first one-day stoppage of several planned for england , wales and northern ireland .

it is already illegal to mislead an auditor , but in theory the law imposes no obligation beyond that .
in contrast , the new proposals - outlined in a white paper on tuesday - impose a duty to offer any information that might be relevant , and gives auditors the right to demand data .
government ministers are planning to meet with accountants and regulators on wednesday to discuss the proposed changes .
could it happen here ?
the moves follow a four-year review , but the need for reform of britain 's creaking company laws has come into sharp relief following the wave of accounting scandals in the us .
the hope is that by changing the rules , the chances of an enron , a worldcom or a tyco happening here could be reduced .
lawmakers in the us are now falling over themselves to increase criminal penalties for corporate bad behaviour , with the senate taking the maximum term for cooking the books to 10 years and the house of representatives pushing for 20 .
it remains to be seen , however , whether these moves will have much practical effect , since very few executives are ever prosecuted .
civil suits are usually more successful .
making it easier in general , uk industry officials have welcomed the proposed changes - which would also be expected to reduce the bureaucratic burden faced by firms .
the white paper from the department of trade and industry envisages slimming down reporting requirements on small businesses , allowing them to drop both the institution of the annual meeting and the post of company secretary as long as all shareholers agree .
about 15,000 firms will also be allowed to simplfy their accounts , thanks to a rise in the threshold for being defined as a small business from £ 2.8m to £ 4.8m , the european union maximum .
