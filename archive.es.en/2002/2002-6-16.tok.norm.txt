the baton was snatched as wrexham runner daniel wilkinson passed through the town of connah 's quay , in north wales , on saturday afternoon .
the man arrested by police has been charged with using threating , insulting and abusive language and behaviour , following the incident outside the boathouse public house .
he was arrested by a hampshire police officer - who was on security duty during the relay - and then handed over to north wales police .
he was questioned at mold police station before being charged .
the high-tech baton , fitted with sensors which monitor the runner 's pulse , before transforming it into a blade of blue light , is making its way around the commonwealth as part of the queen 's golden jubilee celebrations .
a north wales police spokesman said : " a man took the baton from one of the runners .
" he was arrested at the scene by police and members of the public and the baton was recovered from him .
" the relay continued without further incident . "
queen 's jubilee baton relay spokeswoman jackie brock-doyle said she suspected over-excitement on the day of england 's world cup win over denmark had something to do with it .
" one of the people in the crowd came out and grabbed the baton but security guards were there immediately and the runner was fine , " she said .
" i think it was probably high jinks by people who had been watching the football . "
the queen 's jubilee baton relay started at buckingham palace on 11 march and has travelled to canada , the caribbean , africa , australasia , asia and europe before arriving in belfast for the uk leg on 6 june .

" we are now free to develop , test and deploy effective defences against missile attack from states like north korea and iran , " us deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz wrote in a letter published in the wall street journal .
