the decision has stalled chancellor schröder ’ s flagship immigration law aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for foreigners to work and live in germany .
the law , which was set to take effect on jan 1 , 2003 , also included provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad and a range of measures to help foreigners integrate into german society from language to citizenship courses .
the new bill would have also made it easier for foreign students educated at universities in germany to stay on , and easier for self-employed foreigners to work in germany .
at present about 7.3 million foreigners live in germany , representing 9 percent of the country ’ s population of 82 million .
conservatives get their way the reason for the present overturning of the bill is a dispute over procedural irregularities in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , that represents the states on national matters .
in march this year , the bill ran into trouble in the bundesrat when two representatives from the state of brandenburg casted two conflicting votes instead of the one unified vote constitutionally allowed per state .
after a tumultuous debate , the bill was finally passed by the bundesrat , but with the opposition christian democrats crying foul .
a month later , german president , johannes rau signed the politically and legally controversial immigration bill into law , but he made it clear he expected the constitutional court to rule on its legality. in july , six conservative-led state governments asked the highest court to examine the issue , insisting that the vote in the bundesrat was illegal – a view now shared by the constitutional court .
social democrats determined to give bill another shot though the constitutional court ’ s verdict is a blow to the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , the spd has vowed to give the bill another go and salvage it .
dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy spokesman of the spd parliamentary group , said , " we will reintroduce this bill .
if it should fail , it won ’ t be because of the content , but it will fail for procedural reasons . "
german interior minister otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- , whose mandate also covers immigration said he was disappointed about the court ’ s decision , but emphasized that the decision only referred to the passage of the bill , not its contents .
" the law is well accepted in all social groups .
it ’ s after all a very good and balanced law .
and the opposition has also indicated that they want to renew negotiations over it . "
conservative opposition ready to negotiate indeed , germany ’ s conservative opposition , comprising the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have signaled their readiness to return to the negotiating table with the government and talk about the new immigration bill .
however , the conservatives , whose strong opposition to certain aspects of the bill is well known , are expected to insist that the government must now take on board its proposed changes to the bill .
one sticking point concerns foreign workers in germany .
wolfgang bosbach , of the cdu said , " we must not generally broaden the german labor market for immigrant workers .
so we must not lift the restrictions on recruiting them . "
opposition fears foreigners will flood the labor market the fear of being swamped by foreign workers at a time when german unemployment is hovering around the 4 million mark is a fear that the opposition have repeatedly voiced and even exploited .
the bavarian interior minister , günther beckstein , said that a new law must , in the face of 4 million unemployed germans , " limit and steer immigration " .
two years ago , when chancellor schröder launched a scheme to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts , conservative politicians were vocal in denouncing the move .
jürgen rüttgers , the cdu leader of north rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state , launched a campaign , kinder statt inder -lrb- children , not indians -rrb- , meaning that germans should have more children instead of relying on workers from abroad .
he was backed by edmund stoiber , state premier of bavaria , who suggested that the current rate of child benefits should be tripled .
practical necessity might make immigration inevitable while many germans may still be reluctant to see their country as a multicultural one , reality might demand otherwise .
for years , demographers have been insisting that germany ’ s rapidly aging population and falling birth rates are ticking time bombs that could trigger a major financial crisis in the country ’ s overstretched pensions and welfare systems if measures are not taken to counter it .
some argue that germany will need 260,000 immigrants a year for the next 20 years just to keep its present population and social systems stable .
another bigger fear is one often voiced by industry and business leaders , who insist that the german economy is in desperate need of highly-qualified and skilled workers .
on wednesday , the president of the confederation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , michael rogowski , said in a newspaper interview , " those who think that a modern immigration law can be postponed on the long-term in the face of poor economic growth and labor market prospects , are mistaken . "
rogowski said that germany faced a severe crunch particularly of scientists and engineers and that highly-qualified foreigners were badly needed in the fields .
" germany needs clear immigration regulations , which simultaneously facilitate the immigration of highly-qualified labor and prevents an increase in the social-outcasts . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's top court to decide on immigration law earlier this year , germany 's conservative opposition turned to the country 's highest court in an attempt to nullify the first law governing immigration .
on wednesday , the court is expected to announce its decision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.12.2002 germany 's immigration law comes to grinding halt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is going to be one long wait germany ’ s highest court has put the brakes on chancellor schröder ’ s first ever immigration law for germany that was to come into force early next year , much to the delight of the conservative opposition . in a quick decision on wednesday , the german federal constitutional court in karlsruhe ruled that germany ’ s first-ever law governing immigration was unconstitutional and therefore nullified .
the decision has stalled chancellor schröder ’ s flagship immigration law aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for foreigners to work and live in germany .
the law , which was set to take effect on jan 1 , 2003 , also included provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad and a range of measures to help foreigners integrate into german society from language to citizenship courses .
the new bill would have also made it easier for foreign students educated at universities in germany to stay on , and easier for self-employed foreigners to work in germany .
at present about 7.3 million foreigners live in germany , representing 9 percent of the country ’ s population of 82 million .
conservatives get their way the reason for the present overturning of the bill is a dispute over procedural irregularities in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , that represents the states on national matters .
in march this year , the bill ran into trouble in the bundesrat when two representatives from the state of brandenburg casted two conflicting votes instead of the one unified vote constitutionally allowed per state .
after a tumultuous debate , the bill was finally passed by the bundesrat , but with the opposition christian democrats crying foul .
a month later , german president , johannes rau signed the politically and legally controversial immigration bill into law , but he made it clear he expected the constitutional court to rule on its legality. in july , six conservative-led state governments asked the highest court to examine the issue , insisting that the vote in the bundesrat was illegal – a view now shared by the constitutional court .
social democrats determined to give bill another shot though the constitutional court ’ s verdict is a blow to the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , the spd has vowed to give the bill another go and salvage it .
dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy spokesman of the spd parliamentary group , said , " we will reintroduce this bill .
if it should fail , it won ’ t be because of the content , but it will fail for procedural reasons . "
german interior minister otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- , whose mandate also covers immigration said he was disappointed about the court ’ s decision , but emphasized that the decision only referred to the passage of the bill , not its contents .
" the law is well accepted in all social groups .
it ’ s after all a very good and balanced law .
and the opposition has also indicated that they want to renew negotiations over it . "
conservative opposition ready to negotiate indeed , germany ’ s conservative opposition , comprising the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have signaled their readiness to return to the negotiating table with the government and talk about the new immigration bill .
however , the conservatives , whose strong opposition to certain aspects of the bill is well known , are expected to insist that the government must now take on board its proposed changes to the bill .
one sticking point concerns foreign workers in germany .
wolfgang bosbach , of the cdu said , " we must not generally broaden the german labor market for immigrant workers .
so we must not lift the restrictions on recruiting them . "
opposition fears foreigners will flood the labor market the fear of being swamped by foreign workers at a time when german unemployment is hovering around the 4 million mark is a fear that the opposition have repeatedly voiced and even exploited .
the bavarian interior minister , günther beckstein , said that a new law must , in the face of 4 million unemployed germans , " limit and steer immigration " .
two years ago , when chancellor schröder launched a scheme to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts , conservative politicians were vocal in denouncing the move .
jürgen rüttgers , the cdu leader of north rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state , launched a campaign , kinder statt inder -lrb- children , not indians -rrb- , meaning that germans should have more children instead of relying on workers from abroad .
he was backed by edmund stoiber , state premier of bavaria , who suggested that the current rate of child benefits should be tripled .
practical necessity might make immigration inevitable while many germans may still be reluctant to see their country as a multicultural one , reality might demand otherwise .
for years , demographers have been insisting that germany ’ s rapidly aging population and falling birth rates are ticking time bombs that could trigger a major financial crisis in the country ’ s overstretched pensions and welfare systems if measures are not taken to counter it .
some argue that germany will need 260,000 immigrants a year for the next 20 years just to keep its present population and social systems stable .
another bigger fear is one often voiced by industry and business leaders , who insist that the german economy is in desperate need of highly-qualified and skilled workers .
on wednesday , the president of the confederation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , michael rogowski , said in a newspaper interview , " those who think that a modern immigration law can be postponed on the long-term in the face of poor economic growth and labor market prospects , are mistaken . "
rogowski said that germany faced a severe crunch particularly of scientists and engineers and that highly-qualified foreigners were badly needed in the fields .
" germany needs clear immigration regulations , which simultaneously facilitate the immigration of highly-qualified labor and prevents an increase in the social-outcasts . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's top court to decide on immigration law earlier this year , germany 's conservative opposition turned to the country 's highest court in an attempt to nullify the first law governing immigration .

the decision has stalled chancellor schröder ’ s flagship immigration law aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for foreigners to work and live in germany .
the law , which was set to take effect on jan 1 , 2003 , also included provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad and a range of measures to help foreigners integrate into german society from language to citizenship courses .
the new bill would have also made it easier for foreign students educated at universities in germany to stay on , and easier for self-employed foreigners to work in germany .
at present about 7.3 million foreigners live in germany , representing 9 percent of the country ’ s population of 82 million .
conservatives get their way the reason for the present overturning of the bill is a dispute over procedural irregularities in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , that represents the states on national matters .
in march this year , the bill ran into trouble in the bundesrat when two representatives from the state of brandenburg casted two conflicting votes instead of the one unified vote constitutionally allowed per state .
after a tumultuous debate , the bill was finally passed by the bundesrat , but with the opposition christian democrats crying foul .
a month later , german president , johannes rau signed the politically and legally controversial immigration bill into law , but he made it clear he expected the constitutional court to rule on its legality. in july , six conservative-led state governments asked the highest court to examine the issue , insisting that the vote in the bundesrat was illegal – a view now shared by the constitutional court .
social democrats determined to give bill another shot though the constitutional court ’ s verdict is a blow to the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , the spd has vowed to give the bill another go and salvage it .
dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy spokesman of the spd parliamentary group , said , " we will reintroduce this bill .
if it should fail , it won ’ t be because of the content , but it will fail for procedural reasons . "
german interior minister otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- , whose mandate also covers immigration said he was disappointed about the court ’ s decision , but emphasized that the decision only referred to the passage of the bill , not its contents .
" the law is well accepted in all social groups .
it ’ s after all a very good and balanced law .
and the opposition has also indicated that they want to renew negotiations over it . "
conservative opposition ready to negotiate indeed , germany ’ s conservative opposition , comprising the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have signaled their readiness to return to the negotiating table with the government and talk about the new immigration bill .
however , the conservatives , whose strong opposition to certain aspects of the bill is well known , are expected to insist that the government must now take on board its proposed changes to the bill .
one sticking point concerns foreign workers in germany .
wolfgang bosbach , of the cdu said , " we must not generally broaden the german labor market for immigrant workers .
so we must not lift the restrictions on recruiting them . "
opposition fears foreigners will flood the labor market the fear of being swamped by foreign workers at a time when german unemployment is hovering around the 4 million mark is a fear that the opposition have repeatedly voiced and even exploited .
the bavarian interior minister , günther beckstein , said that a new law must , in the face of 4 million unemployed germans , " limit and steer immigration " .
two years ago , when chancellor schröder launched a scheme to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts , conservative politicians were vocal in denouncing the move .
jürgen rüttgers , the cdu leader of north rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state , launched a campaign , kinder statt inder -lrb- children , not indians -rrb- , meaning that germans should have more children instead of relying on workers from abroad .
he was backed by edmund stoiber , state premier of bavaria , who suggested that the current rate of child benefits should be tripled .
practical necessity might make immigration inevitable while many germans may still be reluctant to see their country as a multicultural one , reality might demand otherwise .
for years , demographers have been insisting that germany ’ s rapidly aging population and falling birth rates are ticking time bombs that could trigger a major financial crisis in the country ’ s overstretched pensions and welfare systems if measures are not taken to counter it .
some argue that germany will need 260,000 immigrants a year for the next 20 years just to keep its present population and social systems stable .
another bigger fear is one often voiced by industry and business leaders , who insist that the german economy is in desperate need of highly-qualified and skilled workers .
on wednesday , the president of the confederation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , michael rogowski , said in a newspaper interview , " those who think that a modern immigration law can be postponed on the long-term in the face of poor economic growth and labor market prospects , are mistaken . "
rogowski said that germany faced a severe crunch particularly of scientists and engineers and that highly-qualified foreigners were badly needed in the fields .
" germany needs clear immigration regulations , which simultaneously facilitate the immigration of highly-qualified labor and prevents an increase in the social-outcasts .

the law , which was set to take effect on jan 1 , 2003 , also included provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad and a range of measures to help foreigners integrate into german society from language to citizenship courses .
the new bill would have also made it easier for foreign students educated at universities in germany to stay on , and easier for self-employed foreigners to work in germany .
at present about 7.3 million foreigners live in germany , representing 9 percent of the country ’ s population of 82 million .
conservatives get their way the reason for the present overturning of the bill is a dispute over procedural irregularities in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , that represents the states on national matters .
in march this year , the bill ran into trouble in the bundesrat when two representatives from the state of brandenburg casted two conflicting votes instead of the one unified vote constitutionally allowed per state .
after a tumultuous debate , the bill was finally passed by the bundesrat , but with the opposition christian democrats crying foul .
a month later , german president , johannes rau signed the politically and legally controversial immigration bill into law , but he made it clear he expected the constitutional court to rule on its legality. in july , six conservative-led state governments asked the highest court to examine the issue , insisting that the vote in the bundesrat was illegal – a view now shared by the constitutional court .
social democrats determined to give bill another shot though the constitutional court ’ s verdict is a blow to the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , the spd has vowed to give the bill another go and salvage it .
dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy spokesman of the spd parliamentary group , said , " we will reintroduce this bill .
if it should fail , it won ’ t be because of the content , but it will fail for procedural reasons . "
german interior minister otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- , whose mandate also covers immigration said he was disappointed about the court ’ s decision , but emphasized that the decision only referred to the passage of the bill , not its contents .
" the law is well accepted in all social groups .
it ’ s after all a very good and balanced law .
and the opposition has also indicated that they want to renew negotiations over it . "
conservative opposition ready to negotiate indeed , germany ’ s conservative opposition , comprising the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have signaled their readiness to return to the negotiating table with the government and talk about the new immigration bill .
however , the conservatives , whose strong opposition to certain aspects of the bill is well known , are expected to insist that the government must now take on board its proposed changes to the bill .
one sticking point concerns foreign workers in germany .
wolfgang bosbach , of the cdu said , " we must not generally broaden the german labor market for immigrant workers .
so we must not lift the restrictions on recruiting them . "
opposition fears foreigners will flood the labor market the fear of being swamped by foreign workers at a time when german unemployment is hovering around the 4 million mark is a fear that the opposition have repeatedly voiced and even exploited .
the bavarian interior minister , günther beckstein , said that a new law must , in the face of 4 million unemployed germans , " limit and steer immigration " .
two years ago , when chancellor schröder launched a scheme to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts , conservative politicians were vocal in denouncing the move .
jürgen rüttgers , the cdu leader of north rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state , launched a campaign , kinder statt inder -lrb- children , not indians -rrb- , meaning that germans should have more children instead of relying on workers from abroad .
he was backed by edmund stoiber , state premier of bavaria , who suggested that the current rate of child benefits should be tripled .
practical necessity might make immigration inevitable while many germans may still be reluctant to see their country as a multicultural one , reality might demand otherwise .
for years , demographers have been insisting that germany ’ s rapidly aging population and falling birth rates are ticking time bombs that could trigger a major financial crisis in the country ’ s overstretched pensions and welfare systems if measures are not taken to counter it .
some argue that germany will need 260,000 immigrants a year for the next 20 years just to keep its present population and social systems stable .
another bigger fear is one often voiced by industry and business leaders , who insist that the german economy is in desperate need of highly-qualified and skilled workers .
on wednesday , the president of the confederation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , michael rogowski , said in a newspaper interview , " those who think that a modern immigration law can be postponed on the long-term in the face of poor economic growth and labor market prospects , are mistaken . "
rogowski said that germany faced a severe crunch particularly of scientists and engineers and that highly-qualified foreigners were badly needed in the fields .
" germany needs clear immigration regulations , which simultaneously facilitate the immigration of highly-qualified labor and prevents an increase in the social-outcasts . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's top court to decide on immigration law earlier this year , germany 's conservative opposition turned to the country 's highest court in an attempt to nullify the first law governing immigration .
on wednesday , the court is expected to announce its decision .

conservative opposition ready to negotiate indeed , germany ’ s conservative opposition , comprising the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have signaled their readiness to return to the negotiating table with the government and talk about the new immigration bill .
however , the conservatives , whose strong opposition to certain aspects of the bill is well known , are expected to insist that the government must now take on board its proposed changes to the bill .
one sticking point concerns foreign workers in germany .
wolfgang bosbach , of the cdu said , " we must not generally broaden the german labor market for immigrant workers .
so we must not lift the restrictions on recruiting them . "
opposition fears foreigners will flood the labor market the fear of being swamped by foreign workers at a time when german unemployment is hovering around the 4 million mark is a fear that the opposition have repeatedly voiced and even exploited .
the bavarian interior minister , günther beckstein , said that a new law must , in the face of 4 million unemployed germans , " limit and steer immigration " .
two years ago , when chancellor schröder launched a scheme to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts , conservative politicians were vocal in denouncing the move .
jürgen rüttgers , the cdu leader of north rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state , launched a campaign , kinder statt inder -lrb- children , not indians -rrb- , meaning that germans should have more children instead of relying on workers from abroad .
he was backed by edmund stoiber , state premier of bavaria , who suggested that the current rate of child benefits should be tripled .
practical necessity might make immigration inevitable while many germans may still be reluctant to see their country as a multicultural one , reality might demand otherwise .
for years , demographers have been insisting that germany ’ s rapidly aging population and falling birth rates are ticking time bombs that could trigger a major financial crisis in the country ’ s overstretched pensions and welfare systems if measures are not taken to counter it .
some argue that germany will need 260,000 immigrants a year for the next 20 years just to keep its present population and social systems stable .
another bigger fear is one often voiced by industry and business leaders , who insist that the german economy is in desperate need of highly-qualified and skilled workers .
on wednesday , the president of the confederation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , michael rogowski , said in a newspaper interview , " those who think that a modern immigration law can be postponed on the long-term in the face of poor economic growth and labor market prospects , are mistaken . "
rogowski said that germany faced a severe crunch particularly of scientists and engineers and that highly-qualified foreigners were badly needed in the fields .

the decision has stalled chancellor schröder ’ s flagship immigration law aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for foreigners to work and live in germany .
the law , which was set to take effect on jan 1 , 2003 , also included provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad and a range of measures to help foreigners integrate into german society from language to citizenship courses .
the new bill would have also made it easier for foreign students educated at universities in germany to stay on , and easier for self-employed foreigners to work in germany .
at present about 7.3 million foreigners live in germany , representing 9 percent of the country ’ s population of 82 million .
conservatives get their way the reason for the present overturning of the bill is a dispute over procedural irregularities in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , that represents the states on national matters .
in march this year , the bill ran into trouble in the bundesrat when two representatives from the state of brandenburg casted two conflicting votes instead of the one unified vote constitutionally allowed per state .
after a tumultuous debate , the bill was finally passed by the bundesrat , but with the opposition christian democrats crying foul .
a month later , german president , johannes rau signed the politically and legally controversial immigration bill into law , but he made it clear he expected the constitutional court to rule on its legality. in july , six conservative-led state governments asked the highest court to examine the issue , insisting that the vote in the bundesrat was illegal – a view now shared by the constitutional court .
social democrats determined to give bill another shot though the constitutional court ’ s verdict is a blow to the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , the spd has vowed to give the bill another go and salvage it .
dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy spokesman of the spd parliamentary group , said , " we will reintroduce this bill .
if it should fail , it won ’ t be because of the content , but it will fail for procedural reasons . "
german interior minister otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- , whose mandate also covers immigration said he was disappointed about the court ’ s decision , but emphasized that the decision only referred to the passage of the bill , not its contents .
" the law is well accepted in all social groups .

the decision has stalled chancellor schröder ’ s flagship immigration law aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for foreigners to work and live in germany .
the law , which was set to take effect on jan 1 , 2003 , also included provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad and a range of measures to help foreigners integrate into german society from language to citizenship courses .
the new bill would have also made it easier for foreign students educated at universities in germany to stay on , and easier for self-employed foreigners to work in germany .
at present about 7.3 million foreigners live in germany , representing 9 percent of the country ’ s population of 82 million .
conservatives get their way the reason for the present overturning of the bill is a dispute over procedural irregularities in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , that represents the states on national matters .
in march this year , the bill ran into trouble in the bundesrat when two representatives from the state of brandenburg casted two conflicting votes instead of the one unified vote constitutionally allowed per state .
after a tumultuous debate , the bill was finally passed by the bundesrat , but with the opposition christian democrats crying foul .
a month later , german president , johannes rau signed the politically and legally controversial immigration bill into law , but he made it clear he expected the constitutional court to rule on its legality. in july , six conservative-led state governments asked the highest court to examine the issue , insisting that the vote in the bundesrat was illegal – a view now shared by the constitutional court .
social democrats determined to give bill another shot though the constitutional court ’ s verdict is a blow to the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , the spd has vowed to give the bill another go and salvage it .
dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy spokesman of the spd parliamentary group , said , " we will reintroduce this bill .
if it should fail , it won ’ t be because of the content , but it will fail for procedural reasons . "
german interior minister otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- , whose mandate also covers immigration said he was disappointed about the court ’ s decision , but emphasized that the decision only referred to the passage of the bill , not its contents .
" the law is well accepted in all social groups .
it ’ s after all a very good and balanced law .
and the opposition has also indicated that they want to renew negotiations over it . "
conservative opposition ready to negotiate indeed , germany ’ s conservative opposition , comprising the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have signaled their readiness to return to the negotiating table with the government and talk about the new immigration bill .
however , the conservatives , whose strong opposition to certain aspects of the bill is well known , are expected to insist that the government must now take on board its proposed changes to the bill .
one sticking point concerns foreign workers in germany .
wolfgang bosbach , of the cdu said , " we must not generally broaden the german labor market for immigrant workers .
so we must not lift the restrictions on recruiting them . "
opposition fears foreigners will flood the labor market the fear of being swamped by foreign workers at a time when german unemployment is hovering around the 4 million mark is a fear that the opposition have repeatedly voiced and even exploited .
the bavarian interior minister , günther beckstein , said that a new law must , in the face of 4 million unemployed germans , " limit and steer immigration " .
two years ago , when chancellor schröder launched a scheme to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts , conservative politicians were vocal in denouncing the move .
jürgen rüttgers , the cdu leader of north rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state , launched a campaign , kinder statt inder -lrb- children , not indians -rrb- , meaning that germans should have more children instead of relying on workers from abroad .
he was backed by edmund stoiber , state premier of bavaria , who suggested that the current rate of child benefits should be tripled .
practical necessity might make immigration inevitable while many germans may still be reluctant to see their country as a multicultural one , reality might demand otherwise .
for years , demographers have been insisting that germany ’ s rapidly aging population and falling birth rates are ticking time bombs that could trigger a major financial crisis in the country ’ s overstretched pensions and welfare systems if measures are not taken to counter it .
some argue that germany will need 260,000 immigrants a year for the next 20 years just to keep its present population and social systems stable .
another bigger fear is one often voiced by industry and business leaders , who insist that the german economy is in desperate need of highly-qualified and skilled workers .
on wednesday , the president of the confederation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , michael rogowski , said in a newspaper interview , " those who think that a modern immigration law can be postponed on the long-term in the face of poor economic growth and labor market prospects , are mistaken . "

the decision has stalled chancellor schröder ’ s flagship immigration law aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for foreigners to work and live in germany .
the law , which was set to take effect on jan 1 , 2003 , also included provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad and a range of measures to help foreigners integrate into german society from language to citizenship courses .
the new bill would have also made it easier for foreign students educated at universities in germany to stay on , and easier for self-employed foreigners to work in germany .
at present about 7.3 million foreigners live in germany , representing 9 percent of the country ’ s population of 82 million .
conservatives get their way the reason for the present overturning of the bill is a dispute over procedural irregularities in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , that represents the states on national matters .
in march this year , the bill ran into trouble in the bundesrat when two representatives from the state of brandenburg casted two conflicting votes instead of the one unified vote constitutionally allowed per state .
after a tumultuous debate , the bill was finally passed by the bundesrat , but with the opposition christian democrats crying foul .
a month later , german president , johannes rau signed the politically and legally controversial immigration bill into law , but he made it clear he expected the constitutional court to rule on its legality. in july , six conservative-led state governments asked the highest court to examine the issue , insisting that the vote in the bundesrat was illegal – a view now shared by the constitutional court .
social democrats determined to give bill another shot though the constitutional court ’ s verdict is a blow to the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , the spd has vowed to give the bill another go and salvage it .
dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy spokesman of the spd parliamentary group , said , " we will reintroduce this bill .
if it should fail , it won ’ t be because of the content , but it will fail for procedural reasons . "
german interior minister otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- , whose mandate also covers immigration said he was disappointed about the court ’ s decision , but emphasized that the decision only referred to the passage of the bill , not its contents .
" the law is well accepted in all social groups .
it ’ s after all a very good and balanced law .
and the opposition has also indicated that they want to renew negotiations over it . "
conservative opposition ready to negotiate indeed , germany ’ s conservative opposition , comprising the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have signaled their readiness to return to the negotiating table with the government and talk about the new immigration bill .
however , the conservatives , whose strong opposition to certain aspects of the bill is well known , are expected to insist that the government must now take on board its proposed changes to the bill .
one sticking point concerns foreign workers in germany .
wolfgang bosbach , of the cdu said , " we must not generally broaden the german labor market for immigrant workers .
so we must not lift the restrictions on recruiting them . "
opposition fears foreigners will flood the labor market the fear of being swamped by foreign workers at a time when german unemployment is hovering around the 4 million mark is a fear that the opposition have repeatedly voiced and even exploited .
the bavarian interior minister , günther beckstein , said that a new law must , in the face of 4 million unemployed germans , " limit and steer immigration " .
two years ago , when chancellor schröder launched a scheme to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts , conservative politicians were vocal in denouncing the move .
jürgen rüttgers , the cdu leader of north rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state , launched a campaign , kinder statt inder -lrb- children , not indians -rrb- , meaning that germans should have more children instead of relying on workers from abroad .
he was backed by edmund stoiber , state premier of bavaria , who suggested that the current rate of child benefits should be tripled .
practical necessity might make immigration inevitable while many germans may still be reluctant to see their country as a multicultural one , reality might demand otherwise .
for years , demographers have been insisting that germany ’ s rapidly aging population and falling birth rates are ticking time bombs that could trigger a major financial crisis in the country ’ s overstretched pensions and welfare systems if measures are not taken to counter it .
some argue that germany will need 260,000 immigrants a year for the next 20 years just to keep its present population and social systems stable .
another bigger fear is one often voiced by industry and business leaders , who insist that the german economy is in desperate need of highly-qualified and skilled workers .
on wednesday , the president of the confederation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , michael rogowski , said in a newspaper interview , " those who think that a modern immigration law can be postponed on the long-term in the face of poor economic growth and labor market prospects , are mistaken . "
rogowski said that germany faced a severe crunch particularly of scientists and engineers and that highly-qualified foreigners were badly needed in the fields .
" germany needs clear immigration regulations , which simultaneously facilitate the immigration of highly-qualified labor and prevents an increase in the social-outcasts . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's top court to decide on immigration law earlier this year , germany 's conservative opposition turned to the country 's highest court in an attempt to nullify the first law governing immigration .
on wednesday , the court is expected to announce its decision .

conservative opposition ready to negotiate indeed , germany ’ s conservative opposition , comprising the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have signaled their readiness to return to the negotiating table with the government and talk about the new immigration bill .
however , the conservatives , whose strong opposition to certain aspects of the bill is well known , are expected to insist that the government must now take on board its proposed changes to the bill .
one sticking point concerns foreign workers in germany .
wolfgang bosbach , of the cdu said , " we must not generally broaden the german labor market for immigrant workers .
so we must not lift the restrictions on recruiting them . "
opposition fears foreigners will flood the labor market the fear of being swamped by foreign workers at a time when german unemployment is hovering around the 4 million mark is a fear that the opposition have repeatedly voiced and even exploited .
the bavarian interior minister , günther beckstein , said that a new law must , in the face of 4 million unemployed germans , " limit and steer immigration " .
two years ago , when chancellor schröder launched a scheme to give permits to up to 20,000 computer specialists from india and central europe to work in germany on five-year contracts , conservative politicians were vocal in denouncing the move .
jürgen rüttgers , the cdu leader of north rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state , launched a campaign , kinder statt inder -lrb- children , not indians -rrb- , meaning that germans should have more children instead of relying on workers from abroad .
he was backed by edmund stoiber , state premier of bavaria , who suggested that the current rate of child benefits should be tripled .
practical necessity might make immigration inevitable while many germans may still be reluctant to see their country as a multicultural one , reality might demand otherwise .
for years , demographers have been insisting that germany ’ s rapidly aging population and falling birth rates are ticking time bombs that could trigger a major financial crisis in the country ’ s overstretched pensions and welfare systems if measures are not taken to counter it .
some argue that germany will need 260,000 immigrants a year for the next 20 years just to keep its present population and social systems stable .
another bigger fear is one often voiced by industry and business leaders , who insist that the german economy is in desperate need of highly-qualified and skilled workers .
on wednesday , the president of the confederation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , michael rogowski , said in a newspaper interview , " those who think that a modern immigration law can be postponed on the long-term in the face of poor economic growth and labor market prospects , are mistaken . "
rogowski said that germany faced a severe crunch particularly of scientists and engineers and that highly-qualified foreigners were badly needed in the fields .
" germany needs clear immigration regulations , which simultaneously facilitate the immigration of highly-qualified labor and prevents an increase in the social-outcasts . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's top court to decide on immigration law earlier this year , germany 's conservative opposition turned to the country 's highest court in an attempt to nullify the first law governing immigration .
on wednesday , the court is expected to announce its decision .

the most complaints were made against the lothian and borders force , and the least in dumfries and galloway .
the figures were compiled by the accounts commission for scotland .
across the country there were 1,608 complaints against police last year , the first year that all complaints were recorded .
this equated to just over 20 complaints for every 100 officers , the commission said .
the nationwide total excluded strathclyde , whose figures were said to be " unreliable " .
in lothian and borders there were 28 complaints per 100 officers - a total of 726 complaints .
but only 10 per 100 officers , or 51 complaints , were received in dumfries and galloway .
the excluded " unreliable " data for strathclyde gave a force total of 1,173 complaints , or 16 complaints per 100 officers .
' actively encouraging ' the statistics were published as part of a series of regular reports by the accounts commission on whether public bodies were providing value for money .
meanwhile the figures suggest the number of racist incidents reported to scottish police forces last year was 3,115 , an increase of 410 or 15 % on the year before .
that number would increase since scottish police forces were " actively encouraging " the reporting of racial incidents , the report added .
strathclyde police in july drew up plans to classify information gained in complaints against officers as confidential .
the force 's joint police board made a formal request to the scottish executive asking for legislation on the issue .
freedom of information campaigners described the plans as " draconian " .

the aircraft carrier ark royal is to lead a naval taskforce sailing towards the gulf next month , on their way to " long-planned " exercises in the indian ocean . "
it seems that saddam hussein has decided to continue the pretence that iraq has had no wnd programme " jack straw contingency plans are in place to divert the vessels for war with iraq if necessary , according to the ministry of defence .
a first order for a ship to carry military supplies to the gulf has also been placed by the mod .
the threat of war grew stronger as tony blair , mr straw and us president george w bush expressed doubts about saddam hussein 's declaration on iraq 's weapons programmes .
but a shortage of merchant ships and loss of maritime skills could undermine britain 's role in any military action against iraq , according to the union numast .
bbc correspondent stephen cape said the mod may have to use foreign-flagged or foreign crewed ships which would pose a security risk .
since the falklands war the number of 500 gross tonne ships has dropped by 700 , the union said .
defence secretary geoff hoon told mps the government would consider sending extra naval resources to the gulf in the new year if needed .
but bbc correspondent andrew gilligan said any deployment would not start for at least another month and would appear to be small .
" when britain last sent an armoured brigade to the gulf , in 1990 , it hired in a matter of days 36 ships .
this time , so far , we 're hiring three . "
war ' not imminent ' mr hoon added a standby fleet of ships was being built-up , orders of specialised desert equipment being speeded up and some troop units were being put on shorter notice to move .
" i want to emphasise once more that these are contingency preparations aimed at increasing the readiness of a range of options , " he told the commons .
mr hoon stressed war with iraq was not " imminent or inevitable " , but warned approval from the un security council and the uk parliament was not required before military action was taken against saddam hussein .
the uk 's most senior military chief said troops were frustrated they did not know what they would be doing .
admiral sir michael boyce said : " obviously it is frustrating in the sense that you always want to know exactly where you are heading so you can actually do proper planning for it .
a " menu of packages " was being put together , said the chief of the defence staff .
the " long planned " exercise in the indian ocean , operation flying fish , will culminate in singapore and malaysia in june .
mod officials told bbc news online : " it is not heading for the gulf .
it could head for the gulf . "
mr blair said if saddam hussein breached the un security council resolution which required him to detail his weapons of mass destruction " we should agree to take action " against iraq .
mr blair said he would hold a commons vote on any deployment to iraq , but only if it would not " endanger or imperil our troops " .
a substantial number of anti-war labour mps have been pushing for a vote on the issue before troops are deployed .
earlier , foreign secretary jack straw dismissed as an " obvious falsehood " claims by saddam hussein that iraq abandoned producing weapons of mass destruction long ago .
' confusion ' mr straw said there were " obvious omissions " from iraq 's huge dossier on its weapons programmes .
the white house said president bush was also " concerned " at what was missing .
downing street said mr straw was only giving an " initial impression " and the formal response to iraq 's 12,000 page declaration would be given after christmas .
shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said mr straw and the prime minister appeared to be saying different things .

the land round the dock area in plymouth has been sold for £ 9,000,000 to make way for a waterside development .
the new owners want to transform the area , which has been derelict for years creating apartments , offices and cafes .
a spokesman for the new owners said they wanted to create " a vibrant waterfront area " .
key to future the land was previously owned by associated british ports -lrb- abp -rrb- .
under the terms of the new deal , the south west regional development agency -lrb- rda -rrb- and english partnerships , the national regeneration agency will take over running the site .
carl budden , from the rda , said : " i am delighted that we have been able to purchase this site .
" it is a key part of our regeneration plans for millbay and stonehouse .
" along with plymouth city council we have developed a draft regeneration plan to transform millbay into a vibrant waterfront area which will be attractive to businesses and locals alike . "
the sale includes east quay , clyde quay and the undeveloped inner basin , but abp 's main customer , brittany ferries , will not be affected .

a spokesman for the new owners said they wanted to create " a vibrant waterfront area " .
key to future the land was previously owned by associated british ports -lrb- abp -rrb- .
under the terms of the new deal , the south west regional development agency -lrb- rda -rrb- and english partnerships , the national regeneration agency will take over running the site .
carl budden , from the rda , said : " i am delighted that we have been able to purchase this site .
" it is a key part of our regeneration plans for millbay and stonehouse .
" along with plymouth city council we have developed a draft regeneration plan to transform millbay into a vibrant waterfront area which will be attractive to businesses and locals alike . "
the sale includes east quay , clyde quay and the undeveloped inner basin , but abp 's main customer , brittany ferries , will not be affected .

permanent secretary sir jon shortridge is expected to be asked to explain why £ 250,000 of taxpayers ' money was spent on a legal dispute with sacked architects , the richard rogers partnership .
the cardiff bay project is years behind schedule , millions of pounds over budget .
members of the audit committee are expected to have plenty of questions ready when sir jon faces them on thursday .
close attention is likely to be paid to a legal dust-up between the assembly and the acclaimed architect lord rogers .
although it lost the case , a recent report by auditor general for wales sir john bourn backs the assembly government 's decision to take legal action .
the estimated costs of the building have already risen from £ 12m up to £ 47m and the project more than four years behind schedule .
contracts expected the update report made it clear that more delays were on the way .
it said : " as time passes the date when the assembly is likely to take up occupation of the new building is further delayed . "
it also said a better idea of the cost would be available when bids for the contract arrived .
the richard rogers partnership served notice of adjudication on the assembly for payment of disputes invoices totalling £ 529,000 .
the assembly took legal advice and fought the claim , then served a counter claim to recover fees paid to the firm and damages .
the move cost the assembly £ 267,000 in fees .
but sir john said in light of the advice it received from the office of the counsel general and its solicitors , the assembly considered that it was duty bound to take action to protect the public purse .
he said : " i am satisfied the assembly took appropriate advice and was justified in taking the decision it did .
" it may be disappointing that there will be further delays until the opening of the new building , but it is a positive sign that the assembly has restructured the management arrangements for the project . "
the whole project has been plagued by setbacks .
failed expectations the welsh office originally set aside £ 12m for the building but , in november 2000 , the cost rose to £ 26.7m.
the assembly has since estimated the final cost to be in the region of £ 37m-47m .
the chamber was originally expected to be completed in april 2001 , but that was later put back to january 2003 .
two months ago , it was revealed that it is not now expected to be opened until september 2005 .
a number of firms have been invited to tender for the contract and two will be shortlisted and asked to submit costs and design plans in january .
it is understood one of the firms invited to tender is taylor woodrow , backed by lord rogers .
first minister rhodri morgan had put the project on hold but the assembly rejected his proposal to build a scaled-down building .
lord rogers has already been paid £ 2.5m in fees that were linked to the cost of the building .

it is highly unlikely that we can eradicate terrorism altogether sir michael boyce chief of defence staff he stressed the need for global allies to work more closely together to counter the advantages held by terror groups .

instead of their appeals being heard by a panel of councillors , as had previously been the case , the appeals of officers below chief officer level will now be heard by one of the authority 's corporate managers .
the change in the arrangements for appeals was one of the recommendations of the recent joint review report into the council 's social services .
the changes were approved at the council 's employment committee meeting on thursday .
it follows a year in which two senior social work managers have been sacked and council social services heavily criticised .
neil white , a former officer sacked for challenging social service provision , has said the proposals are unfair .
mr white was fired after he refused to discipline an employee at a council-run home in cardiff , who alleged elderly residents there had been mistreated .
he has taken his case to an industrial tribunal .
four months earlier , another manager , charles faber , was sacked for financial mismanagement .
his dismissal came after he raised concerns in a bbc wales documentary about the effect on vulnerable children of staff shortages in social services .
however , an industrial tribunal later unanimously decided that mr faber was fairly dismissed for financial mismanagement by cardiff county council , not for whistleblowing as he had claimed .
in the original story published on the wales index of bbc news online on thursday 19 december , we mistakenly reported that mr charles faber was dismissed by cardiff county council for raising concerns about social services in a bbc wales documentary .
we are happy to make it clear that this was incorrect and that mr faber was dismissed by cardiff county council for financial mismanagement .
this decision was upheld by an employment tribunal in november .
