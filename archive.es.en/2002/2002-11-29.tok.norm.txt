this clearly illustrates that the domestic economy is falling into a deep deflationary phase " shinichi sato , mitsubishi securities japan 's jobless rate increased last month to 5.5 % , up from september 's 5.4 % and matching the post-world war ii high seen in december last year .
industrial output fell by 0.3 % in october , the second month in a row that the measure has fallen .
and household spending fell by 0.7 % compared with october last year .
deflation kept its hold over the economy , with retail prices falling for the 37th month in row .
" this clearly illustrates that the domestic economy is falling into a deep deflationary phase , " said shinichi sato , fixed income strategist at mitsubishi securities .
" -lrb- the industrial output -rrb- results were far worse than our expectation of plus 0.5 % and also much lower than the original -lrb- government -rrb- forecast of plus 1.2 % , " he said .
grim outlook september 's fall in industrial output had been the first drop for three months , and most analysts had expected output to recover in october .
but sluggish growth in the us - japan 's biggest export markets - has continued to hit hard .
while exports rose by 8.5 % in october from the previous month , analysts said the jump was down to one-off factors .
the ministry of economy trade and industry -lrb- meti -rrb- lowered its outlook for industrial output saying it would remain flat .
meti said manufacturers ' output would fall by 1 % this month , but rise 0.6 % in december .
the disappointing industrial output figures cast a shadow over the stock market , but the nikkei recovered to close up 38.78 points , a rise of 0.42 % , at 9,215.56 .
japan 's financial and economics minister heizo takenaka is due to announce a timetable for dealing with the banking sector 's bad loans later on friday .

in an overnight operation that went on into the early hours , four military hercules planes with teams of doctors and psychologists flew into mombasa and evacuated injured israeli tourists and all those who wanted to leave .
earlier , the israeli prime minister ariel sharon vowed to hunt down the perpetrators of the attacks .
" our long arm will get those who carried out the terror attacks .
no one will be forgiven , " mr sharon said shortly after being re-elected to lead his likud party into january 's general elections .
american and israeli investigators have arrived in kenya to help with the investigation .
twelve civilians - including one israeli adult and two children - were killed alongside the three suicide attackers at an israeli-owned hotel in mombasa .
in a separate attack , two missiles narrowly missed an israeli holiday jet that had taken off from the city 's airport .
mr sharon has put the mossad intelligence agency , which has a reputation for ruthlessness , in charge of investigating the attacks .
american investigators are reported to have joined the hunt .
mossad is best known for hunting down and killing several palestinians suspected of the kidnap and murder of 11 israelis at the 1972 munich olympics .
reduced to rubble kenya has pledged to spare no efforts in bringing to justice the perpetrators of the attacks .
police said they were questioning two men who were detained in mombasa after the attacks , but gave no further details .
security has been stepped up throughout the country since the attacks , especially in coastal areas and national parks frequented by tourists .
us security officials have been sent to protect american citizens on a cruise ship currently docked in mombasa harbour .
the bombing , at 0800 local time -lrb- 0500 gmt -rrb- on thursday , reduced a large part of the paradise hotel to rubble and the rest to a smouldering shell .
kenyan police said that as well as the three israelis , nine kenyans died , most of whom were said to be traditional dancers who came to welcome the tourists .
three suicide bombers were also killed , they added .
the blast occurred just after some 60 visitors had checked into the hotel , all of them from israel , hotel officials said .
condemnation in lebanon , a previously unknown group called the army of palestine has said it carried out the attacks .
the group said it wanted the world to hear the " voice of the refugees " on the 55th anniversary of the partition of palestine . "
if these terrorists have scores to settle , let them fight the battles in their own countries " t.j. kisukwa , kenya but kenyan and israeli officials speculated that osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network might have been responsible .
washington condemned the attacks , but said it was too early to blame al-qaeda .
" today 's attacks underscore the continuing willingness of those opposed to peace to commit horrible crimes , " president george w bush said in crawford , texas , where he was spending the thanksgiving holiday weekend .
" the united states remains firmly committed , with its partners around the world , to the fight against terror and those who commit these heinous acts . "
mr bush urged all " those who seek peace ... to dismantle the infrastructure of terror " .
if confirmed as the work of al-qaeda , it would be their first direct attack on israelis - despite bin laden 's hostility towards israel .
mombasa , on kenya 's indian ocean coast , is a popular destination for foreign visitors and the hotel was frequented mainly by israeli tourists .
in 1998 , the us embassies in kenya and neighbouring tanzania were attacked in nearly simultaneous car bombings that killed 219 people and 12 people respectively .
the us blamed al-qaeda .
coordinated , synchronised attacks are a hallmark of al-qaeda , and the bbc 's security correspondent frank gardner says months of careful surveillance clearly went into the latest kenya attacks .

mr sharon beat his main challenger , foreign minister binyamin netanyahu , by 15 percentage points , according to official results released on friday .
congratulating mr sharon , mr netanyahu said : " we must ensure that the next government will have the power to defeat terror . "
final results ariel sharon : 55.8 % binyamin netanyahu : 40.8 % moshe feiglin : 3.4 % the voting was overshadowed by a deadly gun attack on a polling station in the northern town of beit shean and a double attack on israeli tourists in kenya .
nine israelis in all died in the attacks .
mr sharon is now set to lead the centre-right likud into the january general election against the labour party 's dovish new leader , amram mitzna .
likud is well ahead of labour in opinion polls .
sombre mr sharon won 55.8 % of the likud members ' votes against 40.8 % for netanyahu and 3.4 % for far-right candidate moshe feiglin .
only 46 percent of likud 's 305,000 members voted in thursday 's party primary election .
the bitter rivals called for unity mr sharon cancelled victory celebrations in light of the day 's attacks on israelis .
in a brief and sombre victory speech after a minute of silence for the victims of the attacks , he said : " this is not a night to celebrate .
we have had a very difficult day . "
but , he added , " we are a strong people and will defeat terror ...
our long arm will get those who carried out the terror attacks .
no one will be forgiven . "
having walked onto the stage with the defeated challenger on his side , mr sharon spoke of unity , saying that " we wo n't surrender to political divisions " .
" we are a strong party and will stand together and rule the nation . "
mr netanyahu - who until recently was seen as likud 's prime minister-in-waiting - also spoke of unity , pledging to work with mr sharon .
party members said they hoped the two bitter rivals could get over their differences to help likud face the violence and the forthcoming elections .
voters attacked the likud offices in beit shean were packed with party members out to vote when two suspected palestinian gunmen struck .
four israelis were killed at the scene , with two later dying in hospital .
about 20 were injured , including three children of former foreign minister david levy , according to the israeli daily ha 'aretz .
four of the six killed in the attack will be buried in beit shean in a joint service later on friday , according to the ha 'aretz .
some of the wounded were airlifted to hospital in haifa the gunmen , who reportedly fired at random and also hurled grenades , were themselves shot dead by israelis .
the al-aqsa martyrs ' brigade , a palestinian group connected to yasser arafat 's fatah movement , said it carried out the attack saying it was revenge for the death of two militants in jenin earlier in the week .
the attack was condemned by mr arafat 's palestinian authority which said it would " not help the palestinian people and its cause " .
the election also came amidst two attacks on israeli tourists in kenya which left at least 15 people dead .
policy clash the clearest policy difference between the likud contenders had been over mr netanyahu 's opposition to the creation of a palestinian state .
the bbc 's jeremy cooke in jerusalem says mr sharon is no enthusiast for the idea but has , it seems , come to see such a development as almost inevitable .
" i do n't think there is one statesman who would oppose such a state , " mr sharon told the israeli daily newspaper maariv earlier this week . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's michael voss in jerusalem " the race for party leadership was overshadowed by the killings at home and abroad " key stories israel 's early elections bombs and labour israel seeks us cash hamas resurgent profiles ariel sharon binyamin netanyahu amram mitzna yasser arafat factfile voices from the conflict talking point what will stop the suicide bombings ?

now is your chance to vote for who you think is britain 's greatest business leader in history .
we had hundreds of your nominations , and based on the criteria of popularity , achievement and legacy we whittled the list down to eight top managers .
the nominees have a few things in common : they are all men , a reflection of the fact that until recent times women were virtually excluded from top management .
most of them turned a small business into a corporate giant .
and finally , the majority of them left a legacy of good works .
now it is up to you to decide : who is britain 's greatest business man of all times ?
andrew carnegie william lever -lrb- viscount leverhulme -rrb- john spedan lewis simon marks william morris -lrb- lord nuffield -rrb- charles rolls and henry royce joseph rowntree lord arnold weinstock the vote has now closed .
in the run-up , bbc business journalists will profile all eight nominees .
watch out for their reports on radio , television and online .
so who is missing ?
the list of those who did n't quite make it is long : among them were business titans like siegmund warburg , nathan rothschild , george cadbury , joseph cyril bamford , sir titus salt and jesse boot , to name a few .
only a few living people were nominated for the title of best business leader , among them virgin group 's sir richard branson , vodafone 's chris gent , bp 's lord browne , easygroup 's stelios haji-loannou and lord hanson , founder of the eponymous conglomerate .
however , the bbc 's business team was unanimous in its view that these managers and their businesses still have to prove their lasting impact on uk industry .
straight from the office our audience put forward the names of only two women : anita roddick , founder of the body shop and green conscience of corporate britain , and edith baxter , who did for soups what victor kiam did for electric razors .
but we were tempted to add one fictional character to the list .
sally bigwood nominated david brent from the bbc programme the office .
" he is leading the current , long overdue re-assessment of uk management .
think of where business would be without the thousands of managers of this calibre . "
quite right too .
although on second thoughts , we may have to wait a bit longer to appreciate the true legacy of david 's untiring efforts .

bbc news online looks at the line-up .
surviving beatles sir paul mccartney and ringo starr will join eric clapton , ravi shankar and a host of stars to pay tribute to former beatle george harrison .
jools holland , tom petty and jeff lynne will perform alongside harrison 's pals from tv comedy monty python 's flying circus for the three-and-a-half-hour show celebrating his life and work .
fans can expect some of harrison 's best-known compositions as well as a handful of his favourite songs penned by other writers .
it seems a fair bet that his friends will run through a chorus or two of my sweet lord , harrison 's biggest hit and the song that came to capture his spirit after his death from cancer on 29 november last year at the age of 58 .
there are plenty of guitar heroes on hand to replicate the languid phrasing of his best-known love song something , or the upbeat drive of got my mind set on you .
posthumous clapton , the show 's musical director , might reasonably be tempted to recreate the solo part he made his own on harrison 's white album opus , while my guitar gently weeps .
harrison 's former side project , the traveling wilburys , are represented by co-member tom petty , and by jeff lynne who helped to produce harrison 's posthumous album brainwashed with his son dhani .
there have been persistent rumours that harrison 's long-time friend bob dylan will also show up , but this is thought to be unlikely .
it is thought jools holland and joe brown may perform the old-time standard the devil and the deep blue sea , their collaboration with harrison on brainwashed .
bankrolled if the audience is in danger of getting a little too misty-eyed , un-named pythons will be on hand to administer some of harrison 's beloved comedy .
he was a particularly close friend of python member eric idle , and his film production company handmade bankrolled the pythons ' 1979 film life of brian .
the real treat for friday 's 5,000 paying guests is expected to be the reunion of the two remaining beatles alongside harrison 's musical guru , ravi shankar .
it was shankar , now 82 , who introduced harrison to the sitar and helped to define his unique sound inside the world 's biggest group on tracks such as within you , without you and love you to .
foundation harrison spent most of his final years at home with his family in oxfordshire , but was reunited briefly with mccartney and starr for the beatles anthology project in the 1990s .
profits from friday 's show will be given to the material world charitable foundation set up by harrison three years after the beatles broke up .
tickets , priced up to £ 150 , have long since sold out - and are reportedly changing hands for as much as £ 1,000 on the black market .
what harrison would have made of the touts cashing in on his musical wake is difficult to determine .
profit although famed for his dry sense of humour , he was entirely serious about the charity he established in 1973 to support the arts , music , education and people with special needs .
his widow , olivia , has had harsh words for the racketeers , saying : " i am extremely disappointed to discover that some people have bought tickets for the tribute concert only so they can sell them on for a profit .
" this completely goes against the spirit in which this celebration was conceived .
" i only hope that the people who intend to sell these tickets on will donate the profits to our charity or to another charity . "

sir simon , who took over at the berlin philharmonic orchestra in september , is in the uk to conduct the new piece , which premières next saturday at the royal opera house starring soprano angelika kirchschlager .
when i read the book i thought ' how do you make an opera about a young man complaining that he ca n't get sex ? '
sir simon rattle he was asked to take part in the project by nicholas maw , who wrote the opera based on the best-selling 1979 book by william styron after he was commissioned by bbc radio 3 .
the book tells the story of a polish holocaust survivor involved in a love triangle .
it was made into a film in 1982 starring meryl streep and kevin kline .
sir simon told front row : " i always wondered how do you make an opera out of this , who do you find to do the libretto , and he seems to have done a wonderful job himself .
" what nick has done is concentrate on the desperate effects of it on people , and how the disaster for the two of them seems to reflect the central tragedy .
" i have to say when i read the book i thought ' how do you make an opera about a young man complaining that he ca n't get sex anywhere . '
nick has managed to excise all that and just go for the central facts . "
he said he and the orchestra had had five weeks so far to work on the score , but that new music was appearing every day .
sir simon : contract with berlin orchestra for 10 years " the idea of the ink still being wet on the page , like you used to get with mozart operas , seems to be true here as well . "
young orchestra sir simon also talked about his recent move to berlin , after leaving the city of birmingham symphony orchestra which he had conducted since 1980 .
asked about comparison between the two orchestras , he said : " in birmingham i was working with a sauvignon blanc and now i 'm working with a wonderful bordeaux , they 're both wonderful wines .
" in berlin i 'm working with a very international , very young orchestra , much younger than the birmingham orchestra .
i think the average age is 31 .
" there 's simply more technical and musical gifts than almost any of us know what to do with .
the amount of skill is almost frightening . "
sir simon has a contract with the berlin philharmonic for the next 10 years but joked : " i have been reminded that my predecessor claudio abbado was the first conductor who was n't carried out in a box .
" it has tended to be something where people have stayed .
i would hope 10 years is only a beginning . "

sir simon , who took over at the berlin philharmonic orchestra in september , is in the uk to conduct the new piece , which premières next saturday at the royal opera house starring soprano angelika kirchschlager . "
when i read the book i thought ' how do you make an opera about a young man complaining that he ca n't get sex ? '
" sir simon rattle he was asked to take part in the project by nicholas maw , who wrote the opera based on the best-selling 1979 book by william styron after he was commissioned by bbc radio 3 .
the book tells the story of a polish holocaust survivor involved in a love triangle .
it was made into a film in 1982 starring meryl streep and kevin kline .
sir simon told front row : " i always wondered how do you make an opera out of this , who do you find to do the libretto , and he seems to have done a wonderful job himself .
" what nick has done is concentrate on the desperate effects of it on people , and how the disaster for the two of them seems to reflect the central tragedy .
" i have to say when i read the book i thought ' how do you make an opera about a young man complaining that he ca n't get sex anywhere . '
nick has managed to excise all that and just go for the central facts . "
he said he and the orchestra had had five weeks so far to work on the score , but that new music was appearing every day .

asked about comparison between the two orchestras , he said : " in birmingham i was working with a sauvignon blanc and now i 'm working with a wonderful bordeaux , they 're both wonderful wines .
" in berlin i 'm working with a very international , very young orchestra , much younger than the birmingham orchestra .

" there 's simply more technical and musical gifts than almost any of us know what to do with .
the amount of skill is almost frightening . "
sir simon has a contract with the berlin philharmonic for the next 10 years but joked : " i have been reminded that my predecessor claudio abbado was the first conductor who was n't carried out in a box .
" it has tended to be something where people have stayed .
i would hope 10 years is only a beginning . "
