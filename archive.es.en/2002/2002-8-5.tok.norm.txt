22 .
launching the final leg of his reelection bid , chancellor gerhard schröder warns against an invasion of iraq and says germany should not look to the u.s. as an economic role model . plagued by his party 's repeated poor standing in recent polls , chancellor gerhard schröder launched the social democratic party 's national campaign tour three weeks earlier than planned on monday .
speaking before 5,000 people in his hometown of hanover , schröder launched the final phase of his campaign by indirectly criticizing the united states ' military " adventurism , " and defending europe 's social market system , saying germans should go their own way in these areas rather than looking to the u.s. as a role model .
he also sought to rally the troops behind his party , which is flagging behind the opposition union bloc .
" the spd is setting out to win this election , " social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chairman and chancellor schröder told the crowd .
at one point , schröder and his wife , doris schröder-kopf , held their fingers out in a " v " shape to symbolize victory .
u.s. no longer a role model but the most notable portions of schröder 's speech came as he sought to distance his party from economic and military trends in the united states .
schröder said it " certainly needs to be reconsidered " whether the u.s. economy should be used as an economic example .
he said the " fleecing of little people in the united states , " through golden parachute severance packages was " not the german way . "
" it 's not what we want for our people , " he said , emphasizing that the country had achieved its strength on the basis of its advanced social market system .
under the german model , he said , employers and employees should be able to face each other on equal footing .
monday 's statements were schröder 's strongest worded response yet to the u.s. debate over whether to expand the international war on terrorism into iraq and the recent string of corporate scandals that have damaged faith both domestically and abroad in american executive management and bookkeeping practices .
calling for " new ethics " among the country 's business leaders , schröder said business leaders need to recognize their responsibility in the country 's social market system .
an uphill battle the chancellor also criticized the recent drop in the number of apprenticeships available to young germans as they leave school – both in the eastern and western states .
he urged businesses to " take care of apprenticeships in companies , that 's your duty . "
the opposition 's chancellor candidate , bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the christian social union , has repeatedly attacked schröder for the weak state of the german economy .
on wednesday , the federal labor office will release unemployment statistics for the month of july , and several important think tanks and national newspapers are reporting that the figure is expected to come in above the psychologically important four million mark , with some estimating as many as 4.11 million unemployed .
in recent weeks , schröder has also been dogged by criticism over his alleged role in the ouster of deutsche telekom ceo ron sommer and the resignation of defense minister rudolf scharping after it was revealed he accepted an advance payment on his memoirs from a frankfurt pr executive who has served as both a friend and personal banker to a handful of germany 's top politicians .
last week , the polling institute forsa released a survey showing that the social democrats were on track to receive 35 percent of the vote .

the berlin swim diva won five gold medals in the european championships held in her hometown . " franzi " , as she is affectionately known to her fans , ca n't quite believe her luck , nor can the german swimming community .
" i think it wo n't really sink in , till i 've got a bit of peace and quiet , " van almsick told reporters sunday after winning the final leg of the women 's 4 x 100m relay - her fifth title of the european championships .
" it seems like the whole city 's gone crazy so i 've just gotta pack my bags and leave and then i think i will slowly start feeling something . "
after almost writing franzi off for not coming home with enough medals at the sydney olympics , the german swimming community has gone wild with excitement .
the golden girl was on the front page of most german newspapers sunday and monday .
and for good reason .
in addition to sunday 's relay gold , franzi was part of two other winning relay teams and scooped up the gold in the 100 meter and 200 meter freestyle , where she broke her own record .
" the 200 meters freestyle is my race , " the frazi told reporters after seeing her record time .
" i grew up on it and i love to swim it .
i ’ ve had a lot of ups and downs in the event .
it ’ s probably because i ’ ve become so attached to it over the years . "
franzi had set the world record eight years ago at the world champions when she was just 16 .
on saturday she topped it with 1 minute 56.64 .
when the magic numbers went up on the score board , franzi ’ s fans broke into a deafening roar .
the swimmer herself fell to her knees and cried in disbelief .
success not a guarantee but franzi ’ s gold medal sweep was anything but a sure thing prior to the start of the championships .
the 24-year-old , who had spent much of her sporting career trying to uphold her reputation as a swim star , frequently let down her fans and her team .
after rising to stardom at the barcelona olympics and cashing in on mega advertising deals , franzi suffered a series of injuries and personal problems .
her swimming successes became fewer .
after a crushing defeat at the 2000 olympics , franzi retreated from the limelight and considered giving up swimming altogether .
the berlin championships last week was the first sign that franzi was back on track .
" all i wanted to do was make a comeback .
that 's what i was fighting for , and why i always believed in myself .
i was on the right track at the start of the week ; but nobody can knock me now after the world 200 meters freestyle record .
and that feels good , " she told reporters .
german gold the whole german team came up trumps in berlin , winning a total of 36 medals , 15 of them gold .
no other country came close in germany ’ s medal tally as the advanced to the status of europe 's number 1 nation in swimming and diving .
never before had germany been so successful in international swimming competitions .
the squad clearly profited from being on home territory .
thomas rupprath , two-time gold medal winner in 50 meter backstroke and 100 butterfly , described the event as " indescribable ... the crowd atmosphere just got better over the last days . "
such sentiments were heard often throughout the week-long event .
" it was a crazy atmosphere , " added teammate stev theoloke , winner of the 100 meter backstroke .
christa thiel , president of the german swimming federation , was especially pleased with the team ’ s results .
" the team effort was sensational .

22 .
launching the final leg of his reelection bid , chancellor gerhard schröder warns against an invasion of iraq and says germany should not look to the u.s. as an economic role model . plagued by his party 's repeated poor standing in recent polls , chancellor gerhard schröder launched the social democratic party 's national campaign tour three weeks earlier than planned on monday .
speaking before 5,000 people in his hometown of hanover , schröder launched the final phase of his campaign by indirectly criticizing the united states ' military " adventurism , " and defending europe 's social market system , saying germans should go their own way in these areas rather than looking to the u.s. as a role model .
he also sought to rally the troops behind his party , which is flagging behind the opposition union bloc .
" the spd is setting out to win this election , " social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chairman and chancellor schröder told the crowd .
at one point , schröder and his wife , doris schröder-kopf , held their fingers out in a " v " shape to symbolize victory .
u.s. no longer a role model but the most notable portions of schröder 's speech came as he sought to distance his party from economic and military trends in the united states .
schröder said it " certainly needs to be reconsidered " whether the u.s. economy should be used as an economic example .
he said the " fleecing of little people in the united states , " through golden parachute severance packages was " not the german way . "
" it 's not what we want for our people , " he said , emphasizing that the country had achieved its strength on the basis of its advanced social market system .
under the german model , he said , employers and employees should be able to face each other on equal footing .
monday 's statements were schröder 's strongest worded response yet to the u.s. debate over whether to expand the international war on terrorism into iraq and the recent string of corporate scandals that have damaged faith both domestically and abroad in american executive management and bookkeeping practices .
calling for " new ethics " among the country 's business leaders , schröder said business leaders need to recognize their responsibility in the country 's social market system .
an uphill battle the chancellor also criticized the recent drop in the number of apprenticeships available to young germans as they leave school – both in the eastern and western states .
he urged businesses to " take care of apprenticeships in companies , that 's your duty . "
the opposition 's chancellor candidate , bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the christian social union , has repeatedly attacked schröder for the weak state of the german economy .
on wednesday , the federal labor office will release unemployment statistics for the month of july , and several important think tanks and national newspapers are reporting that the figure is expected to come in above the psychologically important four million mark , with some estimating as many as 4.11 million unemployed .
in recent weeks , schröder has also been dogged by criticism over his alleged role in the ouster of deutsche telekom ceo ron sommer and the resignation of defense minister rudolf scharping after it was revealed he accepted an advance payment on his memoirs from a frankfurt pr executive who has served as both a friend and personal banker to a handful of germany 's top politicians .
last week , the polling institute forsa released a survey showing that the social democrats were on track to receive 35 percent of the vote .
the christian democrats were estimated at 42 percent , a three-point slip over the previous week .
against those political storm clouds , senior spd leaders will be traveling in a large blue semi-truck equipped with its own soundstage , stumping in more than 77 cities and electoral districts .
schröder will first hop on the bandwagon on august 23 .
but it 's a long upward haul until election day on september 22 , and schröder will need more than the truck 's 400 horsepower to get there . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the bad news keeps coming for schröder with the eighth replacement of a cabinet minister in four years and criticism over deutsche telekom 's ceo 's ouster , chancellor gerhard schröder is entering the final stretch of the election more besieged than ever .

the berlin swim diva won five gold medals in the european championships held in her hometown . " franzi " , as she is affectionately known to her fans , ca n't quite believe her luck , nor can the german swimming community .
" i think it wo n't really sink in , till i 've got a bit of peace and quiet , " van almsick told reporters sunday after winning the final leg of the women 's 4 x 100m relay - her fifth title of the european championships .
" it seems like the whole city 's gone crazy so i 've just gotta pack my bags and leave and then i think i will slowly start feeling something . "
after almost writing franzi off for not coming home with enough medals at the sydney olympics , the german swimming community has gone wild with excitement .
the golden girl was on the front page of most german newspapers sunday and monday .
and for good reason .
in addition to sunday 's relay gold , franzi was part of two other winning relay teams and scooped up the gold in the 100 meter and 200 meter freestyle , where she broke her own record .
" the 200 meters freestyle is my race , " the frazi told reporters after seeing her record time .
" i grew up on it and i love to swim it .
i ’ ve had a lot of ups and downs in the event .
it ’ s probably because i ’ ve become so attached to it over the years . "
franzi had set the world record eight years ago at the world champions when she was just 16 .
on saturday she topped it with 1 minute 56.64 .
when the magic numbers went up on the score board , franzi ’ s fans broke into a deafening roar .
the swimmer herself fell to her knees and cried in disbelief .
success not a guarantee but franzi ’ s gold medal sweep was anything but a sure thing prior to the start of the championships .
the 24-year-old , who had spent much of her sporting career trying to uphold her reputation as a swim star , frequently let down her fans and her team .
after rising to stardom at the barcelona olympics and cashing in on mega advertising deals , franzi suffered a series of injuries and personal problems .
her swimming successes became fewer .
after a crushing defeat at the 2000 olympics , franzi retreated from the limelight and considered giving up swimming altogether .
the berlin championships last week was the first sign that franzi was back on track .
" all i wanted to do was make a comeback .
that 's what i was fighting for , and why i always believed in myself .
i was on the right track at the start of the week ; but nobody can knock me now after the world 200 meters freestyle record .
and that feels good , " she told reporters .

22 .
launching the final leg of his reelection bid , chancellor gerhard schröder warns against an invasion of iraq and says germany should not look to the u.s. as an economic role model . plagued by his party 's repeated poor standing in recent polls , chancellor gerhard schröder launched the social democratic party 's national campaign tour three weeks earlier than planned on monday .
speaking before 5,000 people in his hometown of hanover , schröder launched the final phase of his campaign by indirectly criticizing the united states ' military " adventurism , " and defending europe 's social market system , saying germans should go their own way in these areas rather than looking to the u.s. as a role model .
he also sought to rally the troops behind his party , which is flagging behind the opposition union bloc .
" the spd is setting out to win this election , " social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chairman and chancellor schröder told the crowd .
at one point , schröder and his wife , doris schröder-kopf , held their fingers out in a " v " shape to symbolize victory .
u.s. no longer a role model but the most notable portions of schröder 's speech came as he sought to distance his party from economic and military trends in the united states .
schröder said it " certainly needs to be reconsidered " whether the u.s. economy should be used as an economic example .
he said the " fleecing of little people in the united states , " through golden parachute severance packages was " not the german way . "
" it 's not what we want for our people , " he said , emphasizing that the country had achieved its strength on the basis of its advanced social market system .
under the german model , he said , employers and employees should be able to face each other on equal footing .
monday 's statements were schröder 's strongest worded response yet to the u.s. debate over whether to expand the international war on terrorism into iraq and the recent string of corporate scandals that have damaged faith both domestically and abroad in american executive management and bookkeeping practices .
calling for " new ethics " among the country 's business leaders , schröder said business leaders need to recognize their responsibility in the country 's social market system .
an uphill battle the chancellor also criticized the recent drop in the number of apprenticeships available to young germans as they leave school – both in the eastern and western states .
he urged businesses to " take care of apprenticeships in companies , that 's your duty . "
the opposition 's chancellor candidate , bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the christian social union , has repeatedly attacked schröder for the weak state of the german economy .
on wednesday , the federal labor office will release unemployment statistics for the month of july , and several important think tanks and national newspapers are reporting that the figure is expected to come in above the psychologically important four million mark , with some estimating as many as 4.11 million unemployed .
in recent weeks , schröder has also been dogged by criticism over his alleged role in the ouster of deutsche telekom ceo ron sommer and the resignation of defense minister rudolf scharping after it was revealed he accepted an advance payment on his memoirs from a frankfurt pr executive who has served as both a friend and personal banker to a handful of germany 's top politicians .
last week , the polling institute forsa released a survey showing that the social democrats were on track to receive 35 percent of the vote .
the christian democrats were estimated at 42 percent , a three-point slip over the previous week .
against those political storm clouds , senior spd leaders will be traveling in a large blue semi-truck equipped with its own soundstage , stumping in more than 77 cities and electoral districts .
schröder will first hop on the bandwagon on august 23 .
but it 's a long upward haul until election day on september 22 , and schröder will need more than the truck 's 400 horsepower to get there . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the bad news keeps coming for schröder with the eighth replacement of a cabinet minister in four years and criticism over deutsche telekom 's ceo 's ouster , chancellor gerhard schröder is entering the final stretch of the election more besieged than ever .

the berlin swim diva won five gold medals in the european championships held in her hometown . " franzi " , as she is affectionately known to her fans , ca n't quite believe her luck , nor can the german swimming community .
" i think it wo n't really sink in , till i 've got a bit of peace and quiet , " van almsick told reporters sunday after winning the final leg of the women 's 4 x 100m relay - her fifth title of the european championships .
" it seems like the whole city 's gone crazy so i 've just gotta pack my bags and leave and then i think i will slowly start feeling something . "
after almost writing franzi off for not coming home with enough medals at the sydney olympics , the german swimming community has gone wild with excitement .
the golden girl was on the front page of most german newspapers sunday and monday .
and for good reason .
in addition to sunday 's relay gold , franzi was part of two other winning relay teams and scooped up the gold in the 100 meter and 200 meter freestyle , where she broke her own record .
" the 200 meters freestyle is my race , " the frazi told reporters after seeing her record time .
" i grew up on it and i love to swim it .
i ’ ve had a lot of ups and downs in the event .
it ’ s probably because i ’ ve become so attached to it over the years . "
franzi had set the world record eight years ago at the world champions when she was just 16 .
on saturday she topped it with 1 minute 56.64 .
when the magic numbers went up on the score board , franzi ’ s fans broke into a deafening roar .
the swimmer herself fell to her knees and cried in disbelief .
success not a guarantee but franzi ’ s gold medal sweep was anything but a sure thing prior to the start of the championships .
the 24-year-old , who had spent much of her sporting career trying to uphold her reputation as a swim star , frequently let down her fans and her team .
after rising to stardom at the barcelona olympics and cashing in on mega advertising deals , franzi suffered a series of injuries and personal problems .
her swimming successes became fewer .
after a crushing defeat at the 2000 olympics , franzi retreated from the limelight and considered giving up swimming altogether .
the berlin championships last week was the first sign that franzi was back on track .
" all i wanted to do was make a comeback .
that 's what i was fighting for , and why i always believed in myself .
i was on the right track at the start of the week ; but nobody can knock me now after the world 200 meters freestyle record .
and that feels good , " she told reporters .
german gold the whole german team came up trumps in berlin , winning a total of 36 medals , 15 of them gold .

22 .
launching the final leg of his reelection bid , chancellor gerhard schröder warns against an invasion of iraq and says germany should not look to the u.s. as an economic role model . plagued by his party 's repeated poor standing in recent polls , chancellor gerhard schröder launched the social democratic party 's national campaign tour three weeks earlier than planned on monday .
speaking before 5,000 people in his hometown of hanover , schröder launched the final phase of his campaign by indirectly criticizing the united states ' military " adventurism , " and defending europe 's social market system , saying germans should go their own way in these areas rather than looking to the u.s. as a role model .
he also sought to rally the troops behind his party , which is flagging behind the opposition union bloc .
" the spd is setting out to win this election , " social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chairman and chancellor schröder told the crowd .
at one point , schröder and his wife , doris schröder-kopf , held their fingers out in a " v " shape to symbolize victory .
u.s. no longer a role model but the most notable portions of schröder 's speech came as he sought to distance his party from economic and military trends in the united states .
schröder said it " certainly needs to be reconsidered " whether the u.s. economy should be used as an economic example .
he said the " fleecing of little people in the united states , " through golden parachute severance packages was " not the german way . "
" it 's not what we want for our people , " he said , emphasizing that the country had achieved its strength on the basis of its advanced social market system .
under the german model , he said , employers and employees should be able to face each other on equal footing .
monday 's statements were schröder 's strongest worded response yet to the u.s. debate over whether to expand the international war on terrorism into iraq and the recent string of corporate scandals that have damaged faith both domestically and abroad in american executive management and bookkeeping practices .
calling for " new ethics " among the country 's business leaders , schröder said business leaders need to recognize their responsibility in the country 's social market system .
an uphill battle the chancellor also criticized the recent drop in the number of apprenticeships available to young germans as they leave school – both in the eastern and western states .
he urged businesses to " take care of apprenticeships in companies , that 's your duty . "
the opposition 's chancellor candidate , bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the christian social union , has repeatedly attacked schröder for the weak state of the german economy .
on wednesday , the federal labor office will release unemployment statistics for the month of july , and several important think tanks and national newspapers are reporting that the figure is expected to come in above the psychologically important four million mark , with some estimating as many as 4.11 million unemployed .
in recent weeks , schröder has also been dogged by criticism over his alleged role in the ouster of deutsche telekom ceo ron sommer and the resignation of defense minister rudolf scharping after it was revealed he accepted an advance payment on his memoirs from a frankfurt pr executive who has served as both a friend and personal banker to a handful of germany 's top politicians .
last week , the polling institute forsa released a survey showing that the social democrats were on track to receive 35 percent of the vote .
the christian democrats were estimated at 42 percent , a three-point slip over the previous week .
against those political storm clouds , senior spd leaders will be traveling in a large blue semi-truck equipped with its own soundstage , stumping in more than 77 cities and electoral districts .
schröder will first hop on the bandwagon on august 23 .

22 .
launching the final leg of his reelection bid , chancellor gerhard schröder warns against an invasion of iraq and says germany should not look to the u.s. as an economic role model . plagued by his party 's repeated poor standing in recent polls , chancellor gerhard schröder launched the social democratic party 's national campaign tour three weeks earlier than planned on monday .
speaking before 5,000 people in his hometown of hanover , schröder launched the final phase of his campaign by indirectly criticizing the united states ' military " adventurism , " and defending europe 's social market system , saying germans should go their own way in these areas rather than looking to the u.s. as a role model .
he also sought to rally the troops behind his party , which is flagging behind the opposition union bloc .
" the spd is setting out to win this election , " social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chairman and chancellor schröder told the crowd .
at one point , schröder and his wife , doris schröder-kopf , held their fingers out in a " v " shape to symbolize victory .
u.s. no longer a role model but the most notable portions of schröder 's speech came as he sought to distance his party from economic and military trends in the united states .
schröder said it " certainly needs to be reconsidered " whether the u.s. economy should be used as an economic example .
he said the " fleecing of little people in the united states , " through golden parachute severance packages was " not the german way . "
" it 's not what we want for our people , " he said , emphasizing that the country had achieved its strength on the basis of its advanced social market system .
under the german model , he said , employers and employees should be able to face each other on equal footing .
monday 's statements were schröder 's strongest worded response yet to the u.s. debate over whether to expand the international war on terrorism into iraq and the recent string of corporate scandals that have damaged faith both domestically and abroad in american executive management and bookkeeping practices .
calling for " new ethics " among the country 's business leaders , schröder said business leaders need to recognize their responsibility in the country 's social market system .
an uphill battle the chancellor also criticized the recent drop in the number of apprenticeships available to young germans as they leave school – both in the eastern and western states .
he urged businesses to " take care of apprenticeships in companies , that 's your duty . "

the berlin swim diva won five gold medals in the european championships held in her hometown . " franzi " , as she is affectionately known to her fans , ca n't quite believe her luck , nor can the german swimming community .
" i think it wo n't really sink in , till i 've got a bit of peace and quiet , " van almsick told reporters sunday after winning the final leg of the women 's 4 x 100m relay - her fifth title of the european championships .
" it seems like the whole city 's gone crazy so i 've just gotta pack my bags and leave and then i think i will slowly start feeling something . "
after almost writing franzi off for not coming home with enough medals at the sydney olympics , the german swimming community has gone wild with excitement .
the golden girl was on the front page of most german newspapers sunday and monday .
and for good reason .
in addition to sunday 's relay gold , franzi was part of two other winning relay teams and scooped up the gold in the 100 meter and 200 meter freestyle , where she broke her own record .
" the 200 meters freestyle is my race , " the frazi told reporters after seeing her record time .

" the 200 meters freestyle is my race , " the frazi told reporters after seeing her record time .
" i grew up on it and i love to swim it .
i ’ ve had a lot of ups and downs in the event .
it ’ s probably because i ’ ve become so attached to it over the years . "
franzi had set the world record eight years ago at the world champions when she was just 16 .
on saturday she topped it with 1 minute 56.64 .
when the magic numbers went up on the score board , franzi ’ s fans broke into a deafening roar .
the swimmer herself fell to her knees and cried in disbelief .
success not a guarantee but franzi ’ s gold medal sweep was anything but a sure thing prior to the start of the championships .
the 24-year-old , who had spent much of her sporting career trying to uphold her reputation as a swim star , frequently let down her fans and her team .
after rising to stardom at the barcelona olympics and cashing in on mega advertising deals , franzi suffered a series of injuries and personal problems .
her swimming successes became fewer .
after a crushing defeat at the 2000 olympics , franzi retreated from the limelight and considered giving up swimming altogether .
the berlin championships last week was the first sign that franzi was back on track .
" all i wanted to do was make a comeback .
that 's what i was fighting for , and why i always believed in myself .
i was on the right track at the start of the week ; but nobody can knock me now after the world 200 meters freestyle record .
and that feels good , " she told reporters .
german gold the whole german team came up trumps in berlin , winning a total of 36 medals , 15 of them gold .
no other country came close in germany ’ s medal tally as the advanced to the status of europe 's number 1 nation in swimming and diving .
never before had germany been so successful in international swimming competitions .
the squad clearly profited from being on home territory .
thomas rupprath , two-time gold medal winner in 50 meter backstroke and 100 butterfly , described the event as " indescribable ... the crowd atmosphere just got better over the last days . "
such sentiments were heard often throughout the week-long event .
" it was a crazy atmosphere , " added teammate stev theoloke , winner of the 100 meter backstroke .
christa thiel , president of the german swimming federation , was especially pleased with the team ’ s results .
" the team effort was sensational .

22 .
launching the final leg of his reelection bid , chancellor gerhard schröder warns against an invasion of iraq and says germany should not look to the u.s. as an economic role model . plagued by his party 's repeated poor standing in recent polls , chancellor gerhard schröder launched the social democratic party 's national campaign tour three weeks earlier than planned on monday .
speaking before 5,000 people in his hometown of hanover , schröder launched the final phase of his campaign by indirectly criticizing the united states ' military " adventurism , " and defending europe 's social market system , saying germans should go their own way in these areas rather than looking to the u.s. as a role model .
he also sought to rally the troops behind his party , which is flagging behind the opposition union bloc .
" the spd is setting out to win this election , " social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chairman and chancellor schröder told the crowd .
at one point , schröder and his wife , doris schröder-kopf , held their fingers out in a " v " shape to symbolize victory .
u.s. no longer a role model but the most notable portions of schröder 's speech came as he sought to distance his party from economic and military trends in the united states .
schröder said it " certainly needs to be reconsidered " whether the u.s. economy should be used as an economic example .
he said the " fleecing of little people in the united states , " through golden parachute severance packages was " not the german way . "
" it 's not what we want for our people , " he said , emphasizing that the country had achieved its strength on the basis of its advanced social market system .
under the german model , he said , employers and employees should be able to face each other on equal footing .
monday 's statements were schröder 's strongest worded response yet to the u.s. debate over whether to expand the international war on terrorism into iraq and the recent string of corporate scandals that have damaged faith both domestically and abroad in american executive management and bookkeeping practices .
calling for " new ethics " among the country 's business leaders , schröder said business leaders need to recognize their responsibility in the country 's social market system .
an uphill battle the chancellor also criticized the recent drop in the number of apprenticeships available to young germans as they leave school – both in the eastern and western states .
he urged businesses to " take care of apprenticeships in companies , that 's your duty . "
the opposition 's chancellor candidate , bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the christian social union , has repeatedly attacked schröder for the weak state of the german economy .
on wednesday , the federal labor office will release unemployment statistics for the month of july , and several important think tanks and national newspapers are reporting that the figure is expected to come in above the psychologically important four million mark , with some estimating as many as 4.11 million unemployed .
in recent weeks , schröder has also been dogged by criticism over his alleged role in the ouster of deutsche telekom ceo ron sommer and the resignation of defense minister rudolf scharping after it was revealed he accepted an advance payment on his memoirs from a frankfurt pr executive who has served as both a friend and personal banker to a handful of germany 's top politicians .
last week , the polling institute forsa released a survey showing that the social democrats were on track to receive 35 percent of the vote .
the christian democrats were estimated at 42 percent , a three-point slip over the previous week .
against those political storm clouds , senior spd leaders will be traveling in a large blue semi-truck equipped with its own soundstage , stumping in more than 77 cities and electoral districts .

" it seems like the whole city 's gone crazy so i 've just gotta pack my bags and leave and then i think i will slowly start feeling something . "
after almost writing franzi off for not coming home with enough medals at the sydney olympics , the german swimming community has gone wild with excitement .
the golden girl was on the front page of most german newspapers sunday and monday .
and for good reason .
in addition to sunday 's relay gold , franzi was part of two other winning relay teams and scooped up the gold in the 100 meter and 200 meter freestyle , where she broke her own record .
" the 200 meters freestyle is my race , " the frazi told reporters after seeing her record time .
" i grew up on it and i love to swim it .
i ’ ve had a lot of ups and downs in the event .
it ’ s probably because i ’ ve become so attached to it over the years . "
franzi had set the world record eight years ago at the world champions when she was just 16 .
on saturday she topped it with 1 minute 56.64 .
when the magic numbers went up on the score board , franzi ’ s fans broke into a deafening roar .
the swimmer herself fell to her knees and cried in disbelief .
success not a guarantee but franzi ’ s gold medal sweep was anything but a sure thing prior to the start of the championships .
the 24-year-old , who had spent much of her sporting career trying to uphold her reputation as a swim star , frequently let down her fans and her team .
after rising to stardom at the barcelona olympics and cashing in on mega advertising deals , franzi suffered a series of injuries and personal problems .
her swimming successes became fewer .
after a crushing defeat at the 2000 olympics , franzi retreated from the limelight and considered giving up swimming altogether .
the berlin championships last week was the first sign that franzi was back on track .
" all i wanted to do was make a comeback .
that 's what i was fighting for , and why i always believed in myself .
i was on the right track at the start of the week ; but nobody can knock me now after the world 200 meters freestyle record .
and that feels good , " she told reporters .
german gold the whole german team came up trumps in berlin , winning a total of 36 medals , 15 of them gold .
no other country came close in germany ’ s medal tally as the advanced to the status of europe 's number 1 nation in swimming and diving .
never before had germany been so successful in international swimming competitions .
the squad clearly profited from being on home territory .
thomas rupprath , two-time gold medal winner in 50 meter backstroke and 100 butterfly , described the event as " indescribable ... the crowd atmosphere just got better over the last days . "
such sentiments were heard often throughout the week-long event .

the berlin swim diva won five gold medals in the european championships held in her hometown . " franzi " , as she is affectionately known to her fans , ca n't quite believe her luck , nor can the german swimming community .
" i think it wo n't really sink in , till i 've got a bit of peace and quiet , " van almsick told reporters sunday after winning the final leg of the women 's 4 x 100m relay - her fifth title of the european championships .
" it seems like the whole city 's gone crazy so i 've just gotta pack my bags and leave and then i think i will slowly start feeling something . "
after almost writing franzi off for not coming home with enough medals at the sydney olympics , the german swimming community has gone wild with excitement .
the golden girl was on the front page of most german newspapers sunday and monday .
and for good reason .
in addition to sunday 's relay gold , franzi was part of two other winning relay teams and scooped up the gold in the 100 meter and 200 meter freestyle , where she broke her own record .
" the 200 meters freestyle is my race , " the frazi told reporters after seeing her record time .
" i grew up on it and i love to swim it .
i ’ ve had a lot of ups and downs in the event .
it ’ s probably because i ’ ve become so attached to it over the years . "
franzi had set the world record eight years ago at the world champions when she was just 16 .
on saturday she topped it with 1 minute 56.64 .
when the magic numbers went up on the score board , franzi ’ s fans broke into a deafening roar .
the swimmer herself fell to her knees and cried in disbelief .
success not a guarantee but franzi ’ s gold medal sweep was anything but a sure thing prior to the start of the championships .
the 24-year-old , who had spent much of her sporting career trying to uphold her reputation as a swim star , frequently let down her fans and her team .
after rising to stardom at the barcelona olympics and cashing in on mega advertising deals , franzi suffered a series of injuries and personal problems .
her swimming successes became fewer .
after a crushing defeat at the 2000 olympics , franzi retreated from the limelight and considered giving up swimming altogether .
the berlin championships last week was the first sign that franzi was back on track .
" all i wanted to do was make a comeback .
that 's what i was fighting for , and why i always believed in myself .
i was on the right track at the start of the week ; but nobody can knock me now after the world 200 meters freestyle record .
and that feels good , " she told reporters .
german gold the whole german team came up trumps in berlin , winning a total of 36 medals , 15 of them gold .
no other country came close in germany ’ s medal tally as the advanced to the status of europe 's number 1 nation in swimming and diving .
never before had germany been so successful in international swimming competitions .
the squad clearly profited from being on home territory .
thomas rupprath , two-time gold medal winner in 50 meter backstroke and 100 butterfly , described the event as " indescribable ... the crowd atmosphere just got better over the last days . "
such sentiments were heard often throughout the week-long event .

launching the final leg of his reelection bid , chancellor gerhard schröder warns against an invasion of iraq and says germany should not look to the u.s. as an economic role model . plagued by his party 's repeated poor standing in recent polls , chancellor gerhard schröder launched the social democratic party 's national campaign tour three weeks earlier than planned on monday .
speaking before 5,000 people in his hometown of hanover , schröder launched the final phase of his campaign by indirectly criticizing the united states ' military " adventurism , " and defending europe 's social market system , saying germans should go their own way in these areas rather than looking to the u.s. as a role model .
he also sought to rally the troops behind his party , which is flagging behind the opposition union bloc .
" the spd is setting out to win this election , " social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chairman and chancellor schröder told the crowd .
at one point , schröder and his wife , doris schröder-kopf , held their fingers out in a " v " shape to symbolize victory .
u.s. no longer a role model but the most notable portions of schröder 's speech came as he sought to distance his party from economic and military trends in the united states .
schröder said it " certainly needs to be reconsidered " whether the u.s. economy should be used as an economic example .
he said the " fleecing of little people in the united states , " through golden parachute severance packages was " not the german way . "
" it 's not what we want for our people , " he said , emphasizing that the country had achieved its strength on the basis of its advanced social market system .
under the german model , he said , employers and employees should be able to face each other on equal footing .
monday 's statements were schröder 's strongest worded response yet to the u.s. debate over whether to expand the international war on terrorism into iraq and the recent string of corporate scandals that have damaged faith both domestically and abroad in american executive management and bookkeeping practices .
calling for " new ethics " among the country 's business leaders , schröder said business leaders need to recognize their responsibility in the country 's social market system .
an uphill battle the chancellor also criticized the recent drop in the number of apprenticeships available to young germans as they leave school – both in the eastern and western states .
he urged businesses to " take care of apprenticeships in companies , that 's your duty . "
the opposition 's chancellor candidate , bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the christian social union , has repeatedly attacked schröder for the weak state of the german economy .
on wednesday , the federal labor office will release unemployment statistics for the month of july , and several important think tanks and national newspapers are reporting that the figure is expected to come in above the psychologically important four million mark , with some estimating as many as 4.11 million unemployed .
in recent weeks , schröder has also been dogged by criticism over his alleged role in the ouster of deutsche telekom ceo ron sommer and the resignation of defense minister rudolf scharping after it was revealed he accepted an advance payment on his memoirs from a frankfurt pr executive who has served as both a friend and personal banker to a handful of germany 's top politicians .
last week , the polling institute forsa released a survey showing that the social democrats were on track to receive 35 percent of the vote .
the christian democrats were estimated at 42 percent , a three-point slip over the previous week .
against those political storm clouds , senior spd leaders will be traveling in a large blue semi-truck equipped with its own soundstage , stumping in more than 77 cities and electoral districts .
schröder will first hop on the bandwagon on august 23 .
but it 's a long upward haul until election day on september 22 , and schröder will need more than the truck 's 400 horsepower to get there . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the bad news keeps coming for schröder with the eighth replacement of a cabinet minister in four years and criticism over deutsche telekom 's ceo 's ouster , chancellor gerhard schröder is entering the final stretch of the election more besieged than ever .

the berlin swim diva won five gold medals in the european championships held in her hometown . " franzi " , as she is affectionately known to her fans , ca n't quite believe her luck , nor can the german swimming community .
" i think it wo n't really sink in , till i 've got a bit of peace and quiet , " van almsick told reporters sunday after winning the final leg of the women 's 4 x 100m relay - her fifth title of the european championships .
" it seems like the whole city 's gone crazy so i 've just gotta pack my bags and leave and then i think i will slowly start feeling something . "
after almost writing franzi off for not coming home with enough medals at the sydney olympics , the german swimming community has gone wild with excitement .
the golden girl was on the front page of most german newspapers sunday and monday .
and for good reason .
in addition to sunday 's relay gold , franzi was part of two other winning relay teams and scooped up the gold in the 100 meter and 200 meter freestyle , where she broke her own record .
" the 200 meters freestyle is my race , " the frazi told reporters after seeing her record time .
" i grew up on it and i love to swim it .
i ’ ve had a lot of ups and downs in the event .
it ’ s probably because i ’ ve become so attached to it over the years . "
franzi had set the world record eight years ago at the world champions when she was just 16 .
on saturday she topped it with 1 minute 56.64 .
when the magic numbers went up on the score board , franzi ’ s fans broke into a deafening roar .
the swimmer herself fell to her knees and cried in disbelief .
success not a guarantee but franzi ’ s gold medal sweep was anything but a sure thing prior to the start of the championships .
the 24-year-old , who had spent much of her sporting career trying to uphold her reputation as a swim star , frequently let down her fans and her team .
after rising to stardom at the barcelona olympics and cashing in on mega advertising deals , franzi suffered a series of injuries and personal problems .
her swimming successes became fewer .
after a crushing defeat at the 2000 olympics , franzi retreated from the limelight and considered giving up swimming altogether .
the berlin championships last week was the first sign that franzi was back on track .
" all i wanted to do was make a comeback .
that 's what i was fighting for , and why i always believed in myself .
i was on the right track at the start of the week ; but nobody can knock me now after the world 200 meters freestyle record .
and that feels good , " she told reporters .
german gold the whole german team came up trumps in berlin , winning a total of 36 medals , 15 of them gold .
no other country came close in germany ’ s medal tally as the advanced to the status of europe 's number 1 nation in swimming and diving .
never before had germany been so successful in international swimming competitions .
the squad clearly profited from being on home territory .
thomas rupprath , two-time gold medal winner in 50 meter backstroke and 100 butterfly , described the event as " indescribable ... the crowd atmosphere just got better over the last days . "

the berlin swim diva won five gold medals in the european championships held in her hometown . " franzi " , as she is affectionately known to her fans , ca n't quite believe her luck , nor can the german swimming community .
" i think it wo n't really sink in , till i 've got a bit of peace and quiet , " van almsick told reporters sunday after winning the final leg of the women 's 4 x 100m relay - her fifth title of the european championships .
" it seems like the whole city 's gone crazy so i 've just gotta pack my bags and leave and then i think i will slowly start feeling something . "
after almost writing franzi off for not coming home with enough medals at the sydney olympics , the german swimming community has gone wild with excitement .
the golden girl was on the front page of most german newspapers sunday and monday .
and for good reason .
in addition to sunday 's relay gold , franzi was part of two other winning relay teams and scooped up the gold in the 100 meter and 200 meter freestyle , where she broke her own record .
" the 200 meters freestyle is my race , " the frazi told reporters after seeing her record time .
" i grew up on it and i love to swim it .
i ’ ve had a lot of ups and downs in the event .
it ’ s probably because i ’ ve become so attached to it over the years . "
franzi had set the world record eight years ago at the world champions when she was just 16 .
on saturday she topped it with 1 minute 56.64 .
when the magic numbers went up on the score board , franzi ’ s fans broke into a deafening roar .
the swimmer herself fell to her knees and cried in disbelief .
success not a guarantee but franzi ’ s gold medal sweep was anything but a sure thing prior to the start of the championships .
the 24-year-old , who had spent much of her sporting career trying to uphold her reputation as a swim star , frequently let down her fans and her team .
after rising to stardom at the barcelona olympics and cashing in on mega advertising deals , franzi suffered a series of injuries and personal problems .
her swimming successes became fewer .
after a crushing defeat at the 2000 olympics , franzi retreated from the limelight and considered giving up swimming altogether .
the berlin championships last week was the first sign that franzi was back on track .
" all i wanted to do was make a comeback .
that 's what i was fighting for , and why i always believed in myself .
i was on the right track at the start of the week ; but nobody can knock me now after the world 200 meters freestyle record .
and that feels good , " she told reporters .
german gold the whole german team came up trumps in berlin , winning a total of 36 medals , 15 of them gold .
no other country came close in germany ’ s medal tally as the advanced to the status of europe 's number 1 nation in swimming and diving .
never before had germany been so successful in international swimming competitions .
the squad clearly profited from being on home territory .
thomas rupprath , two-time gold medal winner in 50 meter backstroke and 100 butterfly , described the event as " indescribable ... the crowd atmosphere just got better over the last days . "
such sentiments were heard often throughout the week-long event .
" it was a crazy atmosphere , " added teammate stev theoloke , winner of the 100 meter backstroke .
christa thiel , president of the german swimming federation , was especially pleased with the team ’ s results .
" the team effort was sensational .
at the moment we can look contentedly into the future . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german swim diva surfaces after a two-year dive germany 's franziska van almsick swam her way to gold at the european swimming championships .

22 .
launching the final leg of his reelection bid , chancellor gerhard schröder warns against an invasion of iraq and says germany should not look to the u.s. as an economic role model . plagued by his party 's repeated poor standing in recent polls , chancellor gerhard schröder launched the social democratic party 's national campaign tour three weeks earlier than planned on monday .
speaking before 5,000 people in his hometown of hanover , schröder launched the final phase of his campaign by indirectly criticizing the united states ' military " adventurism , " and defending europe 's social market system , saying germans should go their own way in these areas rather than looking to the u.s. as a role model .
he also sought to rally the troops behind his party , which is flagging behind the opposition union bloc .
" the spd is setting out to win this election , " social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chairman and chancellor schröder told the crowd .
at one point , schröder and his wife , doris schröder-kopf , held their fingers out in a " v " shape to symbolize victory .
u.s. no longer a role model but the most notable portions of schröder 's speech came as he sought to distance his party from economic and military trends in the united states .
schröder said it " certainly needs to be reconsidered " whether the u.s. economy should be used as an economic example .
he said the " fleecing of little people in the united states , " through golden parachute severance packages was " not the german way . "
" it 's not what we want for our people , " he said , emphasizing that the country had achieved its strength on the basis of its advanced social market system .
under the german model , he said , employers and employees should be able to face each other on equal footing .
monday 's statements were schröder 's strongest worded response yet to the u.s. debate over whether to expand the international war on terrorism into iraq and the recent string of corporate scandals that have damaged faith both domestically and abroad in american executive management and bookkeeping practices .
calling for " new ethics " among the country 's business leaders , schröder said business leaders need to recognize their responsibility in the country 's social market system .
an uphill battle the chancellor also criticized the recent drop in the number of apprenticeships available to young germans as they leave school – both in the eastern and western states .
he urged businesses to " take care of apprenticeships in companies , that 's your duty . "
the opposition 's chancellor candidate , bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the christian social union , has repeatedly attacked schröder for the weak state of the german economy .
on wednesday , the federal labor office will release unemployment statistics for the month of july , and several important think tanks and national newspapers are reporting that the figure is expected to come in above the psychologically important four million mark , with some estimating as many as 4.11 million unemployed .
in recent weeks , schröder has also been dogged by criticism over his alleged role in the ouster of deutsche telekom ceo ron sommer and the resignation of defense minister rudolf scharping after it was revealed he accepted an advance payment on his memoirs from a frankfurt pr executive who has served as both a friend and personal banker to a handful of germany 's top politicians .
last week , the polling institute forsa released a survey showing that the social democrats were on track to receive 35 percent of the vote .
the christian democrats were estimated at 42 percent , a three-point slip over the previous week .
against those political storm clouds , senior spd leaders will be traveling in a large blue semi-truck equipped with its own soundstage , stumping in more than 77 cities and electoral districts .
schröder will first hop on the bandwagon on august 23 .

22 .
launching the final leg of his reelection bid , chancellor gerhard schröder warns against an invasion of iraq and says germany should not look to the u.s. as an economic role model . plagued by his party 's repeated poor standing in recent polls , chancellor gerhard schröder launched the social democratic party 's national campaign tour three weeks earlier than planned on monday .
speaking before 5,000 people in his hometown of hanover , schröder launched the final phase of his campaign by indirectly criticizing the united states ' military " adventurism , " and defending europe 's social market system , saying germans should go their own way in these areas rather than looking to the u.s. as a role model .
he also sought to rally the troops behind his party , which is flagging behind the opposition union bloc .
" the spd is setting out to win this election , " social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chairman and chancellor schröder told the crowd .
at one point , schröder and his wife , doris schröder-kopf , held their fingers out in a " v " shape to symbolize victory .
u.s. no longer a role model but the most notable portions of schröder 's speech came as he sought to distance his party from economic and military trends in the united states .
schröder said it " certainly needs to be reconsidered " whether the u.s. economy should be used as an economic example .
he said the " fleecing of little people in the united states , " through golden parachute severance packages was " not the german way . "
" it 's not what we want for our people , " he said , emphasizing that the country had achieved its strength on the basis of its advanced social market system .
under the german model , he said , employers and employees should be able to face each other on equal footing .
monday 's statements were schröder 's strongest worded response yet to the u.s. debate over whether to expand the international war on terrorism into iraq and the recent string of corporate scandals that have damaged faith both domestically and abroad in american executive management and bookkeeping practices .
calling for " new ethics " among the country 's business leaders , schröder said business leaders need to recognize their responsibility in the country 's social market system .
an uphill battle the chancellor also criticized the recent drop in the number of apprenticeships available to young germans as they leave school – both in the eastern and western states .
he urged businesses to " take care of apprenticeships in companies , that 's your duty . "
the opposition 's chancellor candidate , bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the christian social union , has repeatedly attacked schröder for the weak state of the german economy .
on wednesday , the federal labor office will release unemployment statistics for the month of july , and several important think tanks and national newspapers are reporting that the figure is expected to come in above the psychologically important four million mark , with some estimating as many as 4.11 million unemployed .
in recent weeks , schröder has also been dogged by criticism over his alleged role in the ouster of deutsche telekom ceo ron sommer and the resignation of defense minister rudolf scharping after it was revealed he accepted an advance payment on his memoirs from a frankfurt pr executive who has served as both a friend and personal banker to a handful of germany 's top politicians .
last week , the polling institute forsa released a survey showing that the social democrats were on track to receive 35 percent of the vote .
the christian democrats were estimated at 42 percent , a three-point slip over the previous week .
against those political storm clouds , senior spd leaders will be traveling in a large blue semi-truck equipped with its own soundstage , stumping in more than 77 cities and electoral districts .

the berlin swim diva won five gold medals in the european championships held in her hometown . " franzi " , as she is affectionately known to her fans , ca n't quite believe her luck , nor can the german swimming community .
" i think it wo n't really sink in , till i 've got a bit of peace and quiet , " van almsick told reporters sunday after winning the final leg of the women 's 4 x 100m relay - her fifth title of the european championships .
" it seems like the whole city 's gone crazy so i 've just gotta pack my bags and leave and then i think i will slowly start feeling something . "
after almost writing franzi off for not coming home with enough medals at the sydney olympics , the german swimming community has gone wild with excitement .
the golden girl was on the front page of most german newspapers sunday and monday .
and for good reason .
in addition to sunday 's relay gold , franzi was part of two other winning relay teams and scooped up the gold in the 100 meter and 200 meter freestyle , where she broke her own record .
" the 200 meters freestyle is my race , " the frazi told reporters after seeing her record time .
" i grew up on it and i love to swim it .
i ’ ve had a lot of ups and downs in the event .
it ’ s probably because i ’ ve become so attached to it over the years . "
franzi had set the world record eight years ago at the world champions when she was just 16 .
on saturday she topped it with 1 minute 56.64 .
when the magic numbers went up on the score board , franzi ’ s fans broke into a deafening roar .
the swimmer herself fell to her knees and cried in disbelief .
success not a guarantee but franzi ’ s gold medal sweep was anything but a sure thing prior to the start of the championships .
the 24-year-old , who had spent much of her sporting career trying to uphold her reputation as a swim star , frequently let down her fans and her team .
after rising to stardom at the barcelona olympics and cashing in on mega advertising deals , franzi suffered a series of injuries and personal problems .
her swimming successes became fewer .
after a crushing defeat at the 2000 olympics , franzi retreated from the limelight and considered giving up swimming altogether .
the berlin championships last week was the first sign that franzi was back on track .
" all i wanted to do was make a comeback .
that 's what i was fighting for , and why i always believed in myself .
i was on the right track at the start of the week ; but nobody can knock me now after the world 200 meters freestyle record .
and that feels good , " she told reporters .
german gold the whole german team came up trumps in berlin , winning a total of 36 medals , 15 of them gold .
no other country came close in germany ’ s medal tally as the advanced to the status of europe 's number 1 nation in swimming and diving .
never before had germany been so successful in international swimming competitions .
the squad clearly profited from being on home territory .

22 .
launching the final leg of his reelection bid , chancellor gerhard schröder warns against an invasion of iraq and says germany should not look to the u.s. as an economic role model . plagued by his party 's repeated poor standing in recent polls , chancellor gerhard schröder launched the social democratic party 's national campaign tour three weeks earlier than planned on monday .
speaking before 5,000 people in his hometown of hanover , schröder launched the final phase of his campaign by indirectly criticizing the united states ' military " adventurism , " and defending europe 's social market system , saying germans should go their own way in these areas rather than looking to the u.s. as a role model .
he also sought to rally the troops behind his party , which is flagging behind the opposition union bloc .
" the spd is setting out to win this election , " social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chairman and chancellor schröder told the crowd .
at one point , schröder and his wife , doris schröder-kopf , held their fingers out in a " v " shape to symbolize victory .
u.s. no longer a role model but the most notable portions of schröder 's speech came as he sought to distance his party from economic and military trends in the united states .
schröder said it " certainly needs to be reconsidered " whether the u.s. economy should be used as an economic example .
he said the " fleecing of little people in the united states , " through golden parachute severance packages was " not the german way . "
" it 's not what we want for our people , " he said , emphasizing that the country had achieved its strength on the basis of its advanced social market system .
under the german model , he said , employers and employees should be able to face each other on equal footing .
monday 's statements were schröder 's strongest worded response yet to the u.s. debate over whether to expand the international war on terrorism into iraq and the recent string of corporate scandals that have damaged faith both domestically and abroad in american executive management and bookkeeping practices .
calling for " new ethics " among the country 's business leaders , schröder said business leaders need to recognize their responsibility in the country 's social market system .
an uphill battle the chancellor also criticized the recent drop in the number of apprenticeships available to young germans as they leave school – both in the eastern and western states .
he urged businesses to " take care of apprenticeships in companies , that 's your duty . "
the opposition 's chancellor candidate , bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the christian social union , has repeatedly attacked schröder for the weak state of the german economy .
on wednesday , the federal labor office will release unemployment statistics for the month of july , and several important think tanks and national newspapers are reporting that the figure is expected to come in above the psychologically important four million mark , with some estimating as many as 4.11 million unemployed .
in recent weeks , schröder has also been dogged by criticism over his alleged role in the ouster of deutsche telekom ceo ron sommer and the resignation of defense minister rudolf scharping after it was revealed he accepted an advance payment on his memoirs from a frankfurt pr executive who has served as both a friend and personal banker to a handful of germany 's top politicians .
last week , the polling institute forsa released a survey showing that the social democrats were on track to receive 35 percent of the vote .
the christian democrats were estimated at 42 percent , a three-point slip over the previous week .
against those political storm clouds , senior spd leaders will be traveling in a large blue semi-truck equipped with its own soundstage , stumping in more than 77 cities and electoral districts .
schröder will first hop on the bandwagon on august 23 .
but it 's a long upward haul until election day on september 22 , and schröder will need more than the truck 's 400 horsepower to get there . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the bad news keeps coming for schröder with the eighth replacement of a cabinet minister in four years and criticism over deutsche telekom 's ceo 's ouster , chancellor gerhard schröder is entering the final stretch of the election more besieged than ever .

in recent weeks , schröder has also been dogged by criticism over his alleged role in the ouster of deutsche telekom ceo ron sommer and the resignation of defense minister rudolf scharping after it was revealed he accepted an advance payment on his memoirs from a frankfurt pr executive who has served as both a friend and personal banker to a handful of germany 's top politicians .
last week , the polling institute forsa released a survey showing that the social democrats were on track to receive 35 percent of the vote .
the christian democrats were estimated at 42 percent , a three-point slip over the previous week .
against those political storm clouds , senior spd leaders will be traveling in a large blue semi-truck equipped with its own soundstage , stumping in more than 77 cities and electoral districts .
schröder will first hop on the bandwagon on august 23 .
but it 's a long upward haul until election day on september 22 , and schröder will need more than the truck 's 400 horsepower to get there . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the bad news keeps coming for schröder with the eighth replacement of a cabinet minister in four years and criticism over deutsche telekom 's ceo 's ouster , chancellor gerhard schröder is entering the final stretch of the election more besieged than ever .

gonzalo sanchez de lozada promised more jobs mr sanchez de lozada , 72 , acknowledged that like other south american countries , bolivia was facing an economic crisis .
but he said he would fulfil his campaign promises and begin an immediate programme of public works , like road and house building , to provide jobs .
he also said he would only decide the controversial gas export question after consulting the population .
' at knockdown price ' mr sanchez de lozada called a press conference to outline his plans for the government immediately after his election was confirmed by bolivia 's national congress .
the all-night session took its toll on some deputies he also said a new national gas policy will be drawn up , but no decisions will be taken on the plan to sell natural gas to california at a knockdown price before the population had been consulted .
bolivia 's neighbours , chile and peru , are competing to provide port facilities for the export of the gas .
the president-elect did not mention his plans in regard to bolivia 's coca growers , whose leader , evo morales , he defeated in the presidential election .
powerful opposition the us government would like to see bolivia eradicate all its coca bushes , although it has been a traditional crop here since pre-incan times .
evo morales will now lead the opposition mr sanchez de lozada 's first steps seem to be an acknowledgement of the new power of the opposition , which has a strong social and nationalist agenda .
this opposition , made up of representatives from indigenous coca growers and trade unions , now has a third of the seats in congress .
now it will be led by evo morales , who was elected deputy for cochabamba besides running for the presidency .
the inauguration of the new president will take place on tuesday , with the venezuelan and peruvian presidents expected to attend .
but the us government 's choice of the man who heads its anti-drug programme to represent it has not gone down very well in bolivia .

dr williams joined the circle of bards during the ceremony at the maes in st david 's , pembrokeshire .
what is the gorsedd of bards ?
created in 1792 as celebration of welsh and celtic heritage gorsedd is welsh for " high seat " rituals look back to era when celtic druids - religious professionals - led society compared to english honours system currently 1,300 members his admittance to the mythical circle of scholars and stars who have contributed to welsh cultural life will be one of his last duties as archbishop of wales .
but his induction has already proved controversial , with a national newspaper repeating evangelical concerns he was dabbling in paganism .
and the gorsedd 's archdruid has used the furore to rail against the english establishment by saying he does not want dr williams to leave wales - because he will be wasted in england .
retired lawyer dr robyn lewis said : " quite frankly , we do not want him to go to canterbury .
" we feel he deserves it , but we feel we need him here .
" he is a fluent welsh speaker for a start , and that will be wasted in canterbury , wasted on the desert air . "
on sunday , dr williams hit back at claims aired in the times newspaper he was getting involved in druidism and paganism .
and after the ceremony at the eisteddfod , he again sided with the suggestions that the english establishment knew little about its welsh counterpart .
he said : " it 's been rather depressing , frankly , to see how little people know about welsh culture and welsh institutions and how ready some people have been to accept very fishy information from very strange sources about all this . "
rev david banting of conservative church of england evangelical group reform said he should " should concentrate on the celebration and promotion of the christian faith ... rather than dabbling in other things " .
dr williams said : " the suggestion that the gorsedd is even remotely associated with paganism is deeply offensive ... " ... not just in its suggestion that i would wish to associate myself in any way with paganism , but also to those people ... who appreciate the gorsedd and eisteddfod .
" when approached by the gorsedd and invited to receive the honour of being admitted to the gorsedd , i was delighted to accept .
" the national eisteddfod and the gorsedd are an important and integral part of wales 's national life and admission to the gorsedd is one of the greatest honours which wales can bestow on her citizens . "
the gorsedd is a creative invention which first gathered at primrose hill , london , in 1792 , and made its first eisteddfod appearance at carmarthen in 1819 , standing around a circle of stones .
today the circle numbers poets , writers , musicians , artists , sportsmen and women , and others who have made a distinguished contribution to wales .
former welsh secretary ron davies , cricketer robert croft , opera singer bryn terfel and the queen are all members of the group .
usually , members must be welsh speakers .
dr williams has written a number of books on the history of theology and spirituality and has published collections of articles and sermons , as well as a book of poems in 1994 .
like other members , he will adopt a unique bardic name in the complex ceremony , as the national eisteddfod gets into full swing .
