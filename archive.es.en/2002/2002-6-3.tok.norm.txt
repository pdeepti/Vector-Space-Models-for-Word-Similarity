five other players help themselves to goals in germany 's record breaking opening game . germany exploited the saudi defence with pinpoint crossing , heading in five of their eight goals en route to a 8-0 record route of saudi arabia in their opening match of the 2002 world cup .
the german offense got opportunity after opportunity throughout the match , often on long passes that were deftly woven through the porous saudi defense .
striker miroslav klose , added to the team following a spate of injuries to german starters in qualifying games , scored three goals in his world cup debut , all of them on headers .
the result was a promising one for the german side , plagued with doubt following injuries and a rough qualifying road to the world cup .
the german forwards were not to be stopped , getting chances within the first two minutes of the game and keeping the pressure on the saudi side throughout .
germany ’ s victory was evidence of the team ’ s size advantage in the match .
the physical presence of german defenders ramelow and linke proved too much for the smaller saudi strikers al yami and al jaber , keeping both quiet throughout the match by stopping chances before they could be properly created .

busy night for saudi goalie his counterpart must have wished for such a statistic .
the german offense fired 25 shots on goal .
most of the team ’ s goals came off beautiful flank passes , including two from star michael ballack , who headed in a goal of his own .

miroslav klose has a hatrick as germany routes saudia arabia 8-0 .
five other players help themselves to goals in germany 's record breaking opening game . germany exploited the saudi defence with pinpoint crossing , heading in five of their eight goals en route to a 8-0 record route of saudi arabia in their opening match of the 2002 world cup .
the german offense got opportunity after opportunity throughout the match , often on long passes that were deftly woven through the porous saudi defense .
striker miroslav klose , added to the team following a spate of injuries to german starters in qualifying games , scored three goals in his world cup debut , all of them on headers .
the result was a promising one for the german side , plagued with doubt following injuries and a rough qualifying road to the world cup .
the german forwards were not to be stopped , getting chances within the first two minutes of the game and keeping the pressure on the saudi side throughout .
germany ’ s victory was evidence of the team ’ s size advantage in the match .
the physical presence of german defenders ramelow and linke proved too much for the smaller saudi strikers al yami and al jaber , keeping both quiet throughout the match by stopping chances before they could be properly created .
goal keeper oliver kahn had a quiet match handling only two shots on goal .
busy night for saudi goalie his counterpart must have wished for such a statistic .
the german offense fired 25 shots on goal .
most of the team ’ s goals came off beautiful flank passes , including two from star michael ballack , who headed in a goal of his own .

the world cup throws the finest footballers on earth together in a tournament where friendships and allegiances are sidelined by the pursuit of global dominance . the greatest sporting circus in the world is once again upon us .
the four year cycle of qualifiers and play-offs , elation and heartache delivers the world cup finals to the planet ’ s consciousness at last .
for most , the exotic collection of foreign characters gracing the greatest of football stages will sweep over them , leaving indelible moments and unforgettable flashes of individual brilliance .
unpronounceable identities will become household names on the back of outrageous skill and championship winning action .
but to many of the players taking part in this year ’ s summer spectacle , their opponents will be far from alien .
the english leagues boast the greatest number of players appearing on the squad sheets of the 32 nations spread over the eight groups with 93 in total .
players from the top league represent the majority of these .
79 premiership stars will take part in the finals , which includes 22 of the england squad itself and the majority of the republic of ireland contingent of course .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the one exception in the england camp is owen hargreaves , the 21 year old bayern munich midfielder who was born in canada but qualifies through his english heritage .
germany-based hargreaves will be one of many players who will be coming up against fellow bundesliga colleagues and opponents in the coming weeks .
in the first phase alone , hargreaves may find himself up against familiar faces such as argentina ’ s diego placente , nigeria ’ s taribo west -lrb- both of bayer leverkusen -rrb- and sweden ’ s andreas jakobsson -lrb- hansa rostock -rrb- .

when france , the current world champions , play denmark in group a on june 6 , bayern stars bixente lizarazu and willy sagnol may well have to deal with the well known threat of schalke 04 ’ s danish danger man ebbe sand .

meanwhile , the lively roque santa cruz of bayern threatens to upset the group when he spearheads the paraguay attack .
south african hopes may well rest on the ability of bradley camell -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- and delron buckley -lrb- bochum -rrb- to contain their bundesliga colleagues in the first stage .
if poland and croatia make it through the group stages and first knockout round , they could meet in a quarter final and field a total of 13 bundesliga stars between them .
polish coach jerzy engel has selected six in his travelling squad of 23 while his croatian counterpart mirko jozic goes one better with an impressive seven .
turkey , brazil , cameroon and tunisia all field one germany-based player in their squad . the united states includes three players from the bundesliga and the belgians have four from their neighbouring country in their contingent .

traditionally one of the most accommodating places when it comes to refugees , denmark has pulled the welcome mat out from underneath the feet of those wishing to enter and live in the country . a new tough stance on immigration , passed as legislation by the danish government on may 31 , is designed to severely restrict access to denmark for asylum-seekers and refugees .
parliamentary support from the anti-immigration , populist danish people 's party ensured the passage of the law , which will take effect from july 1 .
danish lawmakers voted 59-48 in favour of the law after a three-hour debate .
seventy parliamentarians were absent and two abstained .
automatic entry denied ; benefits cut the legislation will deny automatic entry to foreign-born spouses of danes and compromise the legal rights of immigrants who wish to bring in their immediate families for refugees who do get in , conditions are likely to get much tougher once in denmark .
welfare payments will be cut by 35 percent to 50 percent , depending on the size of the family .
a married couple with two children now qualifies for payments of about euro 2,360 -lrb- $ 2,200 -rrb- per month .

refugees will get permanent residence permits after seven years , instead of the present three , and will have to wait until then to get these down-sized benefits .
they will be returned to their native countries if the political situation there stabilises and any refugee who goes home on holiday will have his or her case re-evaluated .
under the proposal , refugees will only be considered as such as per the definition in the geneva convention , meaning those who have been , or fear being , persecuted for their race , religion or political beliefs .
60 per cent of danes support restrictions the legislation was first presented early this year by the liberal-conservative minority government .
the centre-right coalition took office in november on promises to protect the prosperous nation 's ' cradle-to-grave ' welfare system from being exploited by outsiders .
the government is seen by many to be standing firm on these election pledges .
as a result , danes have shown support for the restrictions , with more than 60 per cent in favour .

immigration minister bertel haarder added , " foreigners represent a net burden on society .
they cost more than they give back . "
effects of debate already show reduction in refugees the looming stringent legislation has already begun to show signs of deterring asylum-seekers .
the publicity surrounding the debate on immigrants - which was a main feature of the government 's campaign - is thought to have prompted an already significant decline in the number of asylum-seekers .
the numbers of refugees entering the country dropped from 3,033 in the first three months of 2001 to 1,877 in the same period this year .
immigrants account for 5 percent of the scandinavian nation 's 5.3 million population .

the country is facing a demographic time bomb as its work force shrinks , the number of pensioners rises and its generous social security system struggles to cope .
in recent times , government agencies have appealed to educated foreign workers to move to denmark to help shore up its work force .
un , european neighbours in fierce opposition the decision to clamp down on asylum seekers claiming benefits has been strongly criticised by the united nations and other european countries who say the legislation - which has been under discussion since the centre-right government swept to power - is racist .
european critics hope to pressure denmark , which takes over the revolving presidency of the european union in a month , into diluting the legislation .
neighbouring sweden expressed concern that the restrictive policies now being put in place by the danes could over stretch their own capacity for immigration with refugees flocking to their borders in search of alternatives .
danish voices opposed to the legislation include human rights organisations and left wing political parties .
bashy quraishy , one of 20,000 pakistanis in denmark and the president of the european network against racism , said , " the bottom line is that danes want to keep ethnic minorities out of denmark . "

the world cup throws the finest footballers on earth together in a tournament where friendships and allegiances are sidelined by the pursuit of global dominance . the greatest sporting circus in the world is once again upon us .
the four year cycle of qualifiers and play-offs , elation and heartache delivers the world cup finals to the planet ’ s consciousness at last .
for most , the exotic collection of foreign characters gracing the greatest of football stages will sweep over them , leaving indelible moments and unforgettable flashes of individual brilliance .
unpronounceable identities will become household names on the back of outrageous skill and championship winning action .
but to many of the players taking part in this year ’ s summer spectacle , their opponents will be far from alien .
the english leagues boast the greatest number of players appearing on the squad sheets of the 32 nations spread over the eight groups with 93 in total .
players from the top league represent the majority of these .
79 premiership stars will take part in the finals , which includes 22 of the england squad itself and the majority of the republic of ireland contingent of course .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the one exception in the england camp is owen hargreaves , the 21 year old bayern munich midfielder who was born in canada but qualifies through his english heritage .
germany-based hargreaves will be one of many players who will be coming up against fellow bundesliga colleagues and opponents in the coming weeks .
in the first phase alone , hargreaves may find himself up against familiar faces such as argentina ’ s diego placente , nigeria ’ s taribo west -lrb- both of bayer leverkusen -rrb- and sweden ’ s andreas jakobsson -lrb- hansa rostock -rrb- .
with club colours swapped for the coveted national kit , there promises to be no quarter given as domestic relationships are put to one side in the pursuit of the most valued prize in the game .
when france , the current world champions , play denmark in group a on june 6 , bayern stars bixente lizarazu and willy sagnol may well have to deal with the well known threat of schalke 04 ’ s danish danger man ebbe sand .
in group b , three out of the four teams facing each other will contain germany-based players .
slovenia fields the most with kaisterlautern ’ s aleksander knavs , nuremburg ’ s rajko tavcar and cologne ’ s spasoje bulajic .
meanwhile , the lively roque santa cruz of bayern threatens to upset the group when he spearheads the paraguay attack .
south african hopes may well rest on the ability of bradley camell -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- and delron buckley -lrb- bochum -rrb- to contain their bundesliga colleagues in the first stage .
if poland and croatia make it through the group stages and first knockout round , they could meet in a quarter final and field a total of 13 bundesliga stars between them .
polish coach jerzy engel has selected six in his travelling squad of 23 while his croatian counterpart mirko jozic goes one better with an impressive seven .
turkey , brazil , cameroon and tunisia all field one germany-based player in their squad . the united states includes three players from the bundesliga and the belgians have four from their neighbouring country in their contingent .
of course , the german team itself is made up of a dazzling array of native talent but as the statistics show , the attractions of foreign leagues and big money transfers are not always enough to keep german stars on home soil .
bildunterschrift : liverpool ’ s didi hamann and tottenham hotspurs ’ christian ziege will offer invaluable insights into the english game if and when the old foes clash again while as monaco ’ s oliver bierhoff may have some secret knowledge of french football not yet utilised against the cup holders .
whoever holds the trophy aloft in yokohama on june 30 , international rivalries are sure to be forgotten in the light of celebration .
sportsmanship will undoubtedly be the overall winner until the domestic season starts again and the players can then all resume kicking lumps out of each other .

an unusual art project in cologne seeks to draw attention to the everyday situation of women sitting behind bars .
it also gives them a chance to prove to themselves that they are capable of creating something special . it ’ s not the most likely place to be visiting an art opening .
no champagne , no hors d 'oeuvres , no saxophone player in the corner – just the prison band , steel doors , barred windows and a high wall .
but a group of women in cologne ’ s prison want to use art to break through this wall , at least symbolically .
the prison ’ s art therapist , klaus heilmann , came up with the idea .
when he saw that the women ’ s museum in nearby bonn was planning an exhibit which focussed on violence against women , he approached them about working together .
" we thought it fit really well to the theme , as violence is a major issue in prison , " explains sabine heinen from the museum ’ s art education department .
" we thought it would also be a good chance for these women to release energies and get rid of their aggressions . "
heinen and her colleague , eva wal , put together a concept and got right to work .
for two weeks , the artists worked with 13 imprisoned women .
the results came together on a three-meter-high stone column , displayed in the prison chapel .
" a superb feat " two sides of the column hold box-shaped wooden instruments .
each one was built by one of the imprisoned women and includes a carved element she designed .
on the remaining two sides of the stone column are clay tiles , also each individually designed and completed .
twelve of the 13 women involved are in jail for drug-related offences .
heilmann says that the project shows that drug-addicted women are not what they ’ re made out to be .
" that ’ s what is so wonderful about this exhibit , " he says .
" what you see here is actually a superb feat in strength , energy and staying power .
in my opinion , drug-addicted women are the most creative of all . "
for the two artists from the women ’ s museum , working on such a project inside a prison was quite a change of pace from their usual activities in art education .
wal points out these women are not coming to you in their free time to do something " nice " .
" this here is a personal space , but it ’ s locked into a very tough daily routine , " she says .
" and this life isn ’ t just tough because it ’ s in prison , but also because these women that are in here already had a hell of a tough life . "
breaking through the project is not about escaping this tough life , though , but rather breaking through it .
that ’ s why the initiators chose to call it " durchbruch " or " breakthrough " , says heilmann .
" on the one hand , it ’ s breaking through from the inside to the outside , to present ourselves to the world .
but it ’ s also breaking through in the sense of breaking through myself as a person , breaking out of lethargy and taking action . "
the stone column is expected to be moved from the prison chapel to the new district court building in bonn later this year .
the fact that the general public will see their work also means a lot to the women .
laura says it was one motivating factor for her to take part in the project .
" it ’ s very important for me that people on the other side of this wall understand what sort of situations , emotions and expressions we women here in prison go through . "
and angela hopes it will make people think differently about drug addicts .
" this project proves that - especially as a drug addict - you can show that you are capable of something . "
but what really made this art opening different from any other is that these 13 women could see – many for the first time – that they have accomplished something .
and this realization could help them take back control over their lives once they are released and on the other side of the high walls . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links women 's museum , bonn -lrb- german only -rrb- further information on the museum 's exhibits and activities .

an unusual art project in cologne seeks to draw attention to the everyday situation of women sitting behind bars .
it also gives them a chance to prove to themselves that they are capable of creating something special . it ’ s not the most likely place to be visiting an art opening .
no champagne , no hors d 'oeuvres , no saxophone player in the corner – just the prison band , steel doors , barred windows and a high wall .
but a group of women in cologne ’ s prison want to use art to break through this wall , at least symbolically .
the prison ’ s art therapist , klaus heilmann , came up with the idea .
when he saw that the women ’ s museum in nearby bonn was planning an exhibit which focussed on violence against women , he approached them about working together .
" we thought it fit really well to the theme , as violence is a major issue in prison , " explains sabine heinen from the museum ’ s art education department .
" we thought it would also be a good chance for these women to release energies and get rid of their aggressions . "
heinen and her colleague , eva wal , put together a concept and got right to work .
for two weeks , the artists worked with 13 imprisoned women .
the results came together on a three-meter-high stone column , displayed in the prison chapel .
" a superb feat " two sides of the column hold box-shaped wooden instruments .
each one was built by one of the imprisoned women and includes a carved element she designed .
on the remaining two sides of the stone column are clay tiles , also each individually designed and completed .
twelve of the 13 women involved are in jail for drug-related offences .
heilmann says that the project shows that drug-addicted women are not what they ’ re made out to be .
" that ’ s what is so wonderful about this exhibit , " he says .
" what you see here is actually a superb feat in strength , energy and staying power .
in my opinion , drug-addicted women are the most creative of all . "
for the two artists from the women ’ s museum , working on such a project inside a prison was quite a change of pace from their usual activities in art education .
wal points out these women are not coming to you in their free time to do something " nice " .
" this here is a personal space , but it ’ s locked into a very tough daily routine , " she says .
" and this life isn ’ t just tough because it ’ s in prison , but also because these women that are in here already had a hell of a tough life . "
breaking through the project is not about escaping this tough life , though , but rather breaking through it .
that ’ s why the initiators chose to call it " durchbruch " or " breakthrough " , says heilmann .
" on the one hand , it ’ s breaking through from the inside to the outside , to present ourselves to the world .
but it ’ s also breaking through in the sense of breaking through myself as a person , breaking out of lethargy and taking action . "
the stone column is expected to be moved from the prison chapel to the new district court building in bonn later this year .
the fact that the general public will see their work also means a lot to the women .
laura says it was one motivating factor for her to take part in the project .
" it ’ s very important for me that people on the other side of this wall understand what sort of situations , emotions and expressions we women here in prison go through . "
and angela hopes it will make people think differently about drug addicts .

but what really made this art opening different from any other is that these 13 women could see – many for the first time – that they have accomplished something .

traditionally one of the most accommodating places when it comes to refugees , denmark has pulled the welcome mat out from underneath the feet of those wishing to enter and live in the country . a new tough stance on immigration , passed as legislation by the danish government on may 31 , is designed to severely restrict access to denmark for asylum-seekers and refugees .
parliamentary support from the anti-immigration , populist danish people 's party ensured the passage of the law , which will take effect from july 1 .
danish lawmakers voted 59-48 in favour of the law after a three-hour debate .
seventy parliamentarians were absent and two abstained .
automatic entry denied ; benefits cut the legislation will deny automatic entry to foreign-born spouses of danes and compromise the legal rights of immigrants who wish to bring in their immediate families for refugees who do get in , conditions are likely to get much tougher once in denmark .
welfare payments will be cut by 35 percent to 50 percent , depending on the size of the family .
a married couple with two children now qualifies for payments of about euro 2,360 -lrb- $ 2,200 -rrb- per month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants wait in line to apply for visas .
refugees will get permanent residence permits after seven years , instead of the present three , and will have to wait until then to get these down-sized benefits .
they will be returned to their native countries if the political situation there stabilises and any refugee who goes home on holiday will have his or her case re-evaluated .
under the proposal , refugees will only be considered as such as per the definition in the geneva convention , meaning those who have been , or fear being , persecuted for their race , religion or political beliefs .
60 per cent of danes support restrictions the legislation was first presented early this year by the liberal-conservative minority government .
the centre-right coalition took office in november on promises to protect the prosperous nation 's ' cradle-to-grave ' welfare system from being exploited by outsiders .
the government is seen by many to be standing firm on these election pledges .
as a result , danes have shown support for the restrictions , with more than 60 per cent in favour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " let common sense prevail-yes " , denmark 's pm gets his way .
" with the -lrb- law proposal -rrb- we have carried out the tightening that obviously has become necessary , " prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said .
immigration minister bertel haarder added , " foreigners represent a net burden on society .
they cost more than they give back . "
effects of debate already show reduction in refugees the looming stringent legislation has already begun to show signs of deterring asylum-seekers .
the publicity surrounding the debate on immigrants - which was a main feature of the government 's campaign - is thought to have prompted an already significant decline in the number of asylum-seekers .
the numbers of refugees entering the country dropped from 3,033 in the first three months of 2001 to 1,877 in the same period this year .
immigrants account for 5 percent of the scandinavian nation 's 5.3 million population .
despite the tightening of the immigration laws , the danish government indicated that doctors and other professionals needed to plug gaps in denmark 's health sector would be exempt from the new restrictions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' grey factor ' is a problem for the danish population .
the country is facing a demographic time bomb as its work force shrinks , the number of pensioners rises and its generous social security system struggles to cope .
in recent times , government agencies have appealed to educated foreign workers to move to denmark to help shore up its work force .
un , european neighbours in fierce opposition the decision to clamp down on asylum seekers claiming benefits has been strongly criticised by the united nations and other european countries who say the legislation - which has been under discussion since the centre-right government swept to power - is racist .
european critics hope to pressure denmark , which takes over the revolving presidency of the european union in a month , into diluting the legislation .
neighbouring sweden expressed concern that the restrictive policies now being put in place by the danes could over stretch their own capacity for immigration with refugees flocking to their borders in search of alternatives .
danish voices opposed to the legislation include human rights organisations and left wing political parties .
bashy quraishy , one of 20,000 pakistanis in denmark and the president of the european network against racism , said , " the bottom line is that danes want to keep ethnic minorities out of denmark . "
elsebeth gerner nielsen of the small , centre radical party said , " the government 's immigration package will hit the weakest people inside and outside the country . "
she said the vote would be " an embarrassing day in history for denmark . "
denmark joins list of ' race card ' players disquiet amongst moderate thinkers has now turned to extreme concern .
following a number of election campaigns across europe that featured heavy anti-immigration rhetoric , further pandering to common anxieties that lead to gains by right wing parties is seen as a major danger .
during the danish elections , the ' race card ' was played by a number of groups who successfully appealed to voters ' fears about the september 11 attacks , rising crime and the failure of many immigrants to integrate into society .

the spd should be proud of what it ’ s achieved so far , said the chancellor and party chairman in front of a crowd of more than 500 party delegates .
" some want to write us off or talk us down ... but they have celebrated too early .
what is important is not who leaves the gate first , but who crosses the finish line first , " schröder told his center-left party during an hour-long motivational speech designed to rally the troops prior to the final election count-down .
" we want to win and we will win , " schröder announced to the cheering crowd .
lagging at the polls the spd pre-election pep talk comes just as the most recent voter survey shows chancellor schröder falling well behind the conservative opposition candidate edmund stoiber .
on friday , the emnid polling institute announced the spd had 33 percent voter approval while the conservative coalition of christian democrats and the christian social union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- garnered a steady 39 percent .
the spd voter approval rating has been consistently lower than the cdu / csu since january , despite all attempts to freshen up the party ’ s image and appeal to the people .
the spd-led government simply has a negative streak attached to its name .
it has been hit by sluggish economic growth , rising unemployment rates , a resounding loss in the regional elections in saxony-anhalt , and a corruption scandal in local party branches .
although voters say they still favor the personable schröder over his somewhat more stilted opponent stoiber , many view the spd as a party of stagnation , unable to push through necessary reforms .
these alienated voters point to germany ’ s high unemployment rate and the struggling economy as signs that the spd has not done enough to improve the current condition of millions of germans .
election-time promises denouncing his party ’ s critics , schröder opened the official election campaign with remarks highlighting the spd ’ s record on family support , education reform , reducing the national debt , and improving germany ’ s international market competition .
the chancellor pointed out that under the spd-led coalition the german government has managed to balance free-market economics with a solid social welfare network .
the spd-led government has thereby proven that an administration can combine the parameters for economic success with social security , schröder told the party delegates under the slogan " innovation and cohesion " , the chancellor described the spd as the party that is " willing and able to reform -lsb- government -rsb- without neglecting anyone . "
modernity and justice belong together , he said .
and whoever believes that in this age the " social welfare state can be trampled upon , is not democratic , but rather out-dated . "
schröder admitted that unemployment , hovering at around four million , had not fallen by as much as he had planned when he took office four years ago .
but , he noted that april ’ s jobless figures were half a million below those in 1998 .
improving the job market will be one of schröder ’ s main goals if he gets re-elected in the fall .
although schröder has faced some calls from within the party to amend his election campaign platform to win back alienated voters on the left , he did not announce any major policy shifts from the existing manifesto , nor did any party members challenge his campaign platform .
it was endorsed by 520 party delegates on sunday .
only two were against it and four abstained from voting .
in concluding his speech , schröder said the upcoming election " is about a choice between the future or the past , between progress or regression , between vision of a socially responsible and modern germany or the resurgence of the inappropriate old recipes of yesterday .

what is important is not who leaves the gate first , but who crosses the finish line first , " schröder told his center-left party during an hour-long motivational speech designed to rally the troops prior to the final election count-down .
" we want to win and we will win , " schröder announced to the cheering crowd .
lagging at the polls the spd pre-election pep talk comes just as the most recent voter survey shows chancellor schröder falling well behind the conservative opposition candidate edmund stoiber .
on friday , the emnid polling institute announced the spd had 33 percent voter approval while the conservative coalition of christian democrats and the christian social union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- garnered a steady 39 percent .
the spd voter approval rating has been consistently lower than the cdu / csu since january , despite all attempts to freshen up the party ’ s image and appeal to the people .
the spd-led government simply has a negative streak attached to its name .
it has been hit by sluggish economic growth , rising unemployment rates , a resounding loss in the regional elections in saxony-anhalt , and a corruption scandal in local party branches .
although voters say they still favor the personable schröder over his somewhat more stilted opponent stoiber , many view the spd as a party of stagnation , unable to push through necessary reforms .
these alienated voters point to germany ’ s high unemployment rate and the struggling economy as signs that the spd has not done enough to improve the current condition of millions of germans .
election-time promises denouncing his party ’ s critics , schröder opened the official election campaign with remarks highlighting the spd ’ s record on family support , education reform , reducing the national debt , and improving germany ’ s international market competition .
the chancellor pointed out that under the spd-led coalition the german government has managed to balance free-market economics with a solid social welfare network .
the spd-led government has thereby proven that an administration can combine the parameters for economic success with social security , schröder told the party delegates under the slogan " innovation and cohesion " , the chancellor described the spd as the party that is " willing and able to reform -lsb- government -rsb- without neglecting anyone . "
modernity and justice belong together , he said .
and whoever believes that in this age the " social welfare state can be trampled upon , is not democratic , but rather out-dated . "
schröder admitted that unemployment , hovering at around four million , had not fallen by as much as he had planned when he took office four years ago .
but , he noted that april ’ s jobless figures were half a million below those in 1998 .
improving the job market will be one of schröder ’ s main goals if he gets re-elected in the fall .
although schröder has faced some calls from within the party to amend his election campaign platform to win back alienated voters on the left , he did not announce any major policy shifts from the existing manifesto , nor did any party members challenge his campaign platform .
it was endorsed by 520 party delegates on sunday .
only two were against it and four abstained from voting .
in concluding his speech , schröder said the upcoming election " is about a choice between the future or the past , between progress or regression , between vision of a socially responsible and modern germany or the resurgence of the inappropriate old recipes of yesterday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.06.2002 nitrofen scandal reveals historical traces großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german wheat in its natural state , before it was tainted by nitrofen after days of pointing fingers , a government task force has identified a former east german warehouse as the source of the banned herbicide nitrofen , which mysteriously popped up in organic food during the last month . over the weekend , consumer protection and agriculture minister renate künast announced that a governmental task force had established the source of nitrofen-contaminated wheat used to make poultry feed that was distributed to organic farms throughout germany .
the grain , which was turned into chicken fodder , came from an old warehouse in the north-eastern state of mecklenburg- west pomerania .
located in the former communist east germany , the warehouse was once used as a depot for herbicides and still bears strong traces of the carcinogen nitrofen , a chemical substance long-since banned by the german government .
a particle sample taken from the mecklenburg granary revealed two milligrams of nitrofen per kilogram of dust .
experts say this extremely high chemical concentration explains how the herbicide managed to taint wheat stored in the building and eventually make its way into the food chain via poultry fodder and chicken products .
criminal investigation after the results were made known on saturday , mecklenburg ’ s agricultural minister , till backhaus , immediately shut down the company responsible for storing the contaminated grain , norddeutsche saat- und pflanzgut ag -lrb- nsp -rrb- .
federal prosecutors and state criminal investigators from mecklenburg are now working on the case , tracing back how the former chemical warehouse came to be used for storing food products .
according to agricultural officials , nsp only began renting the warehouse last october .
previously , it was used by an agricultural supplier .
speaking to the press , backhaus expressed his shock over the government ’ s task force findings , and said it was " inconceivable , that a warehouse once used to store herbicides is now being used to store grain . "
backhaus pointed out that nsp had been certified by grünstempel , an organic farming supervisory agency .
normally such a certificate indicates that a thorough background check on the company , including all its warehouse facilities , had been conducted in the course of the certification process .
in the case of nsp this had not happened or the checks were not detailed enough .
government officials working in the state and federal agricultural ministry say they now intend to inspect all grain warehouses with similar east german backgrounds .
so far , however , there is no indication that other granaries have been effected .
pointing fingers now that the source of the contaminated wheat has been determined , organic poultry farmers and feed producers have begun pointing fingers and passing the blame for the nitrofen scandal .
the question on everyone ’ s mind is : why wasn ’ t the tainted wheat identified and made public earlier ?
and who is ultimately responsible ?
consumer groups and organic farmers criticize the federal agriculture ministry and renate künast of the greens party for failing to ensure proper safety guidelines and background checks .
nitrofen , they say , has long been banned as a herbicide in germany , yet very few federal food safety laboratories conduct tests for the substance .
consumers also blame künast for not keeping a closer watch on her own ministry , saying officials were aware of the existence of the feed as early as two months ago .
künast , in turn , blames the traditional farmers ’ federation for the nitrofen scandal .
" this is not , and was not an organic farming scandal , " she said on saturday .
referring to " mafia-like tendencies " connecting the raiffeisen group of farmers ’ credit cooperatives with the farmers ’ federation , künast accused the " old structures " in the feed business of knowing about the contaminated wheat for weeks while trying to turn a profit at the expense of organic farmers .
the only solution , künast said , was to " shut it all down . "
chancellor gerhard schröder defended künast during a pre-election campaign conference for his social democrats on sunday .
he said the nitrofen scandal showed that the government ’ s emphasis on increasing organic farming practices was " more necessary than ever . "
" we must not allow the agricultural shift to be destroyed by the outmoded structures of the farmers ’ federation , " schröder insisted .
he said that in the aftermath of the crisis sparked by bovine spongiform encephalopathy , or mad cow ’ s disease , consumer protection had become the focus of the government ’ s agricultural reform and that more controls had been put into place to guarantee food safety .

a spokesman for cordiant told the reuters news agency that he was unaware of talks with havas at any time during the last six months .
on sunday , the observer newspaper reported that cordiant was mulling a 1bn euro offer from havas , adding that the deal could be done within two weeks .
the reports came as cordiant , once part of legendary advertising group saatchi & saatchi , continues to struggle with falling revenues in the wake of last year 's economic downturn .
financial woes the company 's 2001 pre-tax profits fell by more than half compared with the previous year to 25.7m.
in april , cordiant warned that it did not expect sales to grow this year .
havas is thought to be on the lookout for potential acquisitions in order to keep pace with a wave of consolidation in the global advertising industry .
the french advertising giant raised about 450m euros through bond sales last month , partly in order to fund acquisitions .
earlier this year , havas launched an unsuccessful attempt to buy up its french rival publicis .
it subsequently targeted the media buyer tempus , but was outbid by uk advertising firm wpp .
advertising revenues have slumped worldwide over the past two years due to the dotcom collapse , the economic downturn , and the 11 september attacks .

paul martin was sacked in a cabinet reshuffle on sunday following a clash with the prime minister , jean chretien .
the dismissal of mr martin , credited with taming crippling budget deficits and pushing through economy-boosting tax cuts , unnerved financial markets .
early on monday , one canadian dollar was worth $ 0.65 , 0.56 % lower than late on friday .
" this is a finance minister -lrb- who -rrb- ... enjoyed a very , very high level of credibility in the market , " said benjamin tal , senior economist at cibc world markets .
" the dollar will suffer , no question about it . "
political rivalry the prospect of a bout of political in-fighting within the canadian government in the wake of sunday 's surprise cabinet reshuffle also weighed heavily on the country 's currency .
the canadian dollar 's losses have partially reversed hefty gains since april , fuelled by a string of strong economic data .
mr martin 's dismissal came just days before he was due to host a meeting of finance ministers from the group of seven industrialised nations on 14 and 15 june .
mr martin 's replacement , former deputy prime minister john manley , has signalled that he will maintain his predecessor 's policy of balanced budgets and lower taxes .
mr martin and mr chretien have been bitter political rivals since the two men contested the leadership of canada 's liberal party in 1990 .

the wall street journal 's european edition reported on monday that two of germany 's leading banks , commerzbank and dresdner bank , have verbally agreed to back the proposed new trading system .
each of the banks would be required to invest about 1.2m euros , in return for a 10 % stake in the enterprise , the wall street journal said , citing unnamed sources .
the new exchange , based around an electronic trading platform , is scheduled to go live in january next year .
expansion it would launch with an initial listing of about 300 german and us stocks , later expanding to about 3,000 shares .
the new system would compete directly with deutsche boerse , which currently has a near-monopoly on germany 's equity clearing and settlements market .
nasdaq 's foray into the german share dealing market could stymie the launch of deutsche boerse 's own proposed electronic trading system xetra best , planned for september this year .
nasdaq is hoping its system will capture market share from xetra best by offering more competitive fees to brokers and banks .
japan setback the german venture opens a new front in nasdaq 's drive to expand internationally .
nasdaq is also thought to be pursuing a merger with the london stock exchange .
but its attempts to launch a global exchange linking us , european and japanese stock trading received a setback in japan on monday .
nasdaq japan said in a statement that the osaka stock exchange had delayed implementation of the new system .
the end of the technology boom has hurt nasdaq japan 's performance .
it has listed just 95 companies in japan to date , falling short of its target of 230 .

thoroughly modern millie , the story of an ambitious flapper , won six awards , including best musical and a best-actress-in-a-musical award for its star , sutton foster , at the us theatre world 's equivalent of the hollywood oscars .
the goat , by who 's afraid of virginia woolf ? author edward albee , was named best play at the ceremony in new york , which was screened live across america .
a top theatre world official said that the prizes had shown broadway was back in business after the disastrous effect of the 11 september terror attacks .
" to say this is a dream come true is an understatement , " said foster , 27 , after receiving her award .
the musical , which is based on a 1967 julie andrews film of the same title , also took prizes for best featured actress , choreography , costumes , and orchestrations .
but the musical awards for best direction , book and score went to urinetown , a fringe satire about a city where everyone has to pay to use the toilets .
correspondents say it is not unusual for a musical to win for book and score only to lose the top prize - as was the case in 1998 when ragtime lost to the lion king .
' a play about love ' albee , 74 , last received a tony in 1963 when who 's afraid ? won the award for best play .
" i do n't get many rides to the tonys , " he joked .
in his play , a man has a love affair with a goat , and the veteran writer thanked his producers for their " outrageous faith that broadway was ready to see a play about love " .
other prizes went to more traditional plays while some favourites went away empty-handed : alan bates won the award for best leading man and frank langella for best featured role in fortune 's fool , an adaptation of an 1848 work by russian author ivan turgenev .
a production of noel coward 's private lives took three tonys including one for best revival of a play and one for lindsay duncan as best actress .
veteran actress elaine stritch , 76 , won her first tony , taking the award for best special theatrical event with her elaine stritch at liberty show .
shuler hensley won as featured actor in a musical for his portrayal of jud in oklahoma ! , katie finneran took the featured actress tony for noises off and mary zimmerman won as best director of a play for her production of ovid 's metamorphoses .
the musical mamma mia ! and two highly acclaimed plays - the crucible starring liam neeson and morning 's at seven - took no awards despite being heavily nominated .
jed bernstein , head of the league of american theatres and producers , said the 2002 tonys were more evenly divided than the previous year 's when the producers swept the board .
assessing the effects of 11 september and the lingering economic downturn , he concluded that broadway had " rebounded " .
greg kotis , the creative force behind urinetown , said broadway had " the beneficiary of the goodwill of the public and the country " .

correspondents say it is not unusual for a musical to win for book and score only to lose the top prize - as was the case in 1998 when ragtime lost to the lion king .
' a play about love ' albee , 74 , last received a tony in 1963 when who 's afraid ? won the award for best play .
" i do n't get many rides to the tonys , " he joked .
in his play , a man has a love affair with a goat , and the veteran writer thanked his producers for their " outrageous faith that broadway was ready to see a play about love " .
other prizes went to more traditional plays while some favourites went away empty-handed : alan bates won the award for best leading man and frank langella for best featured role in fortune 's fool , an adaptation of an 1848 work by russian author ivan turgenev .
a production of noel coward 's private lives took three tonys including one for best revival of a play and one for lindsay duncan as best actress .
bates said his win was " like a hallucination " veteran actress elaine stritch , 76 , won her first tony , taking the award for best special theatrical event with her elaine stritch at liberty show .
shuler hensley won as featured actor in a musical for his portrayal of jud in oklahoma ! , katie finneran took the featured actress tony for noises off and mary zimmerman won as best director of a play for her production of ovid 's metamorphoses .
the musical mamma mia ! and two highly acclaimed plays - the crucible starring liam neeson and morning 's at seven - took no awards despite being heavily nominated .
jed bernstein , head of the league of american theatres and producers , said the 2002 tonys were more evenly divided than the previous year 's when the producers swept the board .
assessing the effects of 11 september and the lingering economic downturn , he concluded that broadway had " rebounded " .
greg kotis , the creative force behind urinetown , said broadway had " the beneficiary of the goodwill of the public and the country " .

" $ 233 million to save many lives seems a very inexpensive price tag " dr yasuhiro suzuki who doctors , scientists , aid agencies , donor governments and pharmaceutical companies are meeting in the south african city in an attempt to raise $ 233 million in research funds .
the conference 's organisers say most vaccine research is conducted in the west and may not be relevant to africa which suffers from some strains of the virus not found anywhere else in the world .
" a vaccine for africa would be the best long-term preventive measure against aids , " said peter piot , the executive director of unaids which is running the conference along with the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- .
" enormous efforts should go into this initiative , which could help address the health and development tragedy that aids has become for many african countries . "
african researchers the who 's executive director for health technology and pharmaceuticals , dr yasuhiro suzuki , said the amount was relatively small given the many positive things it could do .
aids in africa 40 million people infected with hiv worldwide , 70 % of whom are african leading cause of death on african continent african vaccine research receives only 1.6 % of funding spent globally on aids research of 30 hiv trials conducted globally since 1987 , only two held in africa " considering that the average cost of developing new prescription drugs in the us is $ 800 million , $ 233 million to save many lives seems a very inexpensive price tag , " he said .
the african aids vaccine programme uses an active strategy of recruiting african scientists and institutions , partly in response to the inadequacy of research infrastructures .
some of the funding the programme hopes to raise will go towards improving local facilities and expertise .
the cape town meeting follows on from a landmark agreement signed by 15 african heads of state during their summit in nigeria last year .
they decided to establish a research project in africa aimed at developing an aids vaccine for africans .

and since the matches take place when most brazilians are usually still in bed , a number of employers are opening for business later than usual so their employees can watch .
other companies are stopping work when brazil has a game .
for previous world cups in football-mad brazil , businesses and banks would close shortly before the team walked onto the pitch , and the entire country would be glued to the tv for each game .
civil servants : time off to watch ronaldo and co with this world cup being held in korea and japan , brazil 's first match - against turkey - began monday at 0600 local time in brazil -lrb- 0900 gmt -rrb- .
at the general motors factory in greater sao paulo , management and employees reached an agreement that will allow everyone to watch the games .
the company has set up a huge screen , and during the matches , production is being halted to enable workers to cheer for the national squad .
and on those days that the brazilian team has a game at 0330 local time in brazil , employees will be allowed to clock in at 0800 , two hours later than the normal start time of 0600 .
late rush hour at the sao paulo underground transit network , the largest in the country , the administrative department is starting work at 1000 .
noon start for federal government workers on match days the trains are sticking to the usual schedule , but they are pulling a reduced number of carriages .
the company believes that rush hour will start after 0800 , once the matches are over .
but there can be no doubt that federal government workers will benefit the most from these match-day arrangements .
their working day will only start at midday and will end at 1900 , even though normal working hours are from 0800 to 0600 .
the decision to allow employees to begin work later than usual was made by the brazilian president 's civil cabinet office .
the government said the measure would benefit the population , given that on match days , traffic jams are commonplace .
coffee , not beer the bar and restaurant sector , which has always profited from the games , selling endless rounds of beer , is this year investing in breakfast with a world cup theme .
clients are drinking coffee while they watch the games on extra-large , high-definition screens .
paulo , an executive who preferred not to give his surname , said before the world cup began that he would be getting up early to watch the game at one of sao paulo 's traditional bakeries .
when asked if he would wake up so early for work , he was very quick to reply : " no way " .
emergency services but brazilians can relax , safe in the knowledge that in case of an emergency there will be no problem .
for essential services it will be business as usual .
twenty-four hour drugstores will remain open , as will supermarkets , street markets , municipal markets , banks and petrol stations .
