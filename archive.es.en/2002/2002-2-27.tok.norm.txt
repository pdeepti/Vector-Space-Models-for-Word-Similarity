the international narcotics control board -lrb- incb -rrb- says in its 2001 report that illegal drugs are being sold over the internet , often with the aid of private chat rooms protected from law enforcers .
heroin use is on the increase worldwide drug dealers using the internet are often evading capture because of the failure by some countries to adopt laws on cyber crime , the report says .
the inib , based in vienna , also revealed that burma became the world 's top illicit opium producer last year after cultivation in afghanistan was stopped in 2000 by the former taleban regime .
the board is also urging countries to resist calls for the legalisation of cannabis , saying it would be an " historical mistake " to treat the drug like alcohol or tobacco .

dutch firms were using the web to sell cannabis seeds and products all over the world , the report revealed .
the incb said it believed young people were particularly at risk from drug dealers using the internet .
it found that dealers were using internet bank accounts to launder drug money , while online pharmacies were making prescription-only drugs readily available .
the taleban prohibited the cultivation of opium it added : " the incb is particularly concerned that countries without adequate legislation against crime involving new technologies may become sanctuaries . "
in africa , the board said it feared that the increase in intravenous heroin use would hasten the spread of hiv / aids on the continent .
in south africa alone , intravenous drug use had increased 40 % in the past three years .
in north america , the use of cocaine appeared to be stabilising but heroin abuse among the young was increasing .

a row has been developing between holyrood and westminster after it emerged london may have the legal power to overrule any decision taken on the issue by msps .
new legal advice at westminster suggests that the scottish executive may have the power to deny planning access to any new power station but westminster could have the final say because it has an obligation to ensure secure energy supplies for britain .
the dispute emerged on the day that britain 's two nuclear electricity generators , british energy and british nuclear fuels -lrb- bnfl -rrb- , signed a deal to develop a new generation of reactors .
earlier this month , a uk-wide energy review left open the option of more nuclear power in britain .
opposition parties reacted furiously to scotland office minister george foulkes ' comments over the matter .
he told the bbc : " anyone looking at it logically would think it would n't be for a legislature which has powers devolved from westminster to then thwart the policy of a uk government on areas which are clearly reserved to westminster , such as energy and defence .
' unambiguous position ' " it would look a wee bit daft if , in reserved areas , decisions were being made north of the border which had a very significant impact south of the border . "
but mr wilson said the position was clear .
he said : " the position is unambiguous .
if anyone wants to build a power station of any kind in scotland , it will be a matter for the scottish executive to determine .
end of story . "
the scottish national party claimed uk ministers were seeking to undermine the powers of the scottish parliament .
the scottish conservatives said it was just more evidence of new labour squabbling over sovereignty .
however , the executive maintained that the power lay with them .
an executive spokesman said : " under the scotland act , scottish ministers have been given the power to decide on planning decisions in scotland , including consents for power stations under the electricity act .
" they do so with regard to all relevant considerations including uk legislation and policy , as well as scottish-specific planning and environmental controls .
" in practice , there will be close consultation between the scottish executive and the uk government on both the development and implementation of policy . "
