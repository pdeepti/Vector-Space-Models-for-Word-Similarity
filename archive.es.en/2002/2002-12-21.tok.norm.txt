advocates of “ baby hatches ” say they save unwanted children , critics say they encourage infant “ disposal ” . “ we ’ ll take your child when no one else will .
without asking your name , without asking questions … ” those were the words posted in public places in the northern city of hamburg in 1999 , when germany ’ s first “ baby hatches ” appeared here .
the hatches , fitted into hospital walls , allowed mothers unable , or unwilling , to care for their infants a way to abandon them , without endangering the baby ’ s health . the idea is not new .
convents throughout europe in the middle ages accepted abandoned babies left by unknown mothers .
as the 20th century came to a close , the idea returned in updated form .
the baby boxes were seen as an almost desperate measure to counter the increasing instances of infants being abandoned in public toilets or garbage dumps , many of them dead from exposure . “ we set up this system up because we were aware that young children were occasionally being abandoned , ” said siegbert heck , head of pediatrics at the waldfriede hospital in berlin .

half of those babies have died by the time they are discovered .
we don ’ t want it to come to that . ” how it works the city of berlin set up its own baby hatches in 2000 , and in the past two years hospitals here have had eleven children left in them .
behind the hatch itself , a small bed and blanket await the newborn child . there is a letter in german , polish , turkish and russian explaining the procedure to the mother and a means of recognizing the child that woman can use later to get news on or reclaim her baby .
one minute after the hatch is activated , a signal goes off alerting staff or volunteers who come and care for the child . “ it ’ s always a strange feeling you get in your stomach , when you still don ’ t know what condition the child will be in , ” said vera kromrei , a pediatric nurse at waldfriede .
“ if it turns out to be healthy , we ’ re happy .
we give the children a lot of love and care , and we ’ re glad we can look after them . ” if the mother does not return for eight weeks , the child is put up for adoption . proponents say the 70 baby hatches around germany today save the lives of children who could likely die otherwise .
it gives mothers overwhelmed by their circumstances a way out , without endangering the infant .
if the child is sick or malnourished , it can be given immediate treatment . does it help ? but the hatches have remained controversial since their inception and they have their detractors .
experts say that since the hatches have been introduced , the number of abandoned infants has not actually gone down .
opponents say that shows that the really desperate mothers are not being reached . “ i have the suspicion that the existing baby hatches induce people to simply “ dispose ” of their child in the hatch , rather than taking the rockier road involved in finding another way to solve the problem , ” said sabine walther of the german society for the protection of children , a group which opposes the baby hatch idea and tries to encourage adoption as an alternative . critics , including some high-profile ones like angela merkel , head of the conservative christian democratic party , say the hatches allow women to give birth anonymously , which is technically illegal in germany but tolerated .
normally doctors or midwives are required to register the names of women giving birth .
anonymous births make it impossible for children to search for their mothers or fathers later , opponents say , leaving the children rootless for the rest of their lives . “ according to the law , you can not preserve anonymity , but in fact , when a foundling is discovered or handed over , you have to inform the police and take the proper measures , ” said ulrike herpich-behrens of berlin ’ s juvenile affairs division . but that does not reflect today ’ s reality , according to baby hatch proponents .
they admit the idea is far from ideal , but say it is better for the child to end up in alive in a hospital than dead in a garbage dumpster . “ our deepest wish , naturally , is that the mothers seek out our help and then come back to look for their children , ” said ursula kuenning , a coordinator at berlin ’ s baby hatch program . that wish is rarely fulfilled .

advocates of “ baby hatches ” say they save unwanted children , critics say they encourage infant “ disposal ” . “ we ’ ll take your child when no one else will .
without asking your name , without asking questions … ” those were the words posted in public places in the northern city of hamburg in 1999 , when germany ’ s first “ baby hatches ” appeared here .
the hatches , fitted into hospital walls , allowed mothers unable , or unwilling , to care for their infants a way to abandon them , without endangering the baby ’ s health . the idea is not new .
convents throughout europe in the middle ages accepted abandoned babies left by unknown mothers .
as the 20th century came to a close , the idea returned in updated form .
the baby boxes were seen as an almost desperate measure to counter the increasing instances of infants being abandoned in public toilets or garbage dumps , many of them dead from exposure . “ we set up this system up because we were aware that young children were occasionally being abandoned , ” said siegbert heck , head of pediatrics at the waldfriede hospital in berlin . " it happens between 40 and 50 times a year in germany .
half of those babies have died by the time they are discovered .
we don ’ t want it to come to that . ” how it works the city of berlin set up its own baby hatches in 2000 , and in the past two years hospitals here have had eleven children left in them .
behind the hatch itself , a small bed and blanket await the newborn child . there is a letter in german , polish , turkish and russian explaining the procedure to the mother and a means of recognizing the child that woman can use later to get news on or reclaim her baby .
one minute after the hatch is activated , a signal goes off alerting staff or volunteers who come and care for the child . “ it ’ s always a strange feeling you get in your stomach , when you still don ’ t know what condition the child will be in , ” said vera kromrei , a pediatric nurse at waldfriede .
“ if it turns out to be healthy , we ’ re happy .
we give the children a lot of love and care , and we ’ re glad we can look after them . ” if the mother does not return for eight weeks , the child is put up for adoption . proponents say the 70 baby hatches around germany today save the lives of children who could likely die otherwise .
it gives mothers overwhelmed by their circumstances a way out , without endangering the infant .
if the child is sick or malnourished , it can be given immediate treatment . does it help ? but the hatches have remained controversial since their inception and they have their detractors .
experts say that since the hatches have been introduced , the number of abandoned infants has not actually gone down .
opponents say that shows that the really desperate mothers are not being reached . “ i have the suspicion that the existing baby hatches induce people to simply “ dispose ” of their child in the hatch , rather than taking the rockier road involved in finding another way to solve the problem , ” said sabine walther of the german society for the protection of children , a group which opposes the baby hatch idea and tries to encourage adoption as an alternative . critics , including some high-profile ones like angela merkel , head of the conservative christian democratic party , say the hatches allow women to give birth anonymously , which is technically illegal in germany but tolerated .
normally doctors or midwives are required to register the names of women giving birth .
anonymous births make it impossible for children to search for their mothers or fathers later , opponents say , leaving the children rootless for the rest of their lives . “ according to the law , you can not preserve anonymity , but in fact , when a foundling is discovered or handed over , you have to inform the police and take the proper measures , ” said ulrike herpich-behrens of berlin ’ s juvenile affairs division . but that does not reflect today ’ s reality , according to baby hatch proponents .
they admit the idea is far from ideal , but say it is better for the child to end up in alive in a hospital than dead in a garbage dumpster . “ our deepest wish , naturally , is that the mothers seek out our help and then come back to look for their children , ” said ursula kuenning , a coordinator at berlin ’ s baby hatch program . that wish is rarely fulfilled .

advocates of “ baby hatches ” say they save unwanted children , critics say they encourage infant “ disposal ” . “ we ’ ll take your child when no one else will .
without asking your name , without asking questions … ” those were the words posted in public places in the northern city of hamburg in 1999 , when germany ’ s first “ baby hatches ” appeared here .
the hatches , fitted into hospital walls , allowed mothers unable , or unwilling , to care for their infants a way to abandon them , without endangering the baby ’ s health . the idea is not new .
convents throughout europe in the middle ages accepted abandoned babies left by unknown mothers .
as the 20th century came to a close , the idea returned in updated form .
the baby boxes were seen as an almost desperate measure to counter the increasing instances of infants being abandoned in public toilets or garbage dumps , many of them dead from exposure . “ we set up this system up because we were aware that young children were occasionally being abandoned , ” said siegbert heck , head of pediatrics at the waldfriede hospital in berlin . " it happens between 40 and 50 times a year in germany .
half of those babies have died by the time they are discovered .
we don ’ t want it to come to that . ” how it works the city of berlin set up its own baby hatches in 2000 , and in the past two years hospitals here have had eleven children left in them .
behind the hatch itself , a small bed and blanket await the newborn child . there is a letter in german , polish , turkish and russian explaining the procedure to the mother and a means of recognizing the child that woman can use later to get news on or reclaim her baby .
one minute after the hatch is activated , a signal goes off alerting staff or volunteers who come and care for the child . “ it ’ s always a strange feeling you get in your stomach , when you still don ’ t know what condition the child will be in , ” said vera kromrei , a pediatric nurse at waldfriede .
“ if it turns out to be healthy , we ’ re happy .
we give the children a lot of love and care , and we ’ re glad we can look after them . ” if the mother does not return for eight weeks , the child is put up for adoption . proponents say the 70 baby hatches around germany today save the lives of children who could likely die otherwise .
it gives mothers overwhelmed by their circumstances a way out , without endangering the infant .
if the child is sick or malnourished , it can be given immediate treatment . does it help ? but the hatches have remained controversial since their inception and they have their detractors .
experts say that since the hatches have been introduced , the number of abandoned infants has not actually gone down .
opponents say that shows that the really desperate mothers are not being reached . “ i have the suspicion that the existing baby hatches induce people to simply “ dispose ” of their child in the hatch , rather than taking the rockier road involved in finding another way to solve the problem , ” said sabine walther of the german society for the protection of children , a group which opposes the baby hatch idea and tries to encourage adoption as an alternative . critics , including some high-profile ones like angela merkel , head of the conservative christian democratic party , say the hatches allow women to give birth anonymously , which is technically illegal in germany but tolerated .
normally doctors or midwives are required to register the names of women giving birth .
anonymous births make it impossible for children to search for their mothers or fathers later , opponents say , leaving the children rootless for the rest of their lives . “ according to the law , you can not preserve anonymity , but in fact , when a foundling is discovered or handed over , you have to inform the police and take the proper measures , ” said ulrike herpich-behrens of berlin ’ s juvenile affairs division . but that does not reflect today ’ s reality , according to baby hatch proponents .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- rawhide comes out of the closet news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : entertainment news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk saturday , 21 december , 2002 , 07:54 gmt rawhide comes out of the closet the new gay character will be portaryed with humour marvel is breaking the mould of traditional macho comic characters by introducing to its pages the first gay cowboy .
by maggie shiels in california in the world of comics , more and more characters are announcing they are gay but few of them make much of an impression and none have a lead role .
step forward the rawhide kid .
the fastest gun in the west with a sense of style and some killer one liners is the latest character to emerge as gay .
in february next year , marvel comics ' rawhide kid will ride into town on his trusty steed apache in a series of adventures entitled slap leather .
think comedy along the lines of the popular tv series will and grace .
what i have always appreciated about marvel comics is that they deal with the crisis of masculinity carla freccero , professor of literature for chroniclers of popular culture , making the star of the comic gay is a move that is being described as enlightened and long overdue .
carla freccero , a professor of literature at the university of california santa cruz and the author of popular culture : an introduction , said rawhide was more explicit .
she said : " there have always been gay characters in the media .
it 's just that up until now they were represented in insinuating ways as in the closet or in swishy or covert ways . "
comic trailblazers indeed , the number of gays making their way into comic storylines is on the increase .
marvel comics broke ground in the early 1990s when they brought the popular alpha flight and now x-men character north star out of the closet .
other major roles include terry berg , a gay teenage supporting character in dc comics ' green lantern to a lesbian character in supergirl .
the rawhide kid will take a lot of pride in his appearance at comic-con international , the world 's biggest comic convention , the role of gays and lesbians in comics merits its own panel .
attendees at this year 's event in san diego were told the rise in characters with alternative lifestyles had evolved as comic books experienced a rebirth of sorts thanks to hit movies like x-men and spider-man .
professor freccero says the public has always been receptive to minority characters as long as they are well written and do not pander to stereotypes .
" the problem i see with gay characters on tv is that the only really remarkable thing about them is that they are gay .
" everything does n't and should n't revolve around that fact .
what i have always appreciated about marvel comics is that they deal with the crisis of masculinity .
" i see this as consistent with their critique of mainstream masculinity . "
withering criticism as to the rawhide kid , marvel 's decision to dust off the scourge of desperadoes the world over was one that senior editor axel alonso said made sense .
" the kid stands out from the pack .
he is just too damn good looking .
" he wears an immaculate blue black leather outfit , a white hat and he ¹ s got flaming red hair and he 's a little fastidious and tidy than the rest of the lot .
so we figured that plus the name just fit . "
but before kid has even hit newstands , he has been subjected to some withering criticism .
the american family association has been leading the charge with claims that the comic is an attempt to introduce children to homosexuality .
afa journal editor ed vitagliano said : " if the new rawhide kid comic series is not an attempt to promote homosexuality , then why purposefully change a character into a homosexual ?
it seems to suggest there is some agenda at work . "
mr alonso is quick off the mark to point out that the rawhide kid comics are for adult eyes only .
humorous touch in the other corner is the gay lobby which is delighted to have the rawhide kid batting for their team .
cathy renna of the gay and lesbian alliance against defamation said : " lesbian and gay characters have become an increasing presence in comics .
" comics are a medium that can be fun or serious , and there should be room for many kinds of representations . "
while the gay issue is one that has earned marvel a ton of headlines , it 's also one they do n't want to go overboard on .
they stress this will be a comedic driven western with a gay gunslinger at the heart of the action .
mr alonso said : " there is not an agenda at work .
marvel wants to do books that reflect society in all its shapes and forms .
" this is not a gay outreach programme .
generally speaking in comics , characters are either paragons of moral virtue or victims .

now the bbc is going one better , suggesting that jesus ' mother mary may not have been a virgin .
the programme has stirred protest from several church leaders even before it has been broadcast .
yet many christians today reject the traditional gospel account of christ 's virgin birth .
mary is not in any case a christian monopoly .
she is a figure of veneration as well to many muslims , who normally call her miriam .
this italian statue shows mary 's cult mary 's reputation in christian terms is pretty well non-negotiable , because the creeds , the ancient formulas summing up the doctrine all believers are supposed to subscribe to , describe her as a virgin : the woman who gave birth to the saviour because god , not man , had made her pregnant .
the bbc programme , the virgin mary , to be shown on bbc one on 22 december. suggests other possible reasons for the birth of jesus , widely acknowledged to have been a historical figure .
theories dismissed it says she could have conceived and borne her son in three other ways : by a secret lover , a possibility the programme dismisses as unlikely after being raped by a roman soldier .
one later writer suggested this , but it appears even less likely , having been made pregnant by joseph , to whom she was engaged .
this seems quite possible , as engaged couples often did live together at the time .
for the faithful , such attempts at interpreting the doctrine of the virgin birth are at best unnecessary , and probably hurtful as well .
but there are reasons - apart from the basic scientific improbability of the traditional account - for rejecting the versions of the evangelists who wrote the gospels .
the four gospels - by matthew , mark , luke and john - were in any case not attempts at biography as we understand it today .
' mistranslation ' each was written to advance a particular theological understanding of jesus .
the virgin birth tradition derives at least partly from a passage in the book attributed to the prophet isaiah : " behold , a virgin shall conceive , and bear a son ... "
other belief systems current in the middle east at the time of christ 's birth also speak of a miraculous birth of a leader to a virgin .
christmas carols : nostalgic - and accurate ?
and the word translated as " virgin " in our bibles , scholars say , may well have meant no more in the original than " young girl " or " maiden " .
belief in the virgin birth is part of mainstream christian doctrine , but veneration of mary is much less common with protestants than in the catholic and orthodox churches .
even in protestantism , though , questioning it can cause controversy .
thinking again in 1994 a leader of the church of scotland said in a sermon that the virgin birth was symbolic , and that the bible need not be taken literally .
a church spokesperson commented : " there is a diversity of opinion on the issue .
but there remains a diversity of opinion over whether there should be a diversity of opinion . "
for anglicans , it may be a little easier .
the new archbishop of canterbury , dr rowan williams , recently said : " it seems to me rather sad , and rather revealing , that ... we suddenly become much less intelligent about our reading of the bible . "
he was talking about attitudes to sex .
but he did hold open the possibility that the bible is there to be interpreted , not simply accepted without question .

the four - the united states , russia , the united nations and the european union - met in washington to discuss the " road map " that proposes the creation of two states living side by side .
netanyahu criticised uk plans for talks " the roadmap is not complete yet , but the united states is committed to its completion , we are committed to its implementation in the name of peace , " president george w bush told reporters .
also on friday , israeli foreign minister binyamin netanyahu met uk foreign secretary jack straw in london .
their talks came after the announcement of a british plan to hold discussions with palestinian leaders next month , a move criticised by mr netanyahu .
a spokesman for the uk foreign office said mr straw and mr netanyahu had a " good discussion " .
frustration the eu had been pushing for the road map peace plan to be published at the washington meeting , arguing that the whole process needs momentum .
it says time is running out if the 2005 deadline for the creation of a permanent palestinian state is to be met .
but the us says it wants to wait until after the israeli general election , scheduled for the end of january , before releasing exact details of the plan .
the delegates want to show they have not forgotten the middle east the bbc 's michael buchanan says the washington meeting allows the quartet to demonstrate to the outside world that , while iraq may be the focus of most international attention at the moment , the continued unrest in the middle east has not been forgotten .
however , our correspondent says , there is increasing frustration about the role the us is playing .
speaking earlier this week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana bemoaned the lack of a committed american partner in the process .
