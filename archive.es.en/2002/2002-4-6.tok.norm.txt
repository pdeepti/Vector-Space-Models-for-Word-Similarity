father don rooney 's body was discovered slumped in his car in a shopping centre car park in cleveland , ohio , with a gunshot wound to the head , police said .
a suicide note was reported to have been found near the body .
the alarm was raised after 48-year-old rooney failed to appear at a meeting with local church officials to discuss allegations that he had molested a woman when she was still in her teens during the early 1980s .
latest scandal the allegations , which came to light after the unnamed woman contacted church leaders , have not been fully investigated or substantiated .
in a statement rooney 's diocese asked for " god 's healing balm on the lives of father don 's mother and his family " .
rooney 's apparent suicide is the latest in a series of scandals to rock the american catholic church .
earlier this week new york 's roman catholic archdiocese gave government prosecutors a list of priests who have been accused of sexually abusing children in the past .
the archdiocese also set out new guidelines for handling fresh allegations .
the move was seen as a major u-turn following strong public pressure on the church in new york .
new york 's cardinal , john egan , has been accused of helping cover up such cases when he was a bishop in connecticut .
there is growing attention across the united states to allegations of child sexual abuse against priests , after scandals from boston to florida .

bbc news -pipe- film -pipe- figgis unlocks hotel 's secrets categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : entertainment : film front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment showbiz music film arts tv and radio new media reviews talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 6 april , 2002 , 07:29 gmt 08:29 uk figgis unlocks hotel 's secrets figgis : specialises in experimental cinema by tom brook bbc news online entertainment correspondent hotel , a new film from director mike figgis , attempts to push the boundaries of cinematic storytelling through its use of digital video , night vision lenses and split screens .
it is the latest work from a director who two years ago made time code , widely regarded as a groundbreaking film .
hotel stars david schwimmer -lrb- right -rrb- as a movie producer time code 's plot unfolds in real time on four separate quadrants all placed within a larger screen .
in hotel , figgis is aided by an all-star cast that includes salma hayek , burt reynolds and david schwimmer .
but the story he tells is again anything but mainstream .
assassin it revolves around a film crew that has gathered at an art deco hotel in venice .
they are making a movie based on the jacobean revenge tragedy the duchess of malfi .
the crew is trying to operate according to the strict minimalist dogme school of film-making .
notting hill star rhys ifans is shot in the movie this requires that cameras be handheld and there be no special lighting .
the man directing this dogme film-within-a-film is played by rhys ifans , best known for playing spike in notting hill .
figgis explains that the drama intensifies when the director is shot by an assassin .
" he fails to kill him but puts him into a coma within which he can hear and see everything that 's going on , but he just ca n't move .
it 's the ultimate nightmare for a director , " says figgis .
what then happens is that the producer of the film , portrayed by schwimmer , takes over .
and figgis says : " you start to realise that perhaps the producer is a little bit more involved in the assassination attempt than first thought . "
mind-boggling this is all relatively straightforward but the picture takes a strange twist as cannibals and vampires , who are members of the hotel staff , begin to prey on the film company .
there is also a surfeit of bizarre sexual activity added into the mix .
burt reynolds was just one of a multiple cast at times , the split-screen images are quite dense and complex .
at one point , as figgis describes , the audience can see simultaneously three very different scenes .
one shows a night journey through venice by canal .
another , sees the revival of the comatose director .
in the third , one of the characters in the film is singing a piece of schubert lieder , der doppelganger .
it may sound a little mind-boggling but figgis calmly maintains that to him " it all makes complete sense " .
his cast seems to share his enthusiasm .
schwimmer says : " i loved how he used a variety of images , just one screen , two screens you know .
" they would fade in , fade out .
i think he 's experimenting with a new art form . "
improvise figgis has an uncanny ability to get top hollywood actors to take part in his films for very little money .
often the draw is the promise that they will be able to improvise and create their own onscreen personas .
salma hayek had no script to follow this was the case with hayek , who plays charlee boux , an exuberant , but mindless , mtv-style entertainment reporter who is putting together a behind the scenes story on the making of the film .
hayek was prepared to improvise but she was a little surprised by the amount of creative freedom she was granted .
she recalls that figgis gave her little time to prepare .
" he told me a day before .
i said , ' what am i playing ? ' and he responded , ' you 're playing an mtv personality . " '
hayek admits she found this a little odd because she wondered why an mtv reporter would be on the set of a dogme art film with no big name stars .
she says that when she brought this up with figgis he told her : " that 's your problem , you have to figure it out .
so you know i invented a story . "
struggle when hotel was first shown at the toronto film festival last year it elicited a memorable response from the trade paper the hollywood reporter .
its critic described hotel as " an achingly pretentious slab of total nonsense " .
since then , some changes have been made but hotel remains a film with limited commercial potential struggling to find distribution .
in fairness , figgis ' experimental work has many admirers who applaud his efforts to redefine cinema using modern technology .
the director has enjoyed commercial success with films like his 1990 crime thriller internal affairs starring richard gere .
he was also feted for his 1995 oscar nominated leaving las vegas which earned nicolas cage a best actor trophy .
but figgis has decided to take a non-hollywood route by embracing small digital cameras , some of which he operates himself .
he employs unusual shooting and editing techniques to create some idiosyncratic works .
his films , like time code and hotel , may not be to everyone 's taste .
but he is addressing an urgent issue that affects mainstream and non-mainstream film-makers alike .
this is the need to develop some fresh approaches to modern cinema to make storytelling more engaging and vibrant .

discussions are likely to be dominated by the middle east crisis , with talks on possible military action against iraq only a second priority .
mr blair was met in waco by mr bush 's national security adviser , condoleeza rice , before boarding a helicopter to the president 's private prairie chapel ranch in nearby crawford . "
we ca n't pick and choose the interlocutors we have , but it 's important to make sure the dialogue is resumed " tony blair on arafat and sharon plans for military action against iraq over its alleged build-up of weapons of mass destruction had been expected to dominate the summit in texas .
but the focus shifted to the middle east conflict amid escalating violence and after president bush called on israel to withdraw from palestinian areas and implement a ceasefire .
mr blair told reporters travelling with him : " we will obviously be looking at ideas that can lead to a ceasefire , which is the essential precondition so that they get back into a process of political dialogue . "
' few grounds for optimism ' the prime minister confirmed the focus would now be on achieving the pause in israeli-palestinian violence needed for us secretary of state colin powell to hold productive talks in the region .
" what 's important is to make sure that we have the minimum agreements necessary in order for this influence to happen , " mr blair said .
he added there were " few grounds for optimism " , but said he believed neither israel nor the palestinian authority wanted the current situation to continue .
liberal democrat foreign affairs spokesman menzies campbell urged president bush to do more to put pressure on the israelis to pull out of the west bank .
" there are three people who hold the fate of this whole business in their hands .
they are president bush , ariel sharon and yasser arafat , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
mr campbell said he expected mr blair to make a statement to an " anxious " commons on his return from texas .
challenged over whether palestinian leader yasser arafat and israeli prime minister ariel sharon could ever deliver peace , mr blair told reporters on board his chartered british airways jet : " we ca n't pick and choose the interlocutors we have , but it 's important to make sure the dialogue is resumed . "
mr bush 's unexpected decision to send secretary of state colin powell to the region is being seen as evidence that he realises he must intervene there if he is to win international support for any future strike against iraq .
the president has also criticised palestinian leader yasser arafat for failing to stop suicide attacks by militants .
on friday , in an interview for itv 's tonight with trevor mcdonald , mr bush said it was a " silly notion " to suggest that the us had not done enough over the middle east , saying : " we acted strong . "
' no immediate plans ' he said he was sending mr powell to the region " because i began to worry that the foundations that are necessary to a lasting peace were becoming eroded " .
mr bush said in his itv interview that they would discuss " all options " over action on iraq but there were " no immediate plans " for action .
he said : " i made up my mind that saddam needs to go .
that 's about all i 'm willing to share with you . "

discussions are likely to be dominated by the middle east crisis , with talks on possible military action against iraq only a second priority .
mr blair was met in waco by mr bush 's national security adviser , condoleeza rice , before boarding a helicopter to the president 's private prairie chapel ranch in nearby crawford .
we ca n't pick and choose the interlocutors we have , but it 's important to make sure the dialogue is resumed tony blair on arafat and sharon plans for military action against iraq over its alleged build-up of weapons of mass destruction had been expected to dominate the summit in texas .
but the focus shifted to the middle east conflict amid escalating violence and after president bush called on israel to withdraw from palestinian areas and implement a ceasefire .
mr blair told reporters travelling with him : " we will obviously be looking at ideas that can lead to a ceasefire , which is the essential precondition so that they get back into a process of political dialogue . "
' few grounds for optimism ' the prime minister confirmed the focus would now be on achieving the pause in israeli-palestinian violence needed for us secretary of state colin powell to hold productive talks in the region .
" what 's important is to make sure that we have the minimum agreements necessary in order for this influence to happen , " mr blair said .
he added there were " few grounds for optimism " , but said he believed neither israel nor the palestinian authority wanted the current situation to continue .
mr bush : both sides must act to halt conflict liberal democrat foreign affairs spokesman menzies campbell urged president bush to do more to put pressure on the israelis to pull out of the west bank .
" there are three people who hold the fate of this whole business in their hands .
they are president bush , ariel sharon and yasser arafat , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
mr campbell said he expected mr blair to make a statement to an " anxious " commons on his return from texas .
challenged over whether palestinian leader yasser arafat and israeli prime minister ariel sharon could ever deliver peace , mr blair told reporters on board his chartered british airways jet : " we ca n't pick and choose the interlocutors we have , but it 's important to make sure the dialogue is resumed . "
mr bush 's unexpected decision to send secretary of state colin powell to the region is being seen as evidence that he realises he must intervene there if he is to win international support for any future strike against iraq .
the president has also criticised palestinian leader yasser arafat for failing to stop suicide attacks by militants .
on friday , in an interview for itv 's tonight with trevor mcdonald , mr bush said it was a " silly notion " to suggest that the us had not done enough over the middle east , saying : " we acted strong . "
' no immediate plans ' he said he was sending mr powell to the region " because i began to worry that the foundations that are necessary to a lasting peace were becoming eroded " .
mr bush said in his itv interview that they would discuss " all options " over action on iraq but there were " no immediate plans " for action .
he said : " i made up my mind that saddam needs to go .
that 's about all i 'm willing to share with you . "
downing street has stressed that the trip is taking place with the full agreement of buckingham palace and that its tone " will be in keeping with the period of national mourning " following the death of the queen mother .

bbc news -pipe- moneybox -pipe- enduring power of attorney survey categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : audio / video : programmes : moneybox front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo programmes services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 6 april , 2002 , 09:02 gmt 10:02 uk enduring power of attorney survey we asked the major banks and building societies whether there were any savings accounts which somebody holding a legitimate enduring power of attorney could not open .
no accounts available cahoot someone holding epa can not open any account with cahoot. cahoot told money box " our current accounts operate under the same consumer credit agreement as our credit cards in order to minimise administration for our customers .
legally we are required to obtain the signature of the account holder only and as such , cahoot can not offer accounts to an enduring power of attorney . "
some accounts available alliance and leicester someone with epa can not open alliance and leicester accounts which have a cash card and pins .
this includes the easysaver and cashcard accounts .
alliance and leicester told money box " we consider the issue of cards with pins to have security implications which do not exist when cheque books / passbooks are concerned and counter transactions rather than atm transactions are the norm .
this situation may change in the future but we have no immediate plans to allow access to these kind of accounts " barclays someone holding epa can not open a barclays e-savings account .
barclays told money box " this is because of difficulties verifying the identity of the holder of power of attorney when dealing with customers on a non face to face basis .
we are currently investigating whether we can make online accounts accessible to third parties whilst also maintaining security " bristol and west someone holding epa can not open any of bristol and west 's direct accounts - ie those operated by post or telephone .
direct accounts include direct rate tracker , call one , postal saver and easy access plus .
bristol and west told money box " bristol & west 's direct accounts are designed to offer enhanced rates to those who want to deal via the post or telephone and are prepared accept a fairly basic account structure .
epa is one of the services we have decided not to offer on these accounts , as it involves a higher degree of administration and is available through our network of 131 branches .
we are sorry that this effectively means that people seeking epa are not able to access these rates , but this was a decision aimed at providing the maximum benefit for the greatest number of customers possible " first direct someone holding epa can only open an account with first direct if either they or the donor are an existing customer .
if the attorney is an existing customer then an account opened with epa can be operated by telephone .
but if the attorney is not an existing customer then first direct will only accept written instructions .
first direct told money box " we are probably different from other banks , because we have certain security measures in place for telephone banking , that branch banking wo n't require .
this is why we ask for a pre-existing relationship to be in place .
we have to be sure of the identity of the person with the epa .
we do this through a set of specific security questions that all customers have , with each being unique to them . "
hsbc in theory hsbc says there is no reason why someone who holds epa could not open any of its accounts .
however if neither the attorney nor the donor is an existing customer then the attorney 's identity and address would be subject to verification checks .
hsbc stresses that each case is assessed on its own merits .
nationwide someone who holds epa can open all of nationwide 's savings accounts but he or she can not have a cash card facility on any account ie cashbuilder or investdirect .
nationwide told money box " it is nationwide 's policy not to allow a cash card facility on savings accounts opened with an enduring power of attorney .
this is due to a number of factors including security and confidentially issue regarding the disclosure of a pin number to a third party .
a savings account operated under a power of attorney should not require frequent cash withdrawals and the society does not believe that the ability to operate the account is greatly impeded by not offering a cash card facility . "
all accounts available the following banks and building societies have told money box there are no restrictions on which accounts can be opened by someone holding epa .
however when money box contacted them posing as customers in a few cases we were told that there were restrictions , so do n't be put off if at first you are told you can not open a certain account .
