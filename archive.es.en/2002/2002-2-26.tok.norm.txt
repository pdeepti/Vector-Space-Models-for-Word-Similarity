broadband internet services enable users to download audio and video much faster than a normal phone line .
we need to underwrite broadband britain ben verwaayen , bt group chief executive bt 's chief executive , ben verwaayen , said just over a fortnight ago the telecoms firm would slash the cost of access to its broadband services .
" broadband is one of our major priorities going forward and our new chief executive has made that very clear , " the spokesman said .
" he will be announcing significant price cuts -lsb- on tuesday -rsb- and we hope that will kick-start the take up of broadband . "
prices to drop by a quarter ?
at present , bt 's high-speed internet services in britain cost around £ 40 a month , which analysts view as more than most consumers are willing to pay .
the cable companies ntl and telewest offer broadband access for about £ 25 a month .
ben verwaayen says broadband is " a major priority " the bt spokesman declined to give further details of the price cuts ahead of the formal announcement .
but a report in the sunday times newspaper said bt would cut the wholesale price it charges to internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- to less than £ 20 a month .
this , in turn , would enable isps such as freeserve and aol to cut their monthly subscription fee to consumers to less than £ 30 a month , the paper said .
high-speed future the bt chief executive said earlier this month there was a need to " underwrite broadband in britain " .
prime minister tony blair has set out a vision of " broadband britain " , to be achieved by 2005 .
britain has lagged behind other developed countries in the take-up of broadband services , with many critics blaming the level of bt 's charges for the slow progress .
freeserve , a frequent and forthright critic of bt 's slow roll out of broadband lines , has welcomed the price cut proposal .
' supportive ' " we have been wholly supportive of any plans to drive down the wholesale price -lsb- of broadband lines -rsb- .
" that will increase the potential customer base which we can drive on to broadband " , freeserve said .
freeserve has more than 2.4 million conventional internet customers in the uk , while bt openworld has about 1.5 million .
bt has restructured itself over the last year to trim its once-crippling debts .
last november , it spun off its mobile phone operation bt cellnet into a new company which has been renamed mmo2 .
profits for the october to december period of last year were £ 381m excluding one-off items , slightly better than analysts had expected .

early retirement is becoming an impossible dream by andrew verity bbc personal finance reporter people in their twenties and thirties will have to work until they are 72 to avoid sudden poverty in retirement , according to analysis commissioned by the bbc .
pensions worry a 25-year-old today who began saving 11 % of earnings would need 47 years to generate a pension income worth two thirds of salary at retirement the analysis by the pensions policy institute shows that unless the younger half of the working population does more to save for retirement they will be forced into an awkward choice .
either they can retire at 65 and accept a dramatic cut in their income , or they must continue working for another seven years .
the analysis is based on a 25-year-old worker saving the typical contribution of 11 % into a group pension scheme .
less , for longer if the worker had started saving 40 years ago he or she would have seen their retirement fund grow rapidly , benefiting from high returns on the stock market , where the pension contributions are invested .
how much to save to get a pension of 60 % of salary at 65 age 25 - 10-15 % age 30 - 12-17 % age 35 - 15-20 % age 40 - 17-24 % age 45 - 23-3- % age 50 - 32-45 % age 55 - 50-70 % assuming investment growth 4 % over rpi , no previous pensions savings source : association of consulting actuaries by now , at 65 they would have saved enough to get a pension income worth two-thirds of their salary at retirement .
but today their money is unlikely to grow as quickly .
and because of longer life expectancy , their pot of pension money will have to last longer .
a 25-year-old today who began saving the same 11 % of earnings would need 47 years , rather than 40 , to generate a pension income worth two thirds of their salary at retirement .
the pensions policy institute 's analysis is confined to members of occupational schemes : it does not cover the third of the country with no private pension at all , who are now likely to have to rely on means-tested benefits .
employers cut back the outlook is worsened by signs that the amounts being saved into occupational pensions are falling .
research from the tuc shows that the number of workers in the best kind of occupational pension - known as " final salary " or " defined benefit " schemes - has fallen by almost two million in the last ten years .
typical company contributions final salary 12-20 % money purchase 6-10 % group personal pension 3 % in these schemes the member of staff knows the pension they will get at retirement , which can be up to two thirds of their salary depending on their length of service .
a host of factors has caused increasing numbers of employers to abandon these schemes for inferior ones .
in the increasingly common schemes , known as " money purchase " or " defined contribution " schemes , the employee knows nothing of what they will get out at retirement .
instead they know only what is paid in .
further , the employer 's contribution is usually smaller than the amount an employer would contribute to a final salary scheme .

but boeing , the biggest maker of aircraft in the world , is putting down a marker for when things bounce back by planning to update its most well-known jetliner , the 747 .
the new 747-400xqlrl , the company announced at the singapore air show , will fly further and more quietly , and is scheduled to come into service in 2004 after flight tests next year .
it is intended to take the shine of european competitor airbus 's plans for a " super-jumbo " of its own .
the current 747 's maximum capacity of about 400 passengers would be dwarfed by the a380 , which - when launched in 2006 - should hold more than 500 .
' size does n't matter ' boeing believes that bigger is not necessarily better , and that its customers are more interested in range and in meeting new european noise standards .
" if we wanted to make it bigger , we could make it bigger , " senior vice president of sales larry dickinson told reporters .
" what we 've been told is that this is the size of airplane customers want .
there 's a 500-seater if you want to buy one .
but nobody is telling us they want a bigger airplane . "
the new jetliner 's range is to be 9,190 miles : only a 4 % increase on current range , but according to boeing that would be enough to take the plane from new york to bangkok non-stop .
existing 747s can go no further than the new york-hong kong run .
one on one boeing , which is shedding 30,000 staff and saw profits slide $ 600m last year , is locked in a head-to-head tussle with airbus , and , as is the case with most air shows , this one is about each of the two rivals trying to outdo the other .
part of the justification for the new 747 , some observers remark , is that boeing has scrapped its own " super-jumbo " plans in favour of a " sonic cruiser " , a near-supersonic jet which it hopes to have in the air by 2008 .
both are also trying to shake off the gloom shrouding the aviation world , which has seen general electric shell out more than $ 4.1bn in vendor financing to try to keep airlines shopping .
airbus 's owner eads , meanwhile , is focusing its comments on the defence business .
eads said at the show that its defence division would turn profitable this year .
the company is starting on pilotless planes , and also plans to win more business in asia .

broadband wholesale prices , european comparisons : bt : 24.75 euros -lrb- down from 48.58 euros -rrb- telecom italia : 35.75 euros france telecom : 30.19 euros telefonica -lrb- spain -rrb- : 22.86 euros belgacom -lrb- belgium -rrb- : 21.34 euros telia -lrb- sweden -rrb- : 12.96 euros source : point topic the telecoms company will cut the cost of wholesale broadband access for internet service providers from £ 25 to £ 14.75 from 1 april .
this should lead to sharp cuts in the prices end users pay .
the internet service provider pipex responded to bt 's move by cutting its broadband charges to less than £ 20 a month before vat .
many of its competitors are expected to follow suit shortly .
the uk has one of the lowest take-up rates for broadband access in western europe , and high wholesale broadband prices have been blamed for this .
" we have now achieved the price that service providers told us they needed to get end user prices below £ 30 , " said bt wholesale chief executive paul reynolds .
broadband retail prices , european comparisons : btopenworld : 55.11 euros -lrb- though expected to come down -rrb- telecom italia : 42.87 euros telefonica -lrb- spain -rrb- : 42.04 euros telia -lrb- sweden -rrb- : 28.08 euros belgacom -lrb- belgium -rrb- : 25.1 euros t-online -lrb- germany -rrb- : 25 euros france telecom : 17.15 euros source : point topic " this is a very positive announcement which we welcome , " said aol uk 's chief executive karen thomson .
" we can now offer broadband to consumers at a price that will drive high levels of take-up , " said the chief executive of the internet service provider freeserve , john pluthero .
" this will drive the whole market forward by making broadband affordable , attractive and accessible , " said bt chief executive ben verwaayen .
' off-putting ' charge structure the investment bank jp morgan was sceptical , pointing out that bt 's decision to raise its engineer-installed connection charge by 40 % to £ 210 would be " potentially off-putting for consumers " .
the new charge applies only to consumer products , while connection fees for businesses remain at the old , lower level .

this should lead to sharp cuts in the prices end users pay .
the internet service provider pipex responded to bt 's move by cutting its broadband charges to less than £ 20 a month before vat .
many of its competitors are expected to follow suit shortly .
the uk has one of the lowest take-up rates for broadband access in western europe , and high wholesale broadband prices have been blamed for this .
" we have now achieved the price that service providers told us they needed to get end user prices below £ 30 , " said bt wholesale chief executive paul reynolds .

" this will drive the whole market forward by making broadband affordable , attractive and accessible , " said bt chief executive ben verwaayen .
' off-putting ' charge structure the investment bank jp morgan was sceptical , pointing out that bt 's decision to raise its engineer-installed connection charge by 40 % to £ 210 would be " potentially off-putting for consumers " .
the new charge applies only to consumer products , while connection fees for businesses remain at the old , lower level .
if consumers install the adsl line themselves , the connection charge will be £ 50 .

merthyr tydfil county borough council has discovered it can not fund the actions of three councillors - including the former leader - who want the high court to end the chaos caused by a bureaucratic blunder .
ultimately its the chief executive 's responsibility and therefore he should not be allowed to continue until all this mess is sorted out phil owens the conservative am for south wales east has said ratepayers could be left with a huge bill if the high court case fails .
meanwhile the welsh assembly is taking legal advice on whether it can discuss the administrative oversight which has left all of the town 's 33 councillors barred from office .
in a last-ditch attempt to prevent an election which would cost £ 30,000 , three merthyr tydfil councillors led by the authority 's former council leader , ray thomas , planned to go to the high court .
they hoped to persuade a judge to overturn the administrative error which has thrown the authority into chaos .
now they have been told that as they are no longer councillors , the authority can not fund their action .
former council leader ray thomas : crisis moves to high court the action is to be led instead by the council 's chief executive .
all 33 former councillors have been called to the civic centre to be briefed on tuesday .
but william graham , the conservative am for south east wales , said ratepayers could be left with a huge bill if the case fails .
he wants the issue raised at the assembly , but officers are concerned that could jeopardise any future legal hearing .
at the same time , one of the councillors stripped of his powers is calling for the assembly to appoint an official to take over the running of the authority .
no allowances phil owens , who represented the dowlais ward on merthyr tydfil , said the current officers should not be allowed to continue .
the former councillors received a letter from the authority over the weekend confirming they were no longer councillors .
the letter also advised them they would not be able to claim any allowances or payments .
" the importance of this can not be underestimated , " said mr owens , who gave up his carpenter job when he was elected to the council two years ago .
" ultimately its the chief executive 's responsibility and therefore he should not be allowed to continue until all this mess is sorted out . "
mr owens , who will now have to manage without his £ 90 weekly allowances , said he was writing to the assembly 's local government minister edwina hart to ask her to intervene .
not " failing " however , despite the demands of individual councillors , the assembly said on monday it would not be appointing anyone to take over the running of the authority .
the assembly only has the power to take over an authority that is " failing " which is not the case .
officials in cardiff bay insist they are happy the council 's chief executive and his team can maintain the running of the authority until the question of the councillors ' legitimacy is resolved .
all council meetings remain halted in merthyr with a planned scrutiny meeting on tuesday and a full council on thursday both cancelled .
the authority must still prepare for the possibility of an election , which could cost taxpayers up to £ 30,000 and leave the town without a council until easter .
code of conduct the problem stems back to last summer when the authority was modernised and brought in a new code of conduct .
councillors thought they had until 21 december 2001 to put their names to the new code .
but an official drafted the resolution from the september meeting , so they only had until 4 november .
the mistake came to light when the local authority ombudsman was looking through the minutes of the meeting .
the official had written that councillors would implement the code " immediately " .
but under the council 's rules " immediately " means within eight weeks . watch / listen on this story bbc wales 's melanie doel " ratepayers could be left with a huge bill if the case fails " see also : 20 feb 02 -pipe- wales blunder sees whole council disbarred 28 jun 01 -pipe- wales parents protest over school site 19 dec 01 -pipe- wales concerns over second dumping site 01 nov 99 -pipe- wales row over £ 175,000 mayoral car plate 29 jan 02 -pipe- wales councils to bypass queen 's jubilee internet links : merthyr county borough council the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top wales stories now : soap actor killed in holiday fall wales leads uk bust firms league husband jailed for rape attack festival town prepares for euros plea for more kidney donors rowing team arrives back in uk families opt for single jabs hain turns fire on greens links to more wales stories are at the foot of the page .
