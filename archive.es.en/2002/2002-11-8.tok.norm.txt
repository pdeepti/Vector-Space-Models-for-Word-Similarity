on thursday nearly 99 percent of gibraltarians said they did not want britain and spain to share sovereignty of their tiny territory . voters in gibraltar overwhelmingly rejected a referendum about joint british-spanish sovereignty for the territory on thursday .

gibraltar 's chief minister , peter caruana , said that the result of the referendum " sent a clear message to the world . "

on thursday nearly 99 percent of gibraltarians said they did not want britain and spain to share sovereignty of their tiny territory . voters in gibraltar overwhelmingly rejected a referendum about joint british-spanish sovereignty for the territory on thursday .
17,900 gibraltarians -lrb- 98.97 percent -rrb- said " no " compared to a mere 187 votes in favor of the measure .
gibraltar 's chief minister , peter caruana , said that the result of the referendum " sent a clear message to the world . "
no effect in real terms , however , the vote means very little .
both the uk and spain announced prior to the plebiscite that they would not recognize the result .
the outcome has no legal legitimacy as both london and madrid have insisted on proceeding with negotiations over shared sovereignty .
the gibraltarians staged the referendum for the sole purpose of making it clear to the larger countries where their preferences lie .
and as caruana told tony blair , england ’ s parliament should " take stock of this referendum result .
it is the will of the people of gibraltar . "
an old feud for london and madrid the " no " vote is a small setback for their attempts to settle the century-old dispute over the territory .
the sovereignty issue stems from the 1713 treaty of utrecht , which forced spain to cede gibraltar to britain .
at the time britain was accorded possession of the " rock " for as long as it wanted .
the territory automatically reverts to the spaniards if the british decide to give it up .
spain still has its heart set on possession of gibraltar , despite the animosity of the territory 's inhabitants , who identify themselves as brits .
many of them still harbor bitter memories of the rock 's isolation during the years of general franco 's dictatorship in spain -lrb- 1939 - 1975 -rrb- .
a total of 87.9 percent of gibraltarian voters cast their ballots in the referendum . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gibraltar expected to spurn uk-spain sovereignty proposal gibraltarians are voting in a referendum on whether britain and spain should share sovereignty of the rock in future .
the result is expected to be a resounding " no “ as the british colony looks set to stay the way it is -lrb- nov .

on thursday nearly 99 percent of gibraltarians said they did not want britain and spain to share sovereignty of their tiny territory . voters in gibraltar overwhelmingly rejected a referendum about joint british-spanish sovereignty for the territory on thursday .
17,900 gibraltarians -lrb- 98.97 percent -rrb- said " no " compared to a mere 187 votes in favor of the measure .
gibraltar 's chief minister , peter caruana , said that the result of the referendum " sent a clear message to the world . "
no effect in real terms , however , the vote means very little .
both the uk and spain announced prior to the plebiscite that they would not recognize the result .
the outcome has no legal legitimacy as both london and madrid have insisted on proceeding with negotiations over shared sovereignty .
the gibraltarians staged the referendum for the sole purpose of making it clear to the larger countries where their preferences lie .
and as caruana told tony blair , england ’ s parliament should " take stock of this referendum result .
it is the will of the people of gibraltar . "
an old feud for london and madrid the " no " vote is a small setback for their attempts to settle the century-old dispute over the territory .
the sovereignty issue stems from the 1713 treaty of utrecht , which forced spain to cede gibraltar to britain .
at the time britain was accorded possession of the " rock " for as long as it wanted .
the territory automatically reverts to the spaniards if the british decide to give it up .
spain still has its heart set on possession of gibraltar , despite the animosity of the territory 's inhabitants , who identify themselves as brits .
many of them still harbor bitter memories of the rock 's isolation during the years of general franco 's dictatorship in spain -lrb- 1939 - 1975 -rrb- .
a total of 87.9 percent of gibraltarian voters cast their ballots in the referendum . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gibraltar expected to spurn uk-spain sovereignty proposal gibraltarians are voting in a referendum on whether britain and spain should share sovereignty of the rock in future .

its social , humanitarian and cultural committee passed the draft treaty by 104 vote to 8 with 37 abstentions and it will now go before the general assembly in december , where routine approval is expected .
this protocol does not produce real results against torture richard boucher us state department the united states argues that the treaty does not provide for surprise prison inspections and it objects to having to pay for the new regime .
state department spokesman richard boucher said the us abhorred " the despicable practice of torture " but considered the new treaty ill-advised as it gave advance notice of inspections to suspected states .
" it 's a flawed inspection process that shows little likelihood of really finding the evidence of torture and working to combat torture , " he said .
the period of notice would give offenders a chance to " clean everything up " , he added .
america has also argued that opening up prisons in its own states to international inspection would violate their rights under the us constitution .
dubious company another us argument is that the new treaty will soak up resources which could be deployed to better effect on other anti-torture mechanisms .
america has nothing to gain by trying to undermine this important human rights initiative rory mungoven human rights watch when the un committee voted on thursday , it roundly rejected - by 98 to 11 votes with 37 abstentions - a us amendment which would have removed funding for the treaty from the general un budget and put it on the shoulders of parties to the protocol instead .
after the vote , mr boucher said that the us could not support the new treaty which it had negotiated over for a decade , and certainly would not help fund it : " we 've basically decided that because this protocol does not produce real results against torture , we 're not going to be a party to it and not being a party , we do n't think we should have to pay for it . "
human rights groups condemned america 's stance saying it had effectively sided with states charged with abusing human rights such as china , iran , cuba and sudan .
" america has nothing to gain by trying to undermine this important human rights initiative and positioning itself alongside some of the world 's worst violators , " said rory mungoven of human rights watch .

america has nothing to gain by trying to undermine this important human rights initiative " rory mungoven human rights watch when the un committee voted on thursday , it roundly rejected - by 98 to 11 votes with 37 abstentions - a us amendment which would have removed funding for the treaty from the general un budget and put it on the shoulders of parties to the protocol instead .
after the vote , mr boucher said that the us could not support the new treaty which it had negotiated over for a decade , and certainly would not help fund it : " we 've basically decided that because this protocol does not produce real results against torture , we 're not going to be a party to it and not being a party , we do n't think we should have to pay for it . "
human rights groups condemned america 's stance saying it had effectively sided with states charged with abusing human rights such as china , iran , cuba and sudan .
" america has nothing to gain by trying to undermine this important human rights initiative and positioning itself alongside some of the world 's worst violators , " said rory mungoven of human rights watch .

an independent report into telstra services in rural australia showed significant improvements had been made , prime minister john howard said .
but the report also pointed up 39 recommendations for reforms - notably improvements to fixed-line services and internet speeds - before the sale can go ahead .
the government hopes to raise about 30bn australian dollars -lrb- £ 10.8bn ; us $ 16.5bn -rrb- by the sale of its 50 % stake in telstra , the last major state-owned companies in australia .
opponents of privatisation , meanwhile , worry that service standards will slip , especially in vulnerable , remote and unprofitable rural districts .
political problems mr howard said telstra had made a significant improvement in the past couple of years , after extra money was poured into services in remote areas following a critical report in 2000 .
telstra said it was capable of meeting the report 's recommendations without significant impact on its costs .
the privatisation plan , which has been dragging on for years , is now approaching its final hurdle .
the government still has to win over a group of independent senators who hold the balance of power in parliament 's upper house and who have always voted against privatisation .
separately , telstra is being investigated by the industry regulator over allegations that it mishandled complaints from a group of small business customers calling themselves casualties of telstra .
the group , based in the north-eastern city of brisbane , claims poor telstra service ruined their businesses .

a new study , published in the british medical journal , reviewed 26 pieces of research to test popular beliefs about being positive .
the glasgow-based researchers hoped to see if there was a link between survival from cancer and different psychological coping styles , such as " fighting spirit " , hopelessness , denial and avoidance .
breast , lung , and gastrointestinal cancers , as well as leukaemia and melanoma , were covered in the studies examined .
they also included data on follow up periods ranging between several months to 15 years .
the research team , led by mark petticrew of the medical research council 's social and public health sciences unit in glasgow , said a link between the way people cope with cancer and their chance of survival was " biologically plausible " .
but they found little scientific basis for the belief that coping styles played an important part in survival from or recurrence of cancer .
the authors said : " it is commonly believed that a person 's mental attitude affects his or her chances of surviving cancer and the psychological coping factors that are most well known in this respect are fighting spirit and helplessness / hopelessness .
" we found little convincing evidence that either of these factors play a clinically important part in survival from or recurrence of cancer ; the significant findings that do exist are confined to a few small studies . "
they said there was no good evidence to support the development of schemes that promoted certain mental attitudes to try to prolong survival .
and they concluded : " people with cancer should not feel pressurised in adopting particular coping styles to improve survival or reduce the risk of recurrence . "
do n't panic health psychologist dr jill graham of the cancer research uk unit at st thomas 's hospital , london , said : " early research in this area suggested if you had a fighting spirit you would live longer .
" but these studies were very small .
since then we have done much more comprehensive work and looked at much larger studies of women .
" the latest research says that if you 're feeling down and depressed you should n't panic as it wo n't affect your recovery or cause a relapse .
" one study looked at women patients who were profoundly depressed for three months or more .
" it was found that they were at no greater risk of cancer returning nor did it lessen their their chances of long term survival .
" i think this is really good news for women who no longer need to panic that if they feel very low it will bring the disease back . "

the campaign for real ale -lrb- camra -rrb- has recruited ninkasi , the ancient sumerian goddess of beer , to try to lure women into trying cask ale at the aberdeen and north east beer festival this weekend .
only 11 % of female pub-goers in scotland have tried real ale , according to research carried out by camra , which said the figure is much lower than in england .
almost all advertising we see on our tv screens for beer is too laddish , too lager-based and a real turn-off for women mike benner camra spokesman the pressure group also said its research found that more than half of women reported real ale was not promoted at their local pub .
some 23 % of women also said they had not sampled real ale because none of their friends drank it .
camra also noted only one in 10 scottish pubs had real ale on tap , compared with more than 50 % of pubs in some regions of england .
the group said this was despite there being a fivefold increase in real ale breweries north of the border in the last 20 years .
the campaign , entitled hale ninkasi , will see aberdeen 's mcclymont hall decorated with a 20ft-long banner and life-size cut-outs of the goddess , as well as posters , leaflets and beer mats .
scottish beer the ancient middle eastern goddess is credited with creating the recipe for beer 4,000 years ago and was worshipped by both men and women in the days when women brewed the beer while men ran the taverns .
camra spokesman mike benner said : " we think scottish beer is something to be proud of and it should be marketed to women as well as men .
" almost all advertising we see on our tv screens for beer is too laddish , too lager-based and a real turn-off for women . "

" almost all advertising we see on our tv screens for beer is too laddish , too lager-based and a real turn-off for women . "
he added : " ninkasi , the new ' goddess of beer ' is here to change that and sets a new precedent for marketing a great product . "

now the film has been released in the uk .
eminem 's performance in 8 mile is somewhat stilted - but nonetheless , believable .
this is a powerful film - gritty , sometimes frightening , occasionally funny and ultimately , inspiring .
fans of eminem will not be disappointed although mainstream audiences may be left wondering what all the fuss was about .
curtis hanson directed la confidential 8 mile , contrary to early speculation , is not based on eminem 's life .
in many respects , his character , jimmy smith jr , could not be more different to the angry , rebellious and apparently homophobic young musician we know as marshall mathers .
jimmy is sympathetic and caring although fond of throwing a punch .
the film is named after the 8 mile road in detroit that acts as a dividing line between the deprived black inner-city and the more affluent white suburbs .
it also represents a divide cutting through the musical tastes of the city 's young people .
nickname jimmy is a trailer park kid with aspirations to better himself and become a respected rap artist .
he lives up to his nickname , rabbit , after freezing with fear during a performance at a local club where he is the only white rapper .
the film is full of colourful characters - not least rabbit 's penniless and rather slutty mother , played by kim basinger .
it is a role that the oscar winner embraces - at times overshadowing her novice co-star .
basinger teams up with her l.a. confidential director , curtis hanson , for the movie .
hanson has been meticulous in his attention to detail .
those in the know - hop-hop insiders , fluent in the street-talk and wise to the outside world 's stereotyped images of their culture - would have been quick to criticise any glib , hollywood representation of their lives .
the director 's use of many native detroit rappers goes a long way to give the film a strong feeling of authenticity .
few words eminem has done himself no harm by making this film .
his acting may lack in training and experience , but he is by no means boring or laughable .
basinger plays eminem 's mother he is at his best in the scenes that allow him to rap - in fact he has relatively few words to deliver as straight dialogue .
on cd , eminem is raw , offensive and provocative while on film he has a softer edge .
his character easily wins the sympathy vote and the story leaves you wanting to know him better .
in hollywood terms , the door is left wide open for a sequel .
eminem embraces the role to the extent that audiences are bound to assume it is biographical .
far from selling his soul to the devil , as the rapper says on his track , say goodbye hollywood , eminem has tantalised tinsel town and managed to escape with his credibility intact .

he plays a detroit rapper struggling to start his career in the film 8 mile , which many have described as semi-autobiographical .
" he is neither brilliant nor bad as an actor , " wrote bbc news online reviewer peter bowes .
" the director 's use of many native detroit rappers goes a long way to give the film a strong feeling of authenticity , " he added .
but what do you think ?
does eminem give a credible performance ?
does curtis hanson capture the essence of the rap world in detroit ?
i watched 8 mile and i thought it was great , it had everything in and was worth it , i 'm a big em fan , i loved the movie .
emran , england 8 mile provides a fascinating insight into the roots of rap culture and reveals to some extent what made eminem such a driven and ambitious individual .
it is intelligently directed , and touching but never mawkish .
a triumph !
amelia , uk i saw 8 mile a few weeks ago at a special screening shortly after it had opened in the us , and i have been keen to see it again ever since .
i was not particularly an eminem fan before the movie , but i sure am now - he can act and he is good in this film , though there is no way that he will get any oscar nominations .
like all of curtis hanson 's films it is beautifully made , kim basinger is very good - she has a better chance of a nomination than eminem , i think .
great film , go see it and do n't be put off by anyone who says it 's just for fans .
cara , uk as jimmy , eminem is a credible and dare i say it , captivating lead myrddin gwynedd , london would we be worshipping at the feet of a racist singer / actor , i think not ?
yet many fall over themselves to applaud a homophobic misogynist .
the film stinks .
nick c , uk the real slim shady gets ready for his close-up in this cinematic version of rap meets rocky .
as jimmy , eminem is a credible and dare i say it , captivating lead .
from the moment when we first bare witness to his borderline-genius knack at improvised rhyme , we 're absolutely spellbound .
this man really can rap .
furthermore , as we delve deeper into the often dark , murky and unforgiving world that jimmy frequents , it 's pretty hard not to empathise and respect this modern poet .
kim basinger 's turn as jimmy 's downtrodden mother-from-hell is watchable , but she does n't quite cut the mustard as a desperate woman on the poverty line .
and with only a smattering of lines throughout the whole film , you 're simply not encouraged to take her that seriously .
plot-wise , there ai n't much going on to tax the brain , but this is more than made up for by 8 mile 's unrelenting assault of the senses ¿ both visually and musically - that makes absolutely compelling viewing .
myrddin gwynedd , twickenham , london i think this film is excellent .
i love em 's acent ! !
he 's gorgeous as well ! !
sarah angus , england i saw it in the us and i thought it was brilliant chloe bay , uk having seen the movie and actually really enjoyed it i can empathise with people who loathed it .
i love rap and i enjoy eminem and find him to be a talented musician .
i thought his stab at acting was actually pretty good and well supported .
however this uncritical adoration of musicians who act is pretty tough to swallow .
britney , madonna , eminem et al are not brilliant just because of who they are and their last album .
i saw up for grabs in london and madonna got a 5 min ovation at the start just for appearing on the stage .
this is wrong .
it should be for a performance of strong acting ; which that night she incidentally gave .
it should not be just becasue someone is seeing their idol .
let 's get this into perspective please .
we are talking about acting , not singing .
in this case eminem did both well .
mel , london i think that the film is very good .
i feel it shows us what it was like in detroit 1995 , being a white rapper trying to succeed but with a lot of prejudice until he was heard .
sean , uk i saw it in the us and i thought it was brilliant .
i thought em was gonna be a rubbish actor but he was n't , he had the facial expressions and everything going for him including his fine body .
i do n't know how people can say that the movie was rubbish .
do n't worry eminem , i love it ! ! ! ! ! !
chloe bay -lrb- eminem 's biggest fan -rrb- uk i saw the movie on its opening last night .
eminem does a fine job of portraying rabbit , the hot-headed white youth from the auto factories of detroit with a gift for rhyming that sets him apart in a world dominated by black rappers .
eminem is certainly no pushover as an actor , although the script itself does n't supply too many opportunities to test his acting range .
the stand-out performances come from eminem 's " gang " , especially mekhi phifer in the role of future , rabbit 's best friend and biggest fan , and the mc of nightly rap " battles " on stage .
another highlight of the movie is the city of detroit itself .
although shorn of drugs and guns in this movie , the decaying inner cities have a gloomy life of their own - all litter and graffiti , wet streets and ruined storefronts .
rarely has the dreadful fate of industrial cities been captured on camera so vividly .
zubaer , bangladesh i am not am eminem fan but this movie made me sad , made me cry inspired me .
brilliant and excellent , a true oscar-level movie .
nitin , us it sucks .
eminem is a horrible , intolerant actor with horrible songs and lack of moral fibre .
i give this movie an f !
paul rosenberg , united states i think that eminem , britney spears and all of other teenage somethings that have graced our movie screens is an embarrassment to the music industry .
what happened to real musicians who play their own music and real actors who are not fluffy and perfect-looking ?
r , united states there are lines stretching out to the street in front of movie theatres right now .
hanson did not denigrate / idealise either detroit or the rap world , but presented both with the honest integrity of an artist .
what might have been an ego trip on celluloid for eminem turned out to be the portrait of a generation .
bravo !
robert del valle , detroit usa perhaps he should stick to dissing his mom .
james appleby , uk i loved seeing eminem on film .
i think he 's a great performer both on stage and on screen .
anyone who thinks he sucks are jealous of his talent because they ca n't rap or act .
darlene , usa a really good performance from eminem , in this very well done film .
south of 8 mile detroit is represented accurately .
i actually enjoyed the rapping !
michael gover , detroit , usa i in no way , shape , or form consider myself an eminem fan despite some of his catchy tunes .
i reluctantly saw 8 mile last night with my husband and thought that eminem was excellent .
in the past i thought that eminem was a disgrace to women .
regardless of my judgements , the guy has got talent .
michelle , florida , usa i love movies and i have seen some great actors and acresses .
em does a great job , it is his first movie .
i hope to see him expand his genre .
kim basinger was great .
she perfected her role .
i loved this movie and i want to see it again ! !
leanne , united states 8 mile ruled .
i think that it will be made best movie of the year .
it was sad , cruel , serious , and funny all at the same time .
i loved the story and i love eminem ! !
i think everyone should see this move ! ! ! !
samantha , usa in terms of music performers turned acting , eminem has done an incredibly good job .
the fact of the movie is , if you do n't like rap , then you 'll probably not like the movie either , because the movie is based on how a rap star first started out .
sandip patel , boston usa i saw 8 mile at the london film festival and loved it .
i knew very little about rapping or eminem before i saw the movie but was converted to both on seeing the film .
eminem turned in a fine performance as " rabbit " and i 'm sure he will acquire many more fans as a result of this movie , especially female ones !
the " poetry " of rapping really came alive and the rap contests were totally involving .
this is a " must see " film .
sue , uk 8 mile was awesome ! !
it built suspense , made you laugh , and at the same time it presents to you with what the whole hip hop world is like .
it 's not sugarcoated at all ... it 's reality .
i loved the movie and i love eminem !
he 's very talented and really cool .
lauren , usa 8 mile is great .
i did n't hope for much , but eminem was charismatic and believable .
the plot is fairly lightweight , yet entertaining and thoroughy enjoyable .
like a rap version of karate kid , 8 mile should be seen by everyone , eminem fan or not .
matt forde , uk i really don ¿ t know how anyone can diss this movie , great story and performances , you may not like what he says in his songs , but again it 's all an act .
some people just do n't get that .
go see it you will want to applaud at the end sequence .
mickyc , uk the film wos good if not a touch boring , this coming from one of em 's longest and most dedicated fans .
" future " put in a great performance but if you wanna experience the true genius of em , go buy the eminem show , an amazing commentary of today 's society .
callum , england get a life nick c. do you think elton john would have performed with eminem if he was truly homophobic and would dido have described him as sweet if he was truly a misogynist ?
have you actually seen the film ?
have you ever listened to and understood any of his lyrics ?
obviously not .
you 've missed the point completely .
you 've fallen into the trap .
ruth , uk definitely one for the fans only .
calling the plot thin would be an overstatement .
poor ol ' white boy trash .
sure he can act ok but give us the grit man - or was the film just cleaned up to satisfy the yanks need for sanitation ?
