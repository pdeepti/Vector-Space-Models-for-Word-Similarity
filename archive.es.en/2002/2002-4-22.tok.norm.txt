the average student debt is now £ 10,000 the natwest money matters survey suggests monthly debt repayments of £ 200 a month were now the norm for graduates .

the survey found the average starting salary for graduates was now £ 13,422 , although those starting work in london or east anglia were more likely to start on salaries between £ 20,000 and £ 25,000 .
job satisfaction was cited as the most important factor for graduates when looking for their first job , although 58 % ranked enjoyment as their number one priority compared to 84 % questioned for last year 's survey .

matt toffrey says he has a debt of £ 15,000 a spokesman for the department for education said : " we accept that students will leave university with debt but the fact is that student loan debt will be repaid only when the students can afford to do so .
" graduates can expect to earn on average £ 400,000 more over their lifetime than the national average , so this debt should be seen as a worthwhile investment for the future . "
natwest advises graduates to make a budget plan before they start earning , to check they are not paying more tax than they should be , to repay borrowings with the highest rate of interest first and to buy an annual travel card to save cash .

speaking on bbc one 's breakfast with frost programme , he compared the drive to improve healthcare in britain with margaret thatcher 's 1980s industrial reforms . "
if it fails , i will carry the can but i believe it wo n't " tony blair mr blair rejected claims that he was returning to an old-style " tax and spend " agenda , saying the " vast bulk " of middle class voters backed the plans to put more money into the nhs .
the conservatives accuse ministers of not knowing how to improve the nhs , while liberal democrat leader charles kennedy says mr blair has fuelled " cynicism " in politics by breaking his promises .
in a wide-ranging interview , the prime minister also said the current middle east conflict was " driving a wedge between some sections of the arab world and the west " .
but those divisions could be healed by relaunching the political process that was essential for peace , said mr blair .
backing it is domestic concerns , however , that top his agenda .
two opinion polls for sunday newspapers suggest public support for last week 's budget .
an icm poll for the sunday telegraph suggests 76 % of voters approved of the 1 % rise in national insurance -lrb- ni -rrb- contributions , with 19 % against .
a separate yougov poll for the sunday times shows 52 % of those questioned said they backed the budget , with 26 % against .
but only 18 % thought the ni rise would produce a major improvement in the nhs - 56 % said it would lead to a small difference and 24 % no change .
both polls also suggest most people believe labour has broken an election promise not to raise income tax .
that view was shared by 58 % of those questioned by yougov -lrb- with 35 % saying it had kept to the pledge -rrb- and by 56 % in the icm poll -lrb- against 35 % -rrb- .
icm questioned 1,004 people on thursday and friday , with yougov 's survey conducted online with 2,840 over the same period .
mr blair insisted labour had not broken its pledge on income tax .
gamble ?
and he cited those polls as evidence that the public realised they had to pay for better hospitals .
asked how big a risk he was taking by raising taxes , he replied : " there is a challenge .
it is a big thing .
it is as big as the industrial restructuring in the 1980s was for the thatcher government . "
mr blair added : " if it fails , i will carry the can , i 've said that , but i believe it wo n't . "
economic stability , lower unemployment and better schools were key evidence of labour 's track record of setting targets it could meet , he said .
mr blair 's comparison with the thatcher years may provoke criticism from trade unions , who are also worried about involved private companies in the nhs .
mr blair said he was prepared to " take on " the unions but stressed he was not " spoiling for a fight with anyone " .
government critics see the budget as a return to an old labour agenda .
but mr blair insisted his government was pursuing a programme of " invest and reform " .
" without the reform it would not be wise to put those sums of money in but there is huge reform going into the health service , " he said .
mr blair refused to rule out a repeat of last week 's tax rises , although he said those changes had funded the government 's nhs plans .
trust worries he could not write the next budget now , he said .
conservative party chairman david davis accused mr blair of " silly semantics " in trying to deny he had broken tax promises .
" if he wants to go on denying it then he will just persuade the british public that he is either disingenuous or dishonest , " mr davis told bbc news .
lib dem leader charles kennedy said mr blair should have " come clean " over raising tax at the election .
noting growing mistrust in politicians , he added : " tony blair and gordon brown have a lot to answer for in fuelling that cynicism . "

frontbencher jenny tonge said in an interview with bbc news online that she had sympathy with the view that cocaine should be available over the counter like alcohol .
she said the uk 's drugs policy was not working and needed a radical overhaul .
" i think cocaine is a difficult one , but i would agree with a lot of people that you would do less damage if cocaine was actually legalised and sold at registered outlets like alcohol than leaving it to the boys on the streets , " she said . "
you may get more addicts but you would have a whole lot more money to treat those addicts " jenny tonge the liberal democrat international development spokeswoman added : " i am not claiming to have the answers , but i am saying that present drugs policy is not working . "
she went on : " the way cannabis is treated is a joke , a complete joke .
that should be used like tobacco , taxed like tobacco -lsb- and -rsb- let 's spend the vat on something . "
dr tonge admitted there would still be a black market for drugs if more were legalised - but pointed out there was a black market for tobacco and alcohol .
' normal lives ' " it would be surely less .
and there will be no excuse at all for an addict having to commit crimes to feed their habit .
" you may get more addicts , that 's another downside , but then you 'd have a whole lot more money in the form of vat to treat those addicts . "
on heroin , she said the drug should be " medicalised " in order to treat addicts on the nhs .
she said heroin users might then be able to lead normal lives .
" you ca n't do that if they having to commit crime all the time to feed their habit , " she said .
" you can only do it if they are getting it anyway . "
liberal democrat policy calls for the legalisation of cannabis and the abolition of jail sentences for personal use of all other drugs .
' radical ' nhs reform dr tonge also said there must be major reform of how the nhs was funded .
she said she feared no party would be brave enough to put enough money on tax to properly fund health services .
but her party was " coming round " to the idea of taking health service funding out of general taxation .
" people have got to get used to the idea of paying a lot more for the health service or even using top ups , saying ' well , after i am 80 i do n't care what happens to me ' .
" i know what my parents would have said : ' we 'll look after ourselves and die after that ' .
that sounds incredibly radical but it may be the sort of choice that people could have . "
she pointed to the us state of oregon where people are asked regularly about their priorities for health care and receive treatment for their top choices but fund the rest themselves .
she stressed she was " thinking out loud - none of that is policy " .
she said there also had to be a limit to what the nhs provided " in terms of sort of personal lifestyle choices " such as infertility treatments for women over the age of 50 .
