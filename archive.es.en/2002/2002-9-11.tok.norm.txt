investment was hesitant as traders tended to adopt a " let ’ s wait and see " attitude rather than get caught up in impulse buying and selling .
according to investment analysts , few traders were willing to make risky investments , for fear of being caught off guard in the event of a new terrorist act .
many remembered all too well how the market shook and plunged only a year ago after terrorists crashed planes into the world trade center and pentagon .
" very few professional investors have wanted to hold short positions on the basis that if something were to happen today it would be extremely difficult to cover those short positions , " a trader for natwest stockbrokers told afp wire services wednesday morning in london .
reflecting this sense of uncertainty , markets in europe began the day with reserved trading .
across the 12-nation euro zone , the euro stoxx 50 index was down 0.1 percent .
the britsh ftse 100 index dropped 0.6 percent , and the german dax reported a 0.21 percent slip in trading .
only the french cac was able to inch up to a meager 0.2 percent .
the german financial daily handelsblatt described the atmosphere on the international markets as tense and a little nervous .
peter coolidge from brean murray & co. in new york told the paper that " people don ’ t want to commit themselves to anything before september 11 is over . "
another trader at the deutsche bank summarized the mood saying , " no one can prophesize what will really happen , but if something does happen , the markets will crash – that ’ s clear . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader reacts in front of the indicator panel of the german stock index in frankfurt tuesday sept .
11 , 2001 .
remembering last year september 11 , 2001 was a tuesday .
in the us , trading stopped for the next four days . in frankfurt , however , the traders continued conducting their business .
" we wanted to avoid a complete crash of the financial markets , " said frank hartmann , spokesman for the deutsche börse ag -lrb- german stock exchange -rrb- .
except for a two-hour stop on trade with us stocks , business moved on as usual .
but it was anything but a normal business day .
the german dax tumbled 7 to 8 percent by closing time , and wasn ’ t able to recover until nearly two months later .
in london , paris and rome , in hong kong and tokyo , stocks plummeted , and the day ended with some of the biggest single day losses in recent history .
only months later could the global economy recover most of its lost ground .
some industries , however , were so badly hurt , that they are still struggling : aviation , tourism , insurance and re-insurers .
even a year later , germany ’ s travel giant tui is recording 3.8 percent losses .
and several international airlines can only stay in flight with the help of hefty government assistance programs .
lay-offs following the terrorist attacks were especially common in the aviation sector .
american airlines , which lost two jets in the attacks , cut 20,000 positions , a reduction of roughly 20 percent of its entire workforce , while commercial aircraft manufacturer boeing slashed 30,000 jobs shortly after the attacks .
financial losses in the insurance sector were also significant following september 11 .
lloyd ’ s of london , the world ’ s largest insurer , faced claims totaling close to 307 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- .
and the german-based munich re , the world ’ s largest re-insurer , estimated costs at around 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 970 million -rrb- .
beyond september 11 for the rest of the market , however , the negative aftermath of september 11 have been eclipsed by more deep-rooted problems .
economic analysts say many of these , such as a sluggish global economy , rising unemployment and a steady decline in the technology sector , all predate the terrorist attacks , and will continue to cause problems for the markets beyond the one-year anniversary .
" certainly september 11 unsettled investors , " said stefan schneider , chief international economist at deutsche bank research , " but the current low market figures , are not all related to the terrorist attacks . "
by the end of 2001 , the markets had almost fully recovered , he told ndr german television , explaining that other factors were to blame .
the recent downward trend owes much more to accounting scandals in the us , a general pessimism about global economic growth and the situation in the middle east , including a looming war in iraq , said rolf drees , german financial analyst .
as proof of the ongoing troubles , eleven months after the terrorist attacks the dax dropped to 3.235 points , its lowest level since april 1997 .
economic growth is most critical factor in the coming months , the most critical factor driving the markets is confidence in economic development and growth .
according to the german investment trust , long-term market trends for the coming year are dependent on positive growth .
if company returns continue to be low , it explains , the stock markets will not recover .
but this does not appear to be the case .
speaking on tuesday in tokyo , the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , announced that while global economic prospects had weakened in the last year , recovery lies ahead in the upcoming months .
recession is not a real risk , he said .
" although growth prospects have weakened somewhat in the united states and europe , most recently our assessment is that the recovery will continue , " köhler explained , easing investment worries .
in germany , the institute for economic research in halle predicted a growth rate of 0.6 percent next year for the sluggish german economy .
the prognosis is a " peace-time scenario " it warned , and in the event of a war against iraq , the economic recovery will suffer and growth will be considerably less .
but this will be the case around the world .
risks and uncertainty could hinder the global recovery process , köhler cautioned . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de impact of us attacks on markets and industry the attacks on the u.s. had a profound impact on both national and international economies -lrb- sept .

" we ’ re all americans " screamed the editorial in the italian daily , corriere della sera on september 12 , 2001 , a day after the terrorist attacks in america shook the world .
that statement soon became a catch phrase to express solidarity with the united states and was picked up the media , intellectuals and authors in europe in the following weeks and months .
the flood of pictures and footage of the wreckage of the world trade center and grieving americans were accompanied by an unprecedented outpouring of european empathy and the readiness to help america in every way possible to nab the perpetrators .
a different world a year later one year on , things appear quite different .
the spontaneous rush of solidarity has waned , european editorials are increasingly critical of american policy , the war on terror is warily spoken about and european and american politicians seem to be speaking different languages .
at a political level , the transatlantic relationship is said to be at an all-time low .
study provides silver lining in gloomy scenario but while politicians and diplomats in both continents may be locking horns over thorny issues , ordinary europeans and americans are in broad agreement when it comes to the war on terrorism , iraq and a host of international issues .
those are the results of a comprehensive survey of european and american public opinion conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and the chicago council on foreign relations .
the aim was to find out how ordinary americans and europeans looked at the world and at each other after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
called " worldviews 2002 " , the study involved 3,000 telephone interviews in the united states and in the six european countries of britain , france , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany .
more than 9,000 europeans and americans were surveyed .
consensus on us foreign policy while 55 percent of europeans believe that us foreign policy is partly to blame for the sept .
11 attacks , a slightly higher majority -lrb- 59 percent -rrb- of europeans believe the us reaction since the attacks was to protect the united states from further attacks , rather than to impose their will around the globe .
interestingly , the study discovered that americans were almost as critical of certain aspects of us foreign policy as their european counterparts .
europeans gave the bush administration low marks for its handling of the arab-israeli conflict -lrb- a mere 20 percent rate it as " excellent " or " good " -rrb- .
just 21 percent said the same of the us handling of the situation in iraq .
at the same time , americans gave its government only slightly higher marks for the same issues .
seeing eye to eye over iraq despite media reports of transatlantic differences over the issue of a military strike against iraq , the study found that the populaces on both sides of the atlantic have very similar concerns regarding iraq .
both consider iraq to be a top international threat and view it unfavourably .
strikingly , 60 percent of the europeans polled and 65 percent of the americans say the us should only invade iraq with un approval and the support of its allies .
a un mandate was also decisive when it came to europeans ’ support for their country ’ s participation .
surprisingly , the study shows that europeans , who are often criticised for shirking away from substantial military spending , are willing in principle to use troops or force in a broad range of circumstances , though they give higher priority to international and humanitarian goals than americans .
we like each other but not iraq perhaps most importantly , the study shows that americans and europeans have a strong affinity for each other and a similar perception of what " friendship " means .
americans and europeans showed similar likes and dislikes when it came to rating their feelings for other countries on a scale of zero to 100 .
for instance , american citizens gave the germans 61 points , the germans , in return , gave the americans 63 points .
iraq was at the bottom of both american -lrb- 23 -rrb- and european -lrb- 25 -rrb- thermometers .
the greatest disparity between the two is over israel , with americans rating it as high as 55 points , and the europeans a mere 38 points . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links worldviews 2002 the complete study 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

those are the results of a comprehensive survey of european and american public opinion conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and the chicago council on foreign relations .
the aim was to find out how ordinary americans and europeans looked at the world and at each other after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
called " worldviews 2002 " , the study involved 3,000 telephone interviews in the united states and in the six european countries of britain , france , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany .
more than 9,000 europeans and americans were surveyed .
consensus on us foreign policy while 55 percent of europeans believe that us foreign policy is partly to blame for the sept .
11 attacks , a slightly higher majority -lrb- 59 percent -rrb- of europeans believe the us reaction since the attacks was to protect the united states from further attacks , rather than to impose their will around the globe .
interestingly , the study discovered that americans were almost as critical of certain aspects of us foreign policy as their european counterparts .
europeans gave the bush administration low marks for its handling of the arab-israeli conflict -lrb- a mere 20 percent rate it as " excellent " or " good " -rrb- .
just 21 percent said the same of the us handling of the situation in iraq .
at the same time , americans gave its government only slightly higher marks for the same issues .
seeing eye to eye over iraq despite media reports of transatlantic differences over the issue of a military strike against iraq , the study found that the populaces on both sides of the atlantic have very similar concerns regarding iraq .
both consider iraq to be a top international threat and view it unfavourably .
strikingly , 60 percent of the europeans polled and 65 percent of the americans say the us should only invade iraq with un approval and the support of its allies .
a un mandate was also decisive when it came to europeans ’ support for their country ’ s participation .
surprisingly , the study shows that europeans , who are often criticised for shirking away from substantial military spending , are willing in principle to use troops or force in a broad range of circumstances , though they give higher priority to international and humanitarian goals than americans .
we like each other but not iraq perhaps most importantly , the study shows that americans and europeans have a strong affinity for each other and a similar perception of what " friendship " means .
americans and europeans showed similar likes and dislikes when it came to rating their feelings for other countries on a scale of zero to 100 .
for instance , american citizens gave the germans 61 points , the germans , in return , gave the americans 63 points .
iraq was at the bottom of both american -lrb- 23 -rrb- and european -lrb- 25 -rrb- thermometers .
the greatest disparity between the two is over israel , with americans rating it as high as 55 points , and the europeans a mere 38 points . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links worldviews 2002 the complete study 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

investment was hesitant as traders tended to adopt a " let ’ s wait and see " attitude rather than get caught up in impulse buying and selling .
according to investment analysts , few traders were willing to make risky investments , for fear of being caught off guard in the event of a new terrorist act .
many remembered all too well how the market shook and plunged only a year ago after terrorists crashed planes into the world trade center and pentagon .
" very few professional investors have wanted to hold short positions on the basis that if something were to happen today it would be extremely difficult to cover those short positions , " a trader for natwest stockbrokers told afp wire services wednesday morning in london .
reflecting this sense of uncertainty , markets in europe began the day with reserved trading .
across the 12-nation euro zone , the euro stoxx 50 index was down 0.1 percent .
the britsh ftse 100 index dropped 0.6 percent , and the german dax reported a 0.21 percent slip in trading .
only the french cac was able to inch up to a meager 0.2 percent .
the german financial daily handelsblatt described the atmosphere on the international markets as tense and a little nervous .
peter coolidge from brean murray & co. in new york told the paper that " people don ’ t want to commit themselves to anything before september 11 is over . "
another trader at the deutsche bank summarized the mood saying , " no one can prophesize what will really happen , but if something does happen , the markets will crash – that ’ s clear . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader reacts in front of the indicator panel of the german stock index in frankfurt tuesday sept .
11 , 2001 .
remembering last year september 11 , 2001 was a tuesday .
in the us , trading stopped for the next four days . in frankfurt , however , the traders continued conducting their business .
" we wanted to avoid a complete crash of the financial markets , " said frank hartmann , spokesman for the deutsche börse ag -lrb- german stock exchange -rrb- .
except for a two-hour stop on trade with us stocks , business moved on as usual .
but it was anything but a normal business day .
the german dax tumbled 7 to 8 percent by closing time , and wasn ’ t able to recover until nearly two months later .
in london , paris and rome , in hong kong and tokyo , stocks plummeted , and the day ended with some of the biggest single day losses in recent history .
only months later could the global economy recover most of its lost ground .
some industries , however , were so badly hurt , that they are still struggling : aviation , tourism , insurance and re-insurers .
even a year later , germany ’ s travel giant tui is recording 3.8 percent losses .
and several international airlines can only stay in flight with the help of hefty government assistance programs .
lay-offs following the terrorist attacks were especially common in the aviation sector .
american airlines , which lost two jets in the attacks , cut 20,000 positions , a reduction of roughly 20 percent of its entire workforce , while commercial aircraft manufacturer boeing slashed 30,000 jobs shortly after the attacks .
financial losses in the insurance sector were also significant following september 11 .
lloyd ’ s of london , the world ’ s largest insurer , faced claims totaling close to 307 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- .
and the german-based munich re , the world ’ s largest re-insurer , estimated costs at around 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 970 million -rrb- .
beyond september 11 for the rest of the market , however , the negative aftermath of september 11 have been eclipsed by more deep-rooted problems .
economic analysts say many of these , such as a sluggish global economy , rising unemployment and a steady decline in the technology sector , all predate the terrorist attacks , and will continue to cause problems for the markets beyond the one-year anniversary .
" certainly september 11 unsettled investors , " said stefan schneider , chief international economist at deutsche bank research , " but the current low market figures , are not all related to the terrorist attacks . "
by the end of 2001 , the markets had almost fully recovered , he told ndr german television , explaining that other factors were to blame .
the recent downward trend owes much more to accounting scandals in the us , a general pessimism about global economic growth and the situation in the middle east , including a looming war in iraq , said rolf drees , german financial analyst .
as proof of the ongoing troubles , eleven months after the terrorist attacks the dax dropped to 3.235 points , its lowest level since april 1997 .
economic growth is most critical factor in the coming months , the most critical factor driving the markets is confidence in economic development and growth .
according to the german investment trust , long-term market trends for the coming year are dependent on positive growth .
if company returns continue to be low , it explains , the stock markets will not recover .
but this does not appear to be the case .
speaking on tuesday in tokyo , the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , announced that while global economic prospects had weakened in the last year , recovery lies ahead in the upcoming months .
recession is not a real risk , he said .
" although growth prospects have weakened somewhat in the united states and europe , most recently our assessment is that the recovery will continue , " köhler explained , easing investment worries .
in germany , the institute for economic research in halle predicted a growth rate of 0.6 percent next year for the sluggish german economy .
the prognosis is a " peace-time scenario " it warned , and in the event of a war against iraq , the economic recovery will suffer and growth will be considerably less .
but this will be the case around the world .
risks and uncertainty could hinder the global recovery process , köhler cautioned . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de impact of us attacks on markets and industry the attacks on the u.s. had a profound impact on both national and international economies -lrb- sept .

" we ’ re all americans " screamed the editorial in the italian daily , corriere della sera on september 12 , 2001 , a day after the terrorist attacks in america shook the world .
that statement soon became a catch phrase to express solidarity with the united states and was picked up the media , intellectuals and authors in europe in the following weeks and months .
the flood of pictures and footage of the wreckage of the world trade center and grieving americans were accompanied by an unprecedented outpouring of european empathy and the readiness to help america in every way possible to nab the perpetrators .
a different world a year later one year on , things appear quite different .
the spontaneous rush of solidarity has waned , european editorials are increasingly critical of american policy , the war on terror is warily spoken about and european and american politicians seem to be speaking different languages .
at a political level , the transatlantic relationship is said to be at an all-time low .
study provides silver lining in gloomy scenario but while politicians and diplomats in both continents may be locking horns over thorny issues , ordinary europeans and americans are in broad agreement when it comes to the war on terrorism , iraq and a host of international issues .
those are the results of a comprehensive survey of european and american public opinion conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and the chicago council on foreign relations .
the aim was to find out how ordinary americans and europeans looked at the world and at each other after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
called " worldviews 2002 " , the study involved 3,000 telephone interviews in the united states and in the six european countries of britain , france , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany .
more than 9,000 europeans and americans were surveyed .
consensus on us foreign policy while 55 percent of europeans believe that us foreign policy is partly to blame for the sept .
11 attacks , a slightly higher majority -lrb- 59 percent -rrb- of europeans believe the us reaction since the attacks was to protect the united states from further attacks , rather than to impose their will around the globe .
interestingly , the study discovered that americans were almost as critical of certain aspects of us foreign policy as their european counterparts .
europeans gave the bush administration low marks for its handling of the arab-israeli conflict -lrb- a mere 20 percent rate it as " excellent " or " good " -rrb- .
just 21 percent said the same of the us handling of the situation in iraq .
at the same time , americans gave its government only slightly higher marks for the same issues .
seeing eye to eye over iraq despite media reports of transatlantic differences over the issue of a military strike against iraq , the study found that the populaces on both sides of the atlantic have very similar concerns regarding iraq .
both consider iraq to be a top international threat and view it unfavourably .
strikingly , 60 percent of the europeans polled and 65 percent of the americans say the us should only invade iraq with un approval and the support of its allies .
a un mandate was also decisive when it came to europeans ’ support for their country ’ s participation .
surprisingly , the study shows that europeans , who are often criticised for shirking away from substantial military spending , are willing in principle to use troops or force in a broad range of circumstances , though they give higher priority to international and humanitarian goals than americans .
we like each other but not iraq perhaps most importantly , the study shows that americans and europeans have a strong affinity for each other and a similar perception of what " friendship " means .
americans and europeans showed similar likes and dislikes when it came to rating their feelings for other countries on a scale of zero to 100 .
for instance , american citizens gave the germans 61 points , the germans , in return , gave the americans 63 points .
iraq was at the bottom of both american -lrb- 23 -rrb- and european -lrb- 25 -rrb- thermometers .
the greatest disparity between the two is over israel , with americans rating it as high as 55 points , and the europeans a mere 38 points . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links worldviews 2002 the complete study 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

investment was hesitant as traders tended to adopt a " let ’ s wait and see " attitude rather than get caught up in impulse buying and selling .
according to investment analysts , few traders were willing to make risky investments , for fear of being caught off guard in the event of a new terrorist act .
many remembered all too well how the market shook and plunged only a year ago after terrorists crashed planes into the world trade center and pentagon .
" very few professional investors have wanted to hold short positions on the basis that if something were to happen today it would be extremely difficult to cover those short positions , " a trader for natwest stockbrokers told afp wire services wednesday morning in london .
reflecting this sense of uncertainty , markets in europe began the day with reserved trading .
across the 12-nation euro zone , the euro stoxx 50 index was down 0.1 percent .
the britsh ftse 100 index dropped 0.6 percent , and the german dax reported a 0.21 percent slip in trading .
only the french cac was able to inch up to a meager 0.2 percent .
the german financial daily handelsblatt described the atmosphere on the international markets as tense and a little nervous .
peter coolidge from brean murray & co. in new york told the paper that " people don ’ t want to commit themselves to anything before september 11 is over . "
another trader at the deutsche bank summarized the mood saying , " no one can prophesize what will really happen , but if something does happen , the markets will crash – that ’ s clear . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader reacts in front of the indicator panel of the german stock index in frankfurt tuesday sept .
11 , 2001 .
remembering last year september 11 , 2001 was a tuesday .
in the us , trading stopped for the next four days . in frankfurt , however , the traders continued conducting their business .
" we wanted to avoid a complete crash of the financial markets , " said frank hartmann , spokesman for the deutsche börse ag -lrb- german stock exchange -rrb- .
except for a two-hour stop on trade with us stocks , business moved on as usual .
but it was anything but a normal business day .
the german dax tumbled 7 to 8 percent by closing time , and wasn ’ t able to recover until nearly two months later .
in london , paris and rome , in hong kong and tokyo , stocks plummeted , and the day ended with some of the biggest single day losses in recent history .
only months later could the global economy recover most of its lost ground .
some industries , however , were so badly hurt , that they are still struggling : aviation , tourism , insurance and re-insurers .
even a year later , germany ’ s travel giant tui is recording 3.8 percent losses .
and several international airlines can only stay in flight with the help of hefty government assistance programs .
lay-offs following the terrorist attacks were especially common in the aviation sector .
american airlines , which lost two jets in the attacks , cut 20,000 positions , a reduction of roughly 20 percent of its entire workforce , while commercial aircraft manufacturer boeing slashed 30,000 jobs shortly after the attacks .
financial losses in the insurance sector were also significant following september 11 .
lloyd ’ s of london , the world ’ s largest insurer , faced claims totaling close to 307 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- .
and the german-based munich re , the world ’ s largest re-insurer , estimated costs at around 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 970 million -rrb- .
beyond september 11 for the rest of the market , however , the negative aftermath of september 11 have been eclipsed by more deep-rooted problems .
economic analysts say many of these , such as a sluggish global economy , rising unemployment and a steady decline in the technology sector , all predate the terrorist attacks , and will continue to cause problems for the markets beyond the one-year anniversary .
" certainly september 11 unsettled investors , " said stefan schneider , chief international economist at deutsche bank research , " but the current low market figures , are not all related to the terrorist attacks . "
by the end of 2001 , the markets had almost fully recovered , he told ndr german television , explaining that other factors were to blame .
the recent downward trend owes much more to accounting scandals in the us , a general pessimism about global economic growth and the situation in the middle east , including a looming war in iraq , said rolf drees , german financial analyst .
as proof of the ongoing troubles , eleven months after the terrorist attacks the dax dropped to 3.235 points , its lowest level since april 1997 .
economic growth is most critical factor in the coming months , the most critical factor driving the markets is confidence in economic development and growth .
according to the german investment trust , long-term market trends for the coming year are dependent on positive growth .
if company returns continue to be low , it explains , the stock markets will not recover .
but this does not appear to be the case .
speaking on tuesday in tokyo , the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , announced that while global economic prospects had weakened in the last year , recovery lies ahead in the upcoming months .
recession is not a real risk , he said .
" although growth prospects have weakened somewhat in the united states and europe , most recently our assessment is that the recovery will continue , " köhler explained , easing investment worries .
in germany , the institute for economic research in halle predicted a growth rate of 0.6 percent next year for the sluggish german economy .
the prognosis is a " peace-time scenario " it warned , and in the event of a war against iraq , the economic recovery will suffer and growth will be considerably less .

investment was hesitant as traders tended to adopt a " let ’ s wait and see " attitude rather than get caught up in impulse buying and selling .
according to investment analysts , few traders were willing to make risky investments , for fear of being caught off guard in the event of a new terrorist act .
many remembered all too well how the market shook and plunged only a year ago after terrorists crashed planes into the world trade center and pentagon .
" very few professional investors have wanted to hold short positions on the basis that if something were to happen today it would be extremely difficult to cover those short positions , " a trader for natwest stockbrokers told afp wire services wednesday morning in london .
reflecting this sense of uncertainty , markets in europe began the day with reserved trading .
across the 12-nation euro zone , the euro stoxx 50 index was down 0.1 percent .
the britsh ftse 100 index dropped 0.6 percent , and the german dax reported a 0.21 percent slip in trading .
only the french cac was able to inch up to a meager 0.2 percent .
the german financial daily handelsblatt described the atmosphere on the international markets as tense and a little nervous .
peter coolidge from brean murray & co. in new york told the paper that " people don ’ t want to commit themselves to anything before september 11 is over . "
another trader at the deutsche bank summarized the mood saying , " no one can prophesize what will really happen , but if something does happen , the markets will crash – that ’ s clear . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader reacts in front of the indicator panel of the german stock index in frankfurt tuesday sept .
11 , 2001 .
remembering last year september 11 , 2001 was a tuesday .
in the us , trading stopped for the next four days . in frankfurt , however , the traders continued conducting their business .
" we wanted to avoid a complete crash of the financial markets , " said frank hartmann , spokesman for the deutsche börse ag -lrb- german stock exchange -rrb- .
except for a two-hour stop on trade with us stocks , business moved on as usual .
but it was anything but a normal business day .
the german dax tumbled 7 to 8 percent by closing time , and wasn ’ t able to recover until nearly two months later .
in london , paris and rome , in hong kong and tokyo , stocks plummeted , and the day ended with some of the biggest single day losses in recent history .
only months later could the global economy recover most of its lost ground .
some industries , however , were so badly hurt , that they are still struggling : aviation , tourism , insurance and re-insurers .
even a year later , germany ’ s travel giant tui is recording 3.8 percent losses .
and several international airlines can only stay in flight with the help of hefty government assistance programs .
lay-offs following the terrorist attacks were especially common in the aviation sector .
american airlines , which lost two jets in the attacks , cut 20,000 positions , a reduction of roughly 20 percent of its entire workforce , while commercial aircraft manufacturer boeing slashed 30,000 jobs shortly after the attacks .
financial losses in the insurance sector were also significant following september 11 .
lloyd ’ s of london , the world ’ s largest insurer , faced claims totaling close to 307 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- .
and the german-based munich re , the world ’ s largest re-insurer , estimated costs at around 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 970 million -rrb- .
beyond september 11 for the rest of the market , however , the negative aftermath of september 11 have been eclipsed by more deep-rooted problems .
economic analysts say many of these , such as a sluggish global economy , rising unemployment and a steady decline in the technology sector , all predate the terrorist attacks , and will continue to cause problems for the markets beyond the one-year anniversary .
" certainly september 11 unsettled investors , " said stefan schneider , chief international economist at deutsche bank research , " but the current low market figures , are not all related to the terrorist attacks . "
by the end of 2001 , the markets had almost fully recovered , he told ndr german television , explaining that other factors were to blame .
the recent downward trend owes much more to accounting scandals in the us , a general pessimism about global economic growth and the situation in the middle east , including a looming war in iraq , said rolf drees , german financial analyst .
as proof of the ongoing troubles , eleven months after the terrorist attacks the dax dropped to 3.235 points , its lowest level since april 1997 .
economic growth is most critical factor in the coming months , the most critical factor driving the markets is confidence in economic development and growth .
according to the german investment trust , long-term market trends for the coming year are dependent on positive growth .
if company returns continue to be low , it explains , the stock markets will not recover .
but this does not appear to be the case .
speaking on tuesday in tokyo , the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , announced that while global economic prospects had weakened in the last year , recovery lies ahead in the upcoming months .
recession is not a real risk , he said .
" although growth prospects have weakened somewhat in the united states and europe , most recently our assessment is that the recovery will continue , " köhler explained , easing investment worries .
in germany , the institute for economic research in halle predicted a growth rate of 0.6 percent next year for the sluggish german economy .
the prognosis is a " peace-time scenario " it warned , and in the event of a war against iraq , the economic recovery will suffer and growth will be considerably less .
but this will be the case around the world .
risks and uncertainty could hinder the global recovery process , köhler cautioned . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de impact of us attacks on markets and industry the attacks on the u.s. had a profound impact on both national and international economies -lrb- sept .

" we ’ re all americans " screamed the editorial in the italian daily , corriere della sera on september 12 , 2001 , a day after the terrorist attacks in america shook the world .
that statement soon became a catch phrase to express solidarity with the united states and was picked up the media , intellectuals and authors in europe in the following weeks and months .
the flood of pictures and footage of the wreckage of the world trade center and grieving americans were accompanied by an unprecedented outpouring of european empathy and the readiness to help america in every way possible to nab the perpetrators .
a different world a year later one year on , things appear quite different .
the spontaneous rush of solidarity has waned , european editorials are increasingly critical of american policy , the war on terror is warily spoken about and european and american politicians seem to be speaking different languages .
at a political level , the transatlantic relationship is said to be at an all-time low .
study provides silver lining in gloomy scenario but while politicians and diplomats in both continents may be locking horns over thorny issues , ordinary europeans and americans are in broad agreement when it comes to the war on terrorism , iraq and a host of international issues .
those are the results of a comprehensive survey of european and american public opinion conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and the chicago council on foreign relations .
the aim was to find out how ordinary americans and europeans looked at the world and at each other after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
called " worldviews 2002 " , the study involved 3,000 telephone interviews in the united states and in the six european countries of britain , france , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany .
more than 9,000 europeans and americans were surveyed .
consensus on us foreign policy while 55 percent of europeans believe that us foreign policy is partly to blame for the sept .
11 attacks , a slightly higher majority -lrb- 59 percent -rrb- of europeans believe the us reaction since the attacks was to protect the united states from further attacks , rather than to impose their will around the globe .
interestingly , the study discovered that americans were almost as critical of certain aspects of us foreign policy as their european counterparts .
europeans gave the bush administration low marks for its handling of the arab-israeli conflict -lrb- a mere 20 percent rate it as " excellent " or " good " -rrb- .
just 21 percent said the same of the us handling of the situation in iraq .
at the same time , americans gave its government only slightly higher marks for the same issues .
seeing eye to eye over iraq despite media reports of transatlantic differences over the issue of a military strike against iraq , the study found that the populaces on both sides of the atlantic have very similar concerns regarding iraq .
both consider iraq to be a top international threat and view it unfavourably .
strikingly , 60 percent of the europeans polled and 65 percent of the americans say the us should only invade iraq with un approval and the support of its allies .
a un mandate was also decisive when it came to europeans ’ support for their country ’ s participation .
surprisingly , the study shows that europeans , who are often criticised for shirking away from substantial military spending , are willing in principle to use troops or force in a broad range of circumstances , though they give higher priority to international and humanitarian goals than americans .
we like each other but not iraq perhaps most importantly , the study shows that americans and europeans have a strong affinity for each other and a similar perception of what " friendship " means .
americans and europeans showed similar likes and dislikes when it came to rating their feelings for other countries on a scale of zero to 100 .
for instance , american citizens gave the germans 61 points , the germans , in return , gave the americans 63 points .
iraq was at the bottom of both american -lrb- 23 -rrb- and european -lrb- 25 -rrb- thermometers .
the greatest disparity between the two is over israel , with americans rating it as high as 55 points , and the europeans a mere 38 points . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links worldviews 2002 the complete study media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader reacts in front of the indicator panel of the german stock index in frankfurt tuesday sept .
11 , 2001 .
remembering last year september 11 , 2001 was a tuesday .
in the us , trading stopped for the next four days . in frankfurt , however , the traders continued conducting their business .
" we wanted to avoid a complete crash of the financial markets , " said frank hartmann , spokesman for the deutsche börse ag -lrb- german stock exchange -rrb- .
except for a two-hour stop on trade with us stocks , business moved on as usual .
but it was anything but a normal business day .
the german dax tumbled 7 to 8 percent by closing time , and wasn ’ t able to recover until nearly two months later .
in london , paris and rome , in hong kong and tokyo , stocks plummeted , and the day ended with some of the biggest single day losses in recent history .
only months later could the global economy recover most of its lost ground .
some industries , however , were so badly hurt , that they are still struggling : aviation , tourism , insurance and re-insurers .
even a year later , germany ’ s travel giant tui is recording 3.8 percent losses .
and several international airlines can only stay in flight with the help of hefty government assistance programs .
lay-offs following the terrorist attacks were especially common in the aviation sector .
american airlines , which lost two jets in the attacks , cut 20,000 positions , a reduction of roughly 20 percent of its entire workforce , while commercial aircraft manufacturer boeing slashed 30,000 jobs shortly after the attacks .
financial losses in the insurance sector were also significant following september 11 .
lloyd ’ s of london , the world ’ s largest insurer , faced claims totaling close to 307 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- .
and the german-based munich re , the world ’ s largest re-insurer , estimated costs at around 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 970 million -rrb- .
beyond september 11 for the rest of the market , however , the negative aftermath of september 11 have been eclipsed by more deep-rooted problems .
economic analysts say many of these , such as a sluggish global economy , rising unemployment and a steady decline in the technology sector , all predate the terrorist attacks , and will continue to cause problems for the markets beyond the one-year anniversary .
" certainly september 11 unsettled investors , " said stefan schneider , chief international economist at deutsche bank research , " but the current low market figures , are not all related to the terrorist attacks . "
by the end of 2001 , the markets had almost fully recovered , he told ndr german television , explaining that other factors were to blame .
the recent downward trend owes much more to accounting scandals in the us , a general pessimism about global economic growth and the situation in the middle east , including a looming war in iraq , said rolf drees , german financial analyst .
as proof of the ongoing troubles , eleven months after the terrorist attacks the dax dropped to 3.235 points , its lowest level since april 1997 .
economic growth is most critical factor in the coming months , the most critical factor driving the markets is confidence in economic development and growth .
according to the german investment trust , long-term market trends for the coming year are dependent on positive growth .
if company returns continue to be low , it explains , the stock markets will not recover .
but this does not appear to be the case .
speaking on tuesday in tokyo , the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , announced that while global economic prospects had weakened in the last year , recovery lies ahead in the upcoming months .
recession is not a real risk , he said .
" although growth prospects have weakened somewhat in the united states and europe , most recently our assessment is that the recovery will continue , " köhler explained , easing investment worries .
in germany , the institute for economic research in halle predicted a growth rate of 0.6 percent next year for the sluggish german economy .
the prognosis is a " peace-time scenario " it warned , and in the event of a war against iraq , the economic recovery will suffer and growth will be considerably less .

" we ’ re all americans " screamed the editorial in the italian daily , corriere della sera on september 12 , 2001 , a day after the terrorist attacks in america shook the world .
that statement soon became a catch phrase to express solidarity with the united states and was picked up the media , intellectuals and authors in europe in the following weeks and months .
the flood of pictures and footage of the wreckage of the world trade center and grieving americans were accompanied by an unprecedented outpouring of european empathy and the readiness to help america in every way possible to nab the perpetrators .
a different world a year later one year on , things appear quite different .
the spontaneous rush of solidarity has waned , european editorials are increasingly critical of american policy , the war on terror is warily spoken about and european and american politicians seem to be speaking different languages .
at a political level , the transatlantic relationship is said to be at an all-time low .
study provides silver lining in gloomy scenario but while politicians and diplomats in both continents may be locking horns over thorny issues , ordinary europeans and americans are in broad agreement when it comes to the war on terrorism , iraq and a host of international issues .
those are the results of a comprehensive survey of european and american public opinion conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and the chicago council on foreign relations .
the aim was to find out how ordinary americans and europeans looked at the world and at each other after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
called " worldviews 2002 " , the study involved 3,000 telephone interviews in the united states and in the six european countries of britain , france , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany .
more than 9,000 europeans and americans were surveyed .
consensus on us foreign policy while 55 percent of europeans believe that us foreign policy is partly to blame for the sept .
11 attacks , a slightly higher majority -lrb- 59 percent -rrb- of europeans believe the us reaction since the attacks was to protect the united states from further attacks , rather than to impose their will around the globe .
interestingly , the study discovered that americans were almost as critical of certain aspects of us foreign policy as their european counterparts .
europeans gave the bush administration low marks for its handling of the arab-israeli conflict -lrb- a mere 20 percent rate it as " excellent " or " good " -rrb- .
just 21 percent said the same of the us handling of the situation in iraq .
at the same time , americans gave its government only slightly higher marks for the same issues .
seeing eye to eye over iraq despite media reports of transatlantic differences over the issue of a military strike against iraq , the study found that the populaces on both sides of the atlantic have very similar concerns regarding iraq .
both consider iraq to be a top international threat and view it unfavourably .
strikingly , 60 percent of the europeans polled and 65 percent of the americans say the us should only invade iraq with un approval and the support of its allies .
a un mandate was also decisive when it came to europeans ’ support for their country ’ s participation .
surprisingly , the study shows that europeans , who are often criticised for shirking away from substantial military spending , are willing in principle to use troops or force in a broad range of circumstances , though they give higher priority to international and humanitarian goals than americans .
we like each other but not iraq perhaps most importantly , the study shows that americans and europeans have a strong affinity for each other and a similar perception of what " friendship " means .
americans and europeans showed similar likes and dislikes when it came to rating their feelings for other countries on a scale of zero to 100 .
for instance , american citizens gave the germans 61 points , the germans , in return , gave the americans 63 points .
iraq was at the bottom of both american -lrb- 23 -rrb- and european -lrb- 25 -rrb- thermometers .
the greatest disparity between the two is over israel , with americans rating it as high as 55 points , and the europeans a mere 38 points . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links worldviews 2002 the complete study dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

both consider iraq to be a top international threat and view it unfavourably .
strikingly , 60 percent of the europeans polled and 65 percent of the americans say the us should only invade iraq with un approval and the support of its allies .
a un mandate was also decisive when it came to europeans ’ support for their country ’ s participation .
surprisingly , the study shows that europeans , who are often criticised for shirking away from substantial military spending , are willing in principle to use troops or force in a broad range of circumstances , though they give higher priority to international and humanitarian goals than americans .
we like each other but not iraq perhaps most importantly , the study shows that americans and europeans have a strong affinity for each other and a similar perception of what " friendship " means .
americans and europeans showed similar likes and dislikes when it came to rating their feelings for other countries on a scale of zero to 100 .
for instance , american citizens gave the germans 61 points , the germans , in return , gave the americans 63 points .
iraq was at the bottom of both american -lrb- 23 -rrb- and european -lrb- 25 -rrb- thermometers .
the greatest disparity between the two is over israel , with americans rating it as high as 55 points , and the europeans a mere 38 points . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links worldviews 2002 the complete study media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

" we ’ re all americans " screamed the editorial in the italian daily , corriere della sera on september 12 , 2001 , a day after the terrorist attacks in america shook the world .
that statement soon became a catch phrase to express solidarity with the united states and was picked up the media , intellectuals and authors in europe in the following weeks and months .
the flood of pictures and footage of the wreckage of the world trade center and grieving americans were accompanied by an unprecedented outpouring of european empathy and the readiness to help america in every way possible to nab the perpetrators .
a different world a year later one year on , things appear quite different .
the spontaneous rush of solidarity has waned , european editorials are increasingly critical of american policy , the war on terror is warily spoken about and european and american politicians seem to be speaking different languages .
at a political level , the transatlantic relationship is said to be at an all-time low .
study provides silver lining in gloomy scenario but while politicians and diplomats in both continents may be locking horns over thorny issues , ordinary europeans and americans are in broad agreement when it comes to the war on terrorism , iraq and a host of international issues .
those are the results of a comprehensive survey of european and american public opinion conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and the chicago council on foreign relations .
the aim was to find out how ordinary americans and europeans looked at the world and at each other after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
called " worldviews 2002 " , the study involved 3,000 telephone interviews in the united states and in the six european countries of britain , france , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany .
more than 9,000 europeans and americans were surveyed .
consensus on us foreign policy while 55 percent of europeans believe that us foreign policy is partly to blame for the sept .
11 attacks , a slightly higher majority -lrb- 59 percent -rrb- of europeans believe the us reaction since the attacks was to protect the united states from further attacks , rather than to impose their will around the globe .
interestingly , the study discovered that americans were almost as critical of certain aspects of us foreign policy as their european counterparts .
europeans gave the bush administration low marks for its handling of the arab-israeli conflict -lrb- a mere 20 percent rate it as " excellent " or " good " -rrb- .
just 21 percent said the same of the us handling of the situation in iraq .
at the same time , americans gave its government only slightly higher marks for the same issues .
seeing eye to eye over iraq despite media reports of transatlantic differences over the issue of a military strike against iraq , the study found that the populaces on both sides of the atlantic have very similar concerns regarding iraq .
both consider iraq to be a top international threat and view it unfavourably .
strikingly , 60 percent of the europeans polled and 65 percent of the americans say the us should only invade iraq with un approval and the support of its allies .
a un mandate was also decisive when it came to europeans ’ support for their country ’ s participation .
surprisingly , the study shows that europeans , who are often criticised for shirking away from substantial military spending , are willing in principle to use troops or force in a broad range of circumstances , though they give higher priority to international and humanitarian goals than americans .
we like each other but not iraq perhaps most importantly , the study shows that americans and europeans have a strong affinity for each other and a similar perception of what " friendship " means .
americans and europeans showed similar likes and dislikes when it came to rating their feelings for other countries on a scale of zero to 100 .
for instance , american citizens gave the germans 61 points , the germans , in return , gave the americans 63 points .
iraq was at the bottom of both american -lrb- 23 -rrb- and european -lrb- 25 -rrb- thermometers .
the greatest disparity between the two is over israel , with americans rating it as high as 55 points , and the europeans a mere 38 points . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links worldviews 2002 the complete study 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

" we ’ re all americans " screamed the editorial in the italian daily , corriere della sera on september 12 , 2001 , a day after the terrorist attacks in america shook the world .
that statement soon became a catch phrase to express solidarity with the united states and was picked up the media , intellectuals and authors in europe in the following weeks and months .
the flood of pictures and footage of the wreckage of the world trade center and grieving americans were accompanied by an unprecedented outpouring of european empathy and the readiness to help america in every way possible to nab the perpetrators .
a different world a year later one year on , things appear quite different .
the spontaneous rush of solidarity has waned , european editorials are increasingly critical of american policy , the war on terror is warily spoken about and european and american politicians seem to be speaking different languages .
at a political level , the transatlantic relationship is said to be at an all-time low .
study provides silver lining in gloomy scenario but while politicians and diplomats in both continents may be locking horns over thorny issues , ordinary europeans and americans are in broad agreement when it comes to the war on terrorism , iraq and a host of international issues .
those are the results of a comprehensive survey of european and american public opinion conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and the chicago council on foreign relations .
the aim was to find out how ordinary americans and europeans looked at the world and at each other after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
called " worldviews 2002 " , the study involved 3,000 telephone interviews in the united states and in the six european countries of britain , france , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany .
more than 9,000 europeans and americans were surveyed .
consensus on us foreign policy while 55 percent of europeans believe that us foreign policy is partly to blame for the sept .
11 attacks , a slightly higher majority -lrb- 59 percent -rrb- of europeans believe the us reaction since the attacks was to protect the united states from further attacks , rather than to impose their will around the globe .
interestingly , the study discovered that americans were almost as critical of certain aspects of us foreign policy as their european counterparts .
europeans gave the bush administration low marks for its handling of the arab-israeli conflict -lrb- a mere 20 percent rate it as " excellent " or " good " -rrb- .
just 21 percent said the same of the us handling of the situation in iraq .
at the same time , americans gave its government only slightly higher marks for the same issues .
seeing eye to eye over iraq despite media reports of transatlantic differences over the issue of a military strike against iraq , the study found that the populaces on both sides of the atlantic have very similar concerns regarding iraq .
both consider iraq to be a top international threat and view it unfavourably .
strikingly , 60 percent of the europeans polled and 65 percent of the americans say the us should only invade iraq with un approval and the support of its allies .
a un mandate was also decisive when it came to europeans ’ support for their country ’ s participation .
surprisingly , the study shows that europeans , who are often criticised for shirking away from substantial military spending , are willing in principle to use troops or force in a broad range of circumstances , though they give higher priority to international and humanitarian goals than americans .

investment was hesitant as traders tended to adopt a " let ’ s wait and see " attitude rather than get caught up in impulse buying and selling .
according to investment analysts , few traders were willing to make risky investments , for fear of being caught off guard in the event of a new terrorist act .
many remembered all too well how the market shook and plunged only a year ago after terrorists crashed planes into the world trade center and pentagon .
" very few professional investors have wanted to hold short positions on the basis that if something were to happen today it would be extremely difficult to cover those short positions , " a trader for natwest stockbrokers told afp wire services wednesday morning in london .
reflecting this sense of uncertainty , markets in europe began the day with reserved trading .
across the 12-nation euro zone , the euro stoxx 50 index was down 0.1 percent .
the britsh ftse 100 index dropped 0.6 percent , and the german dax reported a 0.21 percent slip in trading .
only the french cac was able to inch up to a meager 0.2 percent .
the german financial daily handelsblatt described the atmosphere on the international markets as tense and a little nervous .
peter coolidge from brean murray & co. in new york told the paper that " people don ’ t want to commit themselves to anything before september 11 is over . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader reacts in front of the indicator panel of the german stock index in frankfurt tuesday sept .
11 , 2001 .
remembering last year september 11 , 2001 was a tuesday .
in the us , trading stopped for the next four days . in frankfurt , however , the traders continued conducting their business .
" we wanted to avoid a complete crash of the financial markets , " said frank hartmann , spokesman for the deutsche börse ag -lrb- german stock exchange -rrb- .
except for a two-hour stop on trade with us stocks , business moved on as usual .
but it was anything but a normal business day .
the german dax tumbled 7 to 8 percent by closing time , and wasn ’ t able to recover until nearly two months later .
in london , paris and rome , in hong kong and tokyo , stocks plummeted , and the day ended with some of the biggest single day losses in recent history .
only months later could the global economy recover most of its lost ground .
some industries , however , were so badly hurt , that they are still struggling : aviation , tourism , insurance and re-insurers .
even a year later , germany ’ s travel giant tui is recording 3.8 percent losses .
and several international airlines can only stay in flight with the help of hefty government assistance programs .
lay-offs following the terrorist attacks were especially common in the aviation sector .
american airlines , which lost two jets in the attacks , cut 20,000 positions , a reduction of roughly 20 percent of its entire workforce , while commercial aircraft manufacturer boeing slashed 30,000 jobs shortly after the attacks .
financial losses in the insurance sector were also significant following september 11 .
lloyd ’ s of london , the world ’ s largest insurer , faced claims totaling close to 307 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- .
and the german-based munich re , the world ’ s largest re-insurer , estimated costs at around 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 970 million -rrb- .
beyond september 11 for the rest of the market , however , the negative aftermath of september 11 have been eclipsed by more deep-rooted problems .
economic analysts say many of these , such as a sluggish global economy , rising unemployment and a steady decline in the technology sector , all predate the terrorist attacks , and will continue to cause problems for the markets beyond the one-year anniversary .
" certainly september 11 unsettled investors , " said stefan schneider , chief international economist at deutsche bank research , " but the current low market figures , are not all related to the terrorist attacks . "
by the end of 2001 , the markets had almost fully recovered , he told ndr german television , explaining that other factors were to blame .
the recent downward trend owes much more to accounting scandals in the us , a general pessimism about global economic growth and the situation in the middle east , including a looming war in iraq , said rolf drees , german financial analyst .
as proof of the ongoing troubles , eleven months after the terrorist attacks the dax dropped to 3.235 points , its lowest level since april 1997 .
economic growth is most critical factor in the coming months , the most critical factor driving the markets is confidence in economic development and growth .
according to the german investment trust , long-term market trends for the coming year are dependent on positive growth .
if company returns continue to be low , it explains , the stock markets will not recover .
but this does not appear to be the case .
speaking on tuesday in tokyo , the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , announced that while global economic prospects had weakened in the last year , recovery lies ahead in the upcoming months .
recession is not a real risk , he said .
" although growth prospects have weakened somewhat in the united states and europe , most recently our assessment is that the recovery will continue , " köhler explained , easing investment worries .
in germany , the institute for economic research in halle predicted a growth rate of 0.6 percent next year for the sluggish german economy .
the prognosis is a " peace-time scenario " it warned , and in the event of a war against iraq , the economic recovery will suffer and growth will be considerably less .

investment was hesitant as traders tended to adopt a " let ’ s wait and see " attitude rather than get caught up in impulse buying and selling .
according to investment analysts , few traders were willing to make risky investments , for fear of being caught off guard in the event of a new terrorist act .
many remembered all too well how the market shook and plunged only a year ago after terrorists crashed planes into the world trade center and pentagon .
" very few professional investors have wanted to hold short positions on the basis that if something were to happen today it would be extremely difficult to cover those short positions , " a trader for natwest stockbrokers told afp wire services wednesday morning in london .
reflecting this sense of uncertainty , markets in europe began the day with reserved trading .
across the 12-nation euro zone , the euro stoxx 50 index was down 0.1 percent .
the britsh ftse 100 index dropped 0.6 percent , and the german dax reported a 0.21 percent slip in trading .
only the french cac was able to inch up to a meager 0.2 percent .
the german financial daily handelsblatt described the atmosphere on the international markets as tense and a little nervous .
peter coolidge from brean murray & co. in new york told the paper that " people don ’ t want to commit themselves to anything before september 11 is over . "
another trader at the deutsche bank summarized the mood saying , " no one can prophesize what will really happen , but if something does happen , the markets will crash – that ’ s clear . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader reacts in front of the indicator panel of the german stock index in frankfurt tuesday sept .
11 , 2001 .
remembering last year september 11 , 2001 was a tuesday .
in the us , trading stopped for the next four days . in frankfurt , however , the traders continued conducting their business .
" we wanted to avoid a complete crash of the financial markets , " said frank hartmann , spokesman for the deutsche börse ag -lrb- german stock exchange -rrb- .
except for a two-hour stop on trade with us stocks , business moved on as usual .
but it was anything but a normal business day .
the german dax tumbled 7 to 8 percent by closing time , and wasn ’ t able to recover until nearly two months later .
in london , paris and rome , in hong kong and tokyo , stocks plummeted , and the day ended with some of the biggest single day losses in recent history .
only months later could the global economy recover most of its lost ground .
some industries , however , were so badly hurt , that they are still struggling : aviation , tourism , insurance and re-insurers .
even a year later , germany ’ s travel giant tui is recording 3.8 percent losses .
and several international airlines can only stay in flight with the help of hefty government assistance programs .
lay-offs following the terrorist attacks were especially common in the aviation sector .
american airlines , which lost two jets in the attacks , cut 20,000 positions , a reduction of roughly 20 percent of its entire workforce , while commercial aircraft manufacturer boeing slashed 30,000 jobs shortly after the attacks .
financial losses in the insurance sector were also significant following september 11 .
lloyd ’ s of london , the world ’ s largest insurer , faced claims totaling close to 307 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- .
and the german-based munich re , the world ’ s largest re-insurer , estimated costs at around 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 970 million -rrb- .
beyond september 11 for the rest of the market , however , the negative aftermath of september 11 have been eclipsed by more deep-rooted problems .
economic analysts say many of these , such as a sluggish global economy , rising unemployment and a steady decline in the technology sector , all predate the terrorist attacks , and will continue to cause problems for the markets beyond the one-year anniversary .
" certainly september 11 unsettled investors , " said stefan schneider , chief international economist at deutsche bank research , " but the current low market figures , are not all related to the terrorist attacks . "
by the end of 2001 , the markets had almost fully recovered , he told ndr german television , explaining that other factors were to blame .
the recent downward trend owes much more to accounting scandals in the us , a general pessimism about global economic growth and the situation in the middle east , including a looming war in iraq , said rolf drees , german financial analyst .
as proof of the ongoing troubles , eleven months after the terrorist attacks the dax dropped to 3.235 points , its lowest level since april 1997 .
economic growth is most critical factor in the coming months , the most critical factor driving the markets is confidence in economic development and growth .
according to the german investment trust , long-term market trends for the coming year are dependent on positive growth .
if company returns continue to be low , it explains , the stock markets will not recover .
but this does not appear to be the case .
speaking on tuesday in tokyo , the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , announced that while global economic prospects had weakened in the last year , recovery lies ahead in the upcoming months .
recession is not a real risk , he said .
" although growth prospects have weakened somewhat in the united states and europe , most recently our assessment is that the recovery will continue , " köhler explained , easing investment worries .
in germany , the institute for economic research in halle predicted a growth rate of 0.6 percent next year for the sluggish german economy .
the prognosis is a " peace-time scenario " it warned , and in the event of a war against iraq , the economic recovery will suffer and growth will be considerably less .
but this will be the case around the world .
risks and uncertainty could hinder the global recovery process , köhler cautioned . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de impact of us attacks on markets and industry the attacks on the u.s. had a profound impact on both national and international economies -lrb- sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.09.2002 transatlantic chasm not so wide after all großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the events of september 11 both bound and drove america and europe apart despite frostier-than-usual relations between the united states and europe , the people of both continents seem to be closer than ever in the way they see the world , says a recent study . " we ’ re all americans " screamed the editorial in the italian daily , corriere della sera on september 12 , 2001 , a day after the terrorist attacks in america shook the world .
that statement soon became a catch phrase to express solidarity with the united states and was picked up the media , intellectuals and authors in europe in the following weeks and months .
the flood of pictures and footage of the wreckage of the world trade center and grieving americans were accompanied by an unprecedented outpouring of european empathy and the readiness to help america in every way possible to nab the perpetrators .
a different world a year later one year on , things appear quite different .
the spontaneous rush of solidarity has waned , european editorials are increasingly critical of american policy , the war on terror is warily spoken about and european and american politicians seem to be speaking different languages .
at a political level , the transatlantic relationship is said to be at an all-time low .
study provides silver lining in gloomy scenario but while politicians and diplomats in both continents may be locking horns over thorny issues , ordinary europeans and americans are in broad agreement when it comes to the war on terrorism , iraq and a host of international issues .
those are the results of a comprehensive survey of european and american public opinion conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and the chicago council on foreign relations .
the aim was to find out how ordinary americans and europeans looked at the world and at each other after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
called " worldviews 2002 " , the study involved 3,000 telephone interviews in the united states and in the six european countries of britain , france , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany .
more than 9,000 europeans and americans were surveyed .
consensus on us foreign policy while 55 percent of europeans believe that us foreign policy is partly to blame for the sept .
11 attacks , a slightly higher majority -lrb- 59 percent -rrb- of europeans believe the us reaction since the attacks was to protect the united states from further attacks , rather than to impose their will around the globe .
interestingly , the study discovered that americans were almost as critical of certain aspects of us foreign policy as their european counterparts .
europeans gave the bush administration low marks for its handling of the arab-israeli conflict -lrb- a mere 20 percent rate it as " excellent " or " good " -rrb- .
just 21 percent said the same of the us handling of the situation in iraq .
at the same time , americans gave its government only slightly higher marks for the same issues .
seeing eye to eye over iraq despite media reports of transatlantic differences over the issue of a military strike against iraq , the study found that the populaces on both sides of the atlantic have very similar concerns regarding iraq .
both consider iraq to be a top international threat and view it unfavourably .
strikingly , 60 percent of the europeans polled and 65 percent of the americans say the us should only invade iraq with un approval and the support of its allies .
a un mandate was also decisive when it came to europeans ’ support for their country ’ s participation .
surprisingly , the study shows that europeans , who are often criticised for shirking away from substantial military spending , are willing in principle to use troops or force in a broad range of circumstances , though they give higher priority to international and humanitarian goals than americans .
we like each other but not iraq perhaps most importantly , the study shows that americans and europeans have a strong affinity for each other and a similar perception of what " friendship " means .
americans and europeans showed similar likes and dislikes when it came to rating their feelings for other countries on a scale of zero to 100 .
for instance , american citizens gave the germans 61 points , the germans , in return , gave the americans 63 points .
iraq was at the bottom of both american -lrb- 23 -rrb- and european -lrb- 25 -rrb- thermometers .
the greatest disparity between the two is over israel , with americans rating it as high as 55 points , and the europeans a mere 38 points . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links worldviews 2002 the complete study 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

" we ’ re all americans " screamed the editorial in the italian daily , corriere della sera on september 12 , 2001 , a day after the terrorist attacks in america shook the world .
that statement soon became a catch phrase to express solidarity with the united states and was picked up the media , intellectuals and authors in europe in the following weeks and months .
the flood of pictures and footage of the wreckage of the world trade center and grieving americans were accompanied by an unprecedented outpouring of european empathy and the readiness to help america in every way possible to nab the perpetrators .
a different world a year later one year on , things appear quite different .
the spontaneous rush of solidarity has waned , european editorials are increasingly critical of american policy , the war on terror is warily spoken about and european and american politicians seem to be speaking different languages .
at a political level , the transatlantic relationship is said to be at an all-time low .
study provides silver lining in gloomy scenario but while politicians and diplomats in both continents may be locking horns over thorny issues , ordinary europeans and americans are in broad agreement when it comes to the war on terrorism , iraq and a host of international issues .
those are the results of a comprehensive survey of european and american public opinion conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and the chicago council on foreign relations .
the aim was to find out how ordinary americans and europeans looked at the world and at each other after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
called " worldviews 2002 " , the study involved 3,000 telephone interviews in the united states and in the six european countries of britain , france , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany .
more than 9,000 europeans and americans were surveyed .
consensus on us foreign policy while 55 percent of europeans believe that us foreign policy is partly to blame for the sept .
11 attacks , a slightly higher majority -lrb- 59 percent -rrb- of europeans believe the us reaction since the attacks was to protect the united states from further attacks , rather than to impose their will around the globe .
interestingly , the study discovered that americans were almost as critical of certain aspects of us foreign policy as their european counterparts .
europeans gave the bush administration low marks for its handling of the arab-israeli conflict -lrb- a mere 20 percent rate it as " excellent " or " good " -rrb- .
just 21 percent said the same of the us handling of the situation in iraq .
at the same time , americans gave its government only slightly higher marks for the same issues .
seeing eye to eye over iraq despite media reports of transatlantic differences over the issue of a military strike against iraq , the study found that the populaces on both sides of the atlantic have very similar concerns regarding iraq .
both consider iraq to be a top international threat and view it unfavourably .
strikingly , 60 percent of the europeans polled and 65 percent of the americans say the us should only invade iraq with un approval and the support of its allies .
a un mandate was also decisive when it came to europeans ’ support for their country ’ s participation .
surprisingly , the study shows that europeans , who are often criticised for shirking away from substantial military spending , are willing in principle to use troops or force in a broad range of circumstances , though they give higher priority to international and humanitarian goals than americans .
we like each other but not iraq perhaps most importantly , the study shows that americans and europeans have a strong affinity for each other and a similar perception of what " friendship " means .
americans and europeans showed similar likes and dislikes when it came to rating their feelings for other countries on a scale of zero to 100 .
for instance , american citizens gave the germans 61 points , the germans , in return , gave the americans 63 points .
iraq was at the bottom of both american -lrb- 23 -rrb- and european -lrb- 25 -rrb- thermometers .
the greatest disparity between the two is over israel , with americans rating it as high as 55 points , and the europeans a mere 38 points . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links worldviews 2002 the complete study 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

investment was hesitant as traders tended to adopt a " let ’ s wait and see " attitude rather than get caught up in impulse buying and selling .
according to investment analysts , few traders were willing to make risky investments , for fear of being caught off guard in the event of a new terrorist act .
many remembered all too well how the market shook and plunged only a year ago after terrorists crashed planes into the world trade center and pentagon .
" very few professional investors have wanted to hold short positions on the basis that if something were to happen today it would be extremely difficult to cover those short positions , " a trader for natwest stockbrokers told afp wire services wednesday morning in london .
reflecting this sense of uncertainty , markets in europe began the day with reserved trading .
across the 12-nation euro zone , the euro stoxx 50 index was down 0.1 percent .
the britsh ftse 100 index dropped 0.6 percent , and the german dax reported a 0.21 percent slip in trading .
only the french cac was able to inch up to a meager 0.2 percent .
the german financial daily handelsblatt described the atmosphere on the international markets as tense and a little nervous .
peter coolidge from brean murray & co. in new york told the paper that " people don ’ t want to commit themselves to anything before september 11 is over . "
another trader at the deutsche bank summarized the mood saying , " no one can prophesize what will really happen , but if something does happen , the markets will crash – that ’ s clear . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader reacts in front of the indicator panel of the german stock index in frankfurt tuesday sept .
11 , 2001 .
remembering last year september 11 , 2001 was a tuesday .
in the us , trading stopped for the next four days . in frankfurt , however , the traders continued conducting their business .
" we wanted to avoid a complete crash of the financial markets , " said frank hartmann , spokesman for the deutsche börse ag -lrb- german stock exchange -rrb- .
except for a two-hour stop on trade with us stocks , business moved on as usual .
but it was anything but a normal business day .
the german dax tumbled 7 to 8 percent by closing time , and wasn ’ t able to recover until nearly two months later .
in london , paris and rome , in hong kong and tokyo , stocks plummeted , and the day ended with some of the biggest single day losses in recent history .

“ where were you ?
how did you hear about it ? ” were questions of the hour .
everyone had a story worth telling .
each was deeply personal and at the same time universal .
for around the world , from berlin to bangkok , sept .
11 , 2001 , was a day that made memories , a day that will not be forgotten . this urge to remember , to revisit the not-so-distant past , also ranges from the personal to the collective and throughout germany – like in many countries around the world – there are a plethora of memorial events planned for wednesday . last year , hundreds of thousands of germans gathered at the brandenburg gate after the attacks to show their support for americans and to mourn the victims .
it was the largest memorial gathering in europe at the time . where the elite say their prayers the memorial where most of germany ’ s elite will go to see and be seen is a noontime ecumenical service at the berlin dome .

likewise , memorial services are planned in many churches throughout germany . in mainz , the ecumenical and peace service is planned together with leaders of the jewish and islamic communities . religious differences provoke conflict while thousands have turned to religion for comfort in the days and months following the attack on the u.s. , religion has also become a touchstone of controversy in the past year . and the age-old conflict between religions was undoubtedly heightened in the aftermath . on tuesday , a leader of the lutheran church in germany called for an international cooperation to avoid further religious confrontations worldwide .
bishop christian krause called for an “ open dialogue between religions . ” meanwhile , the chairman of germany ’ s intercultural council said on tuesday that in the past year , many of the 3 million muslims living in germany have experienced growing isolation , suspicion and even hatred from their non-muslim neighbors . non-muslim germans increasingly have the attitude that muslims “ don ’ t belong to us , ” jürgen micksch told the associated press .
“ that ’ s a big obstacle for integration and for a peaceful co-existence . ” multicultural attempt to address tensions in an attempt to address this issue , the organization has formed a so-called abraham team comprised of christians , jews and muslims that will visit schools and public events to discuss commonalities and differences among the religions . churches are not the only places where memorials are planned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.09.2002 markets jittery on anniversary of september 11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a day to remember global financial markets traded hesitantly on the first anniversary of the terrorist attacks as traders remembered those who died and worried about the threat of repeat attacks . stock markets in europe opened slowly on wednesday and remained cautious throughout the early hours of trading .
investment was hesitant as traders tended to adopt a " let ’ s wait and see " attitude rather than get caught up in impulse buying and selling .
according to investment analysts , few traders were willing to make risky investments , for fear of being caught off guard in the event of a new terrorist act .
many remembered all too well how the market shook and plunged only a year ago after terrorists crashed planes into the world trade center and pentagon .
" very few professional investors have wanted to hold short positions on the basis that if something were to happen today it would be extremely difficult to cover those short positions , " a trader for natwest stockbrokers told afp wire services wednesday morning in london .
reflecting this sense of uncertainty , markets in europe began the day with reserved trading .
across the 12-nation euro zone , the euro stoxx 50 index was down 0.1 percent .
the britsh ftse 100 index dropped 0.6 percent , and the german dax reported a 0.21 percent slip in trading .
only the french cac was able to inch up to a meager 0.2 percent .
the german financial daily handelsblatt described the atmosphere on the international markets as tense and a little nervous .
peter coolidge from brean murray & co. in new york told the paper that " people don ’ t want to commit themselves to anything before september 11 is over . "
another trader at the deutsche bank summarized the mood saying , " no one can prophesize what will really happen , but if something does happen , the markets will crash – that ’ s clear . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader reacts in front of the indicator panel of the german stock index in frankfurt tuesday sept .
11 , 2001 .
remembering last year september 11 , 2001 was a tuesday .
in the us , trading stopped for the next four days . in frankfurt , however , the traders continued conducting their business .
" we wanted to avoid a complete crash of the financial markets , " said frank hartmann , spokesman for the deutsche börse ag -lrb- german stock exchange -rrb- .
except for a two-hour stop on trade with us stocks , business moved on as usual .
but it was anything but a normal business day .
the german dax tumbled 7 to 8 percent by closing time , and wasn ’ t able to recover until nearly two months later .
in london , paris and rome , in hong kong and tokyo , stocks plummeted , and the day ended with some of the biggest single day losses in recent history .
only months later could the global economy recover most of its lost ground .
some industries , however , were so badly hurt , that they are still struggling : aviation , tourism , insurance and re-insurers .
even a year later , germany ’ s travel giant tui is recording 3.8 percent losses .
and several international airlines can only stay in flight with the help of hefty government assistance programs .
lay-offs following the terrorist attacks were especially common in the aviation sector .
american airlines , which lost two jets in the attacks , cut 20,000 positions , a reduction of roughly 20 percent of its entire workforce , while commercial aircraft manufacturer boeing slashed 30,000 jobs shortly after the attacks .
financial losses in the insurance sector were also significant following september 11 .
lloyd ’ s of london , the world ’ s largest insurer , faced claims totaling close to 307 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- .
and the german-based munich re , the world ’ s largest re-insurer , estimated costs at around 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 970 million -rrb- .
beyond september 11 for the rest of the market , however , the negative aftermath of september 11 have been eclipsed by more deep-rooted problems .
economic analysts say many of these , such as a sluggish global economy , rising unemployment and a steady decline in the technology sector , all predate the terrorist attacks , and will continue to cause problems for the markets beyond the one-year anniversary .
" certainly september 11 unsettled investors , " said stefan schneider , chief international economist at deutsche bank research , " but the current low market figures , are not all related to the terrorist attacks . "
by the end of 2001 , the markets had almost fully recovered , he told ndr german television , explaining that other factors were to blame .
the recent downward trend owes much more to accounting scandals in the us , a general pessimism about global economic growth and the situation in the middle east , including a looming war in iraq , said rolf drees , german financial analyst .
as proof of the ongoing troubles , eleven months after the terrorist attacks the dax dropped to 3.235 points , its lowest level since april 1997 .
economic growth is most critical factor in the coming months , the most critical factor driving the markets is confidence in economic development and growth .
according to the german investment trust , long-term market trends for the coming year are dependent on positive growth .
if company returns continue to be low , it explains , the stock markets will not recover .
but this does not appear to be the case .
speaking on tuesday in tokyo , the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , announced that while global economic prospects had weakened in the last year , recovery lies ahead in the upcoming months .
recession is not a real risk , he said .
" although growth prospects have weakened somewhat in the united states and europe , most recently our assessment is that the recovery will continue , " köhler explained , easing investment worries .
in germany , the institute for economic research in halle predicted a growth rate of 0.6 percent next year for the sluggish german economy .
the prognosis is a " peace-time scenario " it warned , and in the event of a war against iraq , the economic recovery will suffer and growth will be considerably less .
but this will be the case around the world .
risks and uncertainty could hinder the global recovery process , köhler cautioned . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de impact of us attacks on markets and industry the attacks on the u.s. had a profound impact on both national and international economies -lrb- sept .

" we ’ re all americans " screamed the editorial in the italian daily , corriere della sera on september 12 , 2001 , a day after the terrorist attacks in america shook the world .
that statement soon became a catch phrase to express solidarity with the united states and was picked up the media , intellectuals and authors in europe in the following weeks and months .
the flood of pictures and footage of the wreckage of the world trade center and grieving americans were accompanied by an unprecedented outpouring of european empathy and the readiness to help america in every way possible to nab the perpetrators .
a different world a year later one year on , things appear quite different .
the spontaneous rush of solidarity has waned , european editorials are increasingly critical of american policy , the war on terror is warily spoken about and european and american politicians seem to be speaking different languages .
at a political level , the transatlantic relationship is said to be at an all-time low .
study provides silver lining in gloomy scenario but while politicians and diplomats in both continents may be locking horns over thorny issues , ordinary europeans and americans are in broad agreement when it comes to the war on terrorism , iraq and a host of international issues .
those are the results of a comprehensive survey of european and american public opinion conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and the chicago council on foreign relations .
the aim was to find out how ordinary americans and europeans looked at the world and at each other after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
called " worldviews 2002 " , the study involved 3,000 telephone interviews in the united states and in the six european countries of britain , france , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany .
more than 9,000 europeans and americans were surveyed .
consensus on us foreign policy while 55 percent of europeans believe that us foreign policy is partly to blame for the sept .
11 attacks , a slightly higher majority -lrb- 59 percent -rrb- of europeans believe the us reaction since the attacks was to protect the united states from further attacks , rather than to impose their will around the globe .
interestingly , the study discovered that americans were almost as critical of certain aspects of us foreign policy as their european counterparts .
europeans gave the bush administration low marks for its handling of the arab-israeli conflict -lrb- a mere 20 percent rate it as " excellent " or " good " -rrb- .
just 21 percent said the same of the us handling of the situation in iraq .
at the same time , americans gave its government only slightly higher marks for the same issues .
seeing eye to eye over iraq despite media reports of transatlantic differences over the issue of a military strike against iraq , the study found that the populaces on both sides of the atlantic have very similar concerns regarding iraq .
both consider iraq to be a top international threat and view it unfavourably .
strikingly , 60 percent of the europeans polled and 65 percent of the americans say the us should only invade iraq with un approval and the support of its allies .
a un mandate was also decisive when it came to europeans ’ support for their country ’ s participation .
surprisingly , the study shows that europeans , who are often criticised for shirking away from substantial military spending , are willing in principle to use troops or force in a broad range of circumstances , though they give higher priority to international and humanitarian goals than americans .
we like each other but not iraq perhaps most importantly , the study shows that americans and europeans have a strong affinity for each other and a similar perception of what " friendship " means .
americans and europeans showed similar likes and dislikes when it came to rating their feelings for other countries on a scale of zero to 100 .
for instance , american citizens gave the germans 61 points , the germans , in return , gave the americans 63 points .
iraq was at the bottom of both american -lrb- 23 -rrb- and european -lrb- 25 -rrb- thermometers .
the greatest disparity between the two is over israel , with americans rating it as high as 55 points , and the europeans a mere 38 points . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links worldviews 2002 the complete study 9801 dw-tv europe live in focus we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

investment was hesitant as traders tended to adopt a " let ’ s wait and see " attitude rather than get caught up in impulse buying and selling .
according to investment analysts , few traders were willing to make risky investments , for fear of being caught off guard in the event of a new terrorist act .
many remembered all too well how the market shook and plunged only a year ago after terrorists crashed planes into the world trade center and pentagon .
" very few professional investors have wanted to hold short positions on the basis that if something were to happen today it would be extremely difficult to cover those short positions , " a trader for natwest stockbrokers told afp wire services wednesday morning in london .
reflecting this sense of uncertainty , markets in europe began the day with reserved trading .
across the 12-nation euro zone , the euro stoxx 50 index was down 0.1 percent .
the britsh ftse 100 index dropped 0.6 percent , and the german dax reported a 0.21 percent slip in trading .
only the french cac was able to inch up to a meager 0.2 percent .
the german financial daily handelsblatt described the atmosphere on the international markets as tense and a little nervous .
peter coolidge from brean murray & co. in new york told the paper that " people don ’ t want to commit themselves to anything before september 11 is over . "
another trader at the deutsche bank summarized the mood saying , " no one can prophesize what will really happen , but if something does happen , the markets will crash – that ’ s clear . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader reacts in front of the indicator panel of the german stock index in frankfurt tuesday sept .
11 , 2001 .
remembering last year september 11 , 2001 was a tuesday .
in the us , trading stopped for the next four days . in frankfurt , however , the traders continued conducting their business .
" we wanted to avoid a complete crash of the financial markets , " said frank hartmann , spokesman for the deutsche börse ag -lrb- german stock exchange -rrb- .
except for a two-hour stop on trade with us stocks , business moved on as usual .
but it was anything but a normal business day .
the german dax tumbled 7 to 8 percent by closing time , and wasn ’ t able to recover until nearly two months later .
in london , paris and rome , in hong kong and tokyo , stocks plummeted , and the day ended with some of the biggest single day losses in recent history .
only months later could the global economy recover most of its lost ground .
some industries , however , were so badly hurt , that they are still struggling : aviation , tourism , insurance and re-insurers .
even a year later , germany ’ s travel giant tui is recording 3.8 percent losses .
and several international airlines can only stay in flight with the help of hefty government assistance programs .
lay-offs following the terrorist attacks were especially common in the aviation sector .
american airlines , which lost two jets in the attacks , cut 20,000 positions , a reduction of roughly 20 percent of its entire workforce , while commercial aircraft manufacturer boeing slashed 30,000 jobs shortly after the attacks .
financial losses in the insurance sector were also significant following september 11 .
lloyd ’ s of london , the world ’ s largest insurer , faced claims totaling close to 307 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- .
and the german-based munich re , the world ’ s largest re-insurer , estimated costs at around 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 970 million -rrb- .
beyond september 11 for the rest of the market , however , the negative aftermath of september 11 have been eclipsed by more deep-rooted problems .
economic analysts say many of these , such as a sluggish global economy , rising unemployment and a steady decline in the technology sector , all predate the terrorist attacks , and will continue to cause problems for the markets beyond the one-year anniversary .
" certainly september 11 unsettled investors , " said stefan schneider , chief international economist at deutsche bank research , " but the current low market figures , are not all related to the terrorist attacks . "
by the end of 2001 , the markets had almost fully recovered , he told ndr german television , explaining that other factors were to blame .
the recent downward trend owes much more to accounting scandals in the us , a general pessimism about global economic growth and the situation in the middle east , including a looming war in iraq , said rolf drees , german financial analyst .
as proof of the ongoing troubles , eleven months after the terrorist attacks the dax dropped to 3.235 points , its lowest level since april 1997 .
economic growth is most critical factor in the coming months , the most critical factor driving the markets is confidence in economic development and growth .
according to the german investment trust , long-term market trends for the coming year are dependent on positive growth .
if company returns continue to be low , it explains , the stock markets will not recover .
but this does not appear to be the case .
speaking on tuesday in tokyo , the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , announced that while global economic prospects had weakened in the last year , recovery lies ahead in the upcoming months .
recession is not a real risk , he said .
" although growth prospects have weakened somewhat in the united states and europe , most recently our assessment is that the recovery will continue , " köhler explained , easing investment worries .
in germany , the institute for economic research in halle predicted a growth rate of 0.6 percent next year for the sluggish german economy .
the prognosis is a " peace-time scenario " it warned , and in the event of a war against iraq , the economic recovery will suffer and growth will be considerably less .
but this will be the case around the world .
risks and uncertainty could hinder the global recovery process , köhler cautioned . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de impact of us attacks on markets and industry the attacks on the u.s. had a profound impact on both national and international economies -lrb- sept .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin current affairs -pipe- 11.09.2002 joining hands on a day to remember großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction workers at the world trade center site on wednesday .
memorials ranging from prayer services to concerts are planned in germany to pay tribute to the victims of the september 11 attacks on the u.s. and to reflect on the causes and consequences thereof . in lunchrooms and cafes , at corner bars and in workplaces across germany , friends and strangers alike shared stories in the past days about their own personal experiences on september 11 last year .
“ where were you ?
how did you hear about it ? ” were questions of the hour .
everyone had a story worth telling .
each was deeply personal and at the same time universal .
for around the world , from berlin to bangkok , sept .
11 , 2001 , was a day that made memories , a day that will not be forgotten . this urge to remember , to revisit the not-so-distant past , also ranges from the personal to the collective and throughout germany – like in many countries around the world – there are a plethora of memorial events planned for wednesday . last year , hundreds of thousands of germans gathered at the brandenburg gate after the attacks to show their support for americans and to mourn the victims .
it was the largest memorial gathering in europe at the time . where the elite say their prayers the memorial where most of germany ’ s elite will go to see and be seen is a noontime ecumenical service at the berlin dome .
president johannes rau , chancellor gerhard schröder and bundestag president wolfgang thierse are expected to attend – as are schröder ’ s opposition in the race for the chancellor ’ s office , edmund stoiber , and american ambassador daniel coats , who has been a sparring partner of schröder ’ s since the chancellor announced his opposition to german involvement in a potential u.s. attack on iraq . services will be conducted by both catholic and evangelical clergy .
likewise , memorial services are planned in many churches throughout germany . in mainz , the ecumenical and peace service is planned together with leaders of the jewish and islamic communities . religious differences provoke conflict while thousands have turned to religion for comfort in the days and months following the attack on the u.s. , religion has also become a touchstone of controversy in the past year . and the age-old conflict between religions was undoubtedly heightened in the aftermath . on tuesday , a leader of the lutheran church in germany called for an international cooperation to avoid further religious confrontations worldwide .

" we ’ re all americans " screamed the editorial in the italian daily , corriere della sera on september 12 , 2001 , a day after the terrorist attacks in america shook the world .
that statement soon became a catch phrase to express solidarity with the united states and was picked up the media , intellectuals and authors in europe in the following weeks and months .
the flood of pictures and footage of the wreckage of the world trade center and grieving americans were accompanied by an unprecedented outpouring of european empathy and the readiness to help america in every way possible to nab the perpetrators .
a different world a year later one year on , things appear quite different .
the spontaneous rush of solidarity has waned , european editorials are increasingly critical of american policy , the war on terror is warily spoken about and european and american politicians seem to be speaking different languages .
at a political level , the transatlantic relationship is said to be at an all-time low .
study provides silver lining in gloomy scenario but while politicians and diplomats in both continents may be locking horns over thorny issues , ordinary europeans and americans are in broad agreement when it comes to the war on terrorism , iraq and a host of international issues .
those are the results of a comprehensive survey of european and american public opinion conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and the chicago council on foreign relations .
the aim was to find out how ordinary americans and europeans looked at the world and at each other after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
called " worldviews 2002 " , the study involved 3,000 telephone interviews in the united states and in the six european countries of britain , france , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany .
more than 9,000 europeans and americans were surveyed .
consensus on us foreign policy while 55 percent of europeans believe that us foreign policy is partly to blame for the sept .
11 attacks , a slightly higher majority -lrb- 59 percent -rrb- of europeans believe the us reaction since the attacks was to protect the united states from further attacks , rather than to impose their will around the globe .
interestingly , the study discovered that americans were almost as critical of certain aspects of us foreign policy as their european counterparts .
europeans gave the bush administration low marks for its handling of the arab-israeli conflict -lrb- a mere 20 percent rate it as " excellent " or " good " -rrb- .
just 21 percent said the same of the us handling of the situation in iraq .
at the same time , americans gave its government only slightly higher marks for the same issues .
seeing eye to eye over iraq despite media reports of transatlantic differences over the issue of a military strike against iraq , the study found that the populaces on both sides of the atlantic have very similar concerns regarding iraq .
both consider iraq to be a top international threat and view it unfavourably .
strikingly , 60 percent of the europeans polled and 65 percent of the americans say the us should only invade iraq with un approval and the support of its allies .
a un mandate was also decisive when it came to europeans ’ support for their country ’ s participation .
surprisingly , the study shows that europeans , who are often criticised for shirking away from substantial military spending , are willing in principle to use troops or force in a broad range of circumstances , though they give higher priority to international and humanitarian goals than americans .
we like each other but not iraq perhaps most importantly , the study shows that americans and europeans have a strong affinity for each other and a similar perception of what " friendship " means .
americans and europeans showed similar likes and dislikes when it came to rating their feelings for other countries on a scale of zero to 100 .
for instance , american citizens gave the germans 61 points , the germans , in return , gave the americans 63 points .
iraq was at the bottom of both american -lrb- 23 -rrb- and european -lrb- 25 -rrb- thermometers .

investment was hesitant as traders tended to adopt a " let ’ s wait and see " attitude rather than get caught up in impulse buying and selling .
according to investment analysts , few traders were willing to make risky investments , for fear of being caught off guard in the event of a new terrorist act .
many remembered all too well how the market shook and plunged only a year ago after terrorists crashed planes into the world trade center and pentagon .
" very few professional investors have wanted to hold short positions on the basis that if something were to happen today it would be extremely difficult to cover those short positions , " a trader for natwest stockbrokers told afp wire services wednesday morning in london .

the recent downward trend owes much more to accounting scandals in the us , a general pessimism about global economic growth and the situation in the middle east , including a looming war in iraq , said rolf drees , german financial analyst .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin current affairs -pipe- 11.09.2002 joining hands on a day to remember großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction workers at the world trade center site on wednesday .
memorials ranging from prayer services to concerts are planned in germany to pay tribute to the victims of the september 11 attacks on the u.s. and to reflect on the causes and consequences thereof . in lunchrooms and cafes , at corner bars and in workplaces across germany , friends and strangers alike shared stories in the past days about their own personal experiences on september 11 last year .
“ where were you ?
how did you hear about it ? ” were questions of the hour .
everyone had a story worth telling .
each was deeply personal and at the same time universal .
for around the world , from berlin to bangkok , sept .
11 , 2001 , was a day that made memories , a day that will not be forgotten . this urge to remember , to revisit the not-so-distant past , also ranges from the personal to the collective and throughout germany – like in many countries around the world – there are a plethora of memorial events planned for wednesday . last year , hundreds of thousands of germans gathered at the brandenburg gate after the attacks to show their support for americans and to mourn the victims .
it was the largest memorial gathering in europe at the time . where the elite say their prayers the memorial where most of germany ’ s elite will go to see and be seen is a noontime ecumenical service at the berlin dome .
president johannes rau , chancellor gerhard schröder and bundestag president wolfgang thierse are expected to attend – as are schröder ’ s opposition in the race for the chancellor ’ s office , edmund stoiber , and american ambassador daniel coats , who has been a sparring partner of schröder ’ s since the chancellor announced his opposition to german involvement in a potential u.s. attack on iraq . services will be conducted by both catholic and evangelical clergy .
likewise , memorial services are planned in many churches throughout germany . in mainz , the ecumenical and peace service is planned together with leaders of the jewish and islamic communities . religious differences provoke conflict while thousands have turned to religion for comfort in the days and months following the attack on the u.s. , religion has also become a touchstone of controversy in the past year . and the age-old conflict between religions was undoubtedly heightened in the aftermath . on tuesday , a leader of the lutheran church in germany called for an international cooperation to avoid further religious confrontations worldwide .
bishop christian krause called for an “ open dialogue between religions . ” meanwhile , the chairman of germany ’ s intercultural council said on tuesday that in the past year , many of the 3 million muslims living in germany have experienced growing isolation , suspicion and even hatred from their non-muslim neighbors . non-muslim germans increasingly have the attitude that muslims “ don ’ t belong to us , ” jürgen micksch told the associated press .
“ that ’ s a big obstacle for integration and for a peaceful co-existence . ” multicultural attempt to address tensions in an attempt to address this issue , the organization has formed a so-called abraham team comprised of christians , jews and muslims that will visit schools and public events to discuss commonalities and differences among the religions . churches are not the only places where memorials are planned .
from the soccer field to the stage , tributes ranging from rock concerts to moments of silence are scheduled for wednesday . the german symphony orchestra of berlin , conducted by kent nagano , will present a memorial concert featuring beethoven ’ s symphony no. 4 -lrb- “ the prayer ” -rrb- among other works .
“ in the language of music , we ’ ll make a tribute to the victims and unite in striving towards common ground and in the longing for peace , ” said an orchestra press release . the house of world cultures is presenting new work from the new york jazz musician erik friedlander , who will appear together with his “ trio rope ” group .
in addition , the new york string quartet “ ethel ” .
and religious rocker sarah brendel will give a concert in the course of a religious service at berlin ’ s gedächtniskirche -lrb- memorial church -rrb- , a church that was left in ruins from a world war ii bombing . beyond the stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man places some flowers in front of the u.s consulate in hamburg , northern germany , during a minute of silence for the victims of the terror attacks of sept .

" we ’ re all americans " screamed the editorial in the italian daily , corriere della sera on september 12 , 2001 , a day after the terrorist attacks in america shook the world .
that statement soon became a catch phrase to express solidarity with the united states and was picked up the media , intellectuals and authors in europe in the following weeks and months .
the flood of pictures and footage of the wreckage of the world trade center and grieving americans were accompanied by an unprecedented outpouring of european empathy and the readiness to help america in every way possible to nab the perpetrators .
a different world a year later one year on , things appear quite different .
the spontaneous rush of solidarity has waned , european editorials are increasingly critical of american policy , the war on terror is warily spoken about and european and american politicians seem to be speaking different languages .
at a political level , the transatlantic relationship is said to be at an all-time low .
study provides silver lining in gloomy scenario but while politicians and diplomats in both continents may be locking horns over thorny issues , ordinary europeans and americans are in broad agreement when it comes to the war on terrorism , iraq and a host of international issues .
those are the results of a comprehensive survey of european and american public opinion conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and the chicago council on foreign relations .
the aim was to find out how ordinary americans and europeans looked at the world and at each other after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
called " worldviews 2002 " , the study involved 3,000 telephone interviews in the united states and in the six european countries of britain , france , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany .
more than 9,000 europeans and americans were surveyed .
consensus on us foreign policy while 55 percent of europeans believe that us foreign policy is partly to blame for the sept .
11 attacks , a slightly higher majority -lrb- 59 percent -rrb- of europeans believe the us reaction since the attacks was to protect the united states from further attacks , rather than to impose their will around the globe .
interestingly , the study discovered that americans were almost as critical of certain aspects of us foreign policy as their european counterparts .
europeans gave the bush administration low marks for its handling of the arab-israeli conflict -lrb- a mere 20 percent rate it as " excellent " or " good " -rrb- .
just 21 percent said the same of the us handling of the situation in iraq .
at the same time , americans gave its government only slightly higher marks for the same issues .
seeing eye to eye over iraq despite media reports of transatlantic differences over the issue of a military strike against iraq , the study found that the populaces on both sides of the atlantic have very similar concerns regarding iraq .
both consider iraq to be a top international threat and view it unfavourably .
strikingly , 60 percent of the europeans polled and 65 percent of the americans say the us should only invade iraq with un approval and the support of its allies .
a un mandate was also decisive when it came to europeans ’ support for their country ’ s participation .
surprisingly , the study shows that europeans , who are often criticised for shirking away from substantial military spending , are willing in principle to use troops or force in a broad range of circumstances , though they give higher priority to international and humanitarian goals than americans .
we like each other but not iraq perhaps most importantly , the study shows that americans and europeans have a strong affinity for each other and a similar perception of what " friendship " means .
americans and europeans showed similar likes and dislikes when it came to rating their feelings for other countries on a scale of zero to 100 .
for instance , american citizens gave the germans 61 points , the germans , in return , gave the americans 63 points .
iraq was at the bottom of both american -lrb- 23 -rrb- and european -lrb- 25 -rrb- thermometers .
the greatest disparity between the two is over israel , with americans rating it as high as 55 points , and the europeans a mere 38 points . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links worldviews 2002 the complete study 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

just 21 percent said the same of the us handling of the situation in iraq .
at the same time , americans gave its government only slightly higher marks for the same issues .
seeing eye to eye over iraq despite media reports of transatlantic differences over the issue of a military strike against iraq , the study found that the populaces on both sides of the atlantic have very similar concerns regarding iraq .
both consider iraq to be a top international threat and view it unfavourably .
strikingly , 60 percent of the europeans polled and 65 percent of the americans say the us should only invade iraq with un approval and the support of its allies .
a un mandate was also decisive when it came to europeans ’ support for their country ’ s participation .
surprisingly , the study shows that europeans , who are often criticised for shirking away from substantial military spending , are willing in principle to use troops or force in a broad range of circumstances , though they give higher priority to international and humanitarian goals than americans .
we like each other but not iraq perhaps most importantly , the study shows that americans and europeans have a strong affinity for each other and a similar perception of what " friendship " means .
americans and europeans showed similar likes and dislikes when it came to rating their feelings for other countries on a scale of zero to 100 .
for instance , american citizens gave the germans 61 points , the germans , in return , gave the americans 63 points .
iraq was at the bottom of both american -lrb- 23 -rrb- and european -lrb- 25 -rrb- thermometers .
the greatest disparity between the two is over israel , with americans rating it as high as 55 points , and the europeans a mere 38 points . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links worldviews 2002 the complete study 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

" we ’ re all americans " screamed the editorial in the italian daily , corriere della sera on september 12 , 2001 , a day after the terrorist attacks in america shook the world .
that statement soon became a catch phrase to express solidarity with the united states and was picked up the media , intellectuals and authors in europe in the following weeks and months .
the flood of pictures and footage of the wreckage of the world trade center and grieving americans were accompanied by an unprecedented outpouring of european empathy and the readiness to help america in every way possible to nab the perpetrators .
a different world a year later one year on , things appear quite different .
the spontaneous rush of solidarity has waned , european editorials are increasingly critical of american policy , the war on terror is warily spoken about and european and american politicians seem to be speaking different languages .
at a political level , the transatlantic relationship is said to be at an all-time low .
study provides silver lining in gloomy scenario but while politicians and diplomats in both continents may be locking horns over thorny issues , ordinary europeans and americans are in broad agreement when it comes to the war on terrorism , iraq and a host of international issues .
those are the results of a comprehensive survey of european and american public opinion conducted by the german marshall fund of the united states and the chicago council on foreign relations .
the aim was to find out how ordinary americans and europeans looked at the world and at each other after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
called " worldviews 2002 " , the study involved 3,000 telephone interviews in the united states and in the six european countries of britain , france , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany .
more than 9,000 europeans and americans were surveyed .
consensus on us foreign policy while 55 percent of europeans believe that us foreign policy is partly to blame for the sept .
11 attacks , a slightly higher majority -lrb- 59 percent -rrb- of europeans believe the us reaction since the attacks was to protect the united states from further attacks , rather than to impose their will around the globe .
interestingly , the study discovered that americans were almost as critical of certain aspects of us foreign policy as their european counterparts .
europeans gave the bush administration low marks for its handling of the arab-israeli conflict -lrb- a mere 20 percent rate it as " excellent " or " good " -rrb- .
just 21 percent said the same of the us handling of the situation in iraq .
at the same time , americans gave its government only slightly higher marks for the same issues .

11 , 2001 .
remembering last year september 11 , 2001 was a tuesday .
in the us , trading stopped for the next four days . in frankfurt , however , the traders continued conducting their business .
" we wanted to avoid a complete crash of the financial markets , " said frank hartmann , spokesman for the deutsche börse ag -lrb- german stock exchange -rrb- .
except for a two-hour stop on trade with us stocks , business moved on as usual .
but it was anything but a normal business day .
the german dax tumbled 7 to 8 percent by closing time , and wasn ’ t able to recover until nearly two months later .
in london , paris and rome , in hong kong and tokyo , stocks plummeted , and the day ended with some of the biggest single day losses in recent history .
only months later could the global economy recover most of its lost ground .
some industries , however , were so badly hurt , that they are still struggling : aviation , tourism , insurance and re-insurers .
even a year later , germany ’ s travel giant tui is recording 3.8 percent losses .
and several international airlines can only stay in flight with the help of hefty government assistance programs .
lay-offs following the terrorist attacks were especially common in the aviation sector .
american airlines , which lost two jets in the attacks , cut 20,000 positions , a reduction of roughly 20 percent of its entire workforce , while commercial aircraft manufacturer boeing slashed 30,000 jobs shortly after the attacks .
financial losses in the insurance sector were also significant following september 11 .
lloyd ’ s of london , the world ’ s largest insurer , faced claims totaling close to 307 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- .
and the german-based munich re , the world ’ s largest re-insurer , estimated costs at around 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 970 million -rrb- .
beyond september 11 for the rest of the market , however , the negative aftermath of september 11 have been eclipsed by more deep-rooted problems .
economic analysts say many of these , such as a sluggish global economy , rising unemployment and a steady decline in the technology sector , all predate the terrorist attacks , and will continue to cause problems for the markets beyond the one-year anniversary .
" certainly september 11 unsettled investors , " said stefan schneider , chief international economist at deutsche bank research , " but the current low market figures , are not all related to the terrorist attacks . "
by the end of 2001 , the markets had almost fully recovered , he told ndr german television , explaining that other factors were to blame .
the recent downward trend owes much more to accounting scandals in the us , a general pessimism about global economic growth and the situation in the middle east , including a looming war in iraq , said rolf drees , german financial analyst .
as proof of the ongoing troubles , eleven months after the terrorist attacks the dax dropped to 3.235 points , its lowest level since april 1997 .
economic growth is most critical factor in the coming months , the most critical factor driving the markets is confidence in economic development and growth .
according to the german investment trust , long-term market trends for the coming year are dependent on positive growth .
if company returns continue to be low , it explains , the stock markets will not recover .
but this does not appear to be the case .
speaking on tuesday in tokyo , the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , announced that while global economic prospects had weakened in the last year , recovery lies ahead in the upcoming months .
recession is not a real risk , he said .
" although growth prospects have weakened somewhat in the united states and europe , most recently our assessment is that the recovery will continue , " köhler explained , easing investment worries .
in germany , the institute for economic research in halle predicted a growth rate of 0.6 percent next year for the sluggish german economy .
the prognosis is a " peace-time scenario " it warned , and in the event of a war against iraq , the economic recovery will suffer and growth will be considerably less .

remembering last year september 11 , 2001 was a tuesday .
in the us , trading stopped for the next four days . in frankfurt , however , the traders continued conducting their business .
" we wanted to avoid a complete crash of the financial markets , " said frank hartmann , spokesman for the deutsche börse ag -lrb- german stock exchange -rrb- .
except for a two-hour stop on trade with us stocks , business moved on as usual .
but it was anything but a normal business day .
the german dax tumbled 7 to 8 percent by closing time , and wasn ’ t able to recover until nearly two months later .
in london , paris and rome , in hong kong and tokyo , stocks plummeted , and the day ended with some of the biggest single day losses in recent history .
only months later could the global economy recover most of its lost ground .
some industries , however , were so badly hurt , that they are still struggling : aviation , tourism , insurance and re-insurers .
even a year later , germany ’ s travel giant tui is recording 3.8 percent losses .
and several international airlines can only stay in flight with the help of hefty government assistance programs .
lay-offs following the terrorist attacks were especially common in the aviation sector .
american airlines , which lost two jets in the attacks , cut 20,000 positions , a reduction of roughly 20 percent of its entire workforce , while commercial aircraft manufacturer boeing slashed 30,000 jobs shortly after the attacks .
financial losses in the insurance sector were also significant following september 11 .
lloyd ’ s of london , the world ’ s largest insurer , faced claims totaling close to 307 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- .
and the german-based munich re , the world ’ s largest re-insurer , estimated costs at around 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 970 million -rrb- .
beyond september 11 for the rest of the market , however , the negative aftermath of september 11 have been eclipsed by more deep-rooted problems .
economic analysts say many of these , such as a sluggish global economy , rising unemployment and a steady decline in the technology sector , all predate the terrorist attacks , and will continue to cause problems for the markets beyond the one-year anniversary .
" certainly september 11 unsettled investors , " said stefan schneider , chief international economist at deutsche bank research , " but the current low market figures , are not all related to the terrorist attacks . "
by the end of 2001 , the markets had almost fully recovered , he told ndr german television , explaining that other factors were to blame .
the recent downward trend owes much more to accounting scandals in the us , a general pessimism about global economic growth and the situation in the middle east , including a looming war in iraq , said rolf drees , german financial analyst .
as proof of the ongoing troubles , eleven months after the terrorist attacks the dax dropped to 3.235 points , its lowest level since april 1997 .
economic growth is most critical factor in the coming months , the most critical factor driving the markets is confidence in economic development and growth .
according to the german investment trust , long-term market trends for the coming year are dependent on positive growth .
if company returns continue to be low , it explains , the stock markets will not recover .

“ where were you ?
how did you hear about it ? ” were questions of the hour .
everyone had a story worth telling .
each was deeply personal and at the same time universal .
for around the world , from berlin to bangkok , sept .
11 , 2001 , was a day that made memories , a day that will not be forgotten . this urge to remember , to revisit the not-so-distant past , also ranges from the personal to the collective and throughout germany – like in many countries around the world – there are a plethora of memorial events planned for wednesday . last year , hundreds of thousands of germans gathered at the brandenburg gate after the attacks to show their support for americans and to mourn the victims .

president johannes rau , chancellor gerhard schröder and bundestag president wolfgang thierse are expected to attend – as are schröder ’ s opposition in the race for the chancellor ’ s office , edmund stoiber , and american ambassador daniel coats , who has been a sparring partner of schröder ’ s since the chancellor announced his opposition to german involvement in a potential u.s. attack on iraq . services will be conducted by both catholic and evangelical clergy .
likewise , memorial services are planned in many churches throughout germany . in mainz , the ecumenical and peace service is planned together with leaders of the jewish and islamic communities . religious differences provoke conflict while thousands have turned to religion for comfort in the days and months following the attack on the u.s. , religion has also become a touchstone of controversy in the past year . and the age-old conflict between religions was undoubtedly heightened in the aftermath . on tuesday , a leader of the lutheran church in germany called for an international cooperation to avoid further religious confrontations worldwide .
bishop christian krause called for an “ open dialogue between religions . ” meanwhile , the chairman of germany ’ s intercultural council said on tuesday that in the past year , many of the 3 million muslims living in germany have experienced growing isolation , suspicion and even hatred from their non-muslim neighbors . non-muslim germans increasingly have the attitude that muslims “ don ’ t belong to us , ” jürgen micksch told the associated press .
“ that ’ s a big obstacle for integration and for a peaceful co-existence . ” multicultural attempt to address tensions in an attempt to address this issue , the organization has formed a so-called abraham team comprised of christians , jews and muslims that will visit schools and public events to discuss commonalities and differences among the religions . churches are not the only places where memorials are planned .
from the soccer field to the stage , tributes ranging from rock concerts to moments of silence are scheduled for wednesday . the german symphony orchestra of berlin , conducted by kent nagano , will present a memorial concert featuring beethoven ’ s symphony no. 4 -lrb- “ the prayer ” -rrb- among other works .
“ in the language of music , we ’ ll make a tribute to the victims and unite in striving towards common ground and in the longing for peace , ” said an orchestra press release . the house of world cultures is presenting new work from the new york jazz musician erik friedlander , who will appear together with his “ trio rope ” group .
in addition , the new york string quartet “ ethel ” .
and religious rocker sarah brendel will give a concert in the course of a religious service at berlin ’ s gedächtniskirche -lrb- memorial church -rrb- , a church that was left in ruins from a world war ii bombing . beyond the stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man places some flowers in front of the u.s consulate in hamburg , northern germany , during a minute of silence for the victims of the terror attacks of sept .

"
that 's how rudolph giuliani summed up his ambivalence tonight towards the event that turned him from the simple mayor of new york city into " america 's mayor " .
when you act in a way that kills innocent people , you have just excluded yourself from civilised countries and your cause is unjust rudolph giuliani he came to meet the international media at a special briefing room in midtown manhattan and he was running very late .
his communications director apologised from the podium by telling bbc news online and other waiting journalists that he was coming straight from him mother 's funeral .
helen giuliani , 92 , died on sunday night .
it was the final funeral in what has been a year of funerals for the now-retired politician who has been more closely identified with " 9/11 " than any other .
ambition intact he made it clear to us that despite an incredible year in both his public and personal life - he went through high-profile and bitter divorce proceedings just a few weeks ago - his ambition for office remains intact : " i 've been out of office less than a year ...
in the future , and i do n't know exactly when , i believe i would like to run for office again .
but if you ask me which office , i do n't know . "
he won his status as the healer-in-chief of new york by helping to unite the city with a galvanising message of common purpose and inclusivity .
many here believe that he is the only mayor in recent history capable of doing that .
some , however , believe that his strong words would have come naturally to any incumbent .
firefighters say faulty radios meant more lives were lost the firefighters ' unions have gone further and last month accused him of " fooling " the public .
his administration 's failure to upgrade firefighters ' radio units , they believe , was responsible for approximately 120 deaths - the estimated number of men who failed to hear the order to evacuate the flaming towers .
mr giuliani had an answer for his critics , describing it as the most successful evacuation operation in american history , with 25,000 lives saved : " i do n't think that any city could have been better prepared .
" if you had withdrawn a lot of police officers and firefighters from the building , if communications had worked better , you might have ended up with 3,000-4,000 more civilians dead . "
' soaring memorial ' he criticised the fact that he had not been asked to contribute any evidence to recent reports into the performance of the emergency services .
he said he was not missing being the mayor of new york , and happily restated his opposition to the views of his successor , michael bloomberg , over the issue of land use at ground zero .
the new mayor wants a mixed-use site that includes commercial and residential building .
mr giuliani said the " soaring memorial " he envisages could stand as tall as the towers themselves .
giuliani 's girlfriend judith was with him " i do n't claim to be objective about this.there are many places in which you can build office building .
" you ca n't build a memorial any place else but there . "
he was visibly drained by the events of the last few days .
standing directly behind him at the podium were the police , fire and emergency services commissioners from his old administration .
blunt sitting to one side of the packed press room , dressed elegantly in black , was his girlfriend , judith nathan .
but his words of thanks , deep emotion and reconciliation when reflecting on the past year , contrasted with his blunt answer to a question about how much understanding had really been shown here in new york towards the causes of the 11 september attacks .
" maybe the better response should be , we do n't care about the root cause of terrorism .
" when you act in a way that kills innocent people , you have just excluded yourself from civilised countries ... and your cause is unjust . "
in that we had a flash of the old " rudy " - the outspoken catholic moralist who was not popular with many liberal sections of the city .
with his extraordinary popularity as speechmaker and endorser of republican candidates around the country continuing , another political odyssey for " america 's mayor " is surely on its way .

the action could become more widespread if 26,000 machinists in boeing 's commercial jetliner division also vote to strike in a ballot on pay on thursday .
leaders of the 26,000 machinists in boeing 's biggest union , the international association of machinists and aerospace workers -lrb- iam -rrb- , have urged their members to reject the pay deal .
boeing officials say deliveries of chinook helicopters to the us military could be delayed if 1,500 workers walk out of its pennsylvania factory .
special powers however , pentagon guidelines would allow the company to use other workers to cover strikers ' jobs .
" we 're supplying chinooks to people in afghanistan and things like that , " said boeing spokeswoman madelyn bush .
" the government requires that we keep doing that . "
both disputes centre on pay deals which the unions say are too low , coupled with changes to payments for health insurance and other benefits .
like the rest of the aviation industry , boeing has been hard hit by falling demand for commercial aircraft since the 11 september suicide hijacking attacks as airlines have mothballed planes and cancelled orders .
hard times boeing 's commercial airplanes division has said orders for 504 aircraft have been delayed by customers since the attacks .
the iam said the latest contracts offered little job security and poor benefits .
leaders of the united aerospace workers -lrb- uaw -rrb- union at the ridley plant near philadelphia in pennsylvania have rejected their pay deal on similar grounds .
" i consider that -lrb- offer -rrb- an insult and i think most of our members consider that an insult , " said john defrancisco , president of uaw local 1069 in pennsylvania .
boeing 's spokeswoman said it was " our best and final offer " .

prime minister junichiro koizumi is expected to unveil his proposals on 20 september .
fragile recovery japan 's benchmark nikkei stock index fell to 19 year lows in early september .
the nikkei 's drop below the 9,000 level contributed to pressure for the government to produce an economic revival package to restore the stock market 's performance .
but analysts warned that japan 's export-led recovery remained weak .
one factor helping the growth figures was a downgrading of the role played by imports , which led to a stronger overall contribution from exports , but it suggested weak domestic demand .
the recovery was " likely to be relatively short-lived as exports start to fall next year , " said peter morgan , chief economist at hsbc securities in tokyo .
in the short term , he said , the improvement and the recovery in capital spending would continue .
the revised data meant japan 's economic growth in the april to june period was 2.6 % higher than a year earlier , rather than 1.9 % as had been thought .
however , investors on the nikkei and other asian stock markets were not fazed during trading on the first anniversary of 11 september : the nikkei closed nearly 1 % higher at 9,400 points .

dixons said on wednesday that underlying sales for the 19 weeks to 8 september were up 6 % up compared with the same period last year , outstripping analysts ' forecasts of a 4 % increase .
dixons chairman sir stanley kalms , who retires on wednesday , said the improved sales performance reflected strong demand for dvds , and games consoles , while sales of mobile phones and personal computers showed " encouraging signs of recovery " .
sales of televisions also grew strongly as consumers rushed to upgrade their sets ahead of the world cup football tournament in june .
" while it is too early to extrapolate these trends for the balance of the year , we look forward to a year of continued progress , " sir stanley said , speaking ahead of dixons shareholders ' annual general meeting .
shoppers still busy news of dixons stronger sales figures will help reinforce hopes that the boom in uk consumer spending , credited with staving off recession during last year 's global economic downturn , still has some way to run .
earlier this week , a survey from the british retail consortium showed that high street sales increased at their fastest pace for nearly five months during august .
but some economists believe that deteriorating economic prospects could curb consumer spending in the months ahead .
dixons , which also owns computer retailer pc world , electrical appliance chain currys , and the link mobile phone shop , was hit earlier this year by slowing mobile handset sales .
the company reported a 7 % rise in pre-tax profits to £ 297.2m -lrb- $ 462.7m -rrb- for the year to late april .
in the city , dixons shares were down 2.5 pence at 178.5p in early trade on wednesday .

but the head of one of the world 's major oil firms believes industrial nations have sufficient stockpiles to withstand any output cuts .
" there 's a lot of oil to take care of a very significant shortfall for quite a period of time , " lord browne , chief executive of bp told bbc radio .
on tuesday , two big oil companies warned they were raising prices at the petrol pumps in the uk .
chevrontexaco said its prices would go up by a penny -lrb- 1.5 us cents -rrb- a litre , taking the minimum price for unleaded to 73.9 pence a litre .
totalfinaelf said it was doing the same .
air travel could also face a hike in costs , as jet fuel prices hit a post-11 september high .
jitters the rise in petrol prices in the uk is the direct result of an 11 % climb in the price of wholesale gasoline last week , in the face of ever-louder noises about war with iraq from washington dc and london .
and the cost of aviation fuel reached $ 283 a tonne , threatening airlines already burdened with heavy losses from the disruption which followed the 11 september attacks on the us .
the insistence from both president george w bush and prime minister tony blair that iraq 's president , saddam hussein , is rebuilding nuclear , chemical and biological weapons stockpiles is setting traders ' nerves on edge .
benchmark nymex crude oil in the us has touched $ 30 a barrel in the past 24 hours .
the organisation of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- likes to keep prices between $ 22 and $ 27 , and a meeting later this month could well produce a production boost .

john belle left cardiff for the big apple as a young man looking to find work on the streets of manhattan .
now , as one of america 's most influential architects , he has the task of filling the gaping hole where the world trade center once stood .
it has become the biggest most difficult and sensitive project he has ever faced - the re-building of ground zero .

in his distingushed career , he has restored some of new york 's great iconic buildings including grand central terminal , the rockefeller centre , and the great conservatory at new york 's botanical garden .
but the brief to restore the glory to the city 's beleaguered skyline must overcome more than the scepticism of the critics and the planners , and the demands of big business and politics .
he must negotiate his way through the emotions of the bereaved , and the concerns of millions of ordinary new yorkers .
at a public meeting , six of his company 's projects were rejected .
against a background of dissention and in-fighting , what will fill the yawning emptiness of ground zero is undecided .
" the important thing is we have started , we 've defined some options , " said mr belle .
" the public has responded to those options by giving us some very valid criticisms and in the process of doing that , i think the objectives and the ultimate solutions will become that much clearer . "
