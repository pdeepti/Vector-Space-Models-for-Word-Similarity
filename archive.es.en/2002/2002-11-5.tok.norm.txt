initial results gave the party 34 percent of the vote , allowing the akp to form a single government with 360 seats in the 550-seat national assembly the election victory means that the party , with deep islamic roots , will get the chance to live up to the promises it made regarding the pursuit of eu membership for turkey .
the akp made joining the european union a priority throughout the election campaign .
although describing itself as ' moderate ' with political leanings towards ' conservative democrat , ' the akp has caused some concerns within turkey and elsewhere due to its political background .
the party was formed a year ago by members of previously banned islamist groups , and its leader reccep tayyip erdogan is currently banned from the country 's national assembly and therefore can not be named prime minister .
erdogan was banned from holding an office in the country ’ s parliament because he recited a religious poem in public three years ago that was construed to stir up inter-racial hatred .
turkey and the eu despite the victory of a pro-eu party , the european union is still not completely convinced that turkey can be considered a candidate for enlargement .
the turkish parliament passed new laws to conform to european norms in august this year .
it also abolished the death penalty and extended cultural rights to the country 's kurdish minority .
however , a recent amnesty international report to the eu suggests that systematic torture and human rights abuses are still rife in turkish jails despite the reforms .
in its regular progress report , the european commission said , " the reforms contain a number of significant limitations on the full enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedom , " and added turkey had yet to meet the political agenda to start negotiations .
despite increased pressure from washington to give nato 's only muslim member an accession date , eu leaders are likely to wait until december to make their final decision .
it seems that the european union itself has little cause for concern as the akp continues to voice pro-european support .
britain welcomed the election result and has called for a date to be set to discuss turkey 's accession .
so too has greece , which believes that its problems with its neighbor over the divided island of cyprus , will be better addressed from within the eu .
german reactions the most important european player with regards to turkey ’ s entrance in the eu is germany .
historically the germans have been among the most cautious about turkey 's membership , but in the last few weeks many politicians have warmed up to the idea .
the social democratic-led government has recently come out in favor of turkey joining the eu , and on monday a spokesperson in the office of foreign affairs called the election results the " first positive signal " in the formation of a stable government .
“ we hope , that the traditionally close and friendly ties between germany and turkey will improve ” with the new government , the speaker told reporters .
on nov .
27 the turkish president ahmet necdet sezer , is scheduled to meet with chancellor gerhard schröder to discuss entry into the eu .
the conservative opposition parties in the bundestag , however , remain skeptical .
angela merkel , party leader for the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said on monday that turkey ’ s membership in the eu is “ not on the agenda . ”
the cdu is also not in favor of using the eu summit in copenhagen in december as a forum for discussing a concrete date for turkey ’ s entrance , merkel said .
edmund stoiber , state premier for bavaria is adamantly against extending eu membership to turkey .
on monday he told reporters that turkey is “ politically and economically still far away from meeting the requirements for entrance in the eu . ”
islamist party on europe ’ s edge european reactions to the election result from barely disguised nervousness over the rise to power of a party formed by the deputies of an outlawed islamist organization .
observers believe that a party with islamic roots could lead to instability and tensions in the region with pro-islamist members within the akp becoming dissatisfied with the non-confrontational attitude adopted by leaders such as erdogan .
however , despite allegations to the contrary , the akp has consistently denied that its politics are based on an islamist agenda .
on sunday night , erdogan , having promised voters during the campaign that he had turned his back on his islamist past , moved swiftly to reassure the country that his party would accelerate turkey 's efforts to join the eu .
" akp is ready to take responsibility to build up the political will to accelerate the european union entry process , to strengthen the integration of our economy with the world economy and to implement the economic program , " he said in a public address .
in a bid to allay international fears , the vice-chairman of the akp , yasar yakis , also released a statement promising to speed up work on meeting the criteria for eu membership ahead of the crucial european summit in copenhagen next month .
yakis reiterated the party 's desire to look west .
the former turkish ambassador to the united nations told the british daily " the guardian , " " our first priority in government will be to complete the framework document for the copenhagen criteria .
we do n't want to leave any pretext for europe to say that turkey will not be admitted .

names of potential successors to interim ceo helmut sihler at deutsche telekom have been reported widely on an often daily basis , accompanied often by loud denials on both sides .
a reported 20 potential successors , among them porsche head wendelin wiedeking , deutsche post chairman klaus zumwinkel and ulrich schumacher of chip-maker infineon , have so far turned down being considered for the job at the troubled telecommunication firm .
the lists have been widely criticized by both telekom chairman of the board hans-dietrich winkhaus and officials in the government .
but for different reasons .
winkhaus , who together with the 72-year-old sihler is heading the search , has called the media reports “ disruptive ” and defended telekom ’ s search .
“ you can ’ t do things more discretely , better and quicker than we have done them , ” said winkhaus .
the current candidate list is reportedly down to five , with a selection due most likely in december .
government reportedly unhappy recent reports suggest government officials think otherwise .
the weekly “ welt am sonntag ” newspaper reported that chancellor gerhard schröder had asked his economics minister to take personal responsibility for the search for a new chair , and that there was widespread dissatisfaction with the way winkhaus was handling the job .
members of schröder 's party told the newspaper that the government said the selection process was too chaotic .
the government , which has a 43 percent stake in telekom , and winkhaus have denied the report .
analyst robert vinall at dz bank in frankfurt said it ’ s only natural that schröder ’ s government should put pressure on winkhaus and sihler .
“ instrumental in getting ron sommer out was the key that there was going to be a smooth transition to the new head , ” he said in a dw-world interview .
sommer left the company in july after telekom amassed a 64 billion euro debt and the company ’ s stock dropped to an all time low .
sihler , the former chairman of a chemicals company , quickly took over .
he announced a strict and unpopular savings course that , among other things , would cut the 255,000-strong workforce by 50,000 jobs .
he also said he would be leaving in january to make way for a younger chairman .
“ a very tough job ahead of him ” now the pressure is on and the list of replacements reportedly down to five candidates .
the next chairman will have a mammoth responsibility in front of him .

sihler has already cut the advertising budget and plans to do the same to the travel budget , according to reports .
a complete list of measures will be unveiled at a meeting on nov .

the new ceo should be in place a month after that .

names of potential successors to interim ceo helmut sihler at deutsche telekom have been reported widely on an often daily basis , accompanied often by loud denials on both sides .
a reported 20 potential successors , among them porsche head wendelin wiedeking , deutsche post chairman klaus zumwinkel and ulrich schumacher of chip-maker infineon , have so far turned down being considered for the job at the troubled telecommunication firm .
the lists have been widely criticized by both telekom chairman of the board hans-dietrich winkhaus and officials in the government .
but for different reasons .
winkhaus , who together with the 72-year-old sihler is heading the search , has called the media reports “ disruptive ” and defended telekom ’ s search .
“ you can ’ t do things more discretely , better and quicker than we have done them , ” said winkhaus .
the current candidate list is reportedly down to five , with a selection due most likely in december .
government reportedly unhappy recent reports suggest government officials think otherwise .
the weekly “ welt am sonntag ” newspaper reported that chancellor gerhard schröder had asked his economics minister to take personal responsibility for the search for a new chair , and that there was widespread dissatisfaction with the way winkhaus was handling the job .
members of schröder 's party told the newspaper that the government said the selection process was too chaotic .
the government , which has a 43 percent stake in telekom , and winkhaus have denied the report .
analyst robert vinall at dz bank in frankfurt said it ’ s only natural that schröder ’ s government should put pressure on winkhaus and sihler .
“ instrumental in getting ron sommer out was the key that there was going to be a smooth transition to the new head , ” he said in a dw-world interview .
sommer left the company in july after telekom amassed a 64 billion euro debt and the company ’ s stock dropped to an all time low .
sihler , the former chairman of a chemicals company , quickly took over .
he announced a strict and unpopular savings course that , among other things , would cut the 255,000-strong workforce by 50,000 jobs .
he also said he would be leaving in january to make way for a younger chairman .
“ a very tough job ahead of him ” now the pressure is on and the list of replacements reportedly down to five candidates .
the next chairman will have a mammoth responsibility in front of him .
saddled with a heavy debt and facing job cuts , telekom looks to be a tough assignment .
sihler has already cut the advertising budget and plans to do the same to the travel budget , according to reports .
a complete list of measures will be unveiled at a meeting on nov .
14 when telekom presents the results of a strategic review .
the new ceo should be in place a month after that .
“ i think it ’ s fairly likely that a lot of the unpopular decisions will have been announced by then , ” said vinall .
the burden then comes to this new person to push through the decisions and i think the new person will have a very tough job ahead of him . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prices climbing at deutsche telekom deutsche telekom is raising prices on cable access as it rushes to sell off its cable tv business .

germans are having less kids and living longer .
the news is bad for future retirees and a massive headache right now for the chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government . german workers will have to pay more into the state pension fund under a controversial agreement by chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government announced tuesday .
the hike , which will require workers and their employers to increase their contribution from 19.1 percent of their monthly earnings to 19.5 percent , faced heavy opposition from schröder 's coalition partners , the green party .
after a late-night monday negotiating session , schröder prevailed over his green partners , pushing a hike his party says the pension fund desperately needs .
round 3 billion euro will be missing from the pension fund , into which employees and their employers share monthly contributions , before the end of the year .
the deficit would mean current retirees at the very least would n't have gotten the annual pension payment increase legally guaranteed them this year .
the increase appears to assure them their money .
but critics say the government 's " first aid action " is like putting a bandaid on a gaping wound .
demographic time bomb like many other countries with similar pay-as-you-go state pension schemes , germany faces a demographic time bomb .
over the next 30 years the number of germans above the age of 60 is expected to increase 9.9 million , mainly due to low birth rates and higher life expectancies .
as a result , the number of workers shouldering the pension burden is expected to fall .
currently , a little more than two working germans support every german retiree .
in even 20 years time , that ratio will be 1:1 , according to commerzbank statistics . with the recent introduction of privately funded , state- supported pension schemes , the german government hoped to find a way of avoiding further cuts in state benefits and rises in state contributions .
as a result , the government promised the average pensioner 's benefits would not fall below 67 percent of the national wage on retirement , against the current 69 percent .
the catch was that the pensioner would have to contribute for at least 45 years , as opposed to the current average 37 years .
in addition , compulsory contributions to the pension scheme , now 19.1 percent , jointly paid by employer and employee , were not set to rise above 20 percent for the next 20 years .
" first aid action " but on saturday , germany 's health minister ulla schmidt disclosed plans to raise pension contributions to 19.5 percent in 2003 , saying she regarded this step as a kind of " first aid action " to make way for further and wider structural reforms .
with her proposals , which will be up for decision in the bundestag on thursday , schmidt hopes to cut costs in the welfare system by some 3.5 billion euro .
the proposal faced initial opposition from the greens who agreed on a percentage increase of only 0.2 percent in the government 's coalition agreement signed last week .
on tuesday , those issues appeared to have been ironed out .
business cries foul schmidt still faces tremendous opposition from business lobbies , who are calling for cuts , not increases , in germany 's rising social welfare levies which are driving up the costs of labor .
industrial labor costs in germany are higher than in any other country and germany 's tax and social-welfare burden is one of the heaviest in the world .
when chancellor gerhard schröder took over from helmut kohl in 1998 after 16 years of conservative rule , the largely untouched labor market , health , pensions and school systems were crying out for reform .
the red-green coalition has been struggling with economic reform ever since , aiming to cut the combined costs of compulsory pension health , unemployment and disability insurance fees to under 40 percent of gross wages .
however , the figure is now at 40.4 per cent – and still rising fast .
recognizing the need for major reform , schröder 's coalition accompanied the percentage increase with the announcement that it was calling together a commission to recommend reforms . the recommendations are due out in fall 2003 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the german police are making the most of telecommunication technology in the fight against crime by utilising the text messaging phenomenon to track and catch criminals .
in a pilot project organised by the federal office of criminal investigation , bundeskriminalamt -lrb- bka -rrb- , regional police in ten german cities will be providing information on wrong doers and missing persons via sms text messaging available on mobile phones .
five month trial will cover major cities across germany the five-month trial period began on monday in the central german city of wiesbaden and the northwestern city of bochum .
the project will spread out over a further eight locations in other regions of the country in the coming weeks , ending its initial testing in march 2003 .
in each location , the police will contact between 50 and 100 selected individuals who have provided their numbers for the project .
detailed information on criminals straight to your phone suspect descriptions of wanted miscreants , vehicle information such as licence plate numbers and missing person details will be sent out to the phones of people working every day in close proximity to the public .
for the trial run , police are using public transit employees , taxi drivers , driving instructors and city workers .
" the fast and direct targeting of selected occupations opens up a new working relationship between the police and population .
it enhances the probability that a criminal is apprehended immediately after the perpetration of the crime , " said bka president ulrich kersten .

anyone who receives the information and makes a positive identification can call a special hotline at the local police station .

august hanning told a security conference in berlin that evidence suggests that the organization 's leadership continues to be capable of directing terrorist attacks against germany and the rest of the world .
the bnd chief has made previous claims stating that bin laden is not out of the picture yet and that al qaeda still proves to be a danger despite the destruction of its training camps during the us-led campaign in afghanistan .
bnd believes al qaeda leadership to be at large in a report last weekend in the german sunday newspaper , welt am sonntag , hanning said that the country ’ s intelligence service suspects bin laden and his deputy , ayman al-zawahiri , are hiding in the afghan-pakistani border area southeast of the capital kabul .
in a speech to a security gathering in berlin on monday , hanning reiterated his claims , saying : " -lrb- bin laden -rrb- has numerous helpers .
he operates in regions where access is very difficult .
he also changes his location .
that makes the situation very hard . "
the bnd believes that there are presently over 5,000 al qaeda and taliban fighters in afghanistan and pakistan and that the leadership-in-hiding is looking at " forming new structures . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd director august hanning says reports show increased terror communications .
hanning said that recent information received from collaborating intelligence organizations shows a recognizable increase in worldwide communications between members of the al-qaeda terrorist network in recent weeks and months .
" we see no all clear signal at this time .
rather , we are seeing an increase in -lrb- terrorist -rrb- activities . "
the bnd chief added that there was concern that this was a prelude to further terrorist attacks .
germany on increased alert after recorded warning german authorities have increased anti-terror precautions recently after a recorded message alleged to have been made by al-zawahiri mentioned germany in a warning to western powers .
in the recorded message , the voice says , " the mujahid youth has already sent messages to germany and france .
however , if these doses are not enough , we are prepared , with the help of allah , to inject further doses . "
attacks linked to al qaeda killed 11 german tourists visiting a synagogue in tunisia in april and the same number of french engineers as they traveled by bus in pakistan in may .
" when you look at past attacks , we must conclude that the fear of a new attack is very real ... an attack of greater dimensions , " said the bnd chief on german public television channel zdf after meeting with international security officials in berlin .
however , hanning added that bin laden probably " has the activities planned but they are not yet functional . "
active european terror cells still an al qaeda objective hanning believes that the terrorist organization is still actively recruiting in europe and that cells , like the one discovered in hamburg accused of the september 11th attacks , are still a potential threat .
" we see that recruiting is going on , " he said .
" we have european centers that are still being used for recruiting today . "
hanning added that the risk that al qaeda still had the power to carry out attacks in the arab world and europe " remains relatively high . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany the past year has been an illuminating one for german anti-terrorism investigators .
but much work remains and the country ’ s top terrorism officials warn more attacks might be in store .

the eu filed suit against austria , britain , belgium , denmark , finland , germany , luxembourg and sweden four years ago after the countries refused to let the european commission negotiate a single eu-wide deal with the u.s. and went it alone .
the agreements with the u.s. regulate airline fares , access to crucial routes and landing slots and computer reservation systems for both american and european carriers .
in its ruling , the court said those deals can only be negotiated by brussels .
the decision is likely to provide legal footing for the eu 's ambition to negotiate a full " open skies " agreement with the united states that would permit unlimited access to the u.s. market by all european carriers and also ownership of u.s.-based carriers by european firms .
the initiative is supported by major european airlines including richard branson , whose attempts to expand his virgin express budget carrier into the u.s. have been thwarted by american regulations barring foreign ownership of domestic airlines . more briefs 05.11.2002 -pipe- deutsche bank sells services unit for $ 1.5 billion 05.11.2002 -pipe- audi says car sales speeding up 05.11.2002 -pipe- trial begins for " muppets " german owners 05.11.2002 -pipe- online dream vaporizes for supermarkets 05.11.2002 -pipe- layoffs wave hits europe 05.11.2002 -pipe- industry : no end in sight for sick economy radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the eu filed suit against austria , britain , belgium , denmark , finland , germany , luxembourg and sweden four years ago after the countries refused to let the european commission negotiate a single eu-wide deal with the u.s. and went it alone .
the agreements with the u.s. regulate airline fares , access to crucial routes and landing slots and computer reservation systems for both american and european carriers .
in its ruling , the court said those deals can only be negotiated by brussels .
the decision is likely to provide legal footing for the eu 's ambition to negotiate a full " open skies " agreement with the united states that would permit unlimited access to the u.s. market by all european carriers and also ownership of u.s.-based carriers by european firms .
the initiative is supported by major european airlines including richard branson , whose attempts to expand his virgin express budget carrier into the u.s. have been thwarted by american regulations barring foreign ownership of domestic airlines . more briefs 05.11.2002 -pipe- deutsche bank sells services unit for $ 1.5 billion 05.11.2002 -pipe- audi says car sales speeding up 05.11.2002 -pipe- trial begins for " muppets " german owners 05.11.2002 -pipe- online dream vaporizes for supermarkets 05.11.2002 -pipe- layoffs wave hits europe 05.11.2002 -pipe- industry : no end in sight for sick economy radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

august hanning told a security conference in berlin that evidence suggests that the organization 's leadership continues to be capable of directing terrorist attacks against germany and the rest of the world .
the bnd chief has made previous claims stating that bin laden is not out of the picture yet and that al qaeda still proves to be a danger despite the destruction of its training camps during the us-led campaign in afghanistan .
bnd believes al qaeda leadership to be at large in a report last weekend in the german sunday newspaper , welt am sonntag , hanning said that the country ’ s intelligence service suspects bin laden and his deputy , ayman al-zawahiri , are hiding in the afghan-pakistani border area southeast of the capital kabul .
in a speech to a security gathering in berlin on monday , hanning reiterated his claims , saying : " -lrb- bin laden -rrb- has numerous helpers .
he operates in regions where access is very difficult .
he also changes his location .
that makes the situation very hard . "
the bnd believes that there are presently over 5,000 al qaeda and taliban fighters in afghanistan and pakistan and that the leadership-in-hiding is looking at " forming new structures . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd director august hanning says reports show increased terror communications .
hanning said that recent information received from collaborating intelligence organizations shows a recognizable increase in worldwide communications between members of the al-qaeda terrorist network in recent weeks and months .
" we see no all clear signal at this time .
rather , we are seeing an increase in -lrb- terrorist -rrb- activities . "
the bnd chief added that there was concern that this was a prelude to further terrorist attacks .
germany on increased alert after recorded warning german authorities have increased anti-terror precautions recently after a recorded message alleged to have been made by al-zawahiri mentioned germany in a warning to western powers .
in the recorded message , the voice says , " the mujahid youth has already sent messages to germany and france .
however , if these doses are not enough , we are prepared , with the help of allah , to inject further doses . "
attacks linked to al qaeda killed 11 german tourists visiting a synagogue in tunisia in april and the same number of french engineers as they traveled by bus in pakistan in may .
" when you look at past attacks , we must conclude that the fear of a new attack is very real ... an attack of greater dimensions , " said the bnd chief on german public television channel zdf after meeting with international security officials in berlin .
however , hanning added that bin laden probably " has the activities planned but they are not yet functional . "
active european terror cells still an al qaeda objective hanning believes that the terrorist organization is still actively recruiting in europe and that cells , like the one discovered in hamburg accused of the september 11th attacks , are still a potential threat .
" we see that recruiting is going on , " he said .
" we have european centers that are still being used for recruiting today . "

the court will decide whether thomas haffa can be held responsible for the catastrophic crash of em.tv 's share price .
haffa is the first executive to come under such intense legal scrutiny from a company that traded on germany 's neuer markt , which was disbanded earlier this year with the bursting of the new economy bubble .
state prosecutors accuse haffa and his brother , florian , of publishing falsified half-year figures for the company in 2000 and manipulated forecasts .
testifying in court on monday , thomas haffa denied the charges .
" we always presented the state of the company to the best of our knowledge and conscience , " he told the judges of the munich regional court .
in their heyday , the haffa brothers made handsome profits with the broadcasting and advertising rights to such popular programs as " the muppet show " and " sesame street " as well as formula one racing .
at its peak , em.tv 's shares rose to 120 euro -lrb- $ 120.28 -rrb- , but today it trades at less than a euro . more briefs 05.11.2002 -pipe- online dream vaporizes for supermarkets 05.11.2002 -pipe- layoffs wave hits europe 05.11.2002 -pipe- industry : no end in sight for sick economy radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

names of potential successors to interim ceo helmut sihler at deutsche telekom have been reported widely on an often daily basis , accompanied often by loud denials on both sides .

names of potential successors to interim ceo helmut sihler at deutsche telekom have been reported widely on an often daily basis , accompanied often by loud denials on both sides .
a reported 20 potential successors , among them porsche head wendelin wiedeking , deutsche post chairman klaus zumwinkel and ulrich schumacher of chip-maker infineon , have so far turned down being considered for the job at the troubled telecommunication firm .
the lists have been widely criticized by both telekom chairman of the board hans-dietrich winkhaus and officials in the government .
but for different reasons .
winkhaus , who together with the 72-year-old sihler is heading the search , has called the media reports “ disruptive ” and defended telekom ’ s search .
“ you can ’ t do things more discretely , better and quicker than we have done them , ” said winkhaus .
the current candidate list is reportedly down to five , with a selection due most likely in december .
government reportedly unhappy recent reports suggest government officials think otherwise .
the weekly “ welt am sonntag ” newspaper reported that chancellor gerhard schröder had asked his economics minister to take personal responsibility for the search for a new chair , and that there was widespread dissatisfaction with the way winkhaus was handling the job .
members of schröder 's party told the newspaper that the government said the selection process was too chaotic .
the government , which has a 43 percent stake in telekom , and winkhaus have denied the report .
analyst robert vinall at dz bank in frankfurt said it ’ s only natural that schröder ’ s government should put pressure on winkhaus and sihler .
“ instrumental in getting ron sommer out was the key that there was going to be a smooth transition to the new head , ” he said in a dw-world interview .
sommer left the company in july after telekom amassed a 64 billion euro debt and the company ’ s stock dropped to an all time low .
sihler , the former chairman of a chemicals company , quickly took over .
he announced a strict and unpopular savings course that , among other things , would cut the 255,000-strong workforce by 50,000 jobs .
he also said he would be leaving in january to make way for a younger chairman .
“ a very tough job ahead of him ” now the pressure is on and the list of replacements reportedly down to five candidates .
the next chairman will have a mammoth responsibility in front of him .
saddled with a heavy debt and facing job cuts , telekom looks to be a tough assignment .
sihler has already cut the advertising budget and plans to do the same to the travel budget , according to reports .
a complete list of measures will be unveiled at a meeting on nov .
14 when telekom presents the results of a strategic review .
the new ceo should be in place a month after that .
“ i think it ’ s fairly likely that a lot of the unpopular decisions will have been announced by then , ” said vinall .
the burden then comes to this new person to push through the decisions and i think the new person will have a very tough job ahead of him . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prices climbing at deutsche telekom deutsche telekom is raising prices on cable access as it rushes to sell off its cable tv business .

august hanning told a security conference in berlin that evidence suggests that the organization 's leadership continues to be capable of directing terrorist attacks against germany and the rest of the world .
the bnd chief has made previous claims stating that bin laden is not out of the picture yet and that al qaeda still proves to be a danger despite the destruction of its training camps during the us-led campaign in afghanistan .
bnd believes al qaeda leadership to be at large in a report last weekend in the german sunday newspaper , welt am sonntag , hanning said that the country ’ s intelligence service suspects bin laden and his deputy , ayman al-zawahiri , are hiding in the afghan-pakistani border area southeast of the capital kabul .
in a speech to a security gathering in berlin on monday , hanning reiterated his claims , saying : " -lrb- bin laden -rrb- has numerous helpers .
he operates in regions where access is very difficult .
he also changes his location .
that makes the situation very hard . "
the bnd believes that there are presently over 5,000 al qaeda and taliban fighters in afghanistan and pakistan and that the leadership-in-hiding is looking at " forming new structures . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd director august hanning says reports show increased terror communications .
hanning said that recent information received from collaborating intelligence organizations shows a recognizable increase in worldwide communications between members of the al-qaeda terrorist network in recent weeks and months .
" we see no all clear signal at this time .
rather , we are seeing an increase in -lrb- terrorist -rrb- activities . "
the bnd chief added that there was concern that this was a prelude to further terrorist attacks .
germany on increased alert after recorded warning german authorities have increased anti-terror precautions recently after a recorded message alleged to have been made by al-zawahiri mentioned germany in a warning to western powers .
in the recorded message , the voice says , " the mujahid youth has already sent messages to germany and france .
however , if these doses are not enough , we are prepared , with the help of allah , to inject further doses . "
attacks linked to al qaeda killed 11 german tourists visiting a synagogue in tunisia in april and the same number of french engineers as they traveled by bus in pakistan in may .
" when you look at past attacks , we must conclude that the fear of a new attack is very real ... an attack of greater dimensions , " said the bnd chief on german public television channel zdf after meeting with international security officials in berlin .
however , hanning added that bin laden probably " has the activities planned but they are not yet functional . "
active european terror cells still an al qaeda objective hanning believes that the terrorist organization is still actively recruiting in europe and that cells , like the one discovered in hamburg accused of the september 11th attacks , are still a potential threat .
" we see that recruiting is going on , " he said .
" we have european centers that are still being used for recruiting today . "
hanning added that the risk that al qaeda still had the power to carry out attacks in the arab world and europe " remains relatively high . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany the past year has been an illuminating one for german anti-terrorism investigators .

initial results gave the party 34 percent of the vote , allowing the akp to form a single government with 360 seats in the 550-seat national assembly the election victory means that the party , with deep islamic roots , will get the chance to live up to the promises it made regarding the pursuit of eu membership for turkey .
the akp made joining the european union a priority throughout the election campaign .
although describing itself as ' moderate ' with political leanings towards ' conservative democrat , ' the akp has caused some concerns within turkey and elsewhere due to its political background .
the party was formed a year ago by members of previously banned islamist groups , and its leader reccep tayyip erdogan is currently banned from the country 's national assembly and therefore can not be named prime minister .
erdogan was banned from holding an office in the country ’ s parliament because he recited a religious poem in public three years ago that was construed to stir up inter-racial hatred .
turkey and the eu despite the victory of a pro-eu party , the european union is still not completely convinced that turkey can be considered a candidate for enlargement .
the turkish parliament passed new laws to conform to european norms in august this year .
it also abolished the death penalty and extended cultural rights to the country 's kurdish minority .
however , a recent amnesty international report to the eu suggests that systematic torture and human rights abuses are still rife in turkish jails despite the reforms .
in its regular progress report , the european commission said , " the reforms contain a number of significant limitations on the full enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedom , " and added turkey had yet to meet the political agenda to start negotiations .
despite increased pressure from washington to give nato 's only muslim member an accession date , eu leaders are likely to wait until december to make their final decision .
it seems that the european union itself has little cause for concern as the akp continues to voice pro-european support .
britain welcomed the election result and has called for a date to be set to discuss turkey 's accession .
so too has greece , which believes that its problems with its neighbor over the divided island of cyprus , will be better addressed from within the eu .
german reactions the most important european player with regards to turkey ’ s entrance in the eu is germany .
historically the germans have been among the most cautious about turkey 's membership , but in the last few weeks many politicians have warmed up to the idea .
the social democratic-led government has recently come out in favor of turkey joining the eu , and on monday a spokesperson in the office of foreign affairs called the election results the " first positive signal " in the formation of a stable government .
“ we hope , that the traditionally close and friendly ties between germany and turkey will improve ” with the new government , the speaker told reporters .
on nov .
27 the turkish president ahmet necdet sezer , is scheduled to meet with chancellor gerhard schröder to discuss entry into the eu .
the conservative opposition parties in the bundestag , however , remain skeptical .
angela merkel , party leader for the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said on monday that turkey ’ s membership in the eu is “ not on the agenda . ”
the cdu is also not in favor of using the eu summit in copenhagen in december as a forum for discussing a concrete date for turkey ’ s entrance , merkel said .
edmund stoiber , state premier for bavaria is adamantly against extending eu membership to turkey .
on monday he told reporters that turkey is “ politically and economically still far away from meeting the requirements for entrance in the eu . ”
islamist party on europe ’ s edge european reactions to the election result from barely disguised nervousness over the rise to power of a party formed by the deputies of an outlawed islamist organization .
observers believe that a party with islamic roots could lead to instability and tensions in the region with pro-islamist members within the akp becoming dissatisfied with the non-confrontational attitude adopted by leaders such as erdogan .
however , despite allegations to the contrary , the akp has consistently denied that its politics are based on an islamist agenda .
on sunday night , erdogan , having promised voters during the campaign that he had turned his back on his islamist past , moved swiftly to reassure the country that his party would accelerate turkey 's efforts to join the eu .
" akp is ready to take responsibility to build up the political will to accelerate the european union entry process , to strengthen the integration of our economy with the world economy and to implement the economic program , " he said in a public address .
in a bid to allay international fears , the vice-chairman of the akp , yasar yakis , also released a statement promising to speed up work on meeting the criteria for eu membership ahead of the crucial european summit in copenhagen next month .
yakis reiterated the party 's desire to look west .
the former turkish ambassador to the united nations told the british daily " the guardian , " " our first priority in government will be to complete the framework document for the copenhagen criteria .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.11.2002 a generous pension system in need of reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will pay for the young when they 're old ?
germans are having less kids and living longer .
the news is bad for future retirees and a massive headache right now for the chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government . german workers will have to pay more into the state pension fund under a controversial agreement by chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government announced tuesday .
the hike , which will require workers and their employers to increase their contribution from 19.1 percent of their monthly earnings to 19.5 percent , faced heavy opposition from schröder 's coalition partners , the green party .
after a late-night monday negotiating session , schröder prevailed over his green partners , pushing a hike his party says the pension fund desperately needs .
round 3 billion euro will be missing from the pension fund , into which employees and their employers share monthly contributions , before the end of the year .
the deficit would mean current retirees at the very least would n't have gotten the annual pension payment increase legally guaranteed them this year .
the increase appears to assure them their money .
but critics say the government 's " first aid action " is like putting a bandaid on a gaping wound .
demographic time bomb like many other countries with similar pay-as-you-go state pension schemes , germany faces a demographic time bomb .
over the next 30 years the number of germans above the age of 60 is expected to increase 9.9 million , mainly due to low birth rates and higher life expectancies .
as a result , the number of workers shouldering the pension burden is expected to fall .
currently , a little more than two working germans support every german retiree .
in even 20 years time , that ratio will be 1:1 , according to commerzbank statistics . with the recent introduction of privately funded , state- supported pension schemes , the german government hoped to find a way of avoiding further cuts in state benefits and rises in state contributions .
as a result , the government promised the average pensioner 's benefits would not fall below 67 percent of the national wage on retirement , against the current 69 percent .
the catch was that the pensioner would have to contribute for at least 45 years , as opposed to the current average 37 years .
in addition , compulsory contributions to the pension scheme , now 19.1 percent , jointly paid by employer and employee , were not set to rise above 20 percent for the next 20 years .
" first aid action " but on saturday , germany 's health minister ulla schmidt disclosed plans to raise pension contributions to 19.5 percent in 2003 , saying she regarded this step as a kind of " first aid action " to make way for further and wider structural reforms .
with her proposals , which will be up for decision in the bundestag on thursday , schmidt hopes to cut costs in the welfare system by some 3.5 billion euro .
the proposal faced initial opposition from the greens who agreed on a percentage increase of only 0.2 percent in the government 's coalition agreement signed last week .
on tuesday , those issues appeared to have been ironed out .
business cries foul schmidt still faces tremendous opposition from business lobbies , who are calling for cuts , not increases , in germany 's rising social welfare levies which are driving up the costs of labor .
industrial labor costs in germany are higher than in any other country and germany 's tax and social-welfare burden is one of the heaviest in the world .
when chancellor gerhard schröder took over from helmut kohl in 1998 after 16 years of conservative rule , the largely untouched labor market , health , pensions and school systems were crying out for reform .
the red-green coalition has been struggling with economic reform ever since , aiming to cut the combined costs of compulsory pension health , unemployment and disability insurance fees to under 40 percent of gross wages .
however , the figure is now at 40.4 per cent – and still rising fast .
recognizing the need for major reform , schröder 's coalition accompanied the percentage increase with the announcement that it was calling together a commission to recommend reforms . the recommendations are due out in fall 2003 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

germans are having less kids and living longer .
the news is bad for future retirees and a massive headache right now for the chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government . german workers will have to pay more into the state pension fund under a controversial agreement by chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government announced tuesday .
the hike , which will require workers and their employers to increase their contribution from 19.1 percent of their monthly earnings to 19.5 percent , faced heavy opposition from schröder 's coalition partners , the green party .
after a late-night monday negotiating session , schröder prevailed over his green partners , pushing a hike his party says the pension fund desperately needs .
round 3 billion euro will be missing from the pension fund , into which employees and their employers share monthly contributions , before the end of the year .
the deficit would mean current retirees at the very least would n't have gotten the annual pension payment increase legally guaranteed them this year .
the increase appears to assure them their money .
but critics say the government 's " first aid action " is like putting a bandaid on a gaping wound .
demographic time bomb like many other countries with similar pay-as-you-go state pension schemes , germany faces a demographic time bomb .
over the next 30 years the number of germans above the age of 60 is expected to increase 9.9 million , mainly due to low birth rates and higher life expectancies .
as a result , the number of workers shouldering the pension burden is expected to fall .
currently , a little more than two working germans support every german retiree .
in even 20 years time , that ratio will be 1:1 , according to commerzbank statistics . with the recent introduction of privately funded , state- supported pension schemes , the german government hoped to find a way of avoiding further cuts in state benefits and rises in state contributions .
as a result , the government promised the average pensioner 's benefits would not fall below 67 percent of the national wage on retirement , against the current 69 percent .
the catch was that the pensioner would have to contribute for at least 45 years , as opposed to the current average 37 years .
in addition , compulsory contributions to the pension scheme , now 19.1 percent , jointly paid by employer and employee , were not set to rise above 20 percent for the next 20 years .
" first aid action " but on saturday , germany 's health minister ulla schmidt disclosed plans to raise pension contributions to 19.5 percent in 2003 , saying she regarded this step as a kind of " first aid action " to make way for further and wider structural reforms .
with her proposals , which will be up for decision in the bundestag on thursday , schmidt hopes to cut costs in the welfare system by some 3.5 billion euro .
the proposal faced initial opposition from the greens who agreed on a percentage increase of only 0.2 percent in the government 's coalition agreement signed last week .
on tuesday , those issues appeared to have been ironed out .
business cries foul schmidt still faces tremendous opposition from business lobbies , who are calling for cuts , not increases , in germany 's rising social welfare levies which are driving up the costs of labor .
industrial labor costs in germany are higher than in any other country and germany 's tax and social-welfare burden is one of the heaviest in the world .
when chancellor gerhard schröder took over from helmut kohl in 1998 after 16 years of conservative rule , the largely untouched labor market , health , pensions and school systems were crying out for reform .
the red-green coalition has been struggling with economic reform ever since , aiming to cut the combined costs of compulsory pension health , unemployment and disability insurance fees to under 40 percent of gross wages .
however , the figure is now at 40.4 per cent – and still rising fast .
recognizing the need for major reform , schröder 's coalition accompanied the percentage increase with the announcement that it was calling together a commission to recommend reforms . the recommendations are due out in fall 2003 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

august hanning told a security conference in berlin that evidence suggests that the organization 's leadership continues to be capable of directing terrorist attacks against germany and the rest of the world .
the bnd chief has made previous claims stating that bin laden is not out of the picture yet and that al qaeda still proves to be a danger despite the destruction of its training camps during the us-led campaign in afghanistan .
bnd believes al qaeda leadership to be at large in a report last weekend in the german sunday newspaper , welt am sonntag , hanning said that the country ’ s intelligence service suspects bin laden and his deputy , ayman al-zawahiri , are hiding in the afghan-pakistani border area southeast of the capital kabul .

he operates in regions where access is very difficult .
he also changes his location .
that makes the situation very hard . "
the bnd believes that there are presently over 5,000 al qaeda and taliban fighters in afghanistan and pakistan and that the leadership-in-hiding is looking at " forming new structures . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd director august hanning says reports show increased terror communications .
hanning said that recent information received from collaborating intelligence organizations shows a recognizable increase in worldwide communications between members of the al-qaeda terrorist network in recent weeks and months .
" we see no all clear signal at this time .
rather , we are seeing an increase in -lrb- terrorist -rrb- activities . "
the bnd chief added that there was concern that this was a prelude to further terrorist attacks .
germany on increased alert after recorded warning german authorities have increased anti-terror precautions recently after a recorded message alleged to have been made by al-zawahiri mentioned germany in a warning to western powers .
in the recorded message , the voice says , " the mujahid youth has already sent messages to germany and france .
however , if these doses are not enough , we are prepared , with the help of allah , to inject further doses . "
attacks linked to al qaeda killed 11 german tourists visiting a synagogue in tunisia in april and the same number of french engineers as they traveled by bus in pakistan in may .
" when you look at past attacks , we must conclude that the fear of a new attack is very real ... an attack of greater dimensions , " said the bnd chief on german public television channel zdf after meeting with international security officials in berlin .

germans are having less kids and living longer .
the news is bad for future retirees and a massive headache right now for the chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government . german workers will have to pay more into the state pension fund under a controversial agreement by chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government announced tuesday .
the hike , which will require workers and their employers to increase their contribution from 19.1 percent of their monthly earnings to 19.5 percent , faced heavy opposition from schröder 's coalition partners , the green party .
after a late-night monday negotiating session , schröder prevailed over his green partners , pushing a hike his party says the pension fund desperately needs .
round 3 billion euro will be missing from the pension fund , into which employees and their employers share monthly contributions , before the end of the year .
the deficit would mean current retirees at the very least would n't have gotten the annual pension payment increase legally guaranteed them this year .
the increase appears to assure them their money .
but critics say the government 's " first aid action " is like putting a bandaid on a gaping wound .
demographic time bomb like many other countries with similar pay-as-you-go state pension schemes , germany faces a demographic time bomb .
over the next 30 years the number of germans above the age of 60 is expected to increase 9.9 million , mainly due to low birth rates and higher life expectancies .
as a result , the number of workers shouldering the pension burden is expected to fall .
currently , a little more than two working germans support every german retiree .
in even 20 years time , that ratio will be 1:1 , according to commerzbank statistics . with the recent introduction of privately funded , state- supported pension schemes , the german government hoped to find a way of avoiding further cuts in state benefits and rises in state contributions .
as a result , the government promised the average pensioner 's benefits would not fall below 67 percent of the national wage on retirement , against the current 69 percent .
the catch was that the pensioner would have to contribute for at least 45 years , as opposed to the current average 37 years .
in addition , compulsory contributions to the pension scheme , now 19.1 percent , jointly paid by employer and employee , were not set to rise above 20 percent for the next 20 years .
" first aid action " but on saturday , germany 's health minister ulla schmidt disclosed plans to raise pension contributions to 19.5 percent in 2003 , saying she regarded this step as a kind of " first aid action " to make way for further and wider structural reforms .
with her proposals , which will be up for decision in the bundestag on thursday , schmidt hopes to cut costs in the welfare system by some 3.5 billion euro .
the proposal faced initial opposition from the greens who agreed on a percentage increase of only 0.2 percent in the government 's coalition agreement signed last week .
on tuesday , those issues appeared to have been ironed out .
business cries foul schmidt still faces tremendous opposition from business lobbies , who are calling for cuts , not increases , in germany 's rising social welfare levies which are driving up the costs of labor .
industrial labor costs in germany are higher than in any other country and germany 's tax and social-welfare burden is one of the heaviest in the world .
when chancellor gerhard schröder took over from helmut kohl in 1998 after 16 years of conservative rule , the largely untouched labor market , health , pensions and school systems were crying out for reform .

names of potential successors to interim ceo helmut sihler at deutsche telekom have been reported widely on an often daily basis , accompanied often by loud denials on both sides .
a reported 20 potential successors , among them porsche head wendelin wiedeking , deutsche post chairman klaus zumwinkel and ulrich schumacher of chip-maker infineon , have so far turned down being considered for the job at the troubled telecommunication firm .
the lists have been widely criticized by both telekom chairman of the board hans-dietrich winkhaus and officials in the government .
but for different reasons .
winkhaus , who together with the 72-year-old sihler is heading the search , has called the media reports “ disruptive ” and defended telekom ’ s search .
“ you can ’ t do things more discretely , better and quicker than we have done them , ” said winkhaus .
the current candidate list is reportedly down to five , with a selection due most likely in december .
government reportedly unhappy recent reports suggest government officials think otherwise .
the weekly “ welt am sonntag ” newspaper reported that chancellor gerhard schröder had asked his economics minister to take personal responsibility for the search for a new chair , and that there was widespread dissatisfaction with the way winkhaus was handling the job .
members of schröder 's party told the newspaper that the government said the selection process was too chaotic .
the government , which has a 43 percent stake in telekom , and winkhaus have denied the report .
analyst robert vinall at dz bank in frankfurt said it ’ s only natural that schröder ’ s government should put pressure on winkhaus and sihler .
“ instrumental in getting ron sommer out was the key that there was going to be a smooth transition to the new head , ” he said in a dw-world interview .
sommer left the company in july after telekom amassed a 64 billion euro debt and the company ’ s stock dropped to an all time low .
sihler , the former chairman of a chemicals company , quickly took over .
he announced a strict and unpopular savings course that , among other things , would cut the 255,000-strong workforce by 50,000 jobs .
he also said he would be leaving in january to make way for a younger chairman .
“ a very tough job ahead of him ” now the pressure is on and the list of replacements reportedly down to five candidates .
the next chairman will have a mammoth responsibility in front of him .
saddled with a heavy debt and facing job cuts , telekom looks to be a tough assignment .
sihler has already cut the advertising budget and plans to do the same to the travel budget , according to reports .
a complete list of measures will be unveiled at a meeting on nov .
14 when telekom presents the results of a strategic review .
the new ceo should be in place a month after that .
“ i think it ’ s fairly likely that a lot of the unpopular decisions will have been announced by then , ” said vinall .
the burden then comes to this new person to push through the decisions and i think the new person will have a very tough job ahead of him . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prices climbing at deutsche telekom deutsche telekom is raising prices on cable access as it rushes to sell off its cable tv business .

the german police are making the most of telecommunication technology in the fight against crime by utilising the text messaging phenomenon to track and catch criminals .
in a pilot project organised by the federal office of criminal investigation , bundeskriminalamt -lrb- bka -rrb- , regional police in ten german cities will be providing information on wrong doers and missing persons via sms text messaging available on mobile phones .
five month trial will cover major cities across germany the five-month trial period began on monday in the central german city of wiesbaden and the northwestern city of bochum .
the project will spread out over a further eight locations in other regions of the country in the coming weeks , ending its initial testing in march 2003 .
in each location , the police will contact between 50 and 100 selected individuals who have provided their numbers for the project .
detailed information on criminals straight to your phone suspect descriptions of wanted miscreants , vehicle information such as licence plate numbers and missing person details will be sent out to the phones of people working every day in close proximity to the public .
for the trial run , police are using public transit employees , taxi drivers , driving instructors and city workers .

august hanning told a security conference in berlin that evidence suggests that the organization 's leadership continues to be capable of directing terrorist attacks against germany and the rest of the world .
the bnd chief has made previous claims stating that bin laden is not out of the picture yet and that al qaeda still proves to be a danger despite the destruction of its training camps during the us-led campaign in afghanistan .
bnd believes al qaeda leadership to be at large in a report last weekend in the german sunday newspaper , welt am sonntag , hanning said that the country ’ s intelligence service suspects bin laden and his deputy , ayman al-zawahiri , are hiding in the afghan-pakistani border area southeast of the capital kabul .
in a speech to a security gathering in berlin on monday , hanning reiterated his claims , saying : " -lrb- bin laden -rrb- has numerous helpers .
he operates in regions where access is very difficult .
he also changes his location .
that makes the situation very hard . "
the bnd believes that there are presently over 5,000 al qaeda and taliban fighters in afghanistan and pakistan and that the leadership-in-hiding is looking at " forming new structures . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd director august hanning says reports show increased terror communications .
hanning said that recent information received from collaborating intelligence organizations shows a recognizable increase in worldwide communications between members of the al-qaeda terrorist network in recent weeks and months .
" we see no all clear signal at this time .
rather , we are seeing an increase in -lrb- terrorist -rrb- activities . "
the bnd chief added that there was concern that this was a prelude to further terrorist attacks .
germany on increased alert after recorded warning german authorities have increased anti-terror precautions recently after a recorded message alleged to have been made by al-zawahiri mentioned germany in a warning to western powers .
in the recorded message , the voice says , " the mujahid youth has already sent messages to germany and france .
however , if these doses are not enough , we are prepared , with the help of allah , to inject further doses . "
attacks linked to al qaeda killed 11 german tourists visiting a synagogue in tunisia in april and the same number of french engineers as they traveled by bus in pakistan in may .
" when you look at past attacks , we must conclude that the fear of a new attack is very real ... an attack of greater dimensions , " said the bnd chief on german public television channel zdf after meeting with international security officials in berlin .
however , hanning added that bin laden probably " has the activities planned but they are not yet functional . "
active european terror cells still an al qaeda objective hanning believes that the terrorist organization is still actively recruiting in europe and that cells , like the one discovered in hamburg accused of the september 11th attacks , are still a potential threat .
" we see that recruiting is going on , " he said .
" we have european centers that are still being used for recruiting today . "
hanning added that the risk that al qaeda still had the power to carry out attacks in the arab world and europe " remains relatively high . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany the past year has been an illuminating one for german anti-terrorism investigators .

germans are having less kids and living longer .
the news is bad for future retirees and a massive headache right now for the chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government . german workers will have to pay more into the state pension fund under a controversial agreement by chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government announced tuesday .
the hike , which will require workers and their employers to increase their contribution from 19.1 percent of their monthly earnings to 19.5 percent , faced heavy opposition from schröder 's coalition partners , the green party .
after a late-night monday negotiating session , schröder prevailed over his green partners , pushing a hike his party says the pension fund desperately needs .
round 3 billion euro will be missing from the pension fund , into which employees and their employers share monthly contributions , before the end of the year .
the deficit would mean current retirees at the very least would n't have gotten the annual pension payment increase legally guaranteed them this year .
the increase appears to assure them their money .
but critics say the government 's " first aid action " is like putting a bandaid on a gaping wound .
demographic time bomb like many other countries with similar pay-as-you-go state pension schemes , germany faces a demographic time bomb .
over the next 30 years the number of germans above the age of 60 is expected to increase 9.9 million , mainly due to low birth rates and higher life expectancies .
as a result , the number of workers shouldering the pension burden is expected to fall .
currently , a little more than two working germans support every german retiree .
in even 20 years time , that ratio will be 1:1 , according to commerzbank statistics . with the recent introduction of privately funded , state- supported pension schemes , the german government hoped to find a way of avoiding further cuts in state benefits and rises in state contributions .
as a result , the government promised the average pensioner 's benefits would not fall below 67 percent of the national wage on retirement , against the current 69 percent .
the catch was that the pensioner would have to contribute for at least 45 years , as opposed to the current average 37 years .
in addition , compulsory contributions to the pension scheme , now 19.1 percent , jointly paid by employer and employee , were not set to rise above 20 percent for the next 20 years .
" first aid action " but on saturday , germany 's health minister ulla schmidt disclosed plans to raise pension contributions to 19.5 percent in 2003 , saying she regarded this step as a kind of " first aid action " to make way for further and wider structural reforms .
with her proposals , which will be up for decision in the bundestag on thursday , schmidt hopes to cut costs in the welfare system by some 3.5 billion euro .
the proposal faced initial opposition from the greens who agreed on a percentage increase of only 0.2 percent in the government 's coalition agreement signed last week .
on tuesday , those issues appeared to have been ironed out .
business cries foul schmidt still faces tremendous opposition from business lobbies , who are calling for cuts , not increases , in germany 's rising social welfare levies which are driving up the costs of labor .
industrial labor costs in germany are higher than in any other country and germany 's tax and social-welfare burden is one of the heaviest in the world .
when chancellor gerhard schröder took over from helmut kohl in 1998 after 16 years of conservative rule , the largely untouched labor market , health , pensions and school systems were crying out for reform .
the red-green coalition has been struggling with economic reform ever since , aiming to cut the combined costs of compulsory pension health , unemployment and disability insurance fees to under 40 percent of gross wages .
however , the figure is now at 40.4 per cent – and still rising fast .
recognizing the need for major reform , schröder 's coalition accompanied the percentage increase with the announcement that it was calling together a commission to recommend reforms . the recommendations are due out in fall 2003 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

germans are having less kids and living longer .
the news is bad for future retirees and a massive headache right now for the chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government . german workers will have to pay more into the state pension fund under a controversial agreement by chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government announced tuesday .
the hike , which will require workers and their employers to increase their contribution from 19.1 percent of their monthly earnings to 19.5 percent , faced heavy opposition from schröder 's coalition partners , the green party .
after a late-night monday negotiating session , schröder prevailed over his green partners , pushing a hike his party says the pension fund desperately needs .
round 3 billion euro will be missing from the pension fund , into which employees and their employers share monthly contributions , before the end of the year .
the deficit would mean current retirees at the very least would n't have gotten the annual pension payment increase legally guaranteed them this year .
the increase appears to assure them their money .
but critics say the government 's " first aid action " is like putting a bandaid on a gaping wound .
demographic time bomb like many other countries with similar pay-as-you-go state pension schemes , germany faces a demographic time bomb .
over the next 30 years the number of germans above the age of 60 is expected to increase 9.9 million , mainly due to low birth rates and higher life expectancies .
as a result , the number of workers shouldering the pension burden is expected to fall .
currently , a little more than two working germans support every german retiree .
in even 20 years time , that ratio will be 1:1 , according to commerzbank statistics . with the recent introduction of privately funded , state- supported pension schemes , the german government hoped to find a way of avoiding further cuts in state benefits and rises in state contributions .
as a result , the government promised the average pensioner 's benefits would not fall below 67 percent of the national wage on retirement , against the current 69 percent .
the catch was that the pensioner would have to contribute for at least 45 years , as opposed to the current average 37 years .
in addition , compulsory contributions to the pension scheme , now 19.1 percent , jointly paid by employer and employee , were not set to rise above 20 percent for the next 20 years .
" first aid action " but on saturday , germany 's health minister ulla schmidt disclosed plans to raise pension contributions to 19.5 percent in 2003 , saying she regarded this step as a kind of " first aid action " to make way for further and wider structural reforms .
with her proposals , which will be up for decision in the bundestag on thursday , schmidt hopes to cut costs in the welfare system by some 3.5 billion euro .
the proposal faced initial opposition from the greens who agreed on a percentage increase of only 0.2 percent in the government 's coalition agreement signed last week .
on tuesday , those issues appeared to have been ironed out .
business cries foul schmidt still faces tremendous opposition from business lobbies , who are calling for cuts , not increases , in germany 's rising social welfare levies which are driving up the costs of labor .
industrial labor costs in germany are higher than in any other country and germany 's tax and social-welfare burden is one of the heaviest in the world .
when chancellor gerhard schröder took over from helmut kohl in 1998 after 16 years of conservative rule , the largely untouched labor market , health , pensions and school systems were crying out for reform .
the red-green coalition has been struggling with economic reform ever since , aiming to cut the combined costs of compulsory pension health , unemployment and disability insurance fees to under 40 percent of gross wages .
however , the figure is now at 40.4 per cent – and still rising fast .

initial results gave the party 34 percent of the vote , allowing the akp to form a single government with 360 seats in the 550-seat national assembly the election victory means that the party , with deep islamic roots , will get the chance to live up to the promises it made regarding the pursuit of eu membership for turkey .
the akp made joining the european union a priority throughout the election campaign .
although describing itself as ' moderate ' with political leanings towards ' conservative democrat , ' the akp has caused some concerns within turkey and elsewhere due to its political background .
the party was formed a year ago by members of previously banned islamist groups , and its leader reccep tayyip erdogan is currently banned from the country 's national assembly and therefore can not be named prime minister .
erdogan was banned from holding an office in the country ’ s parliament because he recited a religious poem in public three years ago that was construed to stir up inter-racial hatred .
turkey and the eu despite the victory of a pro-eu party , the european union is still not completely convinced that turkey can be considered a candidate for enlargement .
the turkish parliament passed new laws to conform to european norms in august this year .
it also abolished the death penalty and extended cultural rights to the country 's kurdish minority .
however , a recent amnesty international report to the eu suggests that systematic torture and human rights abuses are still rife in turkish jails despite the reforms .
in its regular progress report , the european commission said , " the reforms contain a number of significant limitations on the full enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedom , " and added turkey had yet to meet the political agenda to start negotiations .
despite increased pressure from washington to give nato 's only muslim member an accession date , eu leaders are likely to wait until december to make their final decision .
it seems that the european union itself has little cause for concern as the akp continues to voice pro-european support .
britain welcomed the election result and has called for a date to be set to discuss turkey 's accession .
so too has greece , which believes that its problems with its neighbor over the divided island of cyprus , will be better addressed from within the eu .
german reactions the most important european player with regards to turkey ’ s entrance in the eu is germany .
historically the germans have been among the most cautious about turkey 's membership , but in the last few weeks many politicians have warmed up to the idea .
the social democratic-led government has recently come out in favor of turkey joining the eu , and on monday a spokesperson in the office of foreign affairs called the election results the " first positive signal " in the formation of a stable government .
“ we hope , that the traditionally close and friendly ties between germany and turkey will improve ” with the new government , the speaker told reporters .
on nov .
27 the turkish president ahmet necdet sezer , is scheduled to meet with chancellor gerhard schröder to discuss entry into the eu .
the conservative opposition parties in the bundestag , however , remain skeptical .
angela merkel , party leader for the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said on monday that turkey ’ s membership in the eu is “ not on the agenda . ”
the cdu is also not in favor of using the eu summit in copenhagen in december as a forum for discussing a concrete date for turkey ’ s entrance , merkel said .
edmund stoiber , state premier for bavaria is adamantly against extending eu membership to turkey .
on monday he told reporters that turkey is “ politically and economically still far away from meeting the requirements for entrance in the eu . ”
islamist party on europe ’ s edge european reactions to the election result from barely disguised nervousness over the rise to power of a party formed by the deputies of an outlawed islamist organization .
observers believe that a party with islamic roots could lead to instability and tensions in the region with pro-islamist members within the akp becoming dissatisfied with the non-confrontational attitude adopted by leaders such as erdogan .
however , despite allegations to the contrary , the akp has consistently denied that its politics are based on an islamist agenda .
on sunday night , erdogan , having promised voters during the campaign that he had turned his back on his islamist past , moved swiftly to reassure the country that his party would accelerate turkey 's efforts to join the eu .
" akp is ready to take responsibility to build up the political will to accelerate the european union entry process , to strengthen the integration of our economy with the world economy and to implement the economic program , " he said in a public address .
in a bid to allay international fears , the vice-chairman of the akp , yasar yakis , also released a statement promising to speed up work on meeting the criteria for eu membership ahead of the crucial european summit in copenhagen next month .
yakis reiterated the party 's desire to look west .
the former turkish ambassador to the united nations told the british daily " the guardian , " " our first priority in government will be to complete the framework document for the copenhagen criteria .

historically the germans have been among the most cautious about turkey 's membership , but in the last few weeks many politicians have warmed up to the idea .
the social democratic-led government has recently come out in favor of turkey joining the eu , and on monday a spokesperson in the office of foreign affairs called the election results the " first positive signal " in the formation of a stable government .
“ we hope , that the traditionally close and friendly ties between germany and turkey will improve ” with the new government , the speaker told reporters .
on nov .

the conservative opposition parties in the bundestag , however , remain skeptical .
angela merkel , party leader for the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said on monday that turkey ’ s membership in the eu is “ not on the agenda . ”
the cdu is also not in favor of using the eu summit in copenhagen in december as a forum for discussing a concrete date for turkey ’ s entrance , merkel said .
edmund stoiber , state premier for bavaria is adamantly against extending eu membership to turkey .
on monday he told reporters that turkey is “ politically and economically still far away from meeting the requirements for entrance in the eu . ”
islamist party on europe ’ s edge european reactions to the election result from barely disguised nervousness over the rise to power of a party formed by the deputies of an outlawed islamist organization .
observers believe that a party with islamic roots could lead to instability and tensions in the region with pro-islamist members within the akp becoming dissatisfied with the non-confrontational attitude adopted by leaders such as erdogan .
however , despite allegations to the contrary , the akp has consistently denied that its politics are based on an islamist agenda .
on sunday night , erdogan , having promised voters during the campaign that he had turned his back on his islamist past , moved swiftly to reassure the country that his party would accelerate turkey 's efforts to join the eu .
" akp is ready to take responsibility to build up the political will to accelerate the european union entry process , to strengthen the integration of our economy with the world economy and to implement the economic program , " he said in a public address .
in a bid to allay international fears , the vice-chairman of the akp , yasar yakis , also released a statement promising to speed up work on meeting the criteria for eu membership ahead of the crucial european summit in copenhagen next month .
yakis reiterated the party 's desire to look west .

initial results gave the party 34 percent of the vote , allowing the akp to form a single government with 360 seats in the 550-seat national assembly the election victory means that the party , with deep islamic roots , will get the chance to live up to the promises it made regarding the pursuit of eu membership for turkey .
the akp made joining the european union a priority throughout the election campaign .
although describing itself as ' moderate ' with political leanings towards ' conservative democrat , ' the akp has caused some concerns within turkey and elsewhere due to its political background .
the party was formed a year ago by members of previously banned islamist groups , and its leader reccep tayyip erdogan is currently banned from the country 's national assembly and therefore can not be named prime minister .
erdogan was banned from holding an office in the country ’ s parliament because he recited a religious poem in public three years ago that was construed to stir up inter-racial hatred .
turkey and the eu despite the victory of a pro-eu party , the european union is still not completely convinced that turkey can be considered a candidate for enlargement .
the turkish parliament passed new laws to conform to european norms in august this year .
it also abolished the death penalty and extended cultural rights to the country 's kurdish minority .
however , a recent amnesty international report to the eu suggests that systematic torture and human rights abuses are still rife in turkish jails despite the reforms .
in its regular progress report , the european commission said , " the reforms contain a number of significant limitations on the full enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedom , " and added turkey had yet to meet the political agenda to start negotiations .
despite increased pressure from washington to give nato 's only muslim member an accession date , eu leaders are likely to wait until december to make their final decision .
it seems that the european union itself has little cause for concern as the akp continues to voice pro-european support .
britain welcomed the election result and has called for a date to be set to discuss turkey 's accession .
so too has greece , which believes that its problems with its neighbor over the divided island of cyprus , will be better addressed from within the eu .

august hanning told a security conference in berlin that evidence suggests that the organization 's leadership continues to be capable of directing terrorist attacks against germany and the rest of the world .
the bnd chief has made previous claims stating that bin laden is not out of the picture yet and that al qaeda still proves to be a danger despite the destruction of its training camps during the us-led campaign in afghanistan .
bnd believes al qaeda leadership to be at large in a report last weekend in the german sunday newspaper , welt am sonntag , hanning said that the country ’ s intelligence service suspects bin laden and his deputy , ayman al-zawahiri , are hiding in the afghan-pakistani border area southeast of the capital kabul .
in a speech to a security gathering in berlin on monday , hanning reiterated his claims , saying : " -lrb- bin laden -rrb- has numerous helpers .
he operates in regions where access is very difficult .
he also changes his location .
that makes the situation very hard . "
the bnd believes that there are presently over 5,000 al qaeda and taliban fighters in afghanistan and pakistan and that the leadership-in-hiding is looking at " forming new structures . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd director august hanning says reports show increased terror communications .
hanning said that recent information received from collaborating intelligence organizations shows a recognizable increase in worldwide communications between members of the al-qaeda terrorist network in recent weeks and months .
" we see no all clear signal at this time .
rather , we are seeing an increase in -lrb- terrorist -rrb- activities . "
the bnd chief added that there was concern that this was a prelude to further terrorist attacks .
germany on increased alert after recorded warning german authorities have increased anti-terror precautions recently after a recorded message alleged to have been made by al-zawahiri mentioned germany in a warning to western powers .
in the recorded message , the voice says , " the mujahid youth has already sent messages to germany and france .
however , if these doses are not enough , we are prepared , with the help of allah , to inject further doses . "
attacks linked to al qaeda killed 11 german tourists visiting a synagogue in tunisia in april and the same number of french engineers as they traveled by bus in pakistan in may .
" when you look at past attacks , we must conclude that the fear of a new attack is very real ... an attack of greater dimensions , " said the bnd chief on german public television channel zdf after meeting with international security officials in berlin .
however , hanning added that bin laden probably " has the activities planned but they are not yet functional . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.11.2002 terrorist threat remains says germany 's top spy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still at large and still a threat , according to the german intelligence service the head of the germany 's federal intelligence service , august hanning , believes that al qaeda leader osama bin laden is still alive and poses a continuing threat , according to recent espionage reports . the director of germany 's federal intelligence service , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- said on monday that intelligence gathered by western intelligence agencies indicates that osama bin laden is probably still alive .
august hanning told a security conference in berlin that evidence suggests that the organization 's leadership continues to be capable of directing terrorist attacks against germany and the rest of the world .
the bnd chief has made previous claims stating that bin laden is not out of the picture yet and that al qaeda still proves to be a danger despite the destruction of its training camps during the us-led campaign in afghanistan .
bnd believes al qaeda leadership to be at large in a report last weekend in the german sunday newspaper , welt am sonntag , hanning said that the country ’ s intelligence service suspects bin laden and his deputy , ayman al-zawahiri , are hiding in the afghan-pakistani border area southeast of the capital kabul .
in a speech to a security gathering in berlin on monday , hanning reiterated his claims , saying : " -lrb- bin laden -rrb- has numerous helpers .
he operates in regions where access is very difficult .
he also changes his location .
that makes the situation very hard . "
the bnd believes that there are presently over 5,000 al qaeda and taliban fighters in afghanistan and pakistan and that the leadership-in-hiding is looking at " forming new structures . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd director august hanning says reports show increased terror communications .
hanning said that recent information received from collaborating intelligence organizations shows a recognizable increase in worldwide communications between members of the al-qaeda terrorist network in recent weeks and months .
" we see no all clear signal at this time .
rather , we are seeing an increase in -lrb- terrorist -rrb- activities . "
the bnd chief added that there was concern that this was a prelude to further terrorist attacks .
germany on increased alert after recorded warning german authorities have increased anti-terror precautions recently after a recorded message alleged to have been made by al-zawahiri mentioned germany in a warning to western powers .
in the recorded message , the voice says , " the mujahid youth has already sent messages to germany and france .
however , if these doses are not enough , we are prepared , with the help of allah , to inject further doses . "
attacks linked to al qaeda killed 11 german tourists visiting a synagogue in tunisia in april and the same number of french engineers as they traveled by bus in pakistan in may .
" when you look at past attacks , we must conclude that the fear of a new attack is very real ... an attack of greater dimensions , " said the bnd chief on german public television channel zdf after meeting with international security officials in berlin .
however , hanning added that bin laden probably " has the activities planned but they are not yet functional . "
active european terror cells still an al qaeda objective hanning believes that the terrorist organization is still actively recruiting in europe and that cells , like the one discovered in hamburg accused of the september 11th attacks , are still a potential threat .
" we see that recruiting is going on , " he said .

initial results gave the party 34 percent of the vote , allowing the akp to form a single government with 360 seats in the 550-seat national assembly the election victory means that the party , with deep islamic roots , will get the chance to live up to the promises it made regarding the pursuit of eu membership for turkey .
the akp made joining the european union a priority throughout the election campaign .
although describing itself as ' moderate ' with political leanings towards ' conservative democrat , ' the akp has caused some concerns within turkey and elsewhere due to its political background .
the party was formed a year ago by members of previously banned islamist groups , and its leader reccep tayyip erdogan is currently banned from the country 's national assembly and therefore can not be named prime minister .
erdogan was banned from holding an office in the country ’ s parliament because he recited a religious poem in public three years ago that was construed to stir up inter-racial hatred .
turkey and the eu despite the victory of a pro-eu party , the european union is still not completely convinced that turkey can be considered a candidate for enlargement .
the turkish parliament passed new laws to conform to european norms in august this year .
it also abolished the death penalty and extended cultural rights to the country 's kurdish minority .
however , a recent amnesty international report to the eu suggests that systematic torture and human rights abuses are still rife in turkish jails despite the reforms .
in its regular progress report , the european commission said , " the reforms contain a number of significant limitations on the full enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedom , " and added turkey had yet to meet the political agenda to start negotiations .
despite increased pressure from washington to give nato 's only muslim member an accession date , eu leaders are likely to wait until december to make their final decision .
it seems that the european union itself has little cause for concern as the akp continues to voice pro-european support .
britain welcomed the election result and has called for a date to be set to discuss turkey 's accession .
so too has greece , which believes that its problems with its neighbor over the divided island of cyprus , will be better addressed from within the eu .
german reactions the most important european player with regards to turkey ’ s entrance in the eu is germany .
historically the germans have been among the most cautious about turkey 's membership , but in the last few weeks many politicians have warmed up to the idea .
the social democratic-led government has recently come out in favor of turkey joining the eu , and on monday a spokesperson in the office of foreign affairs called the election results the " first positive signal " in the formation of a stable government .
“ we hope , that the traditionally close and friendly ties between germany and turkey will improve ” with the new government , the speaker told reporters .
on nov .
27 the turkish president ahmet necdet sezer , is scheduled to meet with chancellor gerhard schröder to discuss entry into the eu .
the conservative opposition parties in the bundestag , however , remain skeptical .
angela merkel , party leader for the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said on monday that turkey ’ s membership in the eu is “ not on the agenda . ”
the cdu is also not in favor of using the eu summit in copenhagen in december as a forum for discussing a concrete date for turkey ’ s entrance , merkel said .
edmund stoiber , state premier for bavaria is adamantly against extending eu membership to turkey .
on monday he told reporters that turkey is “ politically and economically still far away from meeting the requirements for entrance in the eu . ”
islamist party on europe ’ s edge european reactions to the election result from barely disguised nervousness over the rise to power of a party formed by the deputies of an outlawed islamist organization .
observers believe that a party with islamic roots could lead to instability and tensions in the region with pro-islamist members within the akp becoming dissatisfied with the non-confrontational attitude adopted by leaders such as erdogan .
however , despite allegations to the contrary , the akp has consistently denied that its politics are based on an islamist agenda .
on sunday night , erdogan , having promised voters during the campaign that he had turned his back on his islamist past , moved swiftly to reassure the country that his party would accelerate turkey 's efforts to join the eu .
" akp is ready to take responsibility to build up the political will to accelerate the european union entry process , to strengthen the integration of our economy with the world economy and to implement the economic program , " he said in a public address .
in a bid to allay international fears , the vice-chairman of the akp , yasar yakis , also released a statement promising to speed up work on meeting the criteria for eu membership ahead of the crucial european summit in copenhagen next month .
yakis reiterated the party 's desire to look west .
the former turkish ambassador to the united nations told the british daily " the guardian , " " our first priority in government will be to complete the framework document for the copenhagen criteria .

names of potential successors to interim ceo helmut sihler at deutsche telekom have been reported widely on an often daily basis , accompanied often by loud denials on both sides .
a reported 20 potential successors , among them porsche head wendelin wiedeking , deutsche post chairman klaus zumwinkel and ulrich schumacher of chip-maker infineon , have so far turned down being considered for the job at the troubled telecommunication firm .
the lists have been widely criticized by both telekom chairman of the board hans-dietrich winkhaus and officials in the government .
but for different reasons .
winkhaus , who together with the 72-year-old sihler is heading the search , has called the media reports “ disruptive ” and defended telekom ’ s search .
“ you can ’ t do things more discretely , better and quicker than we have done them , ” said winkhaus .
the current candidate list is reportedly down to five , with a selection due most likely in december .
government reportedly unhappy recent reports suggest government officials think otherwise .
the weekly “ welt am sonntag ” newspaper reported that chancellor gerhard schröder had asked his economics minister to take personal responsibility for the search for a new chair , and that there was widespread dissatisfaction with the way winkhaus was handling the job .
members of schröder 's party told the newspaper that the government said the selection process was too chaotic .
the government , which has a 43 percent stake in telekom , and winkhaus have denied the report .
analyst robert vinall at dz bank in frankfurt said it ’ s only natural that schröder ’ s government should put pressure on winkhaus and sihler .
“ instrumental in getting ron sommer out was the key that there was going to be a smooth transition to the new head , ” he said in a dw-world interview .
sommer left the company in july after telekom amassed a 64 billion euro debt and the company ’ s stock dropped to an all time low .
sihler , the former chairman of a chemicals company , quickly took over .
he announced a strict and unpopular savings course that , among other things , would cut the 255,000-strong workforce by 50,000 jobs .
he also said he would be leaving in january to make way for a younger chairman .
“ a very tough job ahead of him ” now the pressure is on and the list of replacements reportedly down to five candidates .
the next chairman will have a mammoth responsibility in front of him .
saddled with a heavy debt and facing job cuts , telekom looks to be a tough assignment .
sihler has already cut the advertising budget and plans to do the same to the travel budget , according to reports .
a complete list of measures will be unveiled at a meeting on nov .
14 when telekom presents the results of a strategic review .
the new ceo should be in place a month after that .
“ i think it ’ s fairly likely that a lot of the unpopular decisions will have been announced by then , ” said vinall .
the burden then comes to this new person to push through the decisions and i think the new person will have a very tough job ahead of him . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prices climbing at deutsche telekom deutsche telekom is raising prices on cable access as it rushes to sell off its cable tv business .

names of potential successors to interim ceo helmut sihler at deutsche telekom have been reported widely on an often daily basis , accompanied often by loud denials on both sides .
a reported 20 potential successors , among them porsche head wendelin wiedeking , deutsche post chairman klaus zumwinkel and ulrich schumacher of chip-maker infineon , have so far turned down being considered for the job at the troubled telecommunication firm .
the lists have been widely criticized by both telekom chairman of the board hans-dietrich winkhaus and officials in the government .
but for different reasons .
winkhaus , who together with the 72-year-old sihler is heading the search , has called the media reports “ disruptive ” and defended telekom ’ s search .
“ you can ’ t do things more discretely , better and quicker than we have done them , ” said winkhaus .
the current candidate list is reportedly down to five , with a selection due most likely in december .
government reportedly unhappy recent reports suggest government officials think otherwise .
the weekly “ welt am sonntag ” newspaper reported that chancellor gerhard schröder had asked his economics minister to take personal responsibility for the search for a new chair , and that there was widespread dissatisfaction with the way winkhaus was handling the job .
members of schröder 's party told the newspaper that the government said the selection process was too chaotic .
the government , which has a 43 percent stake in telekom , and winkhaus have denied the report .
analyst robert vinall at dz bank in frankfurt said it ’ s only natural that schröder ’ s government should put pressure on winkhaus and sihler .
“ instrumental in getting ron sommer out was the key that there was going to be a smooth transition to the new head , ” he said in a dw-world interview .
sommer left the company in july after telekom amassed a 64 billion euro debt and the company ’ s stock dropped to an all time low .
sihler , the former chairman of a chemicals company , quickly took over .
he announced a strict and unpopular savings course that , among other things , would cut the 255,000-strong workforce by 50,000 jobs .
he also said he would be leaving in january to make way for a younger chairman .
“ a very tough job ahead of him ” now the pressure is on and the list of replacements reportedly down to five candidates .

germans are having less kids and living longer .
the news is bad for future retirees and a massive headache right now for the chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government . german workers will have to pay more into the state pension fund under a controversial agreement by chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government announced tuesday .
the hike , which will require workers and their employers to increase their contribution from 19.1 percent of their monthly earnings to 19.5 percent , faced heavy opposition from schröder 's coalition partners , the green party .
after a late-night monday negotiating session , schröder prevailed over his green partners , pushing a hike his party says the pension fund desperately needs .
round 3 billion euro will be missing from the pension fund , into which employees and their employers share monthly contributions , before the end of the year .
the deficit would mean current retirees at the very least would n't have gotten the annual pension payment increase legally guaranteed them this year .
the increase appears to assure them their money .
but critics say the government 's " first aid action " is like putting a bandaid on a gaping wound .
demographic time bomb like many other countries with similar pay-as-you-go state pension schemes , germany faces a demographic time bomb .
over the next 30 years the number of germans above the age of 60 is expected to increase 9.9 million , mainly due to low birth rates and higher life expectancies .
as a result , the number of workers shouldering the pension burden is expected to fall .
currently , a little more than two working germans support every german retiree .
in even 20 years time , that ratio will be 1:1 , according to commerzbank statistics . with the recent introduction of privately funded , state- supported pension schemes , the german government hoped to find a way of avoiding further cuts in state benefits and rises in state contributions .
as a result , the government promised the average pensioner 's benefits would not fall below 67 percent of the national wage on retirement , against the current 69 percent .
the catch was that the pensioner would have to contribute for at least 45 years , as opposed to the current average 37 years .
in addition , compulsory contributions to the pension scheme , now 19.1 percent , jointly paid by employer and employee , were not set to rise above 20 percent for the next 20 years .
" first aid action " but on saturday , germany 's health minister ulla schmidt disclosed plans to raise pension contributions to 19.5 percent in 2003 , saying she regarded this step as a kind of " first aid action " to make way for further and wider structural reforms .
with her proposals , which will be up for decision in the bundestag on thursday , schmidt hopes to cut costs in the welfare system by some 3.5 billion euro .
the proposal faced initial opposition from the greens who agreed on a percentage increase of only 0.2 percent in the government 's coalition agreement signed last week .
on tuesday , those issues appeared to have been ironed out .
business cries foul schmidt still faces tremendous opposition from business lobbies , who are calling for cuts , not increases , in germany 's rising social welfare levies which are driving up the costs of labor .
industrial labor costs in germany are higher than in any other country and germany 's tax and social-welfare burden is one of the heaviest in the world .
when chancellor gerhard schröder took over from helmut kohl in 1998 after 16 years of conservative rule , the largely untouched labor market , health , pensions and school systems were crying out for reform .
the red-green coalition has been struggling with economic reform ever since , aiming to cut the combined costs of compulsory pension health , unemployment and disability insurance fees to under 40 percent of gross wages .
however , the figure is now at 40.4 per cent – and still rising fast .
recognizing the need for major reform , schröder 's coalition accompanied the percentage increase with the announcement that it was calling together a commission to recommend reforms . the recommendations are due out in fall 2003 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

in even 20 years time , that ratio will be 1:1 , according to commerzbank statistics . with the recent introduction of privately funded , state- supported pension schemes , the german government hoped to find a way of avoiding further cuts in state benefits and rises in state contributions .
as a result , the government promised the average pensioner 's benefits would not fall below 67 percent of the national wage on retirement , against the current 69 percent .
the catch was that the pensioner would have to contribute for at least 45 years , as opposed to the current average 37 years .
in addition , compulsory contributions to the pension scheme , now 19.1 percent , jointly paid by employer and employee , were not set to rise above 20 percent for the next 20 years .
" first aid action " but on saturday , germany 's health minister ulla schmidt disclosed plans to raise pension contributions to 19.5 percent in 2003 , saying she regarded this step as a kind of " first aid action " to make way for further and wider structural reforms .
with her proposals , which will be up for decision in the bundestag on thursday , schmidt hopes to cut costs in the welfare system by some 3.5 billion euro .
the proposal faced initial opposition from the greens who agreed on a percentage increase of only 0.2 percent in the government 's coalition agreement signed last week .
on tuesday , those issues appeared to have been ironed out .
business cries foul schmidt still faces tremendous opposition from business lobbies , who are calling for cuts , not increases , in germany 's rising social welfare levies which are driving up the costs of labor .
industrial labor costs in germany are higher than in any other country and germany 's tax and social-welfare burden is one of the heaviest in the world .
when chancellor gerhard schröder took over from helmut kohl in 1998 after 16 years of conservative rule , the largely untouched labor market , health , pensions and school systems were crying out for reform .
the red-green coalition has been struggling with economic reform ever since , aiming to cut the combined costs of compulsory pension health , unemployment and disability insurance fees to under 40 percent of gross wages .
however , the figure is now at 40.4 per cent – and still rising fast .
recognizing the need for major reform , schröder 's coalition accompanied the percentage increase with the announcement that it was calling together a commission to recommend reforms . the recommendations are due out in fall 2003 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the jury at bristol crown court took almost three days to deliver their verdict on mark hampson , from taffs well , near cardiff , who had denied killing the 26-year-old shipping clerk just before christmas in 1990 .
hampson : in prison when dna tested hampson showed little emotion as the verdict was read out while ms palk 's family broke down and comforted each other .
the judge mrs justice hallett described hampson as " vicious and violent man who 'd not the slightest hint of remorse " .
hampson 's conviction ends almost 12 years of police investigations into one of the most baffling murders in south wales .
the court heard he had started his criminal career before he was a teenager and has spent a total of 15 years in prison .
he was arrested last summer on release from dartmoor prison where he had been serving a four year sentence for violent crime .
ms palk had spent the evening of 21 december 1990 with friends at an office party in the city centre , but never returned home .
when her body was found the following morning , just yards from her home in fairwater , it was discovered she had been raped and stabbed repeatedly .
patrick harrington qc , prosecuting , had told the court that carpet fitter hampson had threatened ms palk with a knife and forced her to walk to nearby playing fields where he made her strip .
" he then sexually assaulted her and murdered her in a frenzied attack , stabbing and slashing her body more than 80 times , " he said .
the jury was told how people living around the playing fields heard " a horrible , single , female scream " .
mr harrington said wounds to her hands showed she had tried to fight off her attacker , but it was thought she had died a short time after she was struck on the head .
the body was found near fairwater leisure centre her body had then been dragged from the centre of the field - where the attack took place - to a stream near fairwater leisure centre where a 11-year-old boy found it the following day .
" she had been the subject of a brutal , punishing and sustained attack .
there were a number of grotesque features of that fatal killing , " he said .
the prosecution said hampson had lied about how his semen stain was found on the victim , after the defendant claimed he had a casual sexual encounter with a woman on the night of the murder .
mr harrington also said the defendant had lied about a bite wound to his genitalia , which had been treated at cardiff royal infirmary .
hampson had told hospital staff his wife had inflicted the injury , but he was not even married , the jury was told .
" it was that -lsb- attack -rsb- perhaps which caused the violent , knife-wielding rapist to commit murder , " mr harrington told the court .
the defence team sought to discredit miss palk 's character , highlighting her personal relationships .
geraldine palk 's body was found in a shallow stream the victim 's sister alison lichfield - acting as a defence witness - said miss palk had a string of casual relationships in 1990 after she broke up with a long-term boyfriend the previous year .
ms lichfield " expressed her disapproval " toward her sister , who had been described as " friendly , lively and outgoing " .
in the decade that followed ms palk 's death , detectives took dna samples from 5,000 men in one of the largest screening programmes ever undertaken by a british police force .
eventually , random dna swabbing at dartmoor prison led them to hampson , who was serving a four-year sentence for assault .
he was arrested by detectives from cardiff as he left the prison and was driven away for questioning .
despite damning forensic evidence , hampson continually denied the murder .
tests showed that the likelihood of someone else being responsible was one in a billion .
tragic events ms palk 's death was the first in a series of tragic events for the palk family .
her mother cynthia palk , 61 , died after being knocked down by a car as she walked past the spot where the body was found .
neighbours said the retired nurse had never got over her daughter 's brutal death .
the following year , mrs palk 's husband les died from cancer .
joan brinkworth , a friend who played baseball with ms palk , said relatives never recovered from the loss .
" he killed her family - not just geraldine .
her mother , particularly , never came to terms with it at all .
" i 'm glad that somebody has been caught for the murder , but really it 's too late .
" her mother and father will never see justice . "
the officer who led the south wales police inquiry , detective chief superintendent wynne phillips , said the case showed the importance of sticking with an investigation .
" today brings to an end more than 11 years of heart ache and pain for the relatives of geraldine , " he said .
" i pay tribute to their courage and resolve throughout two harrowing and complex police investigations .
their dignity throughout is a tribute to them .
" it is unfortunate that it took a long time despite our continued commitment - modern policing methods and new forensic technology were vital .
" the final message from me is that this case reinforces the theory ' never give up ' .
" the public deserve this and more so the family of geraldine .
it is sad that geraldine 's parents are not alive to witness some consolation in regard to their daughters tragic death . " watch / listen on this story bbc wales ' caroline evans " he had a long history of violent crime and was on bail for firearms offences when he killed geraldine . "

the tibetan spiritual leader arrived in the mongolian capital , ulan bator , despite a denunciation of his trip by china , which warned mongolian officials not to meet him .
the chinese foreign ministry said he was not simply a religious figure but also a political exile who had engaged in activities to split what it called " the motherland . "
mongolia has strong religious ties with tibet and has been rediscovering its buddhist heritage since the end of communist rule in 1990 .
the dalai lama , who is a winner of the nobel peace prize , fled tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against chinese rule .
