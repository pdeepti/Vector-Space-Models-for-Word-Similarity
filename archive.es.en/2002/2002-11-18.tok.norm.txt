the lot of black people under the nazis , however , has received little attention in the past .
now the nazi documentation center in cologne is showing the first exhibition on the subject .
called " distinguishing feature : negro " – blacks in national socialist times ’ , the exhibition shows germany in the 1930s and 1940s caught in the grip of jazz fever .
black music seduces germany at that time black entertainers , in particular musicians , singers and dancers were wildly popular in germany and black music was considered hip in the weimar republic .

the initiator of the exhibition , dr peter martin of the hamburg foundation for the cultivation of culture and science , estimates that some 10,000 black people lived in germany before the nazis came to power .
documenting little-known history however , with the rise of national socialism in germany , the life of the blacks became increasingly difficult .

according to martin , historians have only been able to document just over two dozen cases of blacks being killed by the nazis .
" white gaze – black object " the exhibition meanwhile has also attracted criticism from groups that represent blacks in germany .
they say that it objectifies blacks .
the black people in germany initiative -lrb- isd -rrb- and the organization black women in germany -lrb- adefra -rrb- , believe that the exhibition is another example of how german society deals with and views black people as objects .
the groups welcome bringing the history of germany ’ s black population to the public but are opposed to the exhibition 's name .
" at the cost of black people , a historical term is updated according to long-standing white-colonial thought patterns , " said a spokeswoman for the isd in a statement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.11.2002 forgotten history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the shadow of the nazi regime for the first time an exhibition in cologne attempts to piece together the story of the nazi persecution of blacks living in germany when hitler came to power in 1933 . jews , roma , communists , homosexuals : the nazis ’ objects of scorn and persecution are well-known and well-documented .
the lot of black people under the nazis , however , has received little attention in the past .
now the nazi documentation center in cologne is showing the first exhibition on the subject .
called " distinguishing feature : negro " – blacks in national socialist times ’ , the exhibition shows germany in the 1930s and 1940s caught in the grip of jazz fever .
black music seduces germany at that time black entertainers , in particular musicians , singers and dancers were wildly popular in germany and black music was considered hip in the weimar republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josephine baker berlin ’ s opulent ballrooms and dance salons swung to jazz tunes and melodies .
not just black musicians , but also an increasing number of immigrants from the caribbean and european colonies in africa , black americans who fled from the us economic crisis to germany , diplomats , business people , students and sailors began to make their presence felt in germany at the time .
the initiator of the exhibition , dr peter martin of the hamburg foundation for the cultivation of culture and science , estimates that some 10,000 black people lived in germany before the nazis came to power .
documenting little-known history however , with the rise of national socialism in germany , the life of the blacks became increasingly difficult .
they became the target of a vicious propaganda machine unleashed by the nazis .
along with jews and those politically opposed to the nazi regime , the blacks began to be hounded by hitler ’ s followers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concentration camp dachau 1945 the fate and stories of some of those unfortunate people have now been painstakingly restored in the exhibition through a collection of posters , flyers , films , audio recordings and photographs .
the venue itself could hardly be more appropriate : the cologne nazi documentation center is housed in a building used by the gestapo for torture and interrogation .
life made hell the nazi ’ s 1933 racial law , which applied to blacks as well as jews , institutionalized racism and made it impossible for them to lead normal lives .
propaganda on the streets and in the media labeled blacks as a " dangerous plague " and " bastards " .
black men were said to be a danger for german women .
black germans who had married white germans were subjected to additional persecution .
many were forcibly sterilized .
historians still don ’ t know what happened to most blacks in germany between 1933 and 1945 .
many simply disappeared from public life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exhibition " besonderes kennzeichen neger " .schwarze im ns-staat .
some were able to leave the country , while others were sent to concentration camps .
hundreds or even thousands may have been killed .
according to martin , historians have only been able to document just over two dozen cases of blacks being killed by the nazis .

however , merrill lynch said it was basing its revision mainly on the performance of british and swiss companies and continued to recommend caution in respect of both deutsche telekom and its french counterpart , france telecom .
the investment bank jp morgan , on the other hand , revised its rating for telekom from " overweight " to neutral , setting the fair price for its shares at 15 euros .
morgan cited concerns about the general economic situation and currency fluctuations for its decision and said that the recent sacking of telekom boss ron sommer had diminished confidence in the company 's restructuring plans .
moody 's , the international financial ratings agency , seems to agree with jp morgan 's assessment , announcing on monday it is considering downrating deutsche telekom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.11.2002 forgotten history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the shadow of the nazi regime for the first time an exhibition in cologne attempts to piece together the story of the nazi persecution of blacks living in germany when hitler came to power in 1933 . jews , roma , communists , homosexuals : the nazis ’ objects of scorn and persecution are well-known and well-documented .
the lot of black people under the nazis , however , has received little attention in the past .
now the nazi documentation center in cologne is showing the first exhibition on the subject .
called " distinguishing feature : negro " – blacks in national socialist times ’ , the exhibition shows germany in the 1930s and 1940s caught in the grip of jazz fever .
black music seduces germany at that time black entertainers , in particular musicians , singers and dancers were wildly popular in germany and black music was considered hip in the weimar republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josephine baker berlin ’ s opulent ballrooms and dance salons swung to jazz tunes and melodies .
not just black musicians , but also an increasing number of immigrants from the caribbean and european colonies in africa , black americans who fled from the us economic crisis to germany , diplomats , business people , students and sailors began to make their presence felt in germany at the time .
the initiator of the exhibition , dr peter martin of the hamburg foundation for the cultivation of culture and science , estimates that some 10,000 black people lived in germany before the nazis came to power .
documenting little-known history however , with the rise of national socialism in germany , the life of the blacks became increasingly difficult .
they became the target of a vicious propaganda machine unleashed by the nazis .
along with jews and those politically opposed to the nazi regime , the blacks began to be hounded by hitler ’ s followers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concentration camp dachau 1945 the fate and stories of some of those unfortunate people have now been painstakingly restored in the exhibition through a collection of posters , flyers , films , audio recordings and photographs .
the venue itself could hardly be more appropriate : the cologne nazi documentation center is housed in a building used by the gestapo for torture and interrogation .
life made hell the nazi ’ s 1933 racial law , which applied to blacks as well as jews , institutionalized racism and made it impossible for them to lead normal lives .
propaganda on the streets and in the media labeled blacks as a " dangerous plague " and " bastards " .
black men were said to be a danger for german women .
black germans who had married white germans were subjected to additional persecution .
many were forcibly sterilized .
historians still don ’ t know what happened to most blacks in germany between 1933 and 1945 .
many simply disappeared from public life .

some were able to leave the country , while others were sent to concentration camps .
hundreds or even thousands may have been killed .
according to martin , historians have only been able to document just over two dozen cases of blacks being killed by the nazis .
" white gaze – black object " the exhibition meanwhile has also attracted criticism from groups that represent blacks in germany .
they say that it objectifies blacks .
the black people in germany initiative -lrb- isd -rrb- and the organization black women in germany -lrb- adefra -rrb- , believe that the exhibition is another example of how german society deals with and views black people as objects .

the lot of black people under the nazis , however , has received little attention in the past .
now the nazi documentation center in cologne is showing the first exhibition on the subject .
called " distinguishing feature : negro " – blacks in national socialist times ’ , the exhibition shows germany in the 1930s and 1940s caught in the grip of jazz fever .
black music seduces germany at that time black entertainers , in particular musicians , singers and dancers were wildly popular in germany and black music was considered hip in the weimar republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josephine baker berlin ’ s opulent ballrooms and dance salons swung to jazz tunes and melodies .
not just black musicians , but also an increasing number of immigrants from the caribbean and european colonies in africa , black americans who fled from the us economic crisis to germany , diplomats , business people , students and sailors began to make their presence felt in germany at the time .
the initiator of the exhibition , dr peter martin of the hamburg foundation for the cultivation of culture and science , estimates that some 10,000 black people lived in germany before the nazis came to power .
documenting little-known history however , with the rise of national socialism in germany , the life of the blacks became increasingly difficult .
they became the target of a vicious propaganda machine unleashed by the nazis .

the venue itself could hardly be more appropriate : the cologne nazi documentation center is housed in a building used by the gestapo for torture and interrogation .
life made hell the nazi ’ s 1933 racial law , which applied to blacks as well as jews , institutionalized racism and made it impossible for them to lead normal lives .
propaganda on the streets and in the media labeled blacks as a " dangerous plague " and " bastards " .
black men were said to be a danger for german women .

some were able to leave the country , while others were sent to concentration camps .

according to martin , historians have only been able to document just over two dozen cases of blacks being killed by the nazis .

the lot of black people under the nazis , however , has received little attention in the past .
now the nazi documentation center in cologne is showing the first exhibition on the subject .
called " distinguishing feature : negro " – blacks in national socialist times ’ , the exhibition shows germany in the 1930s and 1940s caught in the grip of jazz fever .
black music seduces germany at that time black entertainers , in particular musicians , singers and dancers were wildly popular in germany and black music was considered hip in the weimar republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josephine baker berlin ’ s opulent ballrooms and dance salons swung to jazz tunes and melodies .
not just black musicians , but also an increasing number of immigrants from the caribbean and european colonies in africa , black americans who fled from the us economic crisis to germany , diplomats , business people , students and sailors began to make their presence felt in germany at the time .
the initiator of the exhibition , dr peter martin of the hamburg foundation for the cultivation of culture and science , estimates that some 10,000 black people lived in germany before the nazis came to power .
documenting little-known history however , with the rise of national socialism in germany , the life of the blacks became increasingly difficult .
they became the target of a vicious propaganda machine unleashed by the nazis .
along with jews and those politically opposed to the nazi regime , the blacks began to be hounded by hitler ’ s followers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concentration camp dachau 1945 the fate and stories of some of those unfortunate people have now been painstakingly restored in the exhibition through a collection of posters , flyers , films , audio recordings and photographs .
the venue itself could hardly be more appropriate : the cologne nazi documentation center is housed in a building used by the gestapo for torture and interrogation .
life made hell the nazi ’ s 1933 racial law , which applied to blacks as well as jews , institutionalized racism and made it impossible for them to lead normal lives .
propaganda on the streets and in the media labeled blacks as a " dangerous plague " and " bastards " .
black men were said to be a danger for german women .
black germans who had married white germans were subjected to additional persecution .
many were forcibly sterilized .
historians still don ’ t know what happened to most blacks in germany between 1933 and 1945 .
many simply disappeared from public life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exhibition " besonderes kennzeichen neger " .schwarze im ns-staat .
some were able to leave the country , while others were sent to concentration camps .
hundreds or even thousands may have been killed .
according to martin , historians have only been able to document just over two dozen cases of blacks being killed by the nazis .
" white gaze – black object " the exhibition meanwhile has also attracted criticism from groups that represent blacks in germany .
they say that it objectifies blacks .
the black people in germany initiative -lrb- isd -rrb- and the organization black women in germany -lrb- adefra -rrb- , believe that the exhibition is another example of how german society deals with and views black people as objects .

the lot of black people under the nazis , however , has received little attention in the past .
now the nazi documentation center in cologne is showing the first exhibition on the subject .
called " distinguishing feature : negro " – blacks in national socialist times ’ , the exhibition shows germany in the 1930s and 1940s caught in the grip of jazz fever .
black music seduces germany at that time black entertainers , in particular musicians , singers and dancers were wildly popular in germany and black music was considered hip in the weimar republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josephine baker berlin ’ s opulent ballrooms and dance salons swung to jazz tunes and melodies .
not just black musicians , but also an increasing number of immigrants from the caribbean and european colonies in africa , black americans who fled from the us economic crisis to germany , diplomats , business people , students and sailors began to make their presence felt in germany at the time .
the initiator of the exhibition , dr peter martin of the hamburg foundation for the cultivation of culture and science , estimates that some 10,000 black people lived in germany before the nazis came to power .
documenting little-known history however , with the rise of national socialism in germany , the life of the blacks became increasingly difficult .
they became the target of a vicious propaganda machine unleashed by the nazis .
along with jews and those politically opposed to the nazi regime , the blacks began to be hounded by hitler ’ s followers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concentration camp dachau 1945 the fate and stories of some of those unfortunate people have now been painstakingly restored in the exhibition through a collection of posters , flyers , films , audio recordings and photographs .
the venue itself could hardly be more appropriate : the cologne nazi documentation center is housed in a building used by the gestapo for torture and interrogation .
life made hell the nazi ’ s 1933 racial law , which applied to blacks as well as jews , institutionalized racism and made it impossible for them to lead normal lives .
propaganda on the streets and in the media labeled blacks as a " dangerous plague " and " bastards " .
black men were said to be a danger for german women .
black germans who had married white germans were subjected to additional persecution .
many were forcibly sterilized .

some were able to leave the country , while others were sent to concentration camps .
hundreds or even thousands may have been killed .
according to martin , historians have only been able to document just over two dozen cases of blacks being killed by the nazis .

the lot of black people under the nazis , however , has received little attention in the past .
now the nazi documentation center in cologne is showing the first exhibition on the subject .
called " distinguishing feature : negro " – blacks in national socialist times ’ , the exhibition shows germany in the 1930s and 1940s caught in the grip of jazz fever .
black music seduces germany at that time black entertainers , in particular musicians , singers and dancers were wildly popular in germany and black music was considered hip in the weimar republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josephine baker berlin ’ s opulent ballrooms and dance salons swung to jazz tunes and melodies .
not just black musicians , but also an increasing number of immigrants from the caribbean and european colonies in africa , black americans who fled from the us economic crisis to germany , diplomats , business people , students and sailors began to make their presence felt in germany at the time .
the initiator of the exhibition , dr peter martin of the hamburg foundation for the cultivation of culture and science , estimates that some 10,000 black people lived in germany before the nazis came to power .
documenting little-known history however , with the rise of national socialism in germany , the life of the blacks became increasingly difficult .
they became the target of a vicious propaganda machine unleashed by the nazis .
along with jews and those politically opposed to the nazi regime , the blacks began to be hounded by hitler ’ s followers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concentration camp dachau 1945 the fate and stories of some of those unfortunate people have now been painstakingly restored in the exhibition through a collection of posters , flyers , films , audio recordings and photographs .
the venue itself could hardly be more appropriate : the cologne nazi documentation center is housed in a building used by the gestapo for torture and interrogation .
life made hell the nazi ’ s 1933 racial law , which applied to blacks as well as jews , institutionalized racism and made it impossible for them to lead normal lives .
propaganda on the streets and in the media labeled blacks as a " dangerous plague " and " bastards " .
black men were said to be a danger for german women .
black germans who had married white germans were subjected to additional persecution .

some were able to leave the country , while others were sent to concentration camps .
hundreds or even thousands may have been killed .
according to martin , historians have only been able to document just over two dozen cases of blacks being killed by the nazis .
" white gaze – black object " the exhibition meanwhile has also attracted criticism from groups that represent blacks in germany .
they say that it objectifies blacks .
the black people in germany initiative -lrb- isd -rrb- and the organization black women in germany -lrb- adefra -rrb- , believe that the exhibition is another example of how german society deals with and views black people as objects .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.11.2002 forgotten history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the shadow of the nazi regime for the first time an exhibition in cologne attempts to piece together the story of the nazi persecution of blacks living in germany when hitler came to power in 1933 . jews , roma , communists , homosexuals : the nazis ’ objects of scorn and persecution are well-known and well-documented .
the lot of black people under the nazis , however , has received little attention in the past .
now the nazi documentation center in cologne is showing the first exhibition on the subject .
called " distinguishing feature : negro " – blacks in national socialist times ’ , the exhibition shows germany in the 1930s and 1940s caught in the grip of jazz fever .
black music seduces germany at that time black entertainers , in particular musicians , singers and dancers were wildly popular in germany and black music was considered hip in the weimar republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josephine baker berlin ’ s opulent ballrooms and dance salons swung to jazz tunes and melodies .
not just black musicians , but also an increasing number of immigrants from the caribbean and european colonies in africa , black americans who fled from the us economic crisis to germany , diplomats , business people , students and sailors began to make their presence felt in germany at the time .
the initiator of the exhibition , dr peter martin of the hamburg foundation for the cultivation of culture and science , estimates that some 10,000 black people lived in germany before the nazis came to power .
documenting little-known history however , with the rise of national socialism in germany , the life of the blacks became increasingly difficult .
they became the target of a vicious propaganda machine unleashed by the nazis .
along with jews and those politically opposed to the nazi regime , the blacks began to be hounded by hitler ’ s followers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concentration camp dachau 1945 the fate and stories of some of those unfortunate people have now been painstakingly restored in the exhibition through a collection of posters , flyers , films , audio recordings and photographs .
the venue itself could hardly be more appropriate : the cologne nazi documentation center is housed in a building used by the gestapo for torture and interrogation .
life made hell the nazi ’ s 1933 racial law , which applied to blacks as well as jews , institutionalized racism and made it impossible for them to lead normal lives .
propaganda on the streets and in the media labeled blacks as a " dangerous plague " and " bastards " .
black men were said to be a danger for german women .
black germans who had married white germans were subjected to additional persecution .
many were forcibly sterilized .
historians still don ’ t know what happened to most blacks in germany between 1933 and 1945 .
many simply disappeared from public life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exhibition " besonderes kennzeichen neger " .schwarze im ns-staat .
some were able to leave the country , while others were sent to concentration camps .
hundreds or even thousands may have been killed .
according to martin , historians have only been able to document just over two dozen cases of blacks being killed by the nazis .
" white gaze – black object " the exhibition meanwhile has also attracted criticism from groups that represent blacks in germany .
they say that it objectifies blacks .
the black people in germany initiative -lrb- isd -rrb- and the organization black women in germany -lrb- adefra -rrb- , believe that the exhibition is another example of how german society deals with and views black people as objects .
the groups welcome bringing the history of germany ’ s black population to the public but are opposed to the exhibition 's name .
" at the cost of black people , a historical term is updated according to long-standing white-colonial thought patterns , " said a spokeswoman for the isd in a statement .
" black survivors and the murdered victims of the holocaust are hardly receiving a dignified monument . "
the exhibition runs until february 23 , 2003 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the exhibition " distinguishing features : negro " – blacks in national socialist times -lrb- in german -rrb- black people in germany initiative -lrb- in german -rrb- the non-profit organization focuses on ensuring that black people in germany have equal rights and opportunities . dw-tv europe live in focus we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the lot of black people under the nazis , however , has received little attention in the past .
now the nazi documentation center in cologne is showing the first exhibition on the subject .
called " distinguishing feature : negro " – blacks in national socialist times ’ , the exhibition shows germany in the 1930s and 1940s caught in the grip of jazz fever .
black music seduces germany at that time black entertainers , in particular musicians , singers and dancers were wildly popular in germany and black music was considered hip in the weimar republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josephine baker berlin ’ s opulent ballrooms and dance salons swung to jazz tunes and melodies .
not just black musicians , but also an increasing number of immigrants from the caribbean and european colonies in africa , black americans who fled from the us economic crisis to germany , diplomats , business people , students and sailors began to make their presence felt in germany at the time .
the initiator of the exhibition , dr peter martin of the hamburg foundation for the cultivation of culture and science , estimates that some 10,000 black people lived in germany before the nazis came to power .
documenting little-known history however , with the rise of national socialism in germany , the life of the blacks became increasingly difficult .
they became the target of a vicious propaganda machine unleashed by the nazis .

however , merrill lynch said it was basing its revision mainly on the performance of british and swiss companies and continued to recommend caution in respect of both deutsche telekom and its french counterpart , france telecom .
the investment bank jp morgan , on the other hand , revised its rating for telekom from " overweight " to neutral , setting the fair price for its shares at 15 euros .
morgan cited concerns about the general economic situation and currency fluctuations for its decision and said that the recent sacking of telekom boss ron sommer had diminished confidence in the company 's restructuring plans .
moody 's , the international financial ratings agency , seems to agree with jp morgan 's assessment , announcing on monday it is considering downrating deutsche telekom .
pointing both to telekom 's lack of progress in clearing its own debts and to the long-term indebtedness of telekom 's us subsidiary voicestream , moody 's said it intended to complete its review within the next four weeks . more briefs 18.11.2002 -pipe- pharmaceuticals giant interested in bayer part 18.11.2002 -pipe- karstadt shares drop on third quarter result 15.11.2002 -pipe- volkswagen remains in driving seat 14.11.2002 -pipe- german construction giant bucks trend 14.11.2002 -pipe- e.on energy reports good growth 14.11.2002 -pipe- trial begins for fallen neuer markt star 14.11.2002 -pipe- basf posts big profit gain 14.11.2002 -pipe- allianz deep in the red radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

however , merrill lynch said it was basing its revision mainly on the performance of british and swiss companies and continued to recommend caution in respect of both deutsche telekom and its french counterpart , france telecom .
the investment bank jp morgan , on the other hand , revised its rating for telekom from " overweight " to neutral , setting the fair price for its shares at 15 euros .
morgan cited concerns about the general economic situation and currency fluctuations for its decision and said that the recent sacking of telekom boss ron sommer had diminished confidence in the company 's restructuring plans .
moody 's , the international financial ratings agency , seems to agree with jp morgan 's assessment , announcing on monday it is considering downrating deutsche telekom .
pointing both to telekom 's lack of progress in clearing its own debts and to the long-term indebtedness of telekom 's us subsidiary voicestream , moody 's said it intended to complete its review within the next four weeks . more briefs 18.11.2002 -pipe- pharmaceuticals giant interested in bayer part 18.11.2002 -pipe- karstadt shares drop on third quarter result 15.11.2002 -pipe- volkswagen remains in driving seat 14.11.2002 -pipe- german construction giant bucks trend 14.11.2002 -pipe- e.on energy reports good growth 14.11.2002 -pipe- trial begins for fallen neuer markt star 14.11.2002 -pipe- basf posts big profit gain 14.11.2002 -pipe- allianz deep in the red radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a total of 29,236 people have embarked on undergraduate or postgraduate training this autumn , according to the teacher training agency .
more have registered for courses starting during the academic year , taking the total up to 31,261 .
this is 7 % more than last year - but leaves the government 1,005 people short of its target for the recruitment of trainee secondary school teachers . "
this rise is excellent news for the profession , parents and pupils across the country " david miliband school standards minister nevertheless , the chief executive of the agency , ralph tabberer , said the figures were " a tremendous achievement " .
" it is clear that more and more graduates believe teaching is a career which offers rewards which can not be matched elsewhere , " he said .
the total number of training registrations was the highest since at least 1989/90 , the agency said , and had gone up for the third year in a row .
there are 14,476 people registered to train to be primary school teachers , up 10 % on last year and several hundred above target .
and 16,785 have registered for secondary courses - a 5 % rise , but 5.65 % below the number of training places that were available .
the great majority of the trainees - 23,460 - are on postgraduate courses , with just 7,801 doing education as their first degree .
shortage areas the training agency says there are more trainees in each of the priority secondary subjects - those which have the most severe staff shortages .
the subjects are : maths , science , modern foreign languages , english -lrb- including drama -rrb- , design and technology and information and communication technology .
these attract " golden hellos " of £ 4,000 and - under a new scheme - people may also now have their student loans repaid for them if they stay in the job for 10 years .
the figures were being announced at a conference in birmingham on monday , where the school standards minister , david miliband , said they showed " real progress " was being made .
" more people than ever are recognising the tremendous rewards of a teaching career , " he said .
" this is even more impressive at a time when there are a wealth of career options for graduates .
" this rise is excellent news for the profession , parents and pupils across the country and shows we are recruiting the teachers we need for the future . "
older profile there was no complacency but the government 's recruitment strategy was " clearly working " .
" teachers are the backbone of our education system and there has never been a more exciting time to train to be a teacher . "
ralph tabberer said employment-based routes into teaching now accounted for about one in 10 of all training places .
about a third of new teachers were aged 30 or more , and half were over 25 .
" graduates are taking more time to find the career which suits them best , " he said .
" we will continue to encourage people seeking new challenges , and those who find they are not using the skills and knowledge they acquired during their first degree studies , to consider changing to teaching . "
the latest figures do however highlight the very slow take-up of the so-called fast track scheme designed to attract bright students into the teaching profession , with extra training allowances and a higher starting salary .
recruitment has cost £ 13m - and this year brought in just 116 of the 31,261 total trainees .
salaries for most newly-qualified teachers start at £ 17,595 .

clothing firm dewhirst announced on friday that it plans to move production from its ashington plant to morocco , with the loss of 420 jobs .
officials from the general municipal and boilermakers union -lrb- gmb -rrb- want northumberland county council to put pressure on the government to award uniform contracts to the plant .
the company says lower foreign wage costs and pressure from marks and spencer , which it supplies with ladiesware , means it has to move production abroad .
coalmining community gmb officials are angry at the move , which they say they will resist .
however , a spokesman said it would be pressing for help in awarding the plant lucrative government clothing contracts for items like army uniforms .
it is the second jobs blow for northumberland 's former coalmining community in a matter of weeks .
in october , 100 jobs were lost at a baby care products factory in neighbouring cramlington as production was moved to china .
earlier this year dewhirst cut 400 jobs at its factory in sunderland .
more than 5,000 clothing jobs have been lost in the north east over the past four years .
a spokesman for northumberland county council said it was hoping to come up with measures which would persuade dewhirst to stay in ashington .

both patients and doctors are stepping up their campaign for funding for the use of drugs in northern ireland that are being offered to other nhs patients .
new drugs became available last march to rheumatoid arthritis sufferers after the national institute for clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- approved the use of enbrel and remicade for nhs patients in england and wales , for whom conventional treatments had failed .
but the nice rulings do not automatically apply to northern ireland .
it is very hard to understand why people with rheumatoid arthritis in other countries can have the opportunity of having this treatment and people in northern ireland should not have the same level of care andrea beckett arthritis sufferer and the then northern ireland health minister bairbre de brun indicated there was not enough funding to make the drugs freely available in the province .
the treatments cost about £ 10,000 per patient per year .
in northern ireland , about 200 people are waiting to be prescribed the drugs .
one young woman on the waiting list , andrea beckett , said it was unfair that she and other sufferers were being denied drugs which could dramatically change their lives .
she said : " my joints are constantly throbbing , and when i get up to do activities like climbing the stairs my knees are in excruciating pain .
" the drugs are widely used in america and europe and the uk and in the south of ireland too .
" they are used to a certain extent in northern ireland , but it is very limited .
" we ca n't get them because of funding issues .
" it is very hard to understand why people with rheumatoid arthritis in other countries can have the opportunity of having this treatment , with dramatic effects on their lives , and people in northern ireland should not have the same level of care . "
' broadly in line ' currently , about £ 1m has been allocated to pay for the prescribing of the drugs in northern ireland .
a further £ 2m would be needed to address the existing waiting list .
the department of health has said it is working with the health hoards and doctors to promote a cautious approach to the introduction of the new drugs within the resources available .
the department said that the approach to prescribing the drugs in northern ireland was " broadly in line " with nice recommendations . watch / listen on this story andrea beckett , patient : " i find it extremely frustrating " bbc ni 's health correspondent dot kirby : " the number on the waiting list for these drugs is growing " see also : 09 apr 02 -pipe- n ireland call for arthritis drugs funding 27 apr 02 -pipe- n ireland arthritis treatment under spotlight 22 nov 01 -pipe- health arthritis postcode prescribing revealed 26 oct 02 -pipe- health arthritis drug improves symptoms 23 nov 01 -pipe- health how arthritis drug helped me 03 jul 00 -pipe- health drug combats rheumatoid arthritis internet links : nice arthritis research campaign arthritis care national rheumatoid arthritis society the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top n ireland stories now : nail bombs thrown at station omagh detectives make arrest orde defends inquiry comments warders still concerned at breach sdlp member ' being forced out ' jobs threat at council family claim attack was ' sectarian ' adair fails in prison challenge links to more n ireland stories are at the foot of the page .

conservationists have revealed that there have been new sightings in more than 100 towns and cities across the uk where it was believed otters no longer lived .
among the areas noted in the wildlife trust survey are port talbot , merthyr tydfil , haverfordwest , and cardiff .
waters where the otter hunts are less polluted nigel ajax-lewis , conservation officer with the wildlife trust of south and west wales , said that while otter numbers had been rising in some areas , until recently they had only been recorded on the edges of cities , or within a 10 or 20 mile radius of major urban areas .
" we have had sightings of otters climbing in and out of dustbins at supermarkets in towns , and others have been spotted near local authority offices in a town centre in south wales , right next to a busy road , " he said .
" one of the biggest contributing factors is the fact that our waterways are so much cleaner now , and that is largely because of the closure of the coal mines .
" also , organisations like the wildlife trust have put a lot of resources into making sure that otters have places to breed by protecting habitat and by building artificial holts . "
dramatic comeback research released earlier this year revealed that otter numbers had risen generally across wales - but the latest survey - carried out by conservationists working on the wildlife trust 's water for wildlife project - is the first evidence that they are returning to more urban areas .
otters have made a dramatic comeback in recent years after virtual extinction in the 1960s .
their decline was linked to pollution , farm pesticides , and destruction of habitat .
the gradual return began with the phasing out of chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides which , with other chemicals , built up in fish - the otter 's main prey in 1998 , the government set a target of restoring otters to all uk rivers by 2010 see also : 10 apr 02 -pipe- england otters blamed for frog slaughter 14 aug 01 -pipe- uk otter ' tamed ' by love 26 jun 01 -pipe- science / nature new threats to uk otters ' survival 15 dec 00 -pipe- uk otters under threat from flooding 26 jun 00 -pipe- uk beware - otters crossing internet links : the wildlife trusts otters - bbc site the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top wales stories now : boyfriend sought in murder inquiry girl will wait for jailed ' rapist ' lover cash boost for brecon jazz hello !

the company said the six months to september produced a net profit of 33.2bn yen -lrb- £ 174m ; $ 275m -rrb- , compared with a loss of 232.1bn yen a year before .
the half-year figures are the first to be prepared under us accounting rules , and showed operating profit - the figure before the cost of ntt 's massive restructuring drive - rising by 143 % to 823.3bn yen .
