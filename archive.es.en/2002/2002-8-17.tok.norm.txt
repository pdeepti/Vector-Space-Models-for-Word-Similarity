about 14 people have been killed across eastern germany and thousands have now been forced to leave vulnerable parts of dresden , which has been waterlogged by the swollen river elbe .
the city 's historic centre is thought to be in acute danger in the face of predictions that the water could rise further still , with huge efforts required to save unique buildings and artefacts .
the german chancellor , gerhard schroeder , will host a meeting on sunday in berlin with ministers from austria , the czech republic and slovakia , as well as romano prodi , president of the european commission , to discuss the floods .
meanwhile , residents are beginning to return to their homes in the czech capital , prague , where flood waters are finally beginning to recede .
endangered treasures dresden , which has been described as looking like a war zone , is a city submerged as waters rose above the 1845 record of 8.77 metres -lrb- 28.8 feet -rrb- to a new high of 9.13 m -lrb- 29.5 ft -rrb- .
water levels were expected to peak sometime on saturday , and while forecasters predicted more rain , it was not expected to rival the amounts earlier in the week that spurred the flooding . "
it hurts so much that all this is endangered by the water " sonja beyer some 30,000 have already been evacuated from the city , part of the 100,000 who have fled their homes in other areas threatened by the flow of the river elbe .
the river elbe is swollen by torrential rain that has caused floods , claiming more than 80 lives across central europe .
in slovakia , there are hopes that the worst may have passed after the river danube rose to its highest point and began to subside without causing extensive damage .
the danube has already wrought havoc in austria and southern bavaria , where some cleaning-up efforts have already begun as the waters recede .
in prague , some residents have been allowed back to their homes - and are now busy clearing up layers of thick mud .
much of the historic part of the city is still closed , including charles bridge .
towns north of prague are still being battered by torrents of water , although the situation elsewhere has begun to ease .
sorrowful but stoic emergency teams tried in vain to protect dresden 's semper opera house and the zwinger palace - both already hit by a first wave of flooding earlier in the week - but abandoned their efforts early on friday .
the cellars of the ornate zwinger palace - rebuilt under communist rule and home to one of europe 's great art collections , including raphael 's sistine madonna - have been swamped .
fortunately most of the art treasures were removed in time .
the adjacent semper opera house will be closed for at least two months , and the government said it was offering 300 million euros in emergency aid to help repair damage to such buildings .
dresden residents , many of whom lived through wartime air raids which killed tens of thousands , are said to be sorrowful but stoic .
" it hurts so much that all this is endangered by the water , " said sonja beyer , 72 .
" it 's the art treasures that give dresden its flair . "
downstream , thousands of residents in bitterfeld and magdeburg are being evacuated and even hamburg on the north sea coast is also braced .
mr schroeder has described the situation as a national catastrophe , with damage worth billions of euros .

news of the university 's study came a month after it was announced that teachers could face disciplinary action if they fail to report suspicions that a child is being abused .
the law is being tightened to help protect vulnerable children after a campaign by the former education secretary gillian shephard .
new recommendations aimed at ending miscarriages of justice in child abuse investigations are in the hands of the home office .

the rock is only half a mile across and will be as far away from our home planet as the moon is .
but , if you 're lucky and you have a decent pair of binoculars or a telescope , you may be able to see it at around 3-5am on sunday morning .
on breakfast this morning , we talked to dr robert massey , of the greenwich royal observatory .
he explained that the asteroid will not be very easy to spot : you 'll need a good map and a decent pair of binoculars .
this sort of near miss happens once every 50 years .
but , according to dr massey , that does not mean we should be complacent : " a hit from something this size would create a crater 10km across . "
the dust from such an impact might disrupt weather systems across an entire continent .
details the opportunity for amateur skywatchers to get such a close-up view of an asteroid occurs only once every half-century .
enlarge image asteroid fly-by the nearest the asteroid will get is within 530,000 kilometres -lrb- 330,000 miles -rrb- - slightly farther away than the moon .
future pass its track in the sky will pass close by the bright star vega and through the constellation of hercules .
it will be significantly dimmer than even the faintest star visible with the naked eye .
european skywatchers will catch their best glimpse in the early hours of sunday .
for viewing from north america , the best time to watch will be on saturday evening .
scientists will be able to use the close approach to plot the course of the asteroid over the years to come .
they say there is a minute risk - one in 500,000 - that the rock could strike earth in 2022 , but the new measurements could show it will definitely miss us .
drawing skills jay tate , from the spaceguard uk observatory in powys , said that with a little effort , it should be possible to detect the movement of the asteroid .
it 's not groundbreaking science for us , but this is an opportunity for thousands of amateur astronomers jay tate , earthguard uk he told bbc news online : " people should look at the right area of the sky through their binoculars , and make a rough drawing of the position of all the bright objects .
" then they should look again five minutes or so later and see which of them has moved .
" this asteroid wo n't look anything like a normal shooting star , or even a satellite .
" it 's not groundbreaking science for us , but this is an opportunity for thousands of amateur astronomers to see something like this . "
spin rate he said that measurements taken by experts might show the rate at which the rock was spinning in space , giving clues to its composition .

uk computer games firm acclaim uk is offering gamers the chance to legally change their name to turok - the title of their latest computer game .
" we 've been staggered by the response , " said shaun white , uk communications manager for acclaim uk .
" naturally we are looking at it as an experiment in our marketing strategy .
but we 've been truly amazed at the reaction we 've had , " he added .
so-called identity marketing is the latest buzzword in a brand-saturated world , where marketers have seen new mediums like the internet fail to live up to their potential for advertising .
financial incentive it is the first time marketers have turned to living billboards and could signal a big change in advertising according to simon cantrell of the institute of science in marketing who came up with the idea .
" there could be thousands of people called pepsi , brylcreem , toyota and yahoo happily going about their everyday lives while subtly communicating the virtues of their brand namesakes , " said mr cantrell .
the foes are bionically enhanced dinosaurs the website - www.mynameisturok.co.uk - tells volunteer turoks that they will have to opportunity of " being pioneers - one of just a few taking a brave step beyond the leading edge of marketing practice . "
candidates who agree to change their name to turok will receive £ 500 and a microsoft xbox console .
according to a uk spokesman for the institute of science in marketing , not everyone is doing it for the money .
" some do it to have their bit of fame , some because they love the game and others because they like the idea in taking part in a new idea , " he said .
so far 6,500 volunteers have applied since the offer appeared on the web but only five lucky turoks will be chosen .
the name-change will be legally binding for a year , after which time the marketing guinea-pigs can change their names back .
" we are stressing that this is n't something that people can just pick up at the pub on a friday evening , " said the spokesman .
" they have to live with their new identity 24 hours a day and will need to change their passport , driving licence and e-mail address . "

he said he had been listening to those who warned against military action to replace the iraqi leader , saddam hussein .
and he characterised dissent within his own republican party as healthy debate .
his comments came as the iraqi government sent another letter to the united nations , urging further technical discussions on any future weapons inspection mission .
but the text appears to fall short of un demands for an unconditional invitation to weapons inspectors to resume their work .
mr bush , who is on holiday in texas , said : " we 'll continue to consult .
people should be allowed to express their opinion .
" but america needs to know i 'll be making up my mind based on the latest intelligence and how best to protect our own country plus our friends and allies . "
brent scowcroft , a former us national security adviser and retired general , has warned that an attack on iraq could jeopardise or destroy the american-led war on terror .
right-wing congressman dick armey has spoken out against the iraq policy , as has the senior democratic senator , carl levin .
iraqi letter the iraqi letter - from foreign minister naji sabri to un secretary general kofi annan - reportedly requests more technical discussions on the aims and scope of any future un weapons inspection mission before agreeing to its return .
this proposal is similar to a previous iraqi overture .
iraq 's earlier offer was rejected by the un , with mr annan insisting in a letter to mr sabri that the un wanted nothing short of a formal invitation for the return of weapons inspectors .
mr annan 's letter outlined steps iraq should take to comply with a 1999 security council resolution calling for the return of inspectors .
the bbc 's greg barrow , at the un in new york , reports that diplomats are saying that the iraqi strategy is to string out negotiations with the un with the aim of staving off us military intervention .
but he adds that unless baghdad comes up with new ideas , that tactic may not work .
the us has been demanding that baghdad agree to new inspections without further discussion to demonstrate that it is not developing weapons of mass destruction .
un inspectors have not been allowed back into iraq since leaving in 1998 - seven years after they went into the country .

he 's been asking why does the state of the us stockmarket have such a dramatic impact on our own .
in final part of declan 's new york diary , he meets the king of the nasdaq : the american high-tech shares index which has gone dramatically from boom to bust " what is it like , i asked him , " to be the boss of the nasdaq ? "
wick simmons laughed , and said it was the best job he 'd ever done .
but he admitted he 's said that about all his jobs .
after spending close to an hour with him , i still do n't know what thoughts go through your head when you 're running one of the world 's biggest stockmarkets .
but two things are obvious - he has an awfully long working week , and he 's finding it 's more difficult to run a company in the bad times than it is in a boom .
for a man with a new young family -lrb- he 's in his 50s , his daughters from his current marriage are just turning teenagers -rrb- , he certainly puts in the hours .
the working day starts at 6am , and he 's still on the go more than 12 hours later .
and then he 's got the decision no executive who 's also a father of a growing family likes to make nowadays - to go to the evening dinners that are of crucial importance when you 're doing business at the highest levels , or to go home to the kids ?
the call of the rubber chicken when he 's got a free choice , the kids win every time .
but at least two nights a week , he 's on the rubber chicken circuit , and is lucky to see home before 10pm .
he gives the impression that he 'd rather see more of his children ; he 'd be forgiven if he said he 'd like to see less of america .
the job is split between the various nasdaq offices along the east coast - if he 's not in times square for that day 's opening ceremony , he 'll be downtown in its business headquarters just off wall street .
failing that , it 's the washington office for some top-drawer political schmoozing , or he 'll be at one of the many share dealing companies that make up the nasdaq -lrb- it is still a mutual exchange , owned by its members -rrb- .
that 's all before you count in travel to other parts of the states , or even abroad - to the nasdaq 's operations in japan , london or berlin .
he 's likely to have less of that foreign travel to do in the future .
the volatility on the markets has forced the nasdaq to rein in its plans for a round-the-clock , round-the-world stock exchange .
reviving the nasdaq his predecessor went on a dash for growth , building up inter-linked exchanges in japan and europe on the back of the tech boom .
now all that 's been put on hold .
the japanese operation is almost certainly going to be shut down , and while the exchange is expanding in germany , its nasdaq europe operation is n't as successful as had been hoped , and any idea of a deal with the london stock exchange has been put on the shelf - for now , at least .
when the biggest piston of the lot seizes up , the engine stalls - no matter how well-designed or well-oiled our british piston is pr offensive there are endless meetings , of course , but much of his job seems to be about public relations - keeping the member stock trading firms sweet , and re-assuring the public who 've still got money in shares that they 're not on a one-way ticket to destitution .
that 's why he spends so much time speaking to people like bbc journalists .
he expects those investors who bailed out of the market with massive losses to come back - but he knows they need to be coaxed .
and he recognises the damage that 's been caused to all of capitalism by the sleaze that 's oozing out of america 's biggest companies .
and he also says the nasdaq has to re-invent itself .
being the home for technology shares was all very well during the tech boom , but now he 's selling it as the home for all the companies that will build america 's future .
this is another one of those things that change when good times go bad .
brokers of the future we 've spent all of the last week going behind the scenes at america 's stock markets , and trying to measure the importance of shares to the national life over here .
but we 're not the only people over from the uk doing that .
four pupils from tadcaster grammar school have made the journey from york to new york this week .
adam firth , chris wiseman , andrew jackson and phillip malloch are officially britain 's top student investors - they 're this year 's winners of the schools share-dealing competition , run annually by the financial education charity proshare .
the lads ' prize was an all-expenses trip to new york , and a tour of the financial hot spots like the nasdaq , the new york stock exchange and the federal reserve bank of new york -lrb- its boss is one of the people who sets interest rates across the whole of the united states . -rrb-
they came into the bbc 's business bureau in the early hours of friday morning to take part in the programme .
off camera , they said the thing that absolutely staggered them this week was the amount of money that swirls around the various stock exchanges here .
billions of pounds worth of shares are bought and sold every day , and billions more is soaked up in the currency , commodity , futures and options exchanges .
the boys were also struck by the ease with which you can buy shares .
there are stock shops every couple of blocks in manhattan , run by the big financial institutions .
our business team here tell me the number of people using those high-street share stores has fallen in the last year .
but any time i looked into one , they still looked pretty busy .
and those two things are at the heart of everything we 've been trying to explain this week - so many people own shares , and so much money is tied up on the markets , when share prices fall , americans feel poorer , they spend less , companies do less trade , and the recession that started off in business spreads a little further up the high street .
and when that happens , the rest of the world has to watch out , because we 're all just pistons in the global economic engine .
when the biggest piston of the lot seizes up , the engine stalls - no matter how well-designed or well-oiled our british piston is .
