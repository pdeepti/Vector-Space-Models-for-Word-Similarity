program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.11.2002 germany closes the defense wallet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have one more year of enduring freedom ... but then what ?
germany has voted to commit its troops to a further year of enduring freedom , but has told its nato allies to forget about any further expensive military adventures until the country 's financial situation improves . the cash-strapped german government said on thursday that it remains fully committed to its role as a member of nato but added there is little spare money available to the administration to spend on future military adventures .
however , the government secured majority backing in a vote on friday to decide the fate of german soldiers serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
majority vote sees german troops extend tour by a year a total of 473 legislators voted in favor of the one-year extension that will keep 2,450 troops involved in operation enduring freedom throughout afghanistan , kuwait , the horn of africa and surrounding seas .
only 11 voted against and five abstained .
with the nato summit in prague just under a week away , germany 's statement on its reluctance to commit to further military spending will immediately muddy the already murky waters surrounding one of the meeting 's agenda-topping subjects - a nato multinational rapid reaction force .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us proposals set out a ' global police ' force ready to react within days .
the united states is expected to steer the discussions at the summit towards the possibility of creating a 21,000- strong force made up of international nato troops that could be deployed anywhere in the world in under five days .
fischer diplomatic about us plans for rapid nato force german foreign minister joschka fischer diplomatically called the plan " constructive " but stressed that it should not be allowed to interfere with the european union 's own idea of creating a similar force made up of european soldiers only .
" there should be no doubling-up , " he added .
the idea of a european rapid force is one vigorously championed by germany and france but one washington views nervously .
addressing the bundestag on germany 's role as a member of nato , fischer told parliament that germany and its allies within the organization should look towards a more political approach to possible conflict and to adopt a policy of diplomatic pre-emption in peace threatening situations .
" crisis prevention is just as important as crisis reaction .
the summit must not be solely about military capabilities , " he said .
it is these military capabilities that are pre-occupying the german government at this time of belt-tightening .
after one of the bleakest weeks in the country 's recent financial history , the red-green coalition appears even less inclined to throw money in the direction of defense spending than it has before .
germany can not afford to spend big on defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister peter struck has warned nato allies that germany has no money for military actions .
defense minister peter struck said that germany 's financial problems of rising public debt and sluggish growth meant that the country could not afford a massive increase in its own military involvement and capabilities .
" i am not going to promise nato castles in the air , " he told the bundestag on thursday .
" i can not justify it and i do not want to justify it . "
struck added that , accepting that calls for increased military spending would be a major theme at the nato summit , other members would have to take into account the current sickly state of germany 's financial situation .
for ' other members ' herr struck could have substituted the united states and britain .
both countries have called on european nations to pull their weight in the transatlantic alliance by stepping up military might in the fight against terrorism .
fischer says policy of ' force only ' will lose the war joschka fischer agreed that nato had to adapt to the new threats posed by international terrorists but warned that while the war on terror had to be fought decisively by military means , " at the same time we must not restrict ourselves to that , otherwise we will fail . "
fischer quoted the success of the rapid intervention by nato forces that prevented a civil war in macedonia last august as a case in study .
however , with the german government and public alike concerned with matters at home and with its forces already committed to further service overseas , any future alliance plans that include military action will have to count on germany as a political power only .

the appointment ends weeks of speculation following the landslide victory of the justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- led by tayyip erdogan two weeks ago .
the charismatic mr erdogan himself was unable to contest the polls on account of a 1998 conviction for inciting religious hatred and is barred from the post .
gul right man for the job ?
abdullah gul , a close confidant of erdogan and deputy leader of the conservative islamic akp party was handpicked personally by erdogan to head turkey .
he takes over the reins of a country , whose ailing economy and ambitions to join the european union needs a strong pro-reform and pro-west leader at the helm .
the akp which has consistently announced sweeping plans for economic and social reforms to meet eu standards ever since its whopping win , is convinced that gul is the right man for the job .
" it ’ s time to start work .
from this hour onward it ’ s time to mobilize and work night and day to solve the problems of our people , " a smiling gul said after president ahmet necdet sezer invited him to form a government .
" the government will be ready by monday , " he said .
all the right credentials abdullah gul , who speaks fluent english , is a familiar face to the united states , which may look to him for use of turkey ’ s air bases in the event of an attack on neighboring iraq .
financial markets are also counting on gul to wisely deal with a $ 16 billion imf crisis pact to pull itself out of one of the worst economic slump since 1945 .
gul was a member of turkey ’ s first islamist-led government , which was forced from power after a year in 1997 by an army-led pressure campaign .
but gul himself is known for his balanced demeanor and has never had a run-in with courts .
the akp , which presents itself as pro-western and pro-market evolved from the wing of a now banned islamist party .
aware of the suspicions his party faces , gul said in a recent interview , " we are rational people first and foremost .
we are not militant islamists . "
erdogan unveils sweeeping reforms but despite gul being a strong figure in his own right , analysts fear that he might be overshadowed by the more charismatic erdogan and be little more than a caretaker .
erdogan himself has flaunted his pro-western ambitions to the world and has made no bones of his leading role by announcing a program of social and economic reform at a news conference held as gul visited the presidential palace .
" we are building a new world and this new world will bring the east and west together in turkey , " erdogan said .
erdogan ’ s new program includes " immediate " new penalties to deter torture , a long-standing sore point that has marred turkey ’ s relations with the eu . he has also announced plans to reform turkey ’ s education system , a move which will be followed closely by turkey ’ s secular establishment to ensure that the country ’ s secular principles are not diluted .
erdogan has also pledged to give priority to privatization , tax reforms and a shake-up of a crumbling social security system and the energy sector .
turkey 's eu membership high on akp agenda but for now it ’ s turkey ’ s entry into the european union that is high up on the agenda of the akp .
next week erdogan begins a whirlwind tour of nine european union countries to promote his country ’ s bid to become a member .
but it remains to be seen whether the eu will agree to set a date to open membership talks with turkey until reforms have been clearly implemented .
pierre lellouche , head of the french delegation at a nato parliamentary assembly meeting in istanbul told reuters that the west faced an onslaught by muslim extremists and needed to " help modern muslim countries to develop a modern tolerant form of islam . "

on friday , the ten , mainly from the former communist bloc , set out a common demand for entry terms which would not leave them financially worse off when they join the european union in 2004 .
" the net budgetary position of the new member states should be better that their position prior to their entry into the eu , " said a joint statement presented by polish prime minister leszek miller after talks in warsaw .
candidates worried obout not getting a fair deal poland , hungary , the czech and slovak republics , slovenia , estonia , latvia , lithuania and the mediterranean islands of cyprus and malta fear that the eu ’ s slow phase-in of aid to the tune of 40 billion euro proposed in brussels ‘ enlargement budget would leave their coffers empty initially .
the financial package offered at last month ’ s eu summit in brussels is 2,5 billion euro less than the original budget proposed by the european commission .
the candidate countries are also peeved that crunch issues such as the budget , agricultural aid and infrastructure funding are still to be resolved ahead of the eu ’ s enlargement summit in december in copenhagen .
agricultural aid in particularly remains a sticking point with the candidate countries , as they will initially only receive a quarter of the subsidies common in the west , for farming .
according to a eu resolution , the ten new entries will only receive the same support as the west from the eu in the year 2013 .
at the warsaw summit , the ten east european candidates demanded that the eu raise the initial agricultural aid and cut short the waiting period .
poland , with its massive agricultural sector , led calls for the eu to improve a proposal to phase in direct payments to farmers over 10 years , starting at 25 percent of eu levels .
candidates argue that if there is a delay to full farm payments , allocated under the eu ’ s common agricultural policy , their financial contributions to the eu budget should be capped accordingly .
brussels puts finishing touches to new deal however brussels has been involved in drawing up a new package that includes cash and concessions to seal a deal on enlargement .
the ten countries are to offered an extra 1-2 billion euro and a range of other concessions ranging from increasing some farm quotas to a provision allowing hunters in latvia to continue their pursuit of bear and lynx .
the new package is to be discussed by eu foreign ministers next week and designed to pave the way for an agreement with candidate states at the copenhagen summit indecember .

" for poland and the polish people i believe that membership of the european union will mean a great deal in terms of living standards and for polish influence in the world . "

the appointment ends weeks of speculation following the landslide victory of the justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- led by tayyip erdogan two weeks ago .
the charismatic mr erdogan himself was unable to contest the polls on account of a 1998 conviction for inciting religious hatred and is barred from the post .
gul right man for the job ?
abdullah gul , a close confidant of erdogan and deputy leader of the conservative islamic akp party was handpicked personally by erdogan to head turkey .
he takes over the reins of a country , whose ailing economy and ambitions to join the european union needs a strong pro-reform and pro-west leader at the helm .
the akp which has consistently announced sweeping plans for economic and social reforms to meet eu standards ever since its whopping win , is convinced that gul is the right man for the job .
" it ’ s time to start work .
from this hour onward it ’ s time to mobilize and work night and day to solve the problems of our people , " a smiling gul said after president ahmet necdet sezer invited him to form a government .
" the government will be ready by monday , " he said .
all the right credentials abdullah gul , who speaks fluent english , is a familiar face to the united states , which may look to him for use of turkey ’ s air bases in the event of an attack on neighboring iraq .
financial markets are also counting on gul to wisely deal with a $ 16 billion imf crisis pact to pull itself out of one of the worst economic slump since 1945 .
gul was a member of turkey ’ s first islamist-led government , which was forced from power after a year in 1997 by an army-led pressure campaign .
but gul himself is known for his balanced demeanor and has never had a run-in with courts .
the akp , which presents itself as pro-western and pro-market evolved from the wing of a now banned islamist party .
aware of the suspicions his party faces , gul said in a recent interview , " we are rational people first and foremost .
we are not militant islamists . "
erdogan unveils sweeeping reforms but despite gul being a strong figure in his own right , analysts fear that he might be overshadowed by the more charismatic erdogan and be little more than a caretaker .
erdogan himself has flaunted his pro-western ambitions to the world and has made no bones of his leading role by announcing a program of social and economic reform at a news conference held as gul visited the presidential palace .
" we are building a new world and this new world will bring the east and west together in turkey , " erdogan said .
erdogan ’ s new program includes " immediate " new penalties to deter torture , a long-standing sore point that has marred turkey ’ s relations with the eu . he has also announced plans to reform turkey ’ s education system , a move which will be followed closely by turkey ’ s secular establishment to ensure that the country ’ s secular principles are not diluted .
erdogan has also pledged to give priority to privatization , tax reforms and a shake-up of a crumbling social security system and the energy sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.11.2002 germany closes the defense wallet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have one more year of enduring freedom ... but then what ?
germany has voted to commit its troops to a further year of enduring freedom , but has told its nato allies to forget about any further expensive military adventures until the country 's financial situation improves . the cash-strapped german government said on thursday that it remains fully committed to its role as a member of nato but added there is little spare money available to the administration to spend on future military adventures .
however , the government secured majority backing in a vote on friday to decide the fate of german soldiers serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
majority vote sees german troops extend tour by a year a total of 473 legislators voted in favor of the one-year extension that will keep 2,450 troops involved in operation enduring freedom throughout afghanistan , kuwait , the horn of africa and surrounding seas .
only 11 voted against and five abstained .
with the nato summit in prague just under a week away , germany 's statement on its reluctance to commit to further military spending will immediately muddy the already murky waters surrounding one of the meeting 's agenda-topping subjects - a nato multinational rapid reaction force .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us proposals set out a ' global police ' force ready to react within days .
the united states is expected to steer the discussions at the summit towards the possibility of creating a 21,000- strong force made up of international nato troops that could be deployed anywhere in the world in under five days .
fischer diplomatic about us plans for rapid nato force german foreign minister joschka fischer diplomatically called the plan " constructive " but stressed that it should not be allowed to interfere with the european union 's own idea of creating a similar force made up of european soldiers only .
" there should be no doubling-up , " he added .
the idea of a european rapid force is one vigorously championed by germany and france but one washington views nervously .
addressing the bundestag on germany 's role as a member of nato , fischer told parliament that germany and its allies within the organization should look towards a more political approach to possible conflict and to adopt a policy of diplomatic pre-emption in peace threatening situations .
" crisis prevention is just as important as crisis reaction .
the summit must not be solely about military capabilities , " he said .
it is these military capabilities that are pre-occupying the german government at this time of belt-tightening .
after one of the bleakest weeks in the country 's recent financial history , the red-green coalition appears even less inclined to throw money in the direction of defense spending than it has before .
germany can not afford to spend big on defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister peter struck has warned nato allies that germany has no money for military actions .
defense minister peter struck said that germany 's financial problems of rising public debt and sluggish growth meant that the country could not afford a massive increase in its own military involvement and capabilities .
" i am not going to promise nato castles in the air , " he told the bundestag on thursday .
" i can not justify it and i do not want to justify it . "
struck added that , accepting that calls for increased military spending would be a major theme at the nato summit , other members would have to take into account the current sickly state of germany 's financial situation .
for ' other members ' herr struck could have substituted the united states and britain .
both countries have called on european nations to pull their weight in the transatlantic alliance by stepping up military might in the fight against terrorism .
fischer says policy of ' force only ' will lose the war joschka fischer agreed that nato had to adapt to the new threats posed by international terrorists but warned that while the war on terror had to be fought decisively by military means , " at the same time we must not restrict ourselves to that , otherwise we will fail . "
fischer quoted the success of the rapid intervention by nato forces that prevented a civil war in macedonia last august as a case in study .
however , with the german government and public alike concerned with matters at home and with its forces already committed to further service overseas , any future alliance plans that include military action will have to count on germany as a political power only .

on friday , the ten , mainly from the former communist bloc , set out a common demand for entry terms which would not leave them financially worse off when they join the european union in 2004 .
" the net budgetary position of the new member states should be better that their position prior to their entry into the eu , " said a joint statement presented by polish prime minister leszek miller after talks in warsaw .
candidates worried obout not getting a fair deal poland , hungary , the czech and slovak republics , slovenia , estonia , latvia , lithuania and the mediterranean islands of cyprus and malta fear that the eu ’ s slow phase-in of aid to the tune of 40 billion euro proposed in brussels ‘ enlargement budget would leave their coffers empty initially .
the financial package offered at last month ’ s eu summit in brussels is 2,5 billion euro less than the original budget proposed by the european commission .
the candidate countries are also peeved that crunch issues such as the budget , agricultural aid and infrastructure funding are still to be resolved ahead of the eu ’ s enlargement summit in december in copenhagen .
agricultural aid in particularly remains a sticking point with the candidate countries , as they will initially only receive a quarter of the subsidies common in the west , for farming .
according to a eu resolution , the ten new entries will only receive the same support as the west from the eu in the year 2013 .
at the warsaw summit , the ten east european candidates demanded that the eu raise the initial agricultural aid and cut short the waiting period .
poland , with its massive agricultural sector , led calls for the eu to improve a proposal to phase in direct payments to farmers over 10 years , starting at 25 percent of eu levels .
candidates argue that if there is a delay to full farm payments , allocated under the eu ’ s common agricultural policy , their financial contributions to the eu budget should be capped accordingly .
brussels puts finishing touches to new deal however brussels has been involved in drawing up a new package that includes cash and concessions to seal a deal on enlargement .
the ten countries are to offered an extra 1-2 billion euro and a range of other concessions ranging from increasing some farm quotas to a provision allowing hunters in latvia to continue their pursuit of bear and lynx .
the new package is to be discussed by eu foreign ministers next week and designed to pave the way for an agreement with candidate states at the copenhagen summit indecember .
blair tries to allay concerns european social democratic leaders including britain ’ s tony blair , who attended the warsaw summit , attempted to soothe candidates ‘ fears .
after meeting with polish prime minister leszek miller , blair promised that candidates would not lose out , though he did not elaborate .
" the whole purpose of the negotiations is to make sure that no accession country is worse off as a result , " blair said .
" for poland and the polish people i believe that membership of the european union will mean a great deal in terms of living standards and for polish influence in the world . "
eu postpones enlargement the discontent ahead of the warsaw meeting was heightened by the disclosure that the eu had a set a new target date for the ten new countries to join .
originally slated for january 2004 , the entry of the ten new states has now been postponed to april or may 2004 .

germany has voted to commit its troops to a further year of enduring freedom , but has told its nato allies to forget about any further expensive military adventures until the country 's financial situation improves . the cash-strapped german government said on thursday that it remains fully committed to its role as a member of nato but added there is little spare money available to the administration to spend on future military adventures .
however , the government secured majority backing in a vote on friday to decide the fate of german soldiers serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
majority vote sees german troops extend tour by a year a total of 473 legislators voted in favor of the one-year extension that will keep 2,450 troops involved in operation enduring freedom throughout afghanistan , kuwait , the horn of africa and surrounding seas .
only 11 voted against and five abstained .
with the nato summit in prague just under a week away , germany 's statement on its reluctance to commit to further military spending will immediately muddy the already murky waters surrounding one of the meeting 's agenda-topping subjects - a nato multinational rapid reaction force .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us proposals set out a ' global police ' force ready to react within days .
the united states is expected to steer the discussions at the summit towards the possibility of creating a 21,000- strong force made up of international nato troops that could be deployed anywhere in the world in under five days .
fischer diplomatic about us plans for rapid nato force german foreign minister joschka fischer diplomatically called the plan " constructive " but stressed that it should not be allowed to interfere with the european union 's own idea of creating a similar force made up of european soldiers only .
" there should be no doubling-up , " he added .
the idea of a european rapid force is one vigorously championed by germany and france but one washington views nervously .
addressing the bundestag on germany 's role as a member of nato , fischer told parliament that germany and its allies within the organization should look towards a more political approach to possible conflict and to adopt a policy of diplomatic pre-emption in peace threatening situations .
" crisis prevention is just as important as crisis reaction .
the summit must not be solely about military capabilities , " he said .
it is these military capabilities that are pre-occupying the german government at this time of belt-tightening .
after one of the bleakest weeks in the country 's recent financial history , the red-green coalition appears even less inclined to throw money in the direction of defense spending than it has before .
germany can not afford to spend big on defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister peter struck has warned nato allies that germany has no money for military actions .
defense minister peter struck said that germany 's financial problems of rising public debt and sluggish growth meant that the country could not afford a massive increase in its own military involvement and capabilities .
" i am not going to promise nato castles in the air , " he told the bundestag on thursday .
" i can not justify it and i do not want to justify it . "
struck added that , accepting that calls for increased military spending would be a major theme at the nato summit , other members would have to take into account the current sickly state of germany 's financial situation .
for ' other members ' herr struck could have substituted the united states and britain .
both countries have called on european nations to pull their weight in the transatlantic alliance by stepping up military might in the fight against terrorism .
fischer says policy of ' force only ' will lose the war joschka fischer agreed that nato had to adapt to the new threats posed by international terrorists but warned that while the war on terror had to be fought decisively by military means , " at the same time we must not restrict ourselves to that , otherwise we will fail . "
fischer quoted the success of the rapid intervention by nato forces that prevented a civil war in macedonia last august as a case in study .
however , with the german government and public alike concerned with matters at home and with its forces already committed to further service overseas , any future alliance plans that include military action will have to count on germany as a political power only .

germany has voted to commit its troops to a further year of enduring freedom , but has told its nato allies to forget about any further expensive military adventures until the country 's financial situation improves . the cash-strapped german government said on thursday that it remains fully committed to its role as a member of nato but added there is little spare money available to the administration to spend on future military adventures .
however , the government secured majority backing in a vote on friday to decide the fate of german soldiers serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
majority vote sees german troops extend tour by a year a total of 473 legislators voted in favor of the one-year extension that will keep 2,450 troops involved in operation enduring freedom throughout afghanistan , kuwait , the horn of africa and surrounding seas .
only 11 voted against and five abstained .
with the nato summit in prague just under a week away , germany 's statement on its reluctance to commit to further military spending will immediately muddy the already murky waters surrounding one of the meeting 's agenda-topping subjects - a nato multinational rapid reaction force .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us proposals set out a ' global police ' force ready to react within days .
the united states is expected to steer the discussions at the summit towards the possibility of creating a 21,000- strong force made up of international nato troops that could be deployed anywhere in the world in under five days .
fischer diplomatic about us plans for rapid nato force german foreign minister joschka fischer diplomatically called the plan " constructive " but stressed that it should not be allowed to interfere with the european union 's own idea of creating a similar force made up of european soldiers only .
" there should be no doubling-up , " he added .
the idea of a european rapid force is one vigorously championed by germany and france but one washington views nervously .
addressing the bundestag on germany 's role as a member of nato , fischer told parliament that germany and its allies within the organization should look towards a more political approach to possible conflict and to adopt a policy of diplomatic pre-emption in peace threatening situations .
" crisis prevention is just as important as crisis reaction .
the summit must not be solely about military capabilities , " he said .
it is these military capabilities that are pre-occupying the german government at this time of belt-tightening .
after one of the bleakest weeks in the country 's recent financial history , the red-green coalition appears even less inclined to throw money in the direction of defense spending than it has before .
germany can not afford to spend big on defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister peter struck has warned nato allies that germany has no money for military actions .
defense minister peter struck said that germany 's financial problems of rising public debt and sluggish growth meant that the country could not afford a massive increase in its own military involvement and capabilities .
" i am not going to promise nato castles in the air , " he told the bundestag on thursday .
" i can not justify it and i do not want to justify it . "
struck added that , accepting that calls for increased military spending would be a major theme at the nato summit , other members would have to take into account the current sickly state of germany 's financial situation .
for ' other members ' herr struck could have substituted the united states and britain .
both countries have called on european nations to pull their weight in the transatlantic alliance by stepping up military might in the fight against terrorism .
fischer says policy of ' force only ' will lose the war joschka fischer agreed that nato had to adapt to the new threats posed by international terrorists but warned that while the war on terror had to be fought decisively by military means , " at the same time we must not restrict ourselves to that , otherwise we will fail . "
fischer quoted the success of the rapid intervention by nato forces that prevented a civil war in macedonia last august as a case in study .
however , with the german government and public alike concerned with matters at home and with its forces already committed to further service overseas , any future alliance plans that include military action will have to count on germany as a political power only .

the appointment ends weeks of speculation following the landslide victory of the justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- led by tayyip erdogan two weeks ago .
the charismatic mr erdogan himself was unable to contest the polls on account of a 1998 conviction for inciting religious hatred and is barred from the post .
gul right man for the job ?
abdullah gul , a close confidant of erdogan and deputy leader of the conservative islamic akp party was handpicked personally by erdogan to head turkey .
he takes over the reins of a country , whose ailing economy and ambitions to join the european union needs a strong pro-reform and pro-west leader at the helm .
the akp which has consistently announced sweeping plans for economic and social reforms to meet eu standards ever since its whopping win , is convinced that gul is the right man for the job .
" it ’ s time to start work .
from this hour onward it ’ s time to mobilize and work night and day to solve the problems of our people , " a smiling gul said after president ahmet necdet sezer invited him to form a government .
" the government will be ready by monday , " he said .
all the right credentials abdullah gul , who speaks fluent english , is a familiar face to the united states , which may look to him for use of turkey ’ s air bases in the event of an attack on neighboring iraq .
financial markets are also counting on gul to wisely deal with a $ 16 billion imf crisis pact to pull itself out of one of the worst economic slump since 1945 .
gul was a member of turkey ’ s first islamist-led government , which was forced from power after a year in 1997 by an army-led pressure campaign .
but gul himself is known for his balanced demeanor and has never had a run-in with courts .
the akp , which presents itself as pro-western and pro-market evolved from the wing of a now banned islamist party .
aware of the suspicions his party faces , gul said in a recent interview , " we are rational people first and foremost .
we are not militant islamists . "
erdogan unveils sweeeping reforms but despite gul being a strong figure in his own right , analysts fear that he might be overshadowed by the more charismatic erdogan and be little more than a caretaker .
erdogan himself has flaunted his pro-western ambitions to the world and has made no bones of his leading role by announcing a program of social and economic reform at a news conference held as gul visited the presidential palace .
" we are building a new world and this new world will bring the east and west together in turkey , " erdogan said .
erdogan ’ s new program includes " immediate " new penalties to deter torture , a long-standing sore point that has marred turkey ’ s relations with the eu . he has also announced plans to reform turkey ’ s education system , a move which will be followed closely by turkey ’ s secular establishment to ensure that the country ’ s secular principles are not diluted .
erdogan has also pledged to give priority to privatization , tax reforms and a shake-up of a crumbling social security system and the energy sector .
turkey 's eu membership high on akp agenda but for now it ’ s turkey ’ s entry into the european union that is high up on the agenda of the akp .
next week erdogan begins a whirlwind tour of nine european union countries to promote his country ’ s bid to become a member .
but it remains to be seen whether the eu will agree to set a date to open membership talks with turkey until reforms have been clearly implemented .
pierre lellouche , head of the french delegation at a nato parliamentary assembly meeting in istanbul told reuters that the west faced an onslaught by muslim extremists and needed to " help modern muslim countries to develop a modern tolerant form of islam . "
" if we eliminate this hope in the one muslim nation that has a history of secularism -lrb- turkey -rrb- then we ’ ll fabricate ourselves an anti-western islam in this country ...

the appointment ends weeks of speculation following the landslide victory of the justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- led by tayyip erdogan two weeks ago .
the charismatic mr erdogan himself was unable to contest the polls on account of a 1998 conviction for inciting religious hatred and is barred from the post .
gul right man for the job ?
abdullah gul , a close confidant of erdogan and deputy leader of the conservative islamic akp party was handpicked personally by erdogan to head turkey .
he takes over the reins of a country , whose ailing economy and ambitions to join the european union needs a strong pro-reform and pro-west leader at the helm .
the akp which has consistently announced sweeping plans for economic and social reforms to meet eu standards ever since its whopping win , is convinced that gul is the right man for the job .
" it ’ s time to start work .
from this hour onward it ’ s time to mobilize and work night and day to solve the problems of our people , " a smiling gul said after president ahmet necdet sezer invited him to form a government .
" the government will be ready by monday , " he said .
all the right credentials abdullah gul , who speaks fluent english , is a familiar face to the united states , which may look to him for use of turkey ’ s air bases in the event of an attack on neighboring iraq .
financial markets are also counting on gul to wisely deal with a $ 16 billion imf crisis pact to pull itself out of one of the worst economic slump since 1945 .
gul was a member of turkey ’ s first islamist-led government , which was forced from power after a year in 1997 by an army-led pressure campaign .
but gul himself is known for his balanced demeanor and has never had a run-in with courts .
the akp , which presents itself as pro-western and pro-market evolved from the wing of a now banned islamist party .
aware of the suspicions his party faces , gul said in a recent interview , " we are rational people first and foremost .
we are not militant islamists . "
erdogan unveils sweeeping reforms but despite gul being a strong figure in his own right , analysts fear that he might be overshadowed by the more charismatic erdogan and be little more than a caretaker .
erdogan himself has flaunted his pro-western ambitions to the world and has made no bones of his leading role by announcing a program of social and economic reform at a news conference held as gul visited the presidential palace .
" we are building a new world and this new world will bring the east and west together in turkey , " erdogan said .
erdogan ’ s new program includes " immediate " new penalties to deter torture , a long-standing sore point that has marred turkey ’ s relations with the eu . he has also announced plans to reform turkey ’ s education system , a move which will be followed closely by turkey ’ s secular establishment to ensure that the country ’ s secular principles are not diluted .
erdogan has also pledged to give priority to privatization , tax reforms and a shake-up of a crumbling social security system and the energy sector .
turkey 's eu membership high on akp agenda but for now it ’ s turkey ’ s entry into the european union that is high up on the agenda of the akp .
next week erdogan begins a whirlwind tour of nine european union countries to promote his country ’ s bid to become a member .
but it remains to be seen whether the eu will agree to set a date to open membership talks with turkey until reforms have been clearly implemented .
pierre lellouche , head of the french delegation at a nato parliamentary assembly meeting in istanbul told reuters that the west faced an onslaught by muslim extremists and needed to " help modern muslim countries to develop a modern tolerant form of islam . "
" if we eliminate this hope in the one muslim nation that has a history of secularism -lrb- turkey -rrb- then we ’ ll fabricate ourselves an anti-western islam in this country ...

on friday , the ten , mainly from the former communist bloc , set out a common demand for entry terms which would not leave them financially worse off when they join the european union in 2004 .
" the net budgetary position of the new member states should be better that their position prior to their entry into the eu , " said a joint statement presented by polish prime minister leszek miller after talks in warsaw .
candidates worried obout not getting a fair deal poland , hungary , the czech and slovak republics , slovenia , estonia , latvia , lithuania and the mediterranean islands of cyprus and malta fear that the eu ’ s slow phase-in of aid to the tune of 40 billion euro proposed in brussels ‘ enlargement budget would leave their coffers empty initially .
the financial package offered at last month ’ s eu summit in brussels is 2,5 billion euro less than the original budget proposed by the european commission .
the candidate countries are also peeved that crunch issues such as the budget , agricultural aid and infrastructure funding are still to be resolved ahead of the eu ’ s enlargement summit in december in copenhagen .
agricultural aid in particularly remains a sticking point with the candidate countries , as they will initially only receive a quarter of the subsidies common in the west , for farming .
according to a eu resolution , the ten new entries will only receive the same support as the west from the eu in the year 2013 .
at the warsaw summit , the ten east european candidates demanded that the eu raise the initial agricultural aid and cut short the waiting period .
poland , with its massive agricultural sector , led calls for the eu to improve a proposal to phase in direct payments to farmers over 10 years , starting at 25 percent of eu levels .
candidates argue that if there is a delay to full farm payments , allocated under the eu ’ s common agricultural policy , their financial contributions to the eu budget should be capped accordingly .
brussels puts finishing touches to new deal however brussels has been involved in drawing up a new package that includes cash and concessions to seal a deal on enlargement .
the ten countries are to offered an extra 1-2 billion euro and a range of other concessions ranging from increasing some farm quotas to a provision allowing hunters in latvia to continue their pursuit of bear and lynx .
the new package is to be discussed by eu foreign ministers next week and designed to pave the way for an agreement with candidate states at the copenhagen summit indecember .
blair tries to allay concerns european social democratic leaders including britain ’ s tony blair , who attended the warsaw summit , attempted to soothe candidates ‘ fears .
after meeting with polish prime minister leszek miller , blair promised that candidates would not lose out , though he did not elaborate .
" the whole purpose of the negotiations is to make sure that no accession country is worse off as a result , " blair said .
" for poland and the polish people i believe that membership of the european union will mean a great deal in terms of living standards and for polish influence in the world . "
eu postpones enlargement the discontent ahead of the warsaw meeting was heightened by the disclosure that the eu had a set a new target date for the ten new countries to join .
originally slated for january 2004 , the entry of the ten new states has now been postponed to april or may 2004 .
günther verheugen , eu enlargement commissioner urged candidate states not to worry about the delay .
he said that it would take time for the eu ’ s 15 member states to ratify the treaty paving the way for accession .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.11.2002 germany closes the defense wallet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have one more year of enduring freedom ... but then what ?
germany has voted to commit its troops to a further year of enduring freedom , but has told its nato allies to forget about any further expensive military adventures until the country 's financial situation improves . the cash-strapped german government said on thursday that it remains fully committed to its role as a member of nato but added there is little spare money available to the administration to spend on future military adventures .
however , the government secured majority backing in a vote on friday to decide the fate of german soldiers serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
majority vote sees german troops extend tour by a year a total of 473 legislators voted in favor of the one-year extension that will keep 2,450 troops involved in operation enduring freedom throughout afghanistan , kuwait , the horn of africa and surrounding seas .
only 11 voted against and five abstained .
with the nato summit in prague just under a week away , germany 's statement on its reluctance to commit to further military spending will immediately muddy the already murky waters surrounding one of the meeting 's agenda-topping subjects - a nato multinational rapid reaction force .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us proposals set out a ' global police ' force ready to react within days .
the united states is expected to steer the discussions at the summit towards the possibility of creating a 21,000- strong force made up of international nato troops that could be deployed anywhere in the world in under five days .
fischer diplomatic about us plans for rapid nato force german foreign minister joschka fischer diplomatically called the plan " constructive " but stressed that it should not be allowed to interfere with the european union 's own idea of creating a similar force made up of european soldiers only .
" there should be no doubling-up , " he added .
the idea of a european rapid force is one vigorously championed by germany and france but one washington views nervously .
addressing the bundestag on germany 's role as a member of nato , fischer told parliament that germany and its allies within the organization should look towards a more political approach to possible conflict and to adopt a policy of diplomatic pre-emption in peace threatening situations .
" crisis prevention is just as important as crisis reaction .
the summit must not be solely about military capabilities , " he said .
it is these military capabilities that are pre-occupying the german government at this time of belt-tightening .
after one of the bleakest weeks in the country 's recent financial history , the red-green coalition appears even less inclined to throw money in the direction of defense spending than it has before .
germany can not afford to spend big on defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister peter struck has warned nato allies that germany has no money for military actions .
defense minister peter struck said that germany 's financial problems of rising public debt and sluggish growth meant that the country could not afford a massive increase in its own military involvement and capabilities .
" i am not going to promise nato castles in the air , " he told the bundestag on thursday .
" i can not justify it and i do not want to justify it . "
struck added that , accepting that calls for increased military spending would be a major theme at the nato summit , other members would have to take into account the current sickly state of germany 's financial situation .
for ' other members ' herr struck could have substituted the united states and britain .
both countries have called on european nations to pull their weight in the transatlantic alliance by stepping up military might in the fight against terrorism .
fischer says policy of ' force only ' will lose the war joschka fischer agreed that nato had to adapt to the new threats posed by international terrorists but warned that while the war on terror had to be fought decisively by military means , " at the same time we must not restrict ourselves to that , otherwise we will fail . "
fischer quoted the success of the rapid intervention by nato forces that prevented a civil war in macedonia last august as a case in study .
however , with the german government and public alike concerned with matters at home and with its forces already committed to further service overseas , any future alliance plans that include military action will have to count on germany as a political power only .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.11.2002 germany closes the defense wallet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have one more year of enduring freedom ... but then what ?
germany has voted to commit its troops to a further year of enduring freedom , but has told its nato allies to forget about any further expensive military adventures until the country 's financial situation improves . the cash-strapped german government said on thursday that it remains fully committed to its role as a member of nato but added there is little spare money available to the administration to spend on future military adventures .
however , the government secured majority backing in a vote on friday to decide the fate of german soldiers serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
majority vote sees german troops extend tour by a year a total of 473 legislators voted in favor of the one-year extension that will keep 2,450 troops involved in operation enduring freedom throughout afghanistan , kuwait , the horn of africa and surrounding seas .
only 11 voted against and five abstained .
with the nato summit in prague just under a week away , germany 's statement on its reluctance to commit to further military spending will immediately muddy the already murky waters surrounding one of the meeting 's agenda-topping subjects - a nato multinational rapid reaction force .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us proposals set out a ' global police ' force ready to react within days .
the united states is expected to steer the discussions at the summit towards the possibility of creating a 21,000- strong force made up of international nato troops that could be deployed anywhere in the world in under five days .
fischer diplomatic about us plans for rapid nato force german foreign minister joschka fischer diplomatically called the plan " constructive " but stressed that it should not be allowed to interfere with the european union 's own idea of creating a similar force made up of european soldiers only .
" there should be no doubling-up , " he added .
the idea of a european rapid force is one vigorously championed by germany and france but one washington views nervously .
addressing the bundestag on germany 's role as a member of nato , fischer told parliament that germany and its allies within the organization should look towards a more political approach to possible conflict and to adopt a policy of diplomatic pre-emption in peace threatening situations .
" crisis prevention is just as important as crisis reaction .
the summit must not be solely about military capabilities , " he said .
it is these military capabilities that are pre-occupying the german government at this time of belt-tightening .
after one of the bleakest weeks in the country 's recent financial history , the red-green coalition appears even less inclined to throw money in the direction of defense spending than it has before .
germany can not afford to spend big on defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister peter struck has warned nato allies that germany has no money for military actions .
defense minister peter struck said that germany 's financial problems of rising public debt and sluggish growth meant that the country could not afford a massive increase in its own military involvement and capabilities .
" i am not going to promise nato castles in the air , " he told the bundestag on thursday .
" i can not justify it and i do not want to justify it . "
struck added that , accepting that calls for increased military spending would be a major theme at the nato summit , other members would have to take into account the current sickly state of germany 's financial situation .
for ' other members ' herr struck could have substituted the united states and britain .
both countries have called on european nations to pull their weight in the transatlantic alliance by stepping up military might in the fight against terrorism .
fischer says policy of ' force only ' will lose the war joschka fischer agreed that nato had to adapt to the new threats posed by international terrorists but warned that while the war on terror had to be fought decisively by military means , " at the same time we must not restrict ourselves to that , otherwise we will fail . "
fischer quoted the success of the rapid intervention by nato forces that prevented a civil war in macedonia last august as a case in study .
however , with the german government and public alike concerned with matters at home and with its forces already committed to further service overseas , any future alliance plans that include military action will have to count on germany as a political power only .

the appointment ends weeks of speculation following the landslide victory of the justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- led by tayyip erdogan two weeks ago .
the charismatic mr erdogan himself was unable to contest the polls on account of a 1998 conviction for inciting religious hatred and is barred from the post .
gul right man for the job ?
abdullah gul , a close confidant of erdogan and deputy leader of the conservative islamic akp party was handpicked personally by erdogan to head turkey .
he takes over the reins of a country , whose ailing economy and ambitions to join the european union needs a strong pro-reform and pro-west leader at the helm .
the akp which has consistently announced sweeping plans for economic and social reforms to meet eu standards ever since its whopping win , is convinced that gul is the right man for the job .
" it ’ s time to start work .
from this hour onward it ’ s time to mobilize and work night and day to solve the problems of our people , " a smiling gul said after president ahmet necdet sezer invited him to form a government .
" the government will be ready by monday , " he said .
all the right credentials abdullah gul , who speaks fluent english , is a familiar face to the united states , which may look to him for use of turkey ’ s air bases in the event of an attack on neighboring iraq .
financial markets are also counting on gul to wisely deal with a $ 16 billion imf crisis pact to pull itself out of one of the worst economic slump since 1945 .
gul was a member of turkey ’ s first islamist-led government , which was forced from power after a year in 1997 by an army-led pressure campaign .
but gul himself is known for his balanced demeanor and has never had a run-in with courts .
the akp , which presents itself as pro-western and pro-market evolved from the wing of a now banned islamist party .
aware of the suspicions his party faces , gul said in a recent interview , " we are rational people first and foremost .
we are not militant islamists . "
erdogan unveils sweeeping reforms but despite gul being a strong figure in his own right , analysts fear that he might be overshadowed by the more charismatic erdogan and be little more than a caretaker .
erdogan himself has flaunted his pro-western ambitions to the world and has made no bones of his leading role by announcing a program of social and economic reform at a news conference held as gul visited the presidential palace .
" we are building a new world and this new world will bring the east and west together in turkey , " erdogan said .
erdogan ’ s new program includes " immediate " new penalties to deter torture , a long-standing sore point that has marred turkey ’ s relations with the eu . he has also announced plans to reform turkey ’ s education system , a move which will be followed closely by turkey ’ s secular establishment to ensure that the country ’ s secular principles are not diluted .
erdogan has also pledged to give priority to privatization , tax reforms and a shake-up of a crumbling social security system and the energy sector .
turkey 's eu membership high on akp agenda but for now it ’ s turkey ’ s entry into the european union that is high up on the agenda of the akp .
next week erdogan begins a whirlwind tour of nine european union countries to promote his country ’ s bid to become a member .
but it remains to be seen whether the eu will agree to set a date to open membership talks with turkey until reforms have been clearly implemented .
pierre lellouche , head of the french delegation at a nato parliamentary assembly meeting in istanbul told reuters that the west faced an onslaught by muslim extremists and needed to " help modern muslim countries to develop a modern tolerant form of islam . "
" if we eliminate this hope in the one muslim nation that has a history of secularism -lrb- turkey -rrb- then we ’ ll fabricate ourselves an anti-western islam in this country ...

on friday , the ten , mainly from the former communist bloc , set out a common demand for entry terms which would not leave them financially worse off when they join the european union in 2004 .
" the net budgetary position of the new member states should be better that their position prior to their entry into the eu , " said a joint statement presented by polish prime minister leszek miller after talks in warsaw .
candidates worried obout not getting a fair deal poland , hungary , the czech and slovak republics , slovenia , estonia , latvia , lithuania and the mediterranean islands of cyprus and malta fear that the eu ’ s slow phase-in of aid to the tune of 40 billion euro proposed in brussels ‘ enlargement budget would leave their coffers empty initially .
the financial package offered at last month ’ s eu summit in brussels is 2,5 billion euro less than the original budget proposed by the european commission .
the candidate countries are also peeved that crunch issues such as the budget , agricultural aid and infrastructure funding are still to be resolved ahead of the eu ’ s enlargement summit in december in copenhagen .
agricultural aid in particularly remains a sticking point with the candidate countries , as they will initially only receive a quarter of the subsidies common in the west , for farming .
according to a eu resolution , the ten new entries will only receive the same support as the west from the eu in the year 2013 .
at the warsaw summit , the ten east european candidates demanded that the eu raise the initial agricultural aid and cut short the waiting period .
poland , with its massive agricultural sector , led calls for the eu to improve a proposal to phase in direct payments to farmers over 10 years , starting at 25 percent of eu levels .
candidates argue that if there is a delay to full farm payments , allocated under the eu ’ s common agricultural policy , their financial contributions to the eu budget should be capped accordingly .
brussels puts finishing touches to new deal however brussels has been involved in drawing up a new package that includes cash and concessions to seal a deal on enlargement .
the ten countries are to offered an extra 1-2 billion euro and a range of other concessions ranging from increasing some farm quotas to a provision allowing hunters in latvia to continue their pursuit of bear and lynx .
the new package is to be discussed by eu foreign ministers next week and designed to pave the way for an agreement with candidate states at the copenhagen summit indecember .
blair tries to allay concerns european social democratic leaders including britain ’ s tony blair , who attended the warsaw summit , attempted to soothe candidates ‘ fears .
after meeting with polish prime minister leszek miller , blair promised that candidates would not lose out , though he did not elaborate .
" the whole purpose of the negotiations is to make sure that no accession country is worse off as a result , " blair said .
" for poland and the polish people i believe that membership of the european union will mean a great deal in terms of living standards and for polish influence in the world . "
eu postpones enlargement the discontent ahead of the warsaw meeting was heightened by the disclosure that the eu had a set a new target date for the ten new countries to join .

the appointment ends weeks of speculation following the landslide victory of the justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- led by tayyip erdogan two weeks ago .
the charismatic mr erdogan himself was unable to contest the polls on account of a 1998 conviction for inciting religious hatred and is barred from the post .
gul right man for the job ?
abdullah gul , a close confidant of erdogan and deputy leader of the conservative islamic akp party was handpicked personally by erdogan to head turkey .
he takes over the reins of a country , whose ailing economy and ambitions to join the european union needs a strong pro-reform and pro-west leader at the helm .
the akp which has consistently announced sweeping plans for economic and social reforms to meet eu standards ever since its whopping win , is convinced that gul is the right man for the job .
" it ’ s time to start work .
from this hour onward it ’ s time to mobilize and work night and day to solve the problems of our people , " a smiling gul said after president ahmet necdet sezer invited him to form a government .
" the government will be ready by monday , " he said .
all the right credentials abdullah gul , who speaks fluent english , is a familiar face to the united states , which may look to him for use of turkey ’ s air bases in the event of an attack on neighboring iraq .
financial markets are also counting on gul to wisely deal with a $ 16 billion imf crisis pact to pull itself out of one of the worst economic slump since 1945 .
gul was a member of turkey ’ s first islamist-led government , which was forced from power after a year in 1997 by an army-led pressure campaign .
but gul himself is known for his balanced demeanor and has never had a run-in with courts .
the akp , which presents itself as pro-western and pro-market evolved from the wing of a now banned islamist party .
aware of the suspicions his party faces , gul said in a recent interview , " we are rational people first and foremost .
we are not militant islamists . "
erdogan unveils sweeeping reforms but despite gul being a strong figure in his own right , analysts fear that he might be overshadowed by the more charismatic erdogan and be little more than a caretaker .
erdogan himself has flaunted his pro-western ambitions to the world and has made no bones of his leading role by announcing a program of social and economic reform at a news conference held as gul visited the presidential palace .
" we are building a new world and this new world will bring the east and west together in turkey , " erdogan said .
erdogan ’ s new program includes " immediate " new penalties to deter torture , a long-standing sore point that has marred turkey ’ s relations with the eu . he has also announced plans to reform turkey ’ s education system , a move which will be followed closely by turkey ’ s secular establishment to ensure that the country ’ s secular principles are not diluted .
erdogan has also pledged to give priority to privatization , tax reforms and a shake-up of a crumbling social security system and the energy sector .
turkey 's eu membership high on akp agenda but for now it ’ s turkey ’ s entry into the european union that is high up on the agenda of the akp .
next week erdogan begins a whirlwind tour of nine european union countries to promote his country ’ s bid to become a member .
but it remains to be seen whether the eu will agree to set a date to open membership talks with turkey until reforms have been clearly implemented .
pierre lellouche , head of the french delegation at a nato parliamentary assembly meeting in istanbul told reuters that the west faced an onslaught by muslim extremists and needed to " help modern muslim countries to develop a modern tolerant form of islam . "
" if we eliminate this hope in the one muslim nation that has a history of secularism -lrb- turkey -rrb- then we ’ ll fabricate ourselves an anti-western islam in this country ...

on friday , the ten , mainly from the former communist bloc , set out a common demand for entry terms which would not leave them financially worse off when they join the european union in 2004 .
" the net budgetary position of the new member states should be better that their position prior to their entry into the eu , " said a joint statement presented by polish prime minister leszek miller after talks in warsaw .
candidates worried obout not getting a fair deal poland , hungary , the czech and slovak republics , slovenia , estonia , latvia , lithuania and the mediterranean islands of cyprus and malta fear that the eu ’ s slow phase-in of aid to the tune of 40 billion euro proposed in brussels ‘ enlargement budget would leave their coffers empty initially .
the financial package offered at last month ’ s eu summit in brussels is 2,5 billion euro less than the original budget proposed by the european commission .
the candidate countries are also peeved that crunch issues such as the budget , agricultural aid and infrastructure funding are still to be resolved ahead of the eu ’ s enlargement summit in december in copenhagen .
agricultural aid in particularly remains a sticking point with the candidate countries , as they will initially only receive a quarter of the subsidies common in the west , for farming .
according to a eu resolution , the ten new entries will only receive the same support as the west from the eu in the year 2013 .
at the warsaw summit , the ten east european candidates demanded that the eu raise the initial agricultural aid and cut short the waiting period .
poland , with its massive agricultural sector , led calls for the eu to improve a proposal to phase in direct payments to farmers over 10 years , starting at 25 percent of eu levels .
candidates argue that if there is a delay to full farm payments , allocated under the eu ’ s common agricultural policy , their financial contributions to the eu budget should be capped accordingly .
brussels puts finishing touches to new deal however brussels has been involved in drawing up a new package that includes cash and concessions to seal a deal on enlargement .
the ten countries are to offered an extra 1-2 billion euro and a range of other concessions ranging from increasing some farm quotas to a provision allowing hunters in latvia to continue their pursuit of bear and lynx .
the new package is to be discussed by eu foreign ministers next week and designed to pave the way for an agreement with candidate states at the copenhagen summit indecember .
blair tries to allay concerns european social democratic leaders including britain ’ s tony blair , who attended the warsaw summit , attempted to soothe candidates ‘ fears .
after meeting with polish prime minister leszek miller , blair promised that candidates would not lose out , though he did not elaborate .
" the whole purpose of the negotiations is to make sure that no accession country is worse off as a result , " blair said .
" for poland and the polish people i believe that membership of the european union will mean a great deal in terms of living standards and for polish influence in the world . "
eu postpones enlargement the discontent ahead of the warsaw meeting was heightened by the disclosure that the eu had a set a new target date for the ten new countries to join .
originally slated for january 2004 , the entry of the ten new states has now been postponed to april or may 2004 .

on friday , the ten , mainly from the former communist bloc , set out a common demand for entry terms which would not leave them financially worse off when they join the european union in 2004 .
" the net budgetary position of the new member states should be better that their position prior to their entry into the eu , " said a joint statement presented by polish prime minister leszek miller after talks in warsaw .
candidates worried obout not getting a fair deal poland , hungary , the czech and slovak republics , slovenia , estonia , latvia , lithuania and the mediterranean islands of cyprus and malta fear that the eu ’ s slow phase-in of aid to the tune of 40 billion euro proposed in brussels ‘ enlargement budget would leave their coffers empty initially .
the financial package offered at last month ’ s eu summit in brussels is 2,5 billion euro less than the original budget proposed by the european commission .
the candidate countries are also peeved that crunch issues such as the budget , agricultural aid and infrastructure funding are still to be resolved ahead of the eu ’ s enlargement summit in december in copenhagen .
agricultural aid in particularly remains a sticking point with the candidate countries , as they will initially only receive a quarter of the subsidies common in the west , for farming .
according to a eu resolution , the ten new entries will only receive the same support as the west from the eu in the year 2013 .
at the warsaw summit , the ten east european candidates demanded that the eu raise the initial agricultural aid and cut short the waiting period .
poland , with its massive agricultural sector , led calls for the eu to improve a proposal to phase in direct payments to farmers over 10 years , starting at 25 percent of eu levels .
candidates argue that if there is a delay to full farm payments , allocated under the eu ’ s common agricultural policy , their financial contributions to the eu budget should be capped accordingly .
brussels puts finishing touches to new deal however brussels has been involved in drawing up a new package that includes cash and concessions to seal a deal on enlargement .
the ten countries are to offered an extra 1-2 billion euro and a range of other concessions ranging from increasing some farm quotas to a provision allowing hunters in latvia to continue their pursuit of bear and lynx .
the new package is to be discussed by eu foreign ministers next week and designed to pave the way for an agreement with candidate states at the copenhagen summit indecember .
blair tries to allay concerns european social democratic leaders including britain ’ s tony blair , who attended the warsaw summit , attempted to soothe candidates ‘ fears .
after meeting with polish prime minister leszek miller , blair promised that candidates would not lose out , though he did not elaborate .
" the whole purpose of the negotiations is to make sure that no accession country is worse off as a result , " blair said .
" for poland and the polish people i believe that membership of the european union will mean a great deal in terms of living standards and for polish influence in the world . "
eu postpones enlargement the discontent ahead of the warsaw meeting was heightened by the disclosure that the eu had a set a new target date for the ten new countries to join .
originally slated for january 2004 , the entry of the ten new states has now been postponed to april or may 2004 .
günther verheugen , eu enlargement commissioner urged candidate states not to worry about the delay .
he said that it would take time for the eu ’ s 15 member states to ratify the treaty paving the way for accession .
speaking in warsaw on thursday , he said , " we can not put 6,000 -lrb- pages -rrb- of treaty on the table and then tell national parliaments , 'you have six months to read it , ratify it and sign it' .

germany has voted to commit its troops to a further year of enduring freedom , but has told its nato allies to forget about any further expensive military adventures until the country 's financial situation improves . the cash-strapped german government said on thursday that it remains fully committed to its role as a member of nato but added there is little spare money available to the administration to spend on future military adventures .
however , the government secured majority backing in a vote on friday to decide the fate of german soldiers serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
majority vote sees german troops extend tour by a year a total of 473 legislators voted in favor of the one-year extension that will keep 2,450 troops involved in operation enduring freedom throughout afghanistan , kuwait , the horn of africa and surrounding seas .
only 11 voted against and five abstained .
with the nato summit in prague just under a week away , germany 's statement on its reluctance to commit to further military spending will immediately muddy the already murky waters surrounding one of the meeting 's agenda-topping subjects - a nato multinational rapid reaction force .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us proposals set out a ' global police ' force ready to react within days .
the united states is expected to steer the discussions at the summit towards the possibility of creating a 21,000- strong force made up of international nato troops that could be deployed anywhere in the world in under five days .
fischer diplomatic about us plans for rapid nato force german foreign minister joschka fischer diplomatically called the plan " constructive " but stressed that it should not be allowed to interfere with the european union 's own idea of creating a similar force made up of european soldiers only .
" there should be no doubling-up , " he added .
the idea of a european rapid force is one vigorously championed by germany and france but one washington views nervously .
addressing the bundestag on germany 's role as a member of nato , fischer told parliament that germany and its allies within the organization should look towards a more political approach to possible conflict and to adopt a policy of diplomatic pre-emption in peace threatening situations .
" crisis prevention is just as important as crisis reaction .
the summit must not be solely about military capabilities , " he said .
it is these military capabilities that are pre-occupying the german government at this time of belt-tightening .

germany can not afford to spend big on defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister peter struck has warned nato allies that germany has no money for military actions .
defense minister peter struck said that germany 's financial problems of rising public debt and sluggish growth meant that the country could not afford a massive increase in its own military involvement and capabilities .
" i am not going to promise nato castles in the air , " he told the bundestag on thursday .
" i can not justify it and i do not want to justify it . "
struck added that , accepting that calls for increased military spending would be a major theme at the nato summit , other members would have to take into account the current sickly state of germany 's financial situation .
for ' other members ' herr struck could have substituted the united states and britain .
both countries have called on european nations to pull their weight in the transatlantic alliance by stepping up military might in the fight against terrorism .
fischer says policy of ' force only ' will lose the war joschka fischer agreed that nato had to adapt to the new threats posed by international terrorists but warned that while the war on terror had to be fought decisively by military means , " at the same time we must not restrict ourselves to that , otherwise we will fail . "
fischer quoted the success of the rapid intervention by nato forces that prevented a civil war in macedonia last august as a case in study .
however , with the german government and public alike concerned with matters at home and with its forces already committed to further service overseas , any future alliance plans that include military action will have to count on germany as a political power only .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.11.2002 germany closes the defense wallet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have one more year of enduring freedom ... but then what ?
germany has voted to commit its troops to a further year of enduring freedom , but has told its nato allies to forget about any further expensive military adventures until the country 's financial situation improves . the cash-strapped german government said on thursday that it remains fully committed to its role as a member of nato but added there is little spare money available to the administration to spend on future military adventures .
however , the government secured majority backing in a vote on friday to decide the fate of german soldiers serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
majority vote sees german troops extend tour by a year a total of 473 legislators voted in favor of the one-year extension that will keep 2,450 troops involved in operation enduring freedom throughout afghanistan , kuwait , the horn of africa and surrounding seas .
only 11 voted against and five abstained .
with the nato summit in prague just under a week away , germany 's statement on its reluctance to commit to further military spending will immediately muddy the already murky waters surrounding one of the meeting 's agenda-topping subjects - a nato multinational rapid reaction force .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us proposals set out a ' global police ' force ready to react within days .
the united states is expected to steer the discussions at the summit towards the possibility of creating a 21,000- strong force made up of international nato troops that could be deployed anywhere in the world in under five days .
fischer diplomatic about us plans for rapid nato force german foreign minister joschka fischer diplomatically called the plan " constructive " but stressed that it should not be allowed to interfere with the european union 's own idea of creating a similar force made up of european soldiers only .
" there should be no doubling-up , " he added .
the idea of a european rapid force is one vigorously championed by germany and france but one washington views nervously .
addressing the bundestag on germany 's role as a member of nato , fischer told parliament that germany and its allies within the organization should look towards a more political approach to possible conflict and to adopt a policy of diplomatic pre-emption in peace threatening situations .
" crisis prevention is just as important as crisis reaction .
the summit must not be solely about military capabilities , " he said .
it is these military capabilities that are pre-occupying the german government at this time of belt-tightening .
after one of the bleakest weeks in the country 's recent financial history , the red-green coalition appears even less inclined to throw money in the direction of defense spending than it has before .
germany can not afford to spend big on defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister peter struck has warned nato allies that germany has no money for military actions .
defense minister peter struck said that germany 's financial problems of rising public debt and sluggish growth meant that the country could not afford a massive increase in its own military involvement and capabilities .
" i am not going to promise nato castles in the air , " he told the bundestag on thursday .
" i can not justify it and i do not want to justify it . "
struck added that , accepting that calls for increased military spending would be a major theme at the nato summit , other members would have to take into account the current sickly state of germany 's financial situation .
for ' other members ' herr struck could have substituted the united states and britain .
both countries have called on european nations to pull their weight in the transatlantic alliance by stepping up military might in the fight against terrorism .
fischer says policy of ' force only ' will lose the war joschka fischer agreed that nato had to adapt to the new threats posed by international terrorists but warned that while the war on terror had to be fought decisively by military means , " at the same time we must not restrict ourselves to that , otherwise we will fail . "
fischer quoted the success of the rapid intervention by nato forces that prevented a civil war in macedonia last august as a case in study .
however , with the german government and public alike concerned with matters at home and with its forces already committed to further service overseas , any future alliance plans that include military action will have to count on germany as a political power only .

where are they now ? -lrb- 04/02/2002 -rrb- another year of " enduring freedom " for german troops on thursday germany 's parliament debates whether to prolong the deployment of german troops under the aegis of " enduring freedom " for another year .
the vote next week may help thaw us-german relations .

the appointment ends weeks of speculation following the landslide victory of the justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- led by tayyip erdogan two weeks ago .
the charismatic mr erdogan himself was unable to contest the polls on account of a 1998 conviction for inciting religious hatred and is barred from the post .
gul right man for the job ?
abdullah gul , a close confidant of erdogan and deputy leader of the conservative islamic akp party was handpicked personally by erdogan to head turkey .
he takes over the reins of a country , whose ailing economy and ambitions to join the european union needs a strong pro-reform and pro-west leader at the helm .
the akp which has consistently announced sweeping plans for economic and social reforms to meet eu standards ever since its whopping win , is convinced that gul is the right man for the job .
" it ’ s time to start work .
from this hour onward it ’ s time to mobilize and work night and day to solve the problems of our people , " a smiling gul said after president ahmet necdet sezer invited him to form a government .
" the government will be ready by monday , " he said .
all the right credentials abdullah gul , who speaks fluent english , is a familiar face to the united states , which may look to him for use of turkey ’ s air bases in the event of an attack on neighboring iraq .
financial markets are also counting on gul to wisely deal with a $ 16 billion imf crisis pact to pull itself out of one of the worst economic slump since 1945 .
gul was a member of turkey ’ s first islamist-led government , which was forced from power after a year in 1997 by an army-led pressure campaign .
but gul himself is known for his balanced demeanor and has never had a run-in with courts .
the akp , which presents itself as pro-western and pro-market evolved from the wing of a now banned islamist party .
aware of the suspicions his party faces , gul said in a recent interview , " we are rational people first and foremost .
we are not militant islamists . "
erdogan unveils sweeeping reforms but despite gul being a strong figure in his own right , analysts fear that he might be overshadowed by the more charismatic erdogan and be little more than a caretaker .
erdogan himself has flaunted his pro-western ambitions to the world and has made no bones of his leading role by announcing a program of social and economic reform at a news conference held as gul visited the presidential palace .
" we are building a new world and this new world will bring the east and west together in turkey , " erdogan said .
erdogan ’ s new program includes " immediate " new penalties to deter torture , a long-standing sore point that has marred turkey ’ s relations with the eu . he has also announced plans to reform turkey ’ s education system , a move which will be followed closely by turkey ’ s secular establishment to ensure that the country ’ s secular principles are not diluted .
erdogan has also pledged to give priority to privatization , tax reforms and a shake-up of a crumbling social security system and the energy sector .
turkey 's eu membership high on akp agenda but for now it ’ s turkey ’ s entry into the european union that is high up on the agenda of the akp .
next week erdogan begins a whirlwind tour of nine european union countries to promote his country ’ s bid to become a member .
but it remains to be seen whether the eu will agree to set a date to open membership talks with turkey until reforms have been clearly implemented .
pierre lellouche , head of the french delegation at a nato parliamentary assembly meeting in istanbul told reuters that the west faced an onslaught by muslim extremists and needed to " help modern muslim countries to develop a modern tolerant form of islam . "

the appointment ends weeks of speculation following the landslide victory of the justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- led by tayyip erdogan two weeks ago .
the charismatic mr erdogan himself was unable to contest the polls on account of a 1998 conviction for inciting religious hatred and is barred from the post .
gul right man for the job ?
abdullah gul , a close confidant of erdogan and deputy leader of the conservative islamic akp party was handpicked personally by erdogan to head turkey .
he takes over the reins of a country , whose ailing economy and ambitions to join the european union needs a strong pro-reform and pro-west leader at the helm .
the akp which has consistently announced sweeping plans for economic and social reforms to meet eu standards ever since its whopping win , is convinced that gul is the right man for the job .
" it ’ s time to start work .
from this hour onward it ’ s time to mobilize and work night and day to solve the problems of our people , " a smiling gul said after president ahmet necdet sezer invited him to form a government .
" the government will be ready by monday , " he said .
all the right credentials abdullah gul , who speaks fluent english , is a familiar face to the united states , which may look to him for use of turkey ’ s air bases in the event of an attack on neighboring iraq .
financial markets are also counting on gul to wisely deal with a $ 16 billion imf crisis pact to pull itself out of one of the worst economic slump since 1945 .
gul was a member of turkey ’ s first islamist-led government , which was forced from power after a year in 1997 by an army-led pressure campaign .
but gul himself is known for his balanced demeanor and has never had a run-in with courts .
the akp , which presents itself as pro-western and pro-market evolved from the wing of a now banned islamist party .
aware of the suspicions his party faces , gul said in a recent interview , " we are rational people first and foremost .
we are not militant islamists . "
erdogan unveils sweeeping reforms but despite gul being a strong figure in his own right , analysts fear that he might be overshadowed by the more charismatic erdogan and be little more than a caretaker .
erdogan himself has flaunted his pro-western ambitions to the world and has made no bones of his leading role by announcing a program of social and economic reform at a news conference held as gul visited the presidential palace .
" we are building a new world and this new world will bring the east and west together in turkey , " erdogan said .
erdogan ’ s new program includes " immediate " new penalties to deter torture , a long-standing sore point that has marred turkey ’ s relations with the eu . he has also announced plans to reform turkey ’ s education system , a move which will be followed closely by turkey ’ s secular establishment to ensure that the country ’ s secular principles are not diluted .
erdogan has also pledged to give priority to privatization , tax reforms and a shake-up of a crumbling social security system and the energy sector .
turkey 's eu membership high on akp agenda but for now it ’ s turkey ’ s entry into the european union that is high up on the agenda of the akp .
next week erdogan begins a whirlwind tour of nine european union countries to promote his country ’ s bid to become a member .
but it remains to be seen whether the eu will agree to set a date to open membership talks with turkey until reforms have been clearly implemented .
pierre lellouche , head of the french delegation at a nato parliamentary assembly meeting in istanbul told reuters that the west faced an onslaught by muslim extremists and needed to " help modern muslim countries to develop a modern tolerant form of islam . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.11.2002 germany closes the defense wallet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have one more year of enduring freedom ... but then what ?
germany has voted to commit its troops to a further year of enduring freedom , but has told its nato allies to forget about any further expensive military adventures until the country 's financial situation improves . the cash-strapped german government said on thursday that it remains fully committed to its role as a member of nato but added there is little spare money available to the administration to spend on future military adventures .
however , the government secured majority backing in a vote on friday to decide the fate of german soldiers serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
majority vote sees german troops extend tour by a year a total of 473 legislators voted in favor of the one-year extension that will keep 2,450 troops involved in operation enduring freedom throughout afghanistan , kuwait , the horn of africa and surrounding seas .
only 11 voted against and five abstained .
with the nato summit in prague just under a week away , germany 's statement on its reluctance to commit to further military spending will immediately muddy the already murky waters surrounding one of the meeting 's agenda-topping subjects - a nato multinational rapid reaction force .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us proposals set out a ' global police ' force ready to react within days .
the united states is expected to steer the discussions at the summit towards the possibility of creating a 21,000- strong force made up of international nato troops that could be deployed anywhere in the world in under five days .
fischer diplomatic about us plans for rapid nato force german foreign minister joschka fischer diplomatically called the plan " constructive " but stressed that it should not be allowed to interfere with the european union 's own idea of creating a similar force made up of european soldiers only .
" there should be no doubling-up , " he added .
the idea of a european rapid force is one vigorously championed by germany and france but one washington views nervously .
addressing the bundestag on germany 's role as a member of nato , fischer told parliament that germany and its allies within the organization should look towards a more political approach to possible conflict and to adopt a policy of diplomatic pre-emption in peace threatening situations .
" crisis prevention is just as important as crisis reaction .
the summit must not be solely about military capabilities , " he said .
it is these military capabilities that are pre-occupying the german government at this time of belt-tightening .
after one of the bleakest weeks in the country 's recent financial history , the red-green coalition appears even less inclined to throw money in the direction of defense spending than it has before .
germany can not afford to spend big on defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister peter struck has warned nato allies that germany has no money for military actions .
defense minister peter struck said that germany 's financial problems of rising public debt and sluggish growth meant that the country could not afford a massive increase in its own military involvement and capabilities .
" i am not going to promise nato castles in the air , " he told the bundestag on thursday .
" i can not justify it and i do not want to justify it . "
struck added that , accepting that calls for increased military spending would be a major theme at the nato summit , other members would have to take into account the current sickly state of germany 's financial situation .
for ' other members ' herr struck could have substituted the united states and britain .
both countries have called on european nations to pull their weight in the transatlantic alliance by stepping up military might in the fight against terrorism .
fischer says policy of ' force only ' will lose the war joschka fischer agreed that nato had to adapt to the new threats posed by international terrorists but warned that while the war on terror had to be fought decisively by military means , " at the same time we must not restrict ourselves to that , otherwise we will fail . "
fischer quoted the success of the rapid intervention by nato forces that prevented a civil war in macedonia last august as a case in study .
however , with the german government and public alike concerned with matters at home and with its forces already committed to further service overseas , any future alliance plans that include military action will have to count on germany as a political power only .

on friday , the ten , mainly from the former communist bloc , set out a common demand for entry terms which would not leave them financially worse off when they join the european union in 2004 .
" the net budgetary position of the new member states should be better that their position prior to their entry into the eu , " said a joint statement presented by polish prime minister leszek miller after talks in warsaw .
candidates worried obout not getting a fair deal poland , hungary , the czech and slovak republics , slovenia , estonia , latvia , lithuania and the mediterranean islands of cyprus and malta fear that the eu ’ s slow phase-in of aid to the tune of 40 billion euro proposed in brussels ‘ enlargement budget would leave their coffers empty initially .
the financial package offered at last month ’ s eu summit in brussels is 2,5 billion euro less than the original budget proposed by the european commission .
the candidate countries are also peeved that crunch issues such as the budget , agricultural aid and infrastructure funding are still to be resolved ahead of the eu ’ s enlargement summit in december in copenhagen .
agricultural aid in particularly remains a sticking point with the candidate countries , as they will initially only receive a quarter of the subsidies common in the west , for farming .
according to a eu resolution , the ten new entries will only receive the same support as the west from the eu in the year 2013 .
at the warsaw summit , the ten east european candidates demanded that the eu raise the initial agricultural aid and cut short the waiting period .
poland , with its massive agricultural sector , led calls for the eu to improve a proposal to phase in direct payments to farmers over 10 years , starting at 25 percent of eu levels .
candidates argue that if there is a delay to full farm payments , allocated under the eu ’ s common agricultural policy , their financial contributions to the eu budget should be capped accordingly .
brussels puts finishing touches to new deal however brussels has been involved in drawing up a new package that includes cash and concessions to seal a deal on enlargement .
the ten countries are to offered an extra 1-2 billion euro and a range of other concessions ranging from increasing some farm quotas to a provision allowing hunters in latvia to continue their pursuit of bear and lynx .
the new package is to be discussed by eu foreign ministers next week and designed to pave the way for an agreement with candidate states at the copenhagen summit indecember .
blair tries to allay concerns european social democratic leaders including britain ’ s tony blair , who attended the warsaw summit , attempted to soothe candidates ‘ fears .
after meeting with polish prime minister leszek miller , blair promised that candidates would not lose out , though he did not elaborate .
" the whole purpose of the negotiations is to make sure that no accession country is worse off as a result , " blair said .
" for poland and the polish people i believe that membership of the european union will mean a great deal in terms of living standards and for polish influence in the world . "
eu postpones enlargement the discontent ahead of the warsaw meeting was heightened by the disclosure that the eu had a set a new target date for the ten new countries to join .
originally slated for january 2004 , the entry of the ten new states has now been postponed to april or may 2004 .
günther verheugen , eu enlargement commissioner urged candidate states not to worry about the delay .
he said that it would take time for the eu ’ s 15 member states to ratify the treaty paving the way for accession .
speaking in warsaw on thursday , he said , " we can not put 6,000 -lrb- pages -rrb- of treaty on the table and then tell national parliaments , 'you have six months to read it , ratify it and sign it' .

on friday , the ten , mainly from the former communist bloc , set out a common demand for entry terms which would not leave them financially worse off when they join the european union in 2004 .
" the net budgetary position of the new member states should be better that their position prior to their entry into the eu , " said a joint statement presented by polish prime minister leszek miller after talks in warsaw .
candidates worried obout not getting a fair deal poland , hungary , the czech and slovak republics , slovenia , estonia , latvia , lithuania and the mediterranean islands of cyprus and malta fear that the eu ’ s slow phase-in of aid to the tune of 40 billion euro proposed in brussels ‘ enlargement budget would leave their coffers empty initially .
the financial package offered at last month ’ s eu summit in brussels is 2,5 billion euro less than the original budget proposed by the european commission .
the candidate countries are also peeved that crunch issues such as the budget , agricultural aid and infrastructure funding are still to be resolved ahead of the eu ’ s enlargement summit in december in copenhagen .
agricultural aid in particularly remains a sticking point with the candidate countries , as they will initially only receive a quarter of the subsidies common in the west , for farming .
according to a eu resolution , the ten new entries will only receive the same support as the west from the eu in the year 2013 .
at the warsaw summit , the ten east european candidates demanded that the eu raise the initial agricultural aid and cut short the waiting period .
poland , with its massive agricultural sector , led calls for the eu to improve a proposal to phase in direct payments to farmers over 10 years , starting at 25 percent of eu levels .
candidates argue that if there is a delay to full farm payments , allocated under the eu ’ s common agricultural policy , their financial contributions to the eu budget should be capped accordingly .
brussels puts finishing touches to new deal however brussels has been involved in drawing up a new package that includes cash and concessions to seal a deal on enlargement .
the ten countries are to offered an extra 1-2 billion euro and a range of other concessions ranging from increasing some farm quotas to a provision allowing hunters in latvia to continue their pursuit of bear and lynx .
the new package is to be discussed by eu foreign ministers next week and designed to pave the way for an agreement with candidate states at the copenhagen summit indecember .

" the whole purpose of the negotiations is to make sure that no accession country is worse off as a result , " blair said .
" for poland and the polish people i believe that membership of the european union will mean a great deal in terms of living standards and for polish influence in the world . "
eu postpones enlargement the discontent ahead of the warsaw meeting was heightened by the disclosure that the eu had a set a new target date for the ten new countries to join .

germany has voted to commit its troops to a further year of enduring freedom , but has told its nato allies to forget about any further expensive military adventures until the country 's financial situation improves . the cash-strapped german government said on thursday that it remains fully committed to its role as a member of nato but added there is little spare money available to the administration to spend on future military adventures .
however , the government secured majority backing in a vote on friday to decide the fate of german soldiers serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
majority vote sees german troops extend tour by a year a total of 473 legislators voted in favor of the one-year extension that will keep 2,450 troops involved in operation enduring freedom throughout afghanistan , kuwait , the horn of africa and surrounding seas .
only 11 voted against and five abstained .
with the nato summit in prague just under a week away , germany 's statement on its reluctance to commit to further military spending will immediately muddy the already murky waters surrounding one of the meeting 's agenda-topping subjects - a nato multinational rapid reaction force .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us proposals set out a ' global police ' force ready to react within days .
the united states is expected to steer the discussions at the summit towards the possibility of creating a 21,000- strong force made up of international nato troops that could be deployed anywhere in the world in under five days .
fischer diplomatic about us plans for rapid nato force german foreign minister joschka fischer diplomatically called the plan " constructive " but stressed that it should not be allowed to interfere with the european union 's own idea of creating a similar force made up of european soldiers only .
" there should be no doubling-up , " he added .
the idea of a european rapid force is one vigorously championed by germany and france but one washington views nervously .
addressing the bundestag on germany 's role as a member of nato , fischer told parliament that germany and its allies within the organization should look towards a more political approach to possible conflict and to adopt a policy of diplomatic pre-emption in peace threatening situations .
" crisis prevention is just as important as crisis reaction .
the summit must not be solely about military capabilities , " he said .
it is these military capabilities that are pre-occupying the german government at this time of belt-tightening .
after one of the bleakest weeks in the country 's recent financial history , the red-green coalition appears even less inclined to throw money in the direction of defense spending than it has before .
germany can not afford to spend big on defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister peter struck has warned nato allies that germany has no money for military actions .
defense minister peter struck said that germany 's financial problems of rising public debt and sluggish growth meant that the country could not afford a massive increase in its own military involvement and capabilities .
" i am not going to promise nato castles in the air , " he told the bundestag on thursday .
" i can not justify it and i do not want to justify it . "
struck added that , accepting that calls for increased military spending would be a major theme at the nato summit , other members would have to take into account the current sickly state of germany 's financial situation .
for ' other members ' herr struck could have substituted the united states and britain .
both countries have called on european nations to pull their weight in the transatlantic alliance by stepping up military might in the fight against terrorism .
fischer says policy of ' force only ' will lose the war joschka fischer agreed that nato had to adapt to the new threats posed by international terrorists but warned that while the war on terror had to be fought decisively by military means , " at the same time we must not restrict ourselves to that , otherwise we will fail . "
fischer quoted the success of the rapid intervention by nato forces that prevented a civil war in macedonia last august as a case in study .
however , with the german government and public alike concerned with matters at home and with its forces already committed to further service overseas , any future alliance plans that include military action will have to count on germany as a political power only .

on friday , the ten , mainly from the former communist bloc , set out a common demand for entry terms which would not leave them financially worse off when they join the european union in 2004 .
" the net budgetary position of the new member states should be better that their position prior to their entry into the eu , " said a joint statement presented by polish prime minister leszek miller after talks in warsaw .
candidates worried obout not getting a fair deal poland , hungary , the czech and slovak republics , slovenia , estonia , latvia , lithuania and the mediterranean islands of cyprus and malta fear that the eu ’ s slow phase-in of aid to the tune of 40 billion euro proposed in brussels ‘ enlargement budget would leave their coffers empty initially .
the financial package offered at last month ’ s eu summit in brussels is 2,5 billion euro less than the original budget proposed by the european commission .
the candidate countries are also peeved that crunch issues such as the budget , agricultural aid and infrastructure funding are still to be resolved ahead of the eu ’ s enlargement summit in december in copenhagen .
agricultural aid in particularly remains a sticking point with the candidate countries , as they will initially only receive a quarter of the subsidies common in the west , for farming .
according to a eu resolution , the ten new entries will only receive the same support as the west from the eu in the year 2013 .
at the warsaw summit , the ten east european candidates demanded that the eu raise the initial agricultural aid and cut short the waiting period .
poland , with its massive agricultural sector , led calls for the eu to improve a proposal to phase in direct payments to farmers over 10 years , starting at 25 percent of eu levels .
candidates argue that if there is a delay to full farm payments , allocated under the eu ’ s common agricultural policy , their financial contributions to the eu budget should be capped accordingly .
brussels puts finishing touches to new deal however brussels has been involved in drawing up a new package that includes cash and concessions to seal a deal on enlargement .
the ten countries are to offered an extra 1-2 billion euro and a range of other concessions ranging from increasing some farm quotas to a provision allowing hunters in latvia to continue their pursuit of bear and lynx .
the new package is to be discussed by eu foreign ministers next week and designed to pave the way for an agreement with candidate states at the copenhagen summit indecember .
blair tries to allay concerns european social democratic leaders including britain ’ s tony blair , who attended the warsaw summit , attempted to soothe candidates ‘ fears .
after meeting with polish prime minister leszek miller , blair promised that candidates would not lose out , though he did not elaborate .
" the whole purpose of the negotiations is to make sure that no accession country is worse off as a result , " blair said .
" for poland and the polish people i believe that membership of the european union will mean a great deal in terms of living standards and for polish influence in the world . "
eu postpones enlargement the discontent ahead of the warsaw meeting was heightened by the disclosure that the eu had a set a new target date for the ten new countries to join .
originally slated for january 2004 , the entry of the ten new states has now been postponed to april or may 2004 .
günther verheugen , eu enlargement commissioner urged candidate states not to worry about the delay .
he said that it would take time for the eu ’ s 15 member states to ratify the treaty paving the way for accession .
speaking in warsaw on thursday , he said , " we can not put 6,000 -lrb- pages -rrb- of treaty on the table and then tell national parliaments , 'you have six months to read it , ratify it and sign it' .

the appointment ends weeks of speculation following the landslide victory of the justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- led by tayyip erdogan two weeks ago .
the charismatic mr erdogan himself was unable to contest the polls on account of a 1998 conviction for inciting religious hatred and is barred from the post .
gul right man for the job ?
abdullah gul , a close confidant of erdogan and deputy leader of the conservative islamic akp party was handpicked personally by erdogan to head turkey .
he takes over the reins of a country , whose ailing economy and ambitions to join the european union needs a strong pro-reform and pro-west leader at the helm .
the akp which has consistently announced sweeping plans for economic and social reforms to meet eu standards ever since its whopping win , is convinced that gul is the right man for the job .
" it ’ s time to start work .
from this hour onward it ’ s time to mobilize and work night and day to solve the problems of our people , " a smiling gul said after president ahmet necdet sezer invited him to form a government .
" the government will be ready by monday , " he said .
all the right credentials abdullah gul , who speaks fluent english , is a familiar face to the united states , which may look to him for use of turkey ’ s air bases in the event of an attack on neighboring iraq .
financial markets are also counting on gul to wisely deal with a $ 16 billion imf crisis pact to pull itself out of one of the worst economic slump since 1945 .
gul was a member of turkey ’ s first islamist-led government , which was forced from power after a year in 1997 by an army-led pressure campaign .
but gul himself is known for his balanced demeanor and has never had a run-in with courts .
the akp , which presents itself as pro-western and pro-market evolved from the wing of a now banned islamist party .
aware of the suspicions his party faces , gul said in a recent interview , " we are rational people first and foremost .
we are not militant islamists . "
erdogan unveils sweeeping reforms but despite gul being a strong figure in his own right , analysts fear that he might be overshadowed by the more charismatic erdogan and be little more than a caretaker .
erdogan himself has flaunted his pro-western ambitions to the world and has made no bones of his leading role by announcing a program of social and economic reform at a news conference held as gul visited the presidential palace .
" we are building a new world and this new world will bring the east and west together in turkey , " erdogan said .
erdogan ’ s new program includes " immediate " new penalties to deter torture , a long-standing sore point that has marred turkey ’ s relations with the eu . he has also announced plans to reform turkey ’ s education system , a move which will be followed closely by turkey ’ s secular establishment to ensure that the country ’ s secular principles are not diluted .
erdogan has also pledged to give priority to privatization , tax reforms and a shake-up of a crumbling social security system and the energy sector .
turkey 's eu membership high on akp agenda but for now it ’ s turkey ’ s entry into the european union that is high up on the agenda of the akp .
next week erdogan begins a whirlwind tour of nine european union countries to promote his country ’ s bid to become a member .
but it remains to be seen whether the eu will agree to set a date to open membership talks with turkey until reforms have been clearly implemented .
pierre lellouche , head of the french delegation at a nato parliamentary assembly meeting in istanbul told reuters that the west faced an onslaught by muslim extremists and needed to " help modern muslim countries to develop a modern tolerant form of islam . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.11.2002 germany closes the defense wallet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have one more year of enduring freedom ... but then what ?
germany has voted to commit its troops to a further year of enduring freedom , but has told its nato allies to forget about any further expensive military adventures until the country 's financial situation improves . the cash-strapped german government said on thursday that it remains fully committed to its role as a member of nato but added there is little spare money available to the administration to spend on future military adventures .
however , the government secured majority backing in a vote on friday to decide the fate of german soldiers serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
majority vote sees german troops extend tour by a year a total of 473 legislators voted in favor of the one-year extension that will keep 2,450 troops involved in operation enduring freedom throughout afghanistan , kuwait , the horn of africa and surrounding seas .
only 11 voted against and five abstained .
with the nato summit in prague just under a week away , germany 's statement on its reluctance to commit to further military spending will immediately muddy the already murky waters surrounding one of the meeting 's agenda-topping subjects - a nato multinational rapid reaction force .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us proposals set out a ' global police ' force ready to react within days .
the united states is expected to steer the discussions at the summit towards the possibility of creating a 21,000- strong force made up of international nato troops that could be deployed anywhere in the world in under five days .
fischer diplomatic about us plans for rapid nato force german foreign minister joschka fischer diplomatically called the plan " constructive " but stressed that it should not be allowed to interfere with the european union 's own idea of creating a similar force made up of european soldiers only .
" there should be no doubling-up , " he added .
the idea of a european rapid force is one vigorously championed by germany and france but one washington views nervously .
addressing the bundestag on germany 's role as a member of nato , fischer told parliament that germany and its allies within the organization should look towards a more political approach to possible conflict and to adopt a policy of diplomatic pre-emption in peace threatening situations .
" crisis prevention is just as important as crisis reaction .
the summit must not be solely about military capabilities , " he said .
it is these military capabilities that are pre-occupying the german government at this time of belt-tightening .
after one of the bleakest weeks in the country 's recent financial history , the red-green coalition appears even less inclined to throw money in the direction of defense spending than it has before .
germany can not afford to spend big on defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister peter struck has warned nato allies that germany has no money for military actions .
defense minister peter struck said that germany 's financial problems of rising public debt and sluggish growth meant that the country could not afford a massive increase in its own military involvement and capabilities .
" i am not going to promise nato castles in the air , " he told the bundestag on thursday .
" i can not justify it and i do not want to justify it . "
struck added that , accepting that calls for increased military spending would be a major theme at the nato summit , other members would have to take into account the current sickly state of germany 's financial situation .
for ' other members ' herr struck could have substituted the united states and britain .
both countries have called on european nations to pull their weight in the transatlantic alliance by stepping up military might in the fight against terrorism .
fischer says policy of ' force only ' will lose the war joschka fischer agreed that nato had to adapt to the new threats posed by international terrorists but warned that while the war on terror had to be fought decisively by military means , " at the same time we must not restrict ourselves to that , otherwise we will fail . "
fischer quoted the success of the rapid intervention by nato forces that prevented a civil war in macedonia last august as a case in study .
however , with the german government and public alike concerned with matters at home and with its forces already committed to further service overseas , any future alliance plans that include military action will have to count on germany as a political power only .

germany has voted to commit its troops to a further year of enduring freedom , but has told its nato allies to forget about any further expensive military adventures until the country 's financial situation improves . the cash-strapped german government said on thursday that it remains fully committed to its role as a member of nato but added there is little spare money available to the administration to spend on future military adventures .
however , the government secured majority backing in a vote on friday to decide the fate of german soldiers serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
majority vote sees german troops extend tour by a year a total of 473 legislators voted in favor of the one-year extension that will keep 2,450 troops involved in operation enduring freedom throughout afghanistan , kuwait , the horn of africa and surrounding seas .
only 11 voted against and five abstained .
with the nato summit in prague just under a week away , germany 's statement on its reluctance to commit to further military spending will immediately muddy the already murky waters surrounding one of the meeting 's agenda-topping subjects - a nato multinational rapid reaction force .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us proposals set out a ' global police ' force ready to react within days .
the united states is expected to steer the discussions at the summit towards the possibility of creating a 21,000- strong force made up of international nato troops that could be deployed anywhere in the world in under five days .
fischer diplomatic about us plans for rapid nato force german foreign minister joschka fischer diplomatically called the plan " constructive " but stressed that it should not be allowed to interfere with the european union 's own idea of creating a similar force made up of european soldiers only .
" there should be no doubling-up , " he added .
the idea of a european rapid force is one vigorously championed by germany and france but one washington views nervously .
addressing the bundestag on germany 's role as a member of nato , fischer told parliament that germany and its allies within the organization should look towards a more political approach to possible conflict and to adopt a policy of diplomatic pre-emption in peace threatening situations .
" crisis prevention is just as important as crisis reaction .
the summit must not be solely about military capabilities , " he said .
it is these military capabilities that are pre-occupying the german government at this time of belt-tightening .
after one of the bleakest weeks in the country 's recent financial history , the red-green coalition appears even less inclined to throw money in the direction of defense spending than it has before .
germany can not afford to spend big on defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister peter struck has warned nato allies that germany has no money for military actions .
defense minister peter struck said that germany 's financial problems of rising public debt and sluggish growth meant that the country could not afford a massive increase in its own military involvement and capabilities .
" i am not going to promise nato castles in the air , " he told the bundestag on thursday .
" i can not justify it and i do not want to justify it . "
struck added that , accepting that calls for increased military spending would be a major theme at the nato summit , other members would have to take into account the current sickly state of germany 's financial situation .
for ' other members ' herr struck could have substituted the united states and britain .
both countries have called on european nations to pull their weight in the transatlantic alliance by stepping up military might in the fight against terrorism .
fischer says policy of ' force only ' will lose the war joschka fischer agreed that nato had to adapt to the new threats posed by international terrorists but warned that while the war on terror had to be fought decisively by military means , " at the same time we must not restrict ourselves to that , otherwise we will fail . "
fischer quoted the success of the rapid intervention by nato forces that prevented a civil war in macedonia last august as a case in study .
however , with the german government and public alike concerned with matters at home and with its forces already committed to further service overseas , any future alliance plans that include military action will have to count on germany as a political power only .

on friday , the ten , mainly from the former communist bloc , set out a common demand for entry terms which would not leave them financially worse off when they join the european union in 2004 .
" the net budgetary position of the new member states should be better that their position prior to their entry into the eu , " said a joint statement presented by polish prime minister leszek miller after talks in warsaw .
candidates worried obout not getting a fair deal poland , hungary , the czech and slovak republics , slovenia , estonia , latvia , lithuania and the mediterranean islands of cyprus and malta fear that the eu ’ s slow phase-in of aid to the tune of 40 billion euro proposed in brussels ‘ enlargement budget would leave their coffers empty initially .
the financial package offered at last month ’ s eu summit in brussels is 2,5 billion euro less than the original budget proposed by the european commission .
the candidate countries are also peeved that crunch issues such as the budget , agricultural aid and infrastructure funding are still to be resolved ahead of the eu ’ s enlargement summit in december in copenhagen .
agricultural aid in particularly remains a sticking point with the candidate countries , as they will initially only receive a quarter of the subsidies common in the west , for farming .
according to a eu resolution , the ten new entries will only receive the same support as the west from the eu in the year 2013 .
at the warsaw summit , the ten east european candidates demanded that the eu raise the initial agricultural aid and cut short the waiting period .
poland , with its massive agricultural sector , led calls for the eu to improve a proposal to phase in direct payments to farmers over 10 years , starting at 25 percent of eu levels .
candidates argue that if there is a delay to full farm payments , allocated under the eu ’ s common agricultural policy , their financial contributions to the eu budget should be capped accordingly .
brussels puts finishing touches to new deal however brussels has been involved in drawing up a new package that includes cash and concessions to seal a deal on enlargement .
the ten countries are to offered an extra 1-2 billion euro and a range of other concessions ranging from increasing some farm quotas to a provision allowing hunters in latvia to continue their pursuit of bear and lynx .
the new package is to be discussed by eu foreign ministers next week and designed to pave the way for an agreement with candidate states at the copenhagen summit indecember .
blair tries to allay concerns european social democratic leaders including britain ’ s tony blair , who attended the warsaw summit , attempted to soothe candidates ‘ fears .
after meeting with polish prime minister leszek miller , blair promised that candidates would not lose out , though he did not elaborate .
" the whole purpose of the negotiations is to make sure that no accession country is worse off as a result , " blair said .
" for poland and the polish people i believe that membership of the european union will mean a great deal in terms of living standards and for polish influence in the world . "
eu postpones enlargement the discontent ahead of the warsaw meeting was heightened by the disclosure that the eu had a set a new target date for the ten new countries to join .
originally slated for january 2004 , the entry of the ten new states has now been postponed to april or may 2004 .

on friday , the ten , mainly from the former communist bloc , set out a common demand for entry terms which would not leave them financially worse off when they join the european union in 2004 .
" the net budgetary position of the new member states should be better that their position prior to their entry into the eu , " said a joint statement presented by polish prime minister leszek miller after talks in warsaw .
candidates worried obout not getting a fair deal poland , hungary , the czech and slovak republics , slovenia , estonia , latvia , lithuania and the mediterranean islands of cyprus and malta fear that the eu ’ s slow phase-in of aid to the tune of 40 billion euro proposed in brussels ‘ enlargement budget would leave their coffers empty initially .
the financial package offered at last month ’ s eu summit in brussels is 2,5 billion euro less than the original budget proposed by the european commission .
the candidate countries are also peeved that crunch issues such as the budget , agricultural aid and infrastructure funding are still to be resolved ahead of the eu ’ s enlargement summit in december in copenhagen .
agricultural aid in particularly remains a sticking point with the candidate countries , as they will initially only receive a quarter of the subsidies common in the west , for farming .
according to a eu resolution , the ten new entries will only receive the same support as the west from the eu in the year 2013 .
at the warsaw summit , the ten east european candidates demanded that the eu raise the initial agricultural aid and cut short the waiting period .
poland , with its massive agricultural sector , led calls for the eu to improve a proposal to phase in direct payments to farmers over 10 years , starting at 25 percent of eu levels .
candidates argue that if there is a delay to full farm payments , allocated under the eu ’ s common agricultural policy , their financial contributions to the eu budget should be capped accordingly .
brussels puts finishing touches to new deal however brussels has been involved in drawing up a new package that includes cash and concessions to seal a deal on enlargement .
the ten countries are to offered an extra 1-2 billion euro and a range of other concessions ranging from increasing some farm quotas to a provision allowing hunters in latvia to continue their pursuit of bear and lynx .
the new package is to be discussed by eu foreign ministers next week and designed to pave the way for an agreement with candidate states at the copenhagen summit indecember .

after meeting with polish prime minister leszek miller , blair promised that candidates would not lose out , though he did not elaborate .
" the whole purpose of the negotiations is to make sure that no accession country is worse off as a result , " blair said .
" for poland and the polish people i believe that membership of the european union will mean a great deal in terms of living standards and for polish influence in the world . "
eu postpones enlargement the discontent ahead of the warsaw meeting was heightened by the disclosure that the eu had a set a new target date for the ten new countries to join .
originally slated for january 2004 , the entry of the ten new states has now been postponed to april or may 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.11.2002 new turkish prime minister pledges sweeping reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's strong men - new prime minister abdullah gul -lrb- left -rrb- and recep tayyip erdogan abdullah gul , a staunch advocate of turkey ’ s bid for eu membership , close u.s . ties and a favorite of financial markets was appointed turkey ’ s prime minister , ending days of speculation . in a move that is bound to please nato allies and financial markets , abdullah gul , a 52-year-old trained economist and a foreign policy expert , was installed as turkey ’ s prime minister on saturday .
the appointment ends weeks of speculation following the landslide victory of the justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- led by tayyip erdogan two weeks ago .
the charismatic mr erdogan himself was unable to contest the polls on account of a 1998 conviction for inciting religious hatred and is barred from the post .
gul right man for the job ?
abdullah gul , a close confidant of erdogan and deputy leader of the conservative islamic akp party was handpicked personally by erdogan to head turkey .
he takes over the reins of a country , whose ailing economy and ambitions to join the european union needs a strong pro-reform and pro-west leader at the helm .
the akp which has consistently announced sweeping plans for economic and social reforms to meet eu standards ever since its whopping win , is convinced that gul is the right man for the job .
" it ’ s time to start work .
from this hour onward it ’ s time to mobilize and work night and day to solve the problems of our people , " a smiling gul said after president ahmet necdet sezer invited him to form a government .
" the government will be ready by monday , " he said .
all the right credentials abdullah gul , who speaks fluent english , is a familiar face to the united states , which may look to him for use of turkey ’ s air bases in the event of an attack on neighboring iraq .
financial markets are also counting on gul to wisely deal with a $ 16 billion imf crisis pact to pull itself out of one of the worst economic slump since 1945 .
gul was a member of turkey ’ s first islamist-led government , which was forced from power after a year in 1997 by an army-led pressure campaign .
but gul himself is known for his balanced demeanor and has never had a run-in with courts .
the akp , which presents itself as pro-western and pro-market evolved from the wing of a now banned islamist party .
aware of the suspicions his party faces , gul said in a recent interview , " we are rational people first and foremost .
we are not militant islamists . "
erdogan unveils sweeeping reforms but despite gul being a strong figure in his own right , analysts fear that he might be overshadowed by the more charismatic erdogan and be little more than a caretaker .
erdogan himself has flaunted his pro-western ambitions to the world and has made no bones of his leading role by announcing a program of social and economic reform at a news conference held as gul visited the presidential palace .
" we are building a new world and this new world will bring the east and west together in turkey , " erdogan said .
erdogan ’ s new program includes " immediate " new penalties to deter torture , a long-standing sore point that has marred turkey ’ s relations with the eu . he has also announced plans to reform turkey ’ s education system , a move which will be followed closely by turkey ’ s secular establishment to ensure that the country ’ s secular principles are not diluted .
erdogan has also pledged to give priority to privatization , tax reforms and a shake-up of a crumbling social security system and the energy sector .
turkey 's eu membership high on akp agenda but for now it ’ s turkey ’ s entry into the european union that is high up on the agenda of the akp .
next week erdogan begins a whirlwind tour of nine european union countries to promote his country ’ s bid to become a member .
but it remains to be seen whether the eu will agree to set a date to open membership talks with turkey until reforms have been clearly implemented .
pierre lellouche , head of the french delegation at a nato parliamentary assembly meeting in istanbul told reuters that the west faced an onslaught by muslim extremists and needed to " help modern muslim countries to develop a modern tolerant form of islam . "
" if we eliminate this hope in the one muslim nation that has a history of secularism -lrb- turkey -rrb- then we ’ ll fabricate ourselves an anti-western islam in this country ...
this is an unwise policy , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.11.2002 germany closes the defense wallet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have one more year of enduring freedom ... but then what ?
germany has voted to commit its troops to a further year of enduring freedom , but has told its nato allies to forget about any further expensive military adventures until the country 's financial situation improves . the cash-strapped german government said on thursday that it remains fully committed to its role as a member of nato but added there is little spare money available to the administration to spend on future military adventures .
however , the government secured majority backing in a vote on friday to decide the fate of german soldiers serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
majority vote sees german troops extend tour by a year a total of 473 legislators voted in favor of the one-year extension that will keep 2,450 troops involved in operation enduring freedom throughout afghanistan , kuwait , the horn of africa and surrounding seas .
only 11 voted against and five abstained .
with the nato summit in prague just under a week away , germany 's statement on its reluctance to commit to further military spending will immediately muddy the already murky waters surrounding one of the meeting 's agenda-topping subjects - a nato multinational rapid reaction force .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us proposals set out a ' global police ' force ready to react within days .
the united states is expected to steer the discussions at the summit towards the possibility of creating a 21,000- strong force made up of international nato troops that could be deployed anywhere in the world in under five days .
fischer diplomatic about us plans for rapid nato force german foreign minister joschka fischer diplomatically called the plan " constructive " but stressed that it should not be allowed to interfere with the european union 's own idea of creating a similar force made up of european soldiers only .
" there should be no doubling-up , " he added .
the idea of a european rapid force is one vigorously championed by germany and france but one washington views nervously .
addressing the bundestag on germany 's role as a member of nato , fischer told parliament that germany and its allies within the organization should look towards a more political approach to possible conflict and to adopt a policy of diplomatic pre-emption in peace threatening situations .
" crisis prevention is just as important as crisis reaction .
the summit must not be solely about military capabilities , " he said .
it is these military capabilities that are pre-occupying the german government at this time of belt-tightening .
after one of the bleakest weeks in the country 's recent financial history , the red-green coalition appears even less inclined to throw money in the direction of defense spending than it has before .
germany can not afford to spend big on defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister peter struck has warned nato allies that germany has no money for military actions .
defense minister peter struck said that germany 's financial problems of rising public debt and sluggish growth meant that the country could not afford a massive increase in its own military involvement and capabilities .
" i am not going to promise nato castles in the air , " he told the bundestag on thursday .
" i can not justify it and i do not want to justify it . "
struck added that , accepting that calls for increased military spending would be a major theme at the nato summit , other members would have to take into account the current sickly state of germany 's financial situation .
for ' other members ' herr struck could have substituted the united states and britain .
both countries have called on european nations to pull their weight in the transatlantic alliance by stepping up military might in the fight against terrorism .
fischer says policy of ' force only ' will lose the war joschka fischer agreed that nato had to adapt to the new threats posed by international terrorists but warned that while the war on terror had to be fought decisively by military means , " at the same time we must not restrict ourselves to that , otherwise we will fail . "
fischer quoted the success of the rapid intervention by nato forces that prevented a civil war in macedonia last august as a case in study .
however , with the german government and public alike concerned with matters at home and with its forces already committed to further service overseas , any future alliance plans that include military action will have to count on germany as a political power only .

on friday , the ten , mainly from the former communist bloc , set out a common demand for entry terms which would not leave them financially worse off when they join the european union in 2004 .
" the net budgetary position of the new member states should be better that their position prior to their entry into the eu , " said a joint statement presented by polish prime minister leszek miller after talks in warsaw .
candidates worried obout not getting a fair deal poland , hungary , the czech and slovak republics , slovenia , estonia , latvia , lithuania and the mediterranean islands of cyprus and malta fear that the eu ’ s slow phase-in of aid to the tune of 40 billion euro proposed in brussels ‘ enlargement budget would leave their coffers empty initially .
the financial package offered at last month ’ s eu summit in brussels is 2,5 billion euro less than the original budget proposed by the european commission .
the candidate countries are also peeved that crunch issues such as the budget , agricultural aid and infrastructure funding are still to be resolved ahead of the eu ’ s enlargement summit in december in copenhagen .
agricultural aid in particularly remains a sticking point with the candidate countries , as they will initially only receive a quarter of the subsidies common in the west , for farming .
according to a eu resolution , the ten new entries will only receive the same support as the west from the eu in the year 2013 .
at the warsaw summit , the ten east european candidates demanded that the eu raise the initial agricultural aid and cut short the waiting period .
poland , with its massive agricultural sector , led calls for the eu to improve a proposal to phase in direct payments to farmers over 10 years , starting at 25 percent of eu levels .
candidates argue that if there is a delay to full farm payments , allocated under the eu ’ s common agricultural policy , their financial contributions to the eu budget should be capped accordingly .
brussels puts finishing touches to new deal however brussels has been involved in drawing up a new package that includes cash and concessions to seal a deal on enlargement .
the ten countries are to offered an extra 1-2 billion euro and a range of other concessions ranging from increasing some farm quotas to a provision allowing hunters in latvia to continue their pursuit of bear and lynx .
the new package is to be discussed by eu foreign ministers next week and designed to pave the way for an agreement with candidate states at the copenhagen summit indecember .
blair tries to allay concerns european social democratic leaders including britain ’ s tony blair , who attended the warsaw summit , attempted to soothe candidates ‘ fears .
after meeting with polish prime minister leszek miller , blair promised that candidates would not lose out , though he did not elaborate .
" the whole purpose of the negotiations is to make sure that no accession country is worse off as a result , " blair said .
" for poland and the polish people i believe that membership of the european union will mean a great deal in terms of living standards and for polish influence in the world . "
eu postpones enlargement the discontent ahead of the warsaw meeting was heightened by the disclosure that the eu had a set a new target date for the ten new countries to join .
originally slated for january 2004 , the entry of the ten new states has now been postponed to april or may 2004 .
günther verheugen , eu enlargement commissioner urged candidate states not to worry about the delay .
he said that it would take time for the eu ’ s 15 member states to ratify the treaty paving the way for accession .

the appointment ends weeks of speculation following the landslide victory of the justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- led by tayyip erdogan two weeks ago .
the charismatic mr erdogan himself was unable to contest the polls on account of a 1998 conviction for inciting religious hatred and is barred from the post .
gul right man for the job ?
abdullah gul , a close confidant of erdogan and deputy leader of the conservative islamic akp party was handpicked personally by erdogan to head turkey .
he takes over the reins of a country , whose ailing economy and ambitions to join the european union needs a strong pro-reform and pro-west leader at the helm .
the akp which has consistently announced sweeping plans for economic and social reforms to meet eu standards ever since its whopping win , is convinced that gul is the right man for the job .
" it ’ s time to start work .
from this hour onward it ’ s time to mobilize and work night and day to solve the problems of our people , " a smiling gul said after president ahmet necdet sezer invited him to form a government .
" the government will be ready by monday , " he said .
all the right credentials abdullah gul , who speaks fluent english , is a familiar face to the united states , which may look to him for use of turkey ’ s air bases in the event of an attack on neighboring iraq .
financial markets are also counting on gul to wisely deal with a $ 16 billion imf crisis pact to pull itself out of one of the worst economic slump since 1945 .
gul was a member of turkey ’ s first islamist-led government , which was forced from power after a year in 1997 by an army-led pressure campaign .
but gul himself is known for his balanced demeanor and has never had a run-in with courts .
the akp , which presents itself as pro-western and pro-market evolved from the wing of a now banned islamist party .
aware of the suspicions his party faces , gul said in a recent interview , " we are rational people first and foremost .
we are not militant islamists . "
erdogan unveils sweeeping reforms but despite gul being a strong figure in his own right , analysts fear that he might be overshadowed by the more charismatic erdogan and be little more than a caretaker .
erdogan himself has flaunted his pro-western ambitions to the world and has made no bones of his leading role by announcing a program of social and economic reform at a news conference held as gul visited the presidential palace .
" we are building a new world and this new world will bring the east and west together in turkey , " erdogan said .
erdogan ’ s new program includes " immediate " new penalties to deter torture , a long-standing sore point that has marred turkey ’ s relations with the eu . he has also announced plans to reform turkey ’ s education system , a move which will be followed closely by turkey ’ s secular establishment to ensure that the country ’ s secular principles are not diluted .
erdogan has also pledged to give priority to privatization , tax reforms and a shake-up of a crumbling social security system and the energy sector .
turkey 's eu membership high on akp agenda but for now it ’ s turkey ’ s entry into the european union that is high up on the agenda of the akp .
next week erdogan begins a whirlwind tour of nine european union countries to promote his country ’ s bid to become a member .
but it remains to be seen whether the eu will agree to set a date to open membership talks with turkey until reforms have been clearly implemented .
pierre lellouche , head of the french delegation at a nato parliamentary assembly meeting in istanbul told reuters that the west faced an onslaught by muslim extremists and needed to " help modern muslim countries to develop a modern tolerant form of islam . "

germany has voted to commit its troops to a further year of enduring freedom , but has told its nato allies to forget about any further expensive military adventures until the country 's financial situation improves . the cash-strapped german government said on thursday that it remains fully committed to its role as a member of nato but added there is little spare money available to the administration to spend on future military adventures .
however , the government secured majority backing in a vote on friday to decide the fate of german soldiers serving with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
majority vote sees german troops extend tour by a year a total of 473 legislators voted in favor of the one-year extension that will keep 2,450 troops involved in operation enduring freedom throughout afghanistan , kuwait , the horn of africa and surrounding seas .
only 11 voted against and five abstained .
with the nato summit in prague just under a week away , germany 's statement on its reluctance to commit to further military spending will immediately muddy the already murky waters surrounding one of the meeting 's agenda-topping subjects - a nato multinational rapid reaction force .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us proposals set out a ' global police ' force ready to react within days .
the united states is expected to steer the discussions at the summit towards the possibility of creating a 21,000- strong force made up of international nato troops that could be deployed anywhere in the world in under five days .
fischer diplomatic about us plans for rapid nato force german foreign minister joschka fischer diplomatically called the plan " constructive " but stressed that it should not be allowed to interfere with the european union 's own idea of creating a similar force made up of european soldiers only .
" there should be no doubling-up , " he added .
the idea of a european rapid force is one vigorously championed by germany and france but one washington views nervously .
addressing the bundestag on germany 's role as a member of nato , fischer told parliament that germany and its allies within the organization should look towards a more political approach to possible conflict and to adopt a policy of diplomatic pre-emption in peace threatening situations .
" crisis prevention is just as important as crisis reaction .
the summit must not be solely about military capabilities , " he said .

germany can not afford to spend big on defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister peter struck has warned nato allies that germany has no money for military actions .
defense minister peter struck said that germany 's financial problems of rising public debt and sluggish growth meant that the country could not afford a massive increase in its own military involvement and capabilities .
" i am not going to promise nato castles in the air , " he told the bundestag on thursday .
" i can not justify it and i do not want to justify it . "
struck added that , accepting that calls for increased military spending would be a major theme at the nato summit , other members would have to take into account the current sickly state of germany 's financial situation .
for ' other members ' herr struck could have substituted the united states and britain .
both countries have called on european nations to pull their weight in the transatlantic alliance by stepping up military might in the fight against terrorism .
fischer says policy of ' force only ' will lose the war joschka fischer agreed that nato had to adapt to the new threats posed by international terrorists but warned that while the war on terror had to be fought decisively by military means , " at the same time we must not restrict ourselves to that , otherwise we will fail . "
fischer quoted the success of the rapid intervention by nato forces that prevented a civil war in macedonia last august as a case in study .
however , with the german government and public alike concerned with matters at home and with its forces already committed to further service overseas , any future alliance plans that include military action will have to count on germany as a political power only .

but it opened amid controversy , as mps from opposition and religious parties protested at changes in the constitution giving president musharraf new powers .
president musharraf took the oath of office to begin a new five-year term , and shortly afterwards the session began with a reading from the koran .
constitutional amendments will give musharraf greater powers many mps , however , refused to take the oath under the new constitution .
the swearing-in took place after it was established that the oath was the same under both the new and the old constitution .
the opposition and religious deputies - who make up nearly half the assembly - are protesting at amendments to the constitution which give president musharraf the power to dissolve the assembly and set up a national security council .
party alliances although elections were held more than a month ago , there was no outright winner and parties have been trying to form coalitions since then .
the post of prime minister will not be chosen until next week .
the inaugural session was due to have taken place last week , but was delayed after some parties asked for more time to form a coalition government .
there have been weeks of negotiations between the three parties which won the most seats - the pakistan muslim league-q , which backs president musharraf , benazir bhutto 's pakistan people 's party and an alliance of religious parties .
the pmlq now says it has enough support from a variety of smaller parties to form the new government , although this will only be put to the test next week .

he was speaking after the us , south korea , the european union and japan agreed to halt fuel aid to the impoverished communist state as an anti-nuclear sanction . "
the only option ... is for north korea to completely and visibly eliminate its nuclear weapons program " george w bush " the only option ... is for north korea to completely and visibly eliminate its nuclear weapons program , " the president said in a written statement .
but he also appeared to hold out an olive branch to pyongyang , saying the us could still revive a suspended initiative to " improve the lives of the north korean people " .
diplomats meeting in new york under the auspices of the korean peninsula energy development organisation -lrb- kedo -rrb- decided on thursday that a 42,000-tonne shipment of fuel currently on its way to the north should be the last .
" north 's korea 's clear violation of its international commitments will not be ignored , " said mr bush .
the nuclear dispute flared into life on 16 october when the us announced that the north had admitted to having a programme for producing highly enriched uranium - a key ingredient in nuclear weapons .
south ups pressure on friday south korea 's deputy foreign minister lee tae-shik said it was " quite united " with its allies and " pleased " with the decision to cut off supplies .
the official also confirmed that his government would continue to hold talks with pyongyang .
a senior southern official quoted by associated press said the onus was now on the north to respond .
" the ball is in the court of north korea , " he said .
he added that the south wished to " carry on putting more pressure on north korea so they understand the seriousness of all countries involved " .
south korea and japan had previously expressed doubts that stopping oil deliveries will persuade north korea to terminate its nuclear weapons programme .
they feared it would instead lead to a revival of an earlier , plutonium-based nuclear programme .
turning the tap off under a 1994 accord designed to limit north korea 's nuclear ambitions , north korea agreed to freeze its nuclear programme in return for 500,000 tonnes of fuel oil a year in aid .
washington considers that pyongyang nullified the 1994 pact when it reportedly admitted to a us envoy that it was trying to build nuclear weapons .
the north itself has not publicly commented on the admission .
" future shipments will depend on north korea 's concrete and credible actions to dismantle completely its highly enriched uranium programme , " said the statement from korean peninsula energy development organisation .
north korea says it will only scrap its nuclear programme if the us signs a non-aggression treaty .

the world 's largest chip maker intel is introducing technology that tricks a computer into thinking it has two chips instead of one .
called hyper-threading , the technology can speed up programs by up to 25 % , says intel .
both intel and its partner microsoft are promoting the technology , hoping it will help to boost sales of computers and software .
two in one the use of hyper-threading on desktop machines has been described by intel as a major innovation .
before now the technology has only been used in servers .
it makes a single computer chip act like two by allowing a processor to carry out different tasks at the same time .
this is a cheaper alternative than having two chips in a computer .
" this will effectively allow a single chip to see two processors , " said rick skett , director of intel uk and ireland .
" it will enable people to do what they want with their pcs and not have to wait . "
before now chip makers have used many different tricks to speed up the way that processors work to make them look like they are doing two things at once .
technologies known as pipelining , which splits tasks into small chunks , and multitasking , which splits up the time a chip devotes to each task , have been used .
but it is only now that intel has incorporated the technology into its new 3-gigahertz pentium 4 chip which the company says is the fastest commercial microprocessor for pcs .
speed at a price in a demonstration to journalists , intel showed how encoding a home movie at the same time as editing a digital photograph was much faster on a hyper-threaded computer than an identical machine without the technology .
the technology can be used on computers running windows xp and linux , and works best with programs designed to work with hyper-threading technology .
intel says 40 popular software programs already available make use of the technology and it is working with pc game developers to encourage them to use hyper-threading in future titles .
but the additional power comes at a price .
the 3ghz chips cost $ 637 -lrb- £ 400 -rrb- , far higher intel 's other chips .
the cost of the computers range between $ 1,200 and $ 3,000 -lrb- £ 800 and £ 2,000 -rrb- .
some analysts say companies and individuals may be satisfied with the speed of their computers and not willing to pay extra for additional power .

for gaming enthusiasts across the globe , gta : vice city is something akin to utopia at their fingertips .
it is designed by rockstar north , formerly dma design , which occupies spacious offices in the resurgent leith area of scotland 's capital .
in partnership with its american parent company rockstar games , the designers have created a game that encourages players to steal , shoot and connive their way to the top of the gangster tree - and wreak havoc all the way there .
it focuses on the assorted mayhem set in 1980s miami , and the trials and tribulations of gangster tommy vercetti . "
there 's also a lot of humour in the game that takes a lifestyle revolving around cold , snow and haggis to properly evolve " aaron garbut rockstar north before vice city 's launch , the gta phenomenon had generated six million sales worldwide .
rockstar north 's aaron garbut told bbc news online scotland he was confident the fourth instalment of the game would build on that success .
but what was the thinking behind having the creators of one of the world 's biggest ever games based in scotland ?
" it 's cold , dark and rainy so we tend to stay in the office longer , " garbut said .
" there 's also a lot of humour in the game that takes a lifestyle revolving around cold , snow and haggis to properly evolve .
full stream ahead " but we all spend time in the cities the games are based on , collecting research material and soaking in the atmosphere before returning to the wilds of edinburgh to create it . "
the game stretches the play station 2 -lrb- ps2 -rrb- capacity to the limit and boasts a number of hidden treasures which improve on its predecessor gta3 .
garbut said : " there are a lot of clever things going on .
we stream almost everything off the dvd so we are now at the stage where we can add almost limitless detail .
" we no longer rely on the memory of the ps2 to store everything we would like to throw at it .
" this , combined with some clever techniques , allow us to show the city receding miles into the distance and still have things as detailed as cigars in ash trays or bottles of beer in bars .
" if you want to see this at its best , fly around the city in a helicopter .
the sense of detail and scale is difficult to beat . "
gta3 was an instant hit and remains the 10th best-selling game - despite being released more than a year ago .
vice city features 80 different tracks from bands including judas priest , blondie , flock of seagulls , kool and the gang , hall and oates , grandmaster flash , and cutting crew .
voices are supplied by former miami vice star phillip michael thomas , ray liotta , dennis hopper and burt reynolds .
garbut said : " the 80s were a very interesting time .
obviously being the 80s success , money , fame and sheer indulgence is the perfect framework to build a game around .
" it is possible to depict the decade with just a pair of socks or a colour . "
' flat out ' he said the creators believed the only way to satisfy demand was to make each new game bigger , faster and better .
" there 's generally so much new stuff in there , the chances are you will still be playing it when we have the next one ready for you . "
the game , not for the faint-hearted , looks set to create another record by eclipsing metal gear solid as the fastest selling ps2 game in the uk .
garbut revealed the designers were busy creating the next edition .
" we are already thinking of the next project as we finish off the last , " he said .
" we had the conceptual outlines of what we wanted to do with vice city as we finished gta3 .
it 's been exactly a year from gta3 's release and we 've worked flat out ever since . "
