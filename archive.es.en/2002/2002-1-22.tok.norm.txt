arriving in the capital kinshasa for a long-planned peace mission , mr straw said the humanitarian crisis following the eruption highlighted the need for co-operation and an end to the fighting .
mr straw and his french counterpart , hubert vedrine , have adjusted their agenda to include the issue of getting emergency aid to the victims of the nyiragongo volcano .
during their visit they are considering a trip to the worst affected town of goma and surrounding areas , where the homes of hundreds of thousands were destroyed .
rebel-held the two foreign ministers began their three-day trip , which also includes visits to uganda , rwanda and burundi , by meeting president of the democratic republic of congo , joseph kabila .
the fighting may have stopped but peace has not yet broken out jack straw the disaster zone is situated in rebel-held eastern congo and mr straw wants the crisis to underline the need for the two sides to talk .
he said : " maybe in a small way we 'll be able to get across to everybody that if they want to be able better to deal with these natural disasters and tame the natural environment , they need to work with each other rather than against each other . "
mr vedrine said : " the emotions we feel in the face of this eruption should not keep us from doing our job , which is to break with a logic of war and restore peace to the region . "
the war in congo is africa 's biggest conflict and has left two-million people dead and the country overrun and plundered by occupying forces involving upwards of six countries .
competitors traditionally france and britain have been seen as colonial competitors in the congo , with britain remaining more sympathetic to rwanda and france backing the dr congo government .
despite the differences the two countries are now keen to pool their influence and after their meeting with president kabila mr straw and mr vedrine said they were encouraged .
he apparently told them he would do his best to repatriate hutu troops in his army if rwanda and uganda could be persuaded to pull their troops out of rebel-held territory .
those commitments will be sought on tuesday , despite both men 's understanding that unlocking the vicious circle of this conflict will not be easy .
emergency aid mr straw 's visit took place as the government indicated it may be prepared to increase aid to the areas of the democratic republic of congo devastated by the eruption .
the uk government has promised £ 2m in emergency aid to the region , which continues to be shaken by earth tremors .
in a house of commons statement international development minister hilary benn expressed sympathy for the plight of those affected by the eruption .
speaking ahead of his trip , mr straw said : " central africa is the scene of the biggest war in the world .
this conflict has been ignored for too long .
" the region stands at a key moment .
the fighting may have stopped but peace has not yet broken out . "
mr straw said he would push for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country , the demobilisation of rebels and a commitment to dialogue between the factions .

michel fournier , 57 , specialised in very high altitude jumps and falls when he was in the french army .
he will make his world record attempt from a specially-designed stratospheric balloon made by cameron balloons in bristol .
the 95-metre-high helium-filled balloon will carry mr fournier so high he will need to wear a space suit to enable him to breathe .
the casket will be pulled above 40,000 feet it will take him up to three hours to reach a height of more than 40,000 feet -lrb- 12,192 metres -rrb- .
hannah cameron told bbc news online : " before he opens his parachute he will be the first man to break the speed barrier without using an aeroplane .
" we are building the balloon now , using a model section , and the attempt will be sometime between may and september . "
the balloon will carry mr fournier up in a telephone-box shaped casket which will protect him from the ultra-violet light .
michel fournier : " loves experimenting " once he has admired the view , he plans to cross the sound barrier just 30 seconds after leaving his casket .
his pressurised suit can withstand temperatures of -100 c , but he will have to inhale pure oxygen for four hours before he actually jumps .
mr fournier said : " i love life and life pays me back well .
" i love discovering and experimenting .
" i believe in my lucky star and in the virtues of courage and self-implication . "
the site of the launch is yet to be announced , but if all goes to plan , the casket will fall to earth on another parachute before making a landing of its own .

the officials , who have visited camp x-ray at the weekend , have already reported the three british captives have " no complaints " about their treatment .
guantanamo prisoners 144 detainees more than 10 nationalities countries of origin include uk , australia , yemen , saudi arabia the number of prisoners at the camp in guantanamo bay has now risen to 158 and the three britons are said to have been treated well and are in " good physical health " .
the foreign office has named one of the britons as feroz abbasi , 22 , from croydon , but has not released the identities of the other two .
the us has faced fierce international criticism for its treatment of the prisoners , who are held in small cells open to the elements .
the first legal challenge to the detention of 100 of the captives will be heard by a court in los angeles today .
the petition alleges the prisoners are being held at the us naval base in violation of the geneva convention and the us constitution .
there were no gags , no goggles , no ear muffs and no shackles ... in their cells tony blair 's spokesman pictures of shackled and blindfolded detainees , described by the us as unlawful combatants rather than prisoners of war , have led to accusations that the us is flouting international law .
but prime minister tony blair 's official spokesman said the visiting british team had seen no evidence of mistreatment .
the britons were " able to speak freely and without inhibition " about their conditions , he said .
religious needs he added that they had been in contact with red cross workers and british officials were passing messages on to their families at their request .
80 prisoners detained in cages like these buckets for toilets thin foam mattresses beards shaved detailed plan of cells and conditions pictures showing bound and gagged men were taken shortly after their arrival in cuba , he said .
" there were no gags , no goggles , no ear muffs and no shackles while they were in their cells .
they only wear shackles when they are outside their cells . "
he said detainees " get three meals a day " , including a " pre-packed islamic meal for lunch " , as much water as they need and daily medical checks .
" the red cross is arranging for them to have copies of the koran , " he added .
" they have also been provided with washing materials , and calls to prayer are being broadcast over the camp public address system . "
the prisoners ' cells were " basic but fit " and the us military authorities had been " helpful and open throughout the visit , " he said .
the government would now take time to study the report in detail , added the spokesman .
death penalty the european union has said the detainees should be afforded the same rights as prisoners of war .
foreign office parliamentary secretary ben bradshaw told mps he was confident the prisoners were being kept in accordance with the geneva convention but that the definition of a prisoner of war was an " extremely complicated matter " .
" what is important is that those people who are detained are treated humanely in accordance with international norms and if they are brought to trial , they are given a fair trial , " mr bradshaw told mps .
camp x-ray 's commander had assured british officials that " the more lurid allegations about torture and sensory deprivation are completely false " , he added , and the international committee of the red cross now had a permanent presence at the camp .
" this house should not forget that we are talking about some of the most dangerous men in the world who have , in the past , displayed murderous and suicidal tendencies , and often both together , " he told mps .
in response to a question from mr abbasi 's mp geraint davies , about whether his constituent would face the death penalty , mr bradshaw said : " it really is too soon to speculate about what charges -lsb- abbasi -rsb- might face . "
trials ahead military officials say the temporary cells could hold 320 inmates , or more if detainees were housed two to a cell .
the us plans to build a permanent camp holding up to 1,000 prisoners .
under the geneva convention , pows must be tried by the same courts and under the same procedures as us soldiers .
that would mean war crimes trials through courts-martial or civilian courts , not in closed military tribunals .

professor ian mercer , the head of the panel which investigated the outbreak in devon , said : " there is still a great concern culpability has not been apportioned - a proper legal public inquiry is the only way we can bring anyone to account . "
his call for action came after the national farmers ' union accused the government of a " catalogue of delays , failures , incompetence and inadequacies " in its handling of the outbreak .
lord whitty , minister for environment , food and rural affairs , insisted lessons had been learned and britain would be able to deal effectively with any further cases of the disease .
' urgent need ' the nfu argued existing food import controls are " in urgent need of review and strengthening " , with more centralised co-ordination of responsibility .
ministers were also accused of failing to prepare effectively for possible disease outbreaks , and of ignoring the lessons of the previous foot-and-mouth epidemic in 1967 .
lord whitty said the government agreed with some of the nfu 's recommendations but " there are some we strongly disagree with " .
he added : " the nfu has been on board throughout the outbreak and contributed to the way we have dealt with foot-and-mouth .
' controls inadequate ' " i agree that there are lessons to be learned .
we have learned lessons already and the lessons to be learned inquiry will judge and recommend on these later . "
the nfu report blamed imported meat for the outbreak and said the border controls at the time of the outbreak were " inadequate " .
it makes 28 recommendations which will be considered by the government inquiry which is due to report back in the summer .
these include : farmers and rural economy interest groups should be involved in any review of existing plans , which should be regularly tested through simulation exercises the government should provide sufficient disposal capacity for slaughtered animals , using open pyres " only as a last resort " there should be clear command and management structures to tackle a future outbreak , with good communication between government departments and involved agencies , and use of the military where required " at an early stage " there should be more effective liaison between state vets and civil servants , and a " practical and accessible " licence system to allow exceptional animal movements if restrictions are in place the government should give " transparent and consistent " advice to farmers , and to investigate where vaccination might be used in future outbreaks .
the government was ill-prepared , overwhelmed and , too often , incompetent ben gill nfu attacking ministers for a lack of contingency planning before the epidemic , the nfu says a failure to set up simulations beforehand added to delays in getting on top of the disease .
nfu president ben gill said : " the lessons of the 1967 outbreak were very clearly ignored in 2001 .
the government was ill-prepared , overwhelmed and , too often , incompetent .
this time they must listen . "
he told the bbc : " the number of animals killed could have been as few as half of what we ended up killing , if we had had proper plans . "
but the farmers ' union does not quarrel with the basic tactics of handling the outbreak .
it says the policy of culling millions of livestock has been vindicated by the fact that the disease has apparently disappeared .
but mr gill did say the government was still dragging its feet over foot-and-mouth .
he told the bbc : " eleven months on from the start of foot-and-mouth ... the government still has not properly implemented even the current law on controls of imports of meat and food products coming into the uk . "
recent government action to enforce the controls had been " farcical " , he added later , claiming it amounted to " half a dozen a4 posters at heathrow and gatwick " airports .
he said a bbc documentary had shown that " perhaps as much as 10 tonnes of illegal meat comes in suitcases per month through heathrow alone " .
mr gill also defended the nfu 's rejection of vaccination as a possible solution to foot-and-mouth , although many farmers called for it during the outbreak .
he said wishing for a vaccine and having it practically available with the necessary testing were two different things .
more than four million animals were slaughtered as part of the foot-and-mouth cull .
a further two million were killed for " welfare reasons " necessitated by foot-and-mouth restrictions .

better exports could spell revival for taiwan taiwan is edging back from the recession triggered by the global downturn , as export and manufacturing figures show a gradual recovery from the gloom .
but the island 's performance is still well below where it was a year ago , and it still faces a long haul back to anything like the breakneck growth it experienced during the 1990s .
exports have been taiwan 's lifeblood , and orders for exports in december improved markedly on the 11 % decline seen in november over the previous year , and was better than many had feared .
for 2001 as a whole , export orders dropped 11.5 % , again showing that the decline was capped in december , the ministry of economic affairs said on tuesday .
the year before saw double-digit growth .
on the way back " things are improving ... from double-digit declines to single digits , " said daniel chen , chief economist at the industrial bank of taiwan .
" in addition to an improving external environment , domestic consumption will expand with a rising stock market and recovery in the property market . "
but the $ 11.44bn figure was still 8.11 % down on december 2000 .
industrial output , too , was creeping back while continuing to be much lower than a year ago .
in december , output was down 6.14 % from december 2000 , an improvement both on november 's 6.49 % fall and the 7.53 % seen in 2001 as a whole .
the figures emerged a day after taiwan 's president , chen shui-bian , appointed a new cabinet intended to strengthen economic policy .
across the strait the downturn - which saw taiwan enter recession in the july-to-september quarter last year - has also hit overseas investment which , at $ 4.39bn , was 13.5 % lower last year than in 2000 .
december 's figure was , at $ 260m , little more than half that seen in november .
but money is still flowing from taiwan to the people 's republic of china .
although the larger mainland neighbour sees taiwan as a rebel province , this has not stopped taiwanese companies from exploiting the cheaper costs available from mainland manufacturing .
china-bound investment was , at $ 2.78bn , up 6.79 % in 2001 on the year before .
even so , the upsurge in electronics manufacture in china has eased off , with paper , machinery and chemicals investments sharply rising .

the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- earth resources satellites -lrb- ers-1 and ers-2 -rrb- surveyed the dead sea between 1992 and 1999 and identified regions that were sinking .
subsidence rates have now been measured accurately for the first time .
typically , the land is going down across the whole region by two centimetres -lrb- less than one inch -rrb- a year , but data show some areas are falling by up to six centimetres a year .
during the observation period , the level of the dead sea itself fell by about six metres - part of a longer trend that has now been detected in the surrounding rocks .
dead and dropping the dead sea region contains the lowest point of dry land on the planet , and is flanked on two sides by sharply rising terrain - the moab range to the west and the edom range to the east .
the lake is the saltiest body of water in the world .
situated at the mouth of the jordan river , the dead sea has no outlet and forms part of the border between jordan and israel .
the arabs call it bahr lut - the sea of lot .
several smaller streams pour into the sea from the east , bringing a heavy influx of fresh water , which evaporates due to the region 's extreme heat .
the high saltiness kills animal and plant life ; fish carried in by the jordan soon die .
during the 20th century , the water level of the dead sea dropped continuously from about 390 metres -lrb- 1,280 feet -rrb- below sea level in 1930 to 414 m -lrb- 1,360 ft -rrb- below sea level in 1999 , with the average rate of fall accelerating in recent years .
relief map it is known that the surrounding terrain is also subsiding , but putting reliable figures to this trend has required the use of precise satellite-based positioning techniques .
researchers used the interferometric synthetic aperture radar -lrb- insar -rrb- facilities on the ers satellites to detect the lowering of ground level in the region .
two radar scans of the same region were taken at different times ; changes in height were used to construct a two-dimensional map of crustal deformation .

an ers image of the dead sea ...
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- earth resources satellites -lrb- ers-1 and ers-2 -rrb- surveyed the dead sea between 1992 and 1999 and identified regions that were sinking .
subsidence rates have now been measured accurately for the first time .
typically , the land is going down across the whole region by two centimetres -lrb- less than one inch -rrb- a year , but data show some areas are falling by up to six centimetres a year .
during the observation period , the level of the dead sea itself fell by about six metres - part of a longer trend that has now been detected in the surrounding rocks .
dead and dropping the dead sea region contains the lowest point of dry land on the planet , and is flanked on two sides by sharply rising terrain - the moab range to the west and the edom range to the east . ... with the southern end enlarged the lake is the saltiest body of water in the world .
situated at the mouth of the jordan river , the dead sea has no outlet and forms part of the border between jordan and israel .
the arabs call it bahr lut - the sea of lot .
several smaller streams pour into the sea from the east , bringing a heavy influx of fresh water , which evaporates due to the region 's extreme heat .
the high saltiness kills animal and plant life ; fish carried in by the jordan soon die .
during the 20th century , the water level of the dead sea dropped continuously from about 390 metres -lrb- 1,280 feet -rrb- below sea level in 1930 to 414 m -lrb- 1,360 ft -rrb- below sea level in 1999 , with the average rate of fall accelerating in recent years .
relief map it is known that the surrounding terrain is also subsiding , but putting reliable figures to this trend has required the use of precise satellite-based positioning techniques .
the ers mission took measurments over the dead sea between 1992 and 1999 researchers used the interferometric synthetic aperture radar -lrb- insar -rrb- facilities on the ers satellites to detect the lowering of ground level in the region .
two radar scans of the same region were taken at different times ; changes in height were used to construct a two-dimensional map of crustal deformation .
the scientists , from the geological survey of israel and the scripps institution of oceanography in the us , say that as water drains away from the dead sea , the porous rocks beneath the region are drying out .
it means the rocks are no longer able to support the weight of those above them and subside under the pressure .

a police spokesman said a total of 66 workers had now been detained .
about 400 textile workers threw stones , chairs and bottles at police and overturned vehicles after police tried last thursday to detain 16 of their colleagues .
police said the workers had failed urine tests for drug abuse .
fourteen men escaped but police later arrested 11 after a tense stand-off .
another 17 were detained over the weekend .
the protests in the central malaysian town of nilai came just over a month after 2,000 illegal indonesian immigrants rioted and set fire to a detention centre in southern malaysia .
pm 's warning prime minister mahathir mohamad was reported on friday as saying malaysia may employ indonesians last when deciding between workers of different nationalities .
" indonesian workers have been giving us many problems , sneaking into the country , when caught they become violent , we can not accept such behaviour , " he was quoted by the official bernama news agency as saying .

she was born norma egstrom in north dakota , one of five children of scandinavian stock .
she began singing professionally in her teens but made her mark with the benny goodman band in 1941 as a replacement for helen forrest .
she was 21 .
her 1942 recording of why do n't you do right ? which she wrote herself , revealed an individual style .
johnny mercer , her favourite lyricist , became her mentor at the outset of her career .
the writing partnership with her first husband , david barbour , benny goodman 's guitarist , culminated in the tremendously successful recording of manana , but the problems caused by his alcoholism led to divorce in 1951 .
she started to take charge of her professional life , and her innovative recording of the rodgers and hart composition lover resulted from her ignoring richard rodgers 's strict rules about how his songs were to be interpreted .
as her recording career gained momentum , so too did her composing abilities as with tom thumb , johnny guitar and walt disney 's lady and the tramp , co-scored with sonny burke in which she sang he 's a tramp and the siamese cat song .
this , in turn , led to her role in the 1955 film pete kelly 's blues in which her portrayal of an alcoholic singer earned her an oscar nomination in the best supporting actress category .
on record her material ranged from show tunes such as mr wonderful , to big-band blues such as alright , ok , you win .
she also sang rhythm and blues including her most famous song , her adaptation of little willie john 's fever .
lee 's openness to so many forms of music led her to record the songs of contemporary performers from the beatles to judy collins .
in 1969 she had a top twenty hit with her highly formal version of lieber and stoller 's is that all there is ? .
peggy lee had many health problems , including diabetes .
for ten years she had to use a lung machine and had had a double heart by-pass operation in 1985 .
she spent the final years of her career in a wheelchair but continued to perform and write .
in march 1991 peggy lee won nearly two million pounds after a three-year battle against walt disney for her share of the video profits for lady and the tramp .
she had been paid only $ 3,500 and her contract had not covered residuals since video technology was unknown in 1955 .
peggy lee was also a poet , screenwriter , author , painter and humanitarian .
she often donated her artistic works for auction for non-profit organisations and established the peggy lee music scholarship to help musicians in time of need and for education .
but it is for her effortless singing style which she worked so hard to master , for which she will be best remembered .
