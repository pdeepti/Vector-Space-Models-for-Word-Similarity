and they 've got the paychecks to prove it . these are testing times for germany .
the economy is festering , the government seems at odds with itself and nobody seems to know what kind of tanks they can and can not sell .
it 's a good thing that germany 's sporting heroes are top of the heap or things would be really desperate .
it 's been one of the most successful years for sporting achievements in recent history for german sportsmen and women .
and a list of the country 's top earners in the world of sport shows that when it comes to trophies , prize money and endorsement revenue - german stars hoard with the best of them .
schumacher brothers and nowitski are top earners the man with the strongest sideboard and the biggest bank balance is formula one world champion michael schumacher .
again , the world 's motor racing circuits were a sea of ferrari flags this season , accompanied by the seemingly omnipresent german national anthem as " schumi " romped home in record breaking style with 11 grand prix victories this year .
his fifth world championship win did n't do his credit rating any harm , pushing his earnings up to € 50 million -lrb- $ 50.4 million -rrb- .
little brother ralf also had a profitable time driving really fast this year .
schumi ii takes the third spot , with a more than credible € 14 million in his back pocket .
dirk nowitski , the german basketball star who plays his game in the united states , separates the speeding schumacher brothers in the list , notching up € 14.5 million .
nowitski , a talismanic player with the dallas mavericks in the nba , also found time to lead germany 's basketball team to third in the world championships earlier this year .
becker earns € 12 million for not doing much bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : becker in court not on court .
it seems just being german is enough in these boom times for the country 's sport personalities .
boris becker comes into the list in fourth place with earnings of € 12 million , despite only making appearances in the kind of court that he is not normally associated with : the tax court .
the only woman in the top 15 names on the highest earning germans list is another former tennis icon , steffi graf .
she 's in ninth place with € 5.5 million this year .
presumably , being one half of deutsche telekom 's celebrity advertising couple is preferable to slogging balls around on the exhibition circuit .
the assorted others include bernhard langer , enjoying his golf once more with € 10 million ; boxer sven ottke -lrb- € 8 million -rrb- and germany 's world cup hero / villain oliver kahn -lrb- € 7 million -rrb- .
his coach at bayern munich , ottmar hitzfeld , took home € 5 million this year while national team chief rudi völler banked € 4 million . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de undisputed king of the formula one circuit michael schumacher entered the record books by winning his fifth formula one racing season title of his career .

deputy secretary of state richard armitage met prime minister junichiro koizumi and other senior politicians in tokyo , telling them president george w bush was ready to be patient with baghdad .
mr armitage will continue to south korea , china and australia later in the week .
mr armitage 's visit is part of a big us diplomatic offensive that will sound out around 50 nations on possible military action against baghdad .
no war talk mr armitage told japanese leaders that the us president was still hoping that saddam hussein would disarm .
" he would much prefer to have iraq disarm herself , " said mr armitage .
" but , as the president said , ' if iraq wo n't disarm , then eventually , iraq will be disarmed , " ' he added .
however , the us envoy said he had not talked about war scenarios with his japanese hosts .
it is unclear whether japan will support any military action against iraq , although last week it agreed to send one of its most sophisticated destroyers to the indian ocean to provide non-combat assistance in the war on terrorism .
mr armitage expressed his thanks for the japanese move .
but some opposition politicians in japan have already attacked the move , saying it violated efforts by the united nations to resolve the crisis peacefully .
japan 's constitution rejects the use of military force in resolving international conflicts .
bbc correspondent in tokyo , charles scanlon , says mr armitage can expect a warm reception on the last leg of his tour - in australia - but must first travel to south korea and china .
china , our correspondent says , has spoken consistently in favour of a diplomatic and negotiated solution in iraq , while anti-american sentiment has risen in south korea since a recent incident in which two schoolgirls were crushed to death by a us military vehicle .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- asylum rough sleeping crisis fear news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : uk news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk england n ireland scotland wales politics education business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk monday , 9 december , 2002 , 06:02 gmt asylum rough sleeping crisis fear on the road : most asylum seekers apply inside the uk by dominic casciani bbc news online community affairs reporter hundreds of asylum seekers could be sleeping rough on britain 's streets in the new year because of a little noticed clause in recent legislation , warn charities .
refugee and housing charities say new regulations will create chaos in major cities because asylum seekers will not be allowed emergency bed and breakfast accommodation unless they declare themselves on arrival at ports .
the majority of asylum seekers , some 5,000 people in september alone , declare themselves once they are inside the uk , such as after getting out of a lorry on a motorway .
a similar policy change introduced by the conservatives and opposed by labour in 1996 was overturned by the courts after charities ran soup kitchens and night shelters to deal with the numbers sleeping rough .
new regulations asylum seekers get emergency accommodation from the national asylum support service -lrb- nass -rrb- when they declare themselves to authorities .
this undermines the government 's efforts to tackle rough sleeping ... it is completely at odds with their commitment not to leave asylum seekers destitute ben jackson , shelter but from 8 january 2003 , those who fail to declare themselves at ports will not be given a bed until nass has screened and approved their cases , a procedure which could take days .
the refugee council says the practical impact of the change is that they and other agencies will be forced to turn away hundreds of destitute asylum seekers arriving on their doorstep every week .
" we are appalled by these new measures which will throw thousands of asylum seekers into destitution and add to the chaos in the asylum system , " said fazil kawani of the refugee council .
" the reality is that in the harshest winter month , they will be out on the streets while they wait to get documents from the home office which will entitle them to accommodation .
" it is a completely unacceptable way to treat refugees who may be fleeing for their lives or from traumatic persecution . "
fears over pregnant women agencies say home office officials have yet to clarify whether they will be allowed to house young people who ca n't prove they are under 18 or pregnant women .
sleeping rough : charities warn of chaos the previous conservative government introduced a similar rule in february 1996 .
in the weeks that followed , charities , churches and mosques opened emergency shelters to support a growing number of rough sleepers .
charities argued the restriction broke international treaty obligations and the high court eventually ordered local councils to provide support .
" local authorities no longer have any legal responsibility to house asylum seekers and nass support is being withdrawn , " said amy bick of refugee action .
" we are expecting a large number of destitute people will need help .
we estimate 700 people a week .
this is very worrying . "
ben jackson of housing charity shelter said : " this measure undermines the government 's efforts to tackle rough sleeping .
it is completely at odds with their commitment not to leave asylum seekers destitute .
" many people seeking asylum will be worse off than they were under 1996 conservative legislation which the labour party opposed at the time . "
' end-to-end system ' a spokesman for the home office said the measures were part of a " comprehensive end-to-end " asylum system designed to separate false applications by those illegally living in the uk from those in genuine need .
" these measures will end the presumption of support for those who apply for asylum in country unless they can give a truthful and credible account of their circumstances and demonstrate that they claimed asylum at the earliest opportunity , " said the spokesman .
" if you are fleeing from genuine persecution , you will apply for asylum at the first opportunity you get . "
families , those with special needs or individuals whose circumstances suddenly change , such as a coup back home , would not be affected , said the spokesman .
unaccompanied children arriving in the uk already receive support under different legislation .

refugee and housing charities say new regulations will create chaos in major cities because asylum seekers will not be allowed emergency bed and breakfast accommodation unless they declare themselves on arrival at ports .
the majority of asylum seekers , some 5,000 people in september alone , declare themselves once they are inside the uk , such as after getting out of a lorry on a motorway .
a similar policy change introduced by the conservatives and opposed by labour in 1996 was overturned by the courts after charities ran soup kitchens and night shelters to deal with the numbers sleeping rough .
new regulations asylum seekers get emergency accommodation from the national asylum support service -lrb- nass -rrb- when they declare themselves to authorities . "
this undermines the government 's efforts to tackle rough sleeping ... it is completely at odds with their commitment not to leave asylum seekers destitute " ben jackson , shelter but from 8 january 2003 , those who fail to declare themselves at ports will not be given a bed until nass has screened and approved their cases , a procedure which could take days .
the refugee council says the practical impact of the change is that they and other agencies will be forced to turn away hundreds of destitute asylum seekers arriving on their doorstep every week .
" we are appalled by these new measures which will throw thousands of asylum seekers into destitution and add to the chaos in the asylum system , " said fazil kawani of the refugee council .
" the reality is that in the harshest winter month , they will be out on the streets while they wait to get documents from the home office which will entitle them to accommodation .
" it is a completely unacceptable way to treat refugees who may be fleeing for their lives or from traumatic persecution . "
fears over pregnant women agencies say home office officials have yet to clarify whether they will be allowed to house young people who ca n't prove they are under 18 or pregnant women .
the previous conservative government introduced a similar rule in february 1996 .
in the weeks that followed , charities , churches and mosques opened emergency shelters to support a growing number of rough sleepers .
charities argued the restriction broke international treaty obligations and the high court eventually ordered local councils to provide support .
" local authorities no longer have any legal responsibility to house asylum seekers and nass support is being withdrawn , " said amy bick of refugee action .
" we are expecting a large number of destitute people will need help .
we estimate 700 people a week .
this is very worrying . "
ben jackson of housing charity shelter said : " this measure undermines the government 's efforts to tackle rough sleeping .
it is completely at odds with their commitment not to leave asylum seekers destitute .
" many people seeking asylum will be worse off than they were under 1996 conservative legislation which the labour party opposed at the time . "
' end-to-end system ' a spokesman for the home office said the measures were part of a " comprehensive end-to-end " asylum system designed to separate false applications by those illegally living in the uk from those in genuine need .
" these measures will end the presumption of support for those who apply for asylum in country unless they can give a truthful and credible account of their circumstances and demonstrate that they claimed asylum at the earliest opportunity , " said the spokesman .
" if you are fleeing from genuine persecution , you will apply for asylum at the first opportunity you get . "
families , those with special needs or individuals whose circumstances suddenly change , such as a coup back home , would not be affected , said the spokesman .
unaccompanied children arriving in the uk already receive support under different legislation .

the problem is most noticeable in welsh-language medium schools , according to a report published on monday by the general teaching council for wales -lrb- gtcw -rrb- .
in contrast , primary school positions attract an average of 20 applicants per post , more than three times the amount responding to comprehensive jobs .
the report was compiled from responses from nearly 1,500 headteachers in wales and shows the average numbers of applicants for " shortage " subjects has dropped even further .
the survey showed there were on average : 4.2 applicants for maths jobs 4.7 for science 3.8 for physics 2.7 for welsh as a second language .
only the figures for physics jobs had not fallen since last year .
the biggest drop overall was in science , which saw applications fall from 7.5 applicants per post .
the gtcw report also showed about one in 10 posts remained unfilled because of a shortage of applicants .
the most acute lack of teachers is in welsh medium education , where there are shortages in almost every subject area . "

in a number of schools , teachers from different subject areas such as science are teaching welsh simply because they are welsh speakers .
bbc wales ' education correspondent colette hume noted another trend - newly qualified teachers being headhunted by the private sector .
" a lot of companies are asking for people that have pgce qualifications , which is becoming more attractive to employers , " she explained .
education chiefs will discuss the report at a landmark conference in cardiff called to help find solutions to the problem of teacher supply and demand .
secondary head teachers said they have had to resort to poaching , head hunting or other " innovative " means to fill vacant posts .
gary brace , chief executive of the teaching council , said : " it is vital that we get to grips with the recruitment problems head teachers face .
" clearly heads do n't believe they have enough choice of applicants to make the appointments they want .
" in some cases , they had no choices at all .
" at the conference , we will be talking about solutions which make the teaching profession generally more attractive , but the solution to these problems must come from many sources . "
almost half the teachers who leave the profession are taking early retirement , while only 16 % of secondary teachers and eight per cent of primary teachers went to jobs outside the profession .
primary schools tended to have a stable workforce , with no vacancies in 67 % of schools between january and august 2002 .
there were large numbers of candidates for every job which did become available , the report found .

the firm said it was optimistic the long-running dispute with members of the drivers ' union aslef would end after it put a new offer on the table .
strikes currently planned for the weekends of 14-15 december and 21-22 december would affect rail users across north west england and north wales .
aslef executives meet on monday to discuss the new offer , which covers pay and conditions of service .
first north western 's managing director vernon barker said : " we have done everything in our power to reach an agreement .
services returning " we hope that aslef will withdraw the threat of strike action for the sake of our passengers . "
from monday , the rail company will reinstate about a third of services withdrawn earlier this year after drivers refused to work on rest days .
about 50 services will also return to the timetable .
more than 30 new drivers have completed their training in the last three months .
first north western said their deployment would " significantly " reduce the need for rest day working .
the pay dispute has witnessed a series of 48-hour strikes causing widespread disruption to commuters .
the firm 's latest offer had been for a 19 % increase over two years .
it would have provided a driver with a basic salary of £ 28,000 for a 35-hour , four-day working week .

congressional investigators are investigating whether a series of previously undisclosed deals were used to dodge accounting rules , the new york times and the wall street journal reported .
the papers mentioned two deals - one called bacchus , another sundance - which investigators apparently suspect might have been structured in order to inflate enron 's profits .
citigroup is to appear at a hearing on wednesday before the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations on financing deals put together by enron 's banks , according to the new york times .
citigroup is expected to plead innocence and to insist the two deals were legal .
dubious deals ?
in the bacchus deal , citigroup is said to have made a $ 7.5m investment which helped enron book a $ 200m sale of pulp and paper assets and $ 112m profits in 2000 .
however , citigroup 's investment was met with an informal guarantee from and enron executive , and as such it should be seen as a loan to enron rather than as an investment by citigroup , senate investigators said according to the papers .
in the sundance deal , an investment by citigroup was said to have enabled enron to keep its loss making commodity operations off its balance sheet , and thus away from investors ' prying eyes .
enron also achieved several hundreds of millions of dollars in tax deductions that would normally have been rejected , the newspapers reported .
the deductions were made thanks to a deal between enron and citigroup 's competitor , jp morgan chase .

the royal navy ship , which was damaged on rocks off australia , has sailed into portsmouth , where she will undergo £ 26m repairs .
devonport dockyard in plymouth had hoped to win the contract , saying it would have helped keep hundreds of people employed at the yard .
the type-42 destroyer hit rocks and holed her hull in july and has been transported back to uk waters on the dutch heavy lifting ship , mv swan .
costs have ballooned for devonport 's refit dock hms nottingham crashed at north howe island , 200 miles north east of sydney .
devonport management limited -lrb- dml -rrb- , the private company which runs the yard , said winning the contract would have preserved 200 jobs for more than 18 months .
last week , the government was forced to step in with taxpayers ' money to bail out the refit of nuclear submarines at the plymouth yard .
design and construction delays of a new royal navy purpose-built refit centre at devonport has seen costs soar from £ 650m to £ 933m .
the ministry of defence will pay £ 849m , leaving taxpayers with a bill of at least an extra £ 199m , a national audit office -lrb- nao -rrb- report revealed .

the royal navy ship , which was damaged on rocks off australia , has sailed into portsmouth , where she will undergo £ 26m repairs .
devonport dockyard in plymouth had hoped to win the contract , saying it would have helped keep hundreds of people employed at the yard .
the type-42 destroyer hit rocks and holed her hull in july and has been transported back to uk waters on the dutch heavy lifting ship , mv swan .
hms nottingham crashed at north howe island , 200 miles north east of sydney .
devonport management limited -lrb- dml -rrb- , the private company which runs the yard , said winning the contract would have preserved 200 jobs for more than 18 months .
last week , the government was forced to step in with taxpayers ' money to bail out the refit of nuclear submarines at the plymouth yard .
design and construction delays of a new royal navy purpose-built refit centre at devonport has seen costs soar from £ 650m to £ 933m .
the ministry of defence will pay £ 849m , leaving taxpayers with a bill of at least an extra £ 199m , a national audit office -lrb- nao -rrb- report revealed .
