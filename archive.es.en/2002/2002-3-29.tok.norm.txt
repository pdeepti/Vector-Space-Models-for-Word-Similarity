a surge in injuries and even deaths among handymen and women is traditionally seen on easter bank holiday monday and experts do not expect this year to be any different .
in 1999 , the last year for which statistics are available , 1,400 people injured themselves over the easter break - making it the most dangerous period in a year with 200,000 diy injuries and 70 deaths .

' instructions are important ' according to the dti people aged 30 to 39 are most at risk of injuring themselves while working on home improvements .
cutting corners could mean putting yourself at risk , and it can end up costing more than you think melanie johnson - consumer minister it says the group is least likely to wear safety gear or ask for expert advice and most likely to tackle complex jobs beyond their capabilities .
the dti says the right tools and protective equipment should always be used and plenty of time allowed to do the job thoroughly and carefully .
it says instructions should always be followed and extra care taken with power tools .
consumer minister melanie johnson said : " doing jobs yourself around the home can be fun and saves money .
" but before you start any job , you need to weigh it up and decide whether it is something you can manage yourself or whether you need to get in the experts .
" cutting corners could mean putting yourself at risk , and it can end up costing more than you think . "

identifying the genetic difference could lead to a test to help determine whose heart health would benefit from the therapy .
good cholesterol - high-density lipoprotein -lrb- hdl -rrb- - is believed to help prevent heart disease , especially in women .
whether hormone replacement therapy prevents or slows heart disease in postmenopausal women has proved a controversial subject in recent years . "
our research suggests that genetics may identify some women who respond more favourably to hormone replacement therapy than others " professor david herrington , wake forest university baptist medical center this latest research suggests genetics may play a part in determining who does benefit .
however , the researchers say it is too soon for doctors to begin testing for the gene variant and they should continue to follow expert guidance on the use of oestrogen and other therapies for preventing heart disease in women .
genetic predisposition doctors at wake forest university baptist medical center , winston-salem , north carolina looked at 309 women with heart disease who took hrt or a dummy version .
they discovered that women who took hrt who had a common mutation in the oestrogen receptor alpha gene had dramatic increases in good cholesterol .
the increase in hdl was more than twice as much as in women without the gene variant .
around 18 % of women had the genetic predisposition to high levels of hdl cholesterol when taking oestrogen .
the increase seen was two or three times what is normally achieved with cholesterol drugs used to raise hdl , the researchers said .
previous research into cholesterol drugs show that raising hdl to this extent might reduce heart disease events by 25 to 40 % .
david herrington , a professor of cardiology who led the research , said : " studies with oestrogen have n't shown the same connection between hdl raising and heart disease benefit , but it 's possible this was because we were focusing on all women , rather than the sub-group with this gene variant . "
sensitive genes he added : " our research suggests that genetics may identify some women who respond more favourably to hormone replacement therapy than others . "
but he added : " more research is needed to see if the higher hdl levels translate into fewer heart attacks .
" we also need to know if women with the gene variant are more sensitive to oestrogen 's other effects .
" but , this finding is exciting because it shows the potential for doctors to use genetic testing to improve decisions about drug therapy . "
professor herrington said scientists also needed to look at whether women with this gene variant are also more sensitive to beneficial effects of oestrogen , such as maintaining bone mineral density and reducing hot flashes , and negative ones , such as formation of blood clots in the legs .
" it makes sense that if one area , cholesterol , is affected , others might be too , " he said .
alison shaw , medical spokesperson for the british heart foundation , told bbc news online : " there is increasing evidence that hrt may help increase the levels of protective cholesterol in the body .
" this research suggests that some women may have a gene that makes them more responsive to hrt .
" this may lead to an increase in the manufacture of good cholesterol which has a protective effect against coronary heart disease -lrb- chd -rrb- .
but she added : " although some research shows that hrt may help reduce the risks of chd , it is still not usually prescribed for that sole purpose .
" as the researchers themselves suggest , further research regarding the link between high levels of good cholesterol and the reduction of heart attacks is needed .
" until further studies have been carried out , the current guidelines for prescribing hrt for women should be adhered to . "
the research is published in the new england journal of medicine .

" both parties to the conflict have agreed to holding the talks in thailand , " said a statement read out by thai foreign minister surakiart sathirathai and the visiting norwegian deputy foreign minister vida helgesen .
the peace talks , which follow a ceasefire signed by the tamil tigers and the sri lankan government in february , are expected to begin in the first week of may .
the meeting will be the first between the two sides since the oslo peace initiative began three years ago .
the norwegian envoy , vidar helgesen - whose country has been largely responsible for arranging the talks - said the purpose was to find a resolution to the 18-year sri lankan conflict .
" the negotiations will aim at reaching a political settlement , " he told reporters .
mr helgesen is due to visit sri lanka in mid-april to prepare the ground for the talks .
guerilla war the tamil rebels have been fighting for a separate homeland in the north and east of sri lanka for nearly two decades .
the tamils , a minority group in sri lanka , claim they are discriminated against by the majority sinhalese .
so far , the 18-year war has claimed some 64,500 lives .
the ltte was banned in 1998 .
the group is also outlawed in other countries , such as india , the united states , britain , australia and canada .
the last round of negotiations between the tigers and the government broke down in 1995 after a 100-day ceasefire , when president chandrika kumaratunga 's government claimed the rebels were not interested in discussing substantive political issues .
the ltte replied by accusing the government of reneging on its promises to solve the problems of the tamil people .
as time passed , mrs kumaratunga 's government hardened its stand .
but her party lost national elections in december , although her own tenure runs until 2005 .
soon after taking over , new prime minister ranil wickremesinghe took steps toward a negotiated settlement .
he ended sanctions on rebel-held areas and also said he would consider lifting the ban against the ltte .

the international confederation of free trade unions -lrb- icftu -rrb- , an umbrella body for national trade unions , said it was particularly worried about yao fuxin , 54 , who was arrested in liaoyang on 17 march .
the icftu said it believed mr yao had been " severely mistreated " by public security officials after being detained , or that he may actually have been killed while in official custody it said a chinese public security bureau -lrb- psb -rrb- official had visited mr yao 's wife and said he was " in a very serious condition , at the hospital , after having suffered a heart attack " .
the icftu said it had verified that yao fuxin was in a " perfect state of health " prior to his detention and had never suffered any heart problems .
mr yao was arrested for helping organise protests that at one stage involved up to 30,000 disaffected workers , most of which were angry about unpaid wages and benefits .
three other workers ' leaders were also arrested .
on friday , more than 200 workers and relatives gathered for a second day outside the liaoyang city government offices to appeal for the arrested men 's release .
mr yao 's daughter , yao dan , told the afp news agency : " today , our family was mainly asking for a chance to see my father " .
key problem the protests , which have been underway in liaoyang and another north-eastern town for several weeks , are being closely watched to see how authorities react .
such protests are rare , but they have become more common as china grapples with painful reforms of its state industry .
earlier this month , up to 50,000 retired oil workers protested in the north-eastern town of daqing .
there have also been smaller demonstrations in the capital beijing and in the south-western province of sichuan .
the protests highlight a key problem in china 's current welfare system - factories are often responsible not only for providing for their retired workers , but also for paying unemployment benefits to the same workers they have made redundant .
the government has acknowledged the problem poses a threat to social stability , and is in the process of setting up a national social security network .
the need has been made all the more urgent by fears that china 's entry into the world trade organisation will lead to millions of new redundancies .
but setting up the new welfare system will take several years , and in some areas of the country , enterprises and local governments are currently struggling to keep up payments .
suspicions of official corruption have exacerbated tensions among laid off workers .

bbc news -pipe- uk politics -pipe- labour warns unions ca n't ' buy ' policy categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk politics front page world uk uk politics interviews business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics friday , 29 march , 2002 , 08:56 gmt labour warns unions ca n't ' buy ' policy postal workers have been angered by job cuts the labour party 's general secretary has warned that trade unions must not be allowed to " buy " policies .
david triesman issued the warning the day after the postal workers union , the cwu , cut its donation to labour amid anger at privatisation plans .
we have to make decisions about how best to campaign on behalf of our members in the postal industry billy hayes it also came as the leader of the transport union rmt , bob crow , stepped up calls for labour mps to do more to represent the views of his members .
labour general secretary mr triesman said , in an interview with the times , that to be swayed by financial concerns would be " unethical " .
" you can not have an ethical party or an ethical government if people believe that their donations can buy them something , " mr triesman told the newspaper .
" we know that people are saying this or that union will cut the amount it gives unless the party delivers the following things . , " he said .
" unions are saying in an inverse way that money is associated with policies . "
strike considered but speaking on bbc radio 4 's today programme on friday , mr crow , said that his members wanted to get better respresentation of their views in parliament .
he said the majority of his members opposed the privatisation of london underground , and questioned why they would want to support mps who supported that move .
the implicit threat that the rmt might cut its funding came as the cwu slashes £ 500,000 - a third - of its donations over the next three years .
general secretary billy hayes said : " like any other organisations , we have a limited budget .
we value the institutional link with the labour party .
remember , the last time this was broken was at the instigation of the right-wing government of stanley baldwin in 1927 billy hayes cwu " we have to make decisions about how best to campaign on behalf of our members in the postal industry , in the girobank and in telecommunications . "
currently the cwu is threatening a strike over plans by the post office - now called consignia - over the job cuts .
mr hayes said the money that was kept back from the labour party would be used to fund an anti-privatisation campaign .
" we are fighting to end the deregulation , and de facto privatisation , of the postal industry .
" we are struggling to assure a future for our financial services members , especially in the girobank ; and we are campaigning for a broadband britain in which bt has a leading role .
all these things cost money . "
asked whether the decision to deprive labour of some of its usual donation was purely symbolic , mr hayes said he hoped the party leadership would take notice .
" we value the institutional link with the labour party .
remember , the last time this was broken was at the instigation of the right-wing government of stanley baldwin in 1927 .
" we have no desire to return to those dark days . "

the language which is used by turkey 's 12 million strong kurdish minority has for years been banned from the airwaves .
but the european union has demanded that turkey grant its kurdish population more rights if turkey is to become a member state .
there are 12 million kurds in turkey some have suggested that state television and radio should set aside some time , maybe an hour everyday , for kurdish broadcasting .
the nationalist party the mhp , has said it is against that , but the alternative is pretty unpalatable for the government - that a private station be allowed to broadcast from turkish soil in the kurdish language .
separatist act kurdish tv and radio stations in turkey are frequently closed down .
the only station that broadcasts in kurdish without interruption is based in paris .
the authorities say that kurdish language broadcasting is a separatist act which attacks the unity of the state .
kurds , some of whom speak nothing but kurdish , say the language is an essential part of their identity .
if the ban is relaxed and the law is subsequently changed , for turkey it will be a major act of liberalisation .

boys cry too childline chief executive carole easton believes an online service will be an excellent complement to the existing telephone service .
" children are often more comfortable with technology than adults and we have found that they would be interested in an e-mail service , especially for those that might not be able or do not want to use the telephone , " she said .
it could also be a way of coaxing more boys to get in touch as childline currently receives more calls from girls .
the charity is looking at developing its own online counselling service .
