nobody pretends we have got the perfect rail system in britain labour party spokesman a virgin spokesman denied that it was being done as a special favour for the government , pointing out that additional trains would also be laid on for the conservative conference in bournemouth and the liberal democrats in brighton .
" we recognise that vast numbers of people travel to and from party conferences , " the spokesman said .
" we have a need to move lots of people from london to blackpool .
we have worked with the organisers and planned it accordingly . "
pendolino trains a labour party spokesman defended the arrangement , saying they would be accused of " clogging up " the system if special trains had not been arranged .
" nobody pretends we have got the perfect rail system in britain , " he said .
" the labour party and the government are well aware of the problems on the west coast line .
that is why we have the investment going into it . "
the work on the west coast line is long over-due and will allow for the introduction of virgin 's new 125mph pendolino trains .

during the 27-year conflict which ended this year , hundreds of thousands of children lost their parents or their homes - and many were forcibly drafted as soldiers .
during a week-long tour ms farrow visited four angolan provinces , where she met children orphaned by the war and visited projects aimed at helping them .
she said the purpose of her trip was to gain a better understanding of angola 's problems , and take that information home to the united states .
devastating impression at the end of her stay , ms farrow said the united states , which used to back unita rebels , had a moral responsibility for the effects of the war .
angolan children suffered greatly during the civil war however she emphasised that the angolan government , which receives billions of dollars each year in oil revenue , must take the lead in helping people to become self-sufficient again .
she expressed particular concern over the psychological effects of the war on the child soldiers who were forcibly recruited by both unita and the government .
ms farrow said her most devastating impression of angola was the sight of the town of kuito , much of which has lain in ruins since a fierce battle between the government and unita nine years ago .
but she said the spirit of the angolan people was in complete contrast to the physical destruction of their country .
she added that in their minds , ordinary angolans had already started rebuilding but lacked the means to do so .

the children were detained when they visited their parents in the holding centre on friday , and the family is now due to be deported to germany .
but is the government 's tough line warranted ?
keith best from the immigration advisory service told breakfast : " of course those who have no lawful right to remain here should laeve but we are concerned about the heavy handedness in this case .
" i am not sure how you can justify putting four and six year olds into prison . "
speaking live from the government 's immigration holding centre near heathrow , he said : " at present , there are 72 families in the centre behind me ..
" the removal centre is comfortable but it 's still a prison : look at the barbed wire - what message does that convey to children ? " click here to watch our interview in full with keith best details a court has ruled on saturday that the four-year-old boy and six-year-old girl must stay with their parents at harmondsworth detention centre , which they had visited on friday .
the ahmadi children , with their identities hidden farid and feriba ahmadi 's lawyers said the move was illegal and the children must remain with family friends - a view upheld by the high court in a ruling late on friday .
but it is understood that officials persuaded the court that the home secretary has the final say in some immigration cases and the children should remain in custody .
the ahmadis were detained two weeks ago after being forcibly removed from a mosque where they had taken refuge .
the manner of the arrest attracted widespread condemnation of police tactics .
11th hour appeal mrs ahmadi told bbc radio 4 's today programme that her children were scared and did not understand what was happening to them .
the family 's immigration lawyer , pierre makhlouf , said there had been no warning of what would happen when the children were taken to see their parents by a family friend on friday .
although very regrettable , sometimes it is necessary to detain families with children home office he said a high court judge ordered the release of the children , after an 11th hour appeal on friday night .
after saturday morning 's court hearing , mr makhlouf said : " i 'm extremely disappointed that politics is taking precedent over a legal decision that was taking into account the best interests of children " .
he also said he was angry that the home office had " acted as they have in a clandestine manner , detaining the children without them even having their teddy bears with them " .
he added : " the secretary of state 's drive to enforce his immigration controls has disregarded all the arguments being put forward by the lawyers trying to work in the best interests of the children . "
harmondsworth detention centre , west london the sequence of events prompted former home office minister ann widdecombe to demand an explanation .
she said : " i know of no precedent for a government minister defying a court ruling . "
mr makhlouf said papers had been lodged to make the children wards of court and that they should not have been removed from their carer until a decision on their parents asylum application was made .
mr makhlouf said he was calling for a psychiatric assessment of the parents , adding that he was convinced they suffered from post traumatic stress disorder .
' regrettable ' a home office spokeswoman said the ahmadi children had been " reunited " with their parents .
she said : " detention remains an unfortunate but essential element in the effective enforcement of immigration control .
" although very regrettable , sometimes it is necessary to detain families with children . "
ms widdecombe said the situation was a " mess " and called on the government to explain its actions .
" where you have got the intervention of the courts , then that is something which , however irritating , has to be supreme , " she said .
uproar at raid the ahmadis say they fled the taleban regime two years ago with their children to seek refuge in britain .
their case caused uproar among muslim elders after the police and immigration officers smashed their way into a mosque two weeks ago .
their children were not at the mosque when officers stormed in and seized the couple .
they say there is nothing left for them in afghanistan and that they had started to build a future for themselves in england .
the home office says the couple should be returned to germany , where they first sought refuge from the taleban .
it has suspended their deportation until after a judicial review into the case . watch / listen on this story keith best immigration advisory service home when we are on air recent forums programme archive studio tour today 's information meet the team presenters reporters your say contact us your comments see also : 02 aug 02 -pipe- england asylum couple reunited with children 01 aug 02 -pipe- england mosque raid couple 's deportation delayed 31 jul 02 -pipe- england mosque raid mother speaks out internet links : refugee council home office the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites e-mail this story to a friend links to more breakfast stories in this section running the red soak the rich metrosexual man casualty 's big day rail passengers face above inflation rise the truth about nanotechnology hoover street revival hitchcock blonde when violence begins at home more children suffering from eating disorders calling time on licensing laws the lessons of the trupti patel case open all hours ^ ^ back to top news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point -pipe- country profiles -pipe- in depth -pipe- programmes - to bbc sport > > -pipe- to bbc weather > > -pipe- to bbc world service > > - © mmiii -pipe- news sources -pipe- privacy

deutsche post wants to set up a mail service in japan this autumn , according to a report in the nihon keizai shimbun newspaper in japan .
the move would be an attempt to steal a lead on japan 's plans to let its postal public corporation expand into international markets .
postal public , which is to handle both mail and the post office 's savings and insurance services from next spring , is expected to facilitate the privatisation of japan 's postal services .
contracting out deutsche post 's service would deal with direct mail , such as catalogues and pamphlets , from companies to consumers .
japanese firms mailing customers in major cities , for example tokyo , osaka and nagoya , would be among deutsche post 's target customers .
but rather than setting up its own local delivery infrastructures , deutsche post would farm out the work to dhl international .
deutsche post would not need to invest heavily to set up the service because it already owns a fleet of aircraft .
and since it would not be delivering letters , it would not need approval for its plans by the japanese government , the newspaper said .

"
you call this normal ?
you have the temerity to say so ? "
jm lyngdoh chief election commissioner jm lyngdoh , who was visiting the riot-torn state to assess whether state elections can go ahead , expressed concern that officials in western baroda district had been giving out the " wrong information " .
under india 's system , the timing of elections can only be decided by the country 's election commission .
his comments come as the country 's president , abdul kalam , prepares to visit gujarat on monday to look at the progress of rehabilitation work for the victims of the rioting , most of them muslim .
violence , which erupted in the state in february after an attack on train carrying hindu activists , left more than 1,000 people dead .
angry comments reports said mr lyngdoh had severely censured the gujarat 's chief secretary g subba rao when he told him that the situation in the state was normal .
" you call this normal ?
you have the temerity to say so ? " , mr lyngdoh is quoted as saying .
" have you been to the relief camps ?
i suggest that you stay there for two days " , he is reported to have told the chief secretary .
the state 's controversial chief minister , narendra modi , who was severely criticised for his handling of religious violence , dissolved the state assembly in july and called for fresh elections .
but india 's opposition parties say a free and fair poll is not possible in an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty in which they say many muslims of the state are still living .
' back to normal ' mr lyngdoh is reported to been angry when baroda 's district collector remarked that communal violence in the area had been only sporadic .
" what kind of stories were you telling us ? " , mr lyngdoh told district collector bhagyesh jha .
" you said only sporadic incidents .
sporadic incidents ?
you are jokers .
all of you .
are n't you ashamed of yourselves " , he told senior officials .
baroda was among the cities worst affected by the communal rioting .
bjp strategy mr modi , who still has the backing of the ruling bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- , insists that life in gujarat has returned to normal .
he has also rejected allegations that his hindu nationalist administration was complicit in the slaughter of muslims following the train attack .
the bjp itself is preparing for the polls and held a meeting of its senior gujarat leaders on friday .
civil-rights activists maintain that elections would be an insult to survivors , who are still waiting for compensation .
they also point out that thousands of people lost all their belongings , including their identity documents , in the violence and would therefore be unable to vote .
analysts say by holding snap elections , mr modi and the bjp expect to return to power on a wave of hindu support .
