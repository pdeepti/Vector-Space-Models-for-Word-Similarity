many openly condemned the military ouster although only cuba had any sympathy for the overthrown president hugo chavez .
but while anxious about the manner of the change of power , doors were left open for the possible recognition of the interim government at a later date .
by coincidence , many heads of state of venezuela 's neighbours were together for a meeting of the rio group in costa rica .
venezuela 's own delegation had left hurriedly as the coup unfolded .
the rio group summit asked the secretary general of the organization of american states , cesar gaviria , to call a special meeting of the group 's permanent council to discuss the situation in venezuela .
mexican president vicente fox said mexico " will abstain from recognising - or not - the new government of venezuela . "
resignation query mr fox - himself under pressure at home - said venezuela 's crisis had been caused by policies that polarised society and by the " erratic ways of the government " .
chile 's ricardo lagos agreed but said solutions using force were not acceptable in the 21st century . "
we are operating in a sea of unknowns " peruvian president alejandro toledo el salvador 's president francisco flores , however , said he supported the new leadership .
" we consider president chavez 's resignation as the culmination of a process of polarisation , confrontation and abuses of democratic principles , " he said .
peruvian president alejandro toledo said it was still too early to say whether the rest of latin america could accept the new government as legitimate .
" i was n't the greatest fan of the chavez government and i recognise that the people have the right to remove their government , but they have to do so through democratic channels in adherence to the rule of law , " he said .
one issue to be cleared up was whether mr chavez had signed a written resignation .
" we are operating in a sea of unknowns and we need more information .
it would be premature to issue any definitive conclusion , " mr toledo said .
but both argentine president eduardo duhalde and paraguayan president luis gonzalez macchi called venezuela 's new government illegitimate .
asylum claims chile 's president lagos said his country had been asked whether it would grant asylum to members of mr chavez 's former government , but no formal requests had been made .
officials in panama , a country that has harboured several ousted leaders in the past , denied that mr chavez or any of his family members had asked for asylum and said it would not be granted if sought .
mr chavez appeared to have friends only in cuba - a relationship he cultivated since taking office .
cuba 's foreign minister felipe perez roque said mr chavez was still considered the constitutional president of venezuela .
cuba said venezuela had suffered a " counter-revolutionary " plot by the " subversive " rich .
president fidel castro - who treated mr chavez like a son and talked to him shortly before he was ousted - has made no public statements .

" it 's clear that the authorities in iran simply want people to go home - i mean progressively , in growing numbers .

" if we can not deliver the real repatriation , managed with some material assistance , with unhcr on the ground at arrival points in the villages , then i fear we will see breakdown of trust with the iranian authorities . "
mr lubbers says he believes that most areas of afghanistan are now safe enough to return to .
he says he will use this trip to try to resolve any remaining problems and help create an atmosphere of confidence to give refugees the courage to decide to go home .

a british woman living in south africa could cost the uk government Â£ 330 million a year if she succeeds in her legal action this week to get her state retirement pension unfrozen .
annette carson moved to south africa in 1989 to work in advertising .
now 61 she still earns her living as a writer .
but she was horrified to find that after a lifetime contributing to a uk state pension she would be discriminated against for living in her chosen country .
" i continued with my state pension contributions because wherever you are in the world you should always do that .
the department of social security happily took my money .
but i was horrified to learn , not from the uk government but from a newspaper , that when i claimed my pension it would be frozen .
i got in september 2000 and in april 2001 it was not increased and that is the basis of my case " annette carson said .
campaigners have been trying for decades to get the government to end the discrimination which creates two classes of british pensioner living abroad .
the lucky half are the 441,800 people who live in 40 countries where their uk retirement pensions are increased each year in line with inflation .
from 8 april 2002 they saw a rise of 4.1 % in their basic pension .
the unlucky half are the 490,200 who live in the rest of the world .
their pensions are frozen at the date when they first claimed them leaving some older people with just a few pounds a week despite a lifetime working and contributing to the uk national insurance scheme .
almost all these frozen pensioners live in the commonwealth - principally in australia , canada , new zealand and south africa .
despite consistent pressure from successive australian and canadian ministers , all british governments , conservative and labour , have resisted change on grounds of cost - currently put at Â£ 330 million a year to unfreeze pensions around the world .
the present labour government , despite the fact that that several serving ministers supported change when in opposition , says it would rather concentrate resources on poorer pensioners in the uk .
this week 's high court case is of tremendous importance to the campaigners .
it is being brought under the 1998 human rights act , which incorporates into uk law the european convention on human rights .
article 1 of the first protocol to the convention says everyone is " entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions " which " no one shall be deprived of " .
lawyers argue that the state retirement pension is a possession which has been paid for and should not be arbitrarily taken away from people .
moreover , the way in which it is taken away could also contravene article 14 which says " the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground " .
clearly there is discrimination between those who live in the 40 countries where pensions are uprated and the rest of the world where they are not .
the solicitor handling the case , graham chrystie a partner with solicitors thomas eggar , says that the case is about more than annette carson .
" if annette wins we will ask the court to declare the regulations which freeze pensions paid abroad ultra vires and of no effect .
her case is the lead case but we represent all the canadian and south african pensioners .
the furthest we can go back is 2 october 2000 when the human rights act came into force .
but the quantum -lsb- amount -rsb- would have to be settled country by country .
annette gets no benefit to make up her loss from the south african government but others might and they could not get double provision out of the case . "
president of the south african alliance of british pensioners charles poole , says a lot is riding on the case " there is a lot of people living on the breadline .
one couple i know , in their late 80s , are still getting about Â£ 8 a week which they first claimed nearly 30 years ago .
if they got the full amount , around Â£ 100 , they could afford the medical care they need . "
uk retirement and bereavement pensions are frozen at the rate first paid in all countries of the world , except for pensioners living in these 40 countries where pensions are uprated as they are in the uk .
alderney , austria , barbados , belgium , bermuda , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , cyprus , denmark , federal republic of yugoslavia -lrb- serbia -rrb- , finland , france , germany , gibraltar , greece , guernsey , iceland , ireland , isle of man , israel , italy , jamaica , jersey , kosovo , liechtenstein , luxembourg , macedonia , malta , mauritius , netherlands , norway , philippines , portugal , sark , slovenia , spain , sweden , switzerland , turkey , and united states of america .
in the falkland islands the island government tops up frozen uk pensions to the level that would have been paid in the uk .
