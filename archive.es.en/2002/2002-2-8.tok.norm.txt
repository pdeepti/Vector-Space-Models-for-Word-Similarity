the president has ruled that the geneva conventions do apply , after all , to the taleban prisoners , but not to members of al-qaeda .
however , he has maintained that members of neither group qualify as prisoners-of-war .
white house spokesman ari fleischer insisted that the treatment of all the prisoners would not change as a result .
what is less clear is the legal logic , and the legal implications .
uniforms in the case of al-qaeda fighters , the lawyers have decided that they do not qualify , because al-qaeda itself is not a party to the geneva conventions .
that 's simple enough , even if some human rights activists disagree about the train of thought .
as for the taleban , the white house says they are covered by the geneva conventions , because the state of afghanistan is a party to the conventions , even though the united states never recognised the taleban as the legitimate regime .
mr fleischer cited two reasons why the taleban detainees were nevertheless not eligible to be treated as prisoners-of-war : failure to wear uniforms that distinguish them from the civilian population failure to conduct their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war .
but in the geneva conventions those requirements only apply to " members of militias and members of other volunteer corps " .
they say prisoner-of-war status should be given to " members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a government or authority not recognised by the detaining power " - a description which could well apply to the taleban forces .
another part of the conventions states that where any doubt arises about the status of prisoners , they should be treated as prisoners-of-war until the issue is decided by a " competent tribunal " .
there is provision for such tribunals in american military law .
but despite the white house 's announcement on the geneva conventions , there is no word that the americans plan to set up any such tribunals .
military commissions all of that means that the taleban prisoners should at least have a case to argue that they are being denied their legal rights .
their problem is that it is not clear if or when they will ever appear before a court of law to argue the case .
american law does not extend to guantanamo bay , so it is no use applying to the american courts to challenge the ruling .
if they are tried , it is likely to be before one of the military commissions being proposed by president bush .
those commissions would not have the safeguards which the geneva conventions specify for prisoners-of-war .
the taleban detainees would find themselves arguing their case before a tribunal of military officers appointed by the us government .
double-edged weapon ?
so this ruling appears to be little more than a legal move which will not have any practical impact .
one reason for the change of heart by president bush may be the recent international pressure .
equally - if not more - important were concerns expressed by the us military about their possible fate , if they should fall into enemy hands .
after all , american special forces also often do n't wear uniforms , or carry their arms openly .
the narrow interpretation of the geneva conventions being made by the bush administration could be a double-edged weapon .

despite the continuing violence back home , he 's in as strong a position as he has ever been .
the main purpose of the trip is to keep up the pressure on the beleaguered yasser arafat .
on the face of it , mr sharon is pushing at an open door in the united states , but he still faces many challenges in getting what he wants from the americans .
" -lrb- mr arafat -rrb- must be put under heavier pressure than ever , from america , from europeans , from us , " mr sharon told the new york times .
" at the current time , he 's too influential for somebody else to get up and take over - therefore , everything depends on pressure on arafat . "
recent events suggest that mr sharon will not have difficulty convincing the us of his position .
president bush is furious at the palestinian leader over his alleged involvement with the recent arms shipment discovered by the israelis .
mr bush believes he was lied to by mr arafat in a personal letter , something that provoked the president to say that he was " very disappointed " with the palestinian leader .
but even before the bush-sharon meeting , the white house spokesman , ari fleischer stressed that the us would " remain engaged in the region and remain engaged with the palestinian authority " .
the american envoy , bill burns , pointed out that mr arafat was still the legitimate leader of that authority .
the national security council , composed of mr bush and his top advisers , has certainly considered cutting off ties with the palestinian leadership .
so far the president has stepped back from that dramatic move .
there 's a reluctance even to take the lesser step of closing the plo office in washington .
in response to the israeli calls , mr arafat has begun a new campaign to put his case across .
he 's given rare interviews with the bbc , the american media and various newspapers .
in an article on sunday , also in the new york times , mr arafat said he condemned " the attacks carried out by terrorist groups against israeli civilians . "
the palestinian leader went on to offer slightly conciliatory language over the issue of the palestinian right of return to israel .
there have even been talks between some of mr arafat 's key lieutenants .
war with iraq ?
with america 's european and arab allies also pressing for dialogue , it means that mr sharon is unlikely to win much more ground from the us .
but it is not just the conflict with the palestinians that preoccupies the israeli leader .
he has also warned that if the us goes to war with iraq , this time the israelis will not sit it out .
that is something that could cause deep problems for washington in what is looking like an increasingly inevitable march to war against baghdad .
so while mr sharon is , no doubt , being warmly received here in washington , there is still plenty of tension between these two closest of allies .

the prime minister received the unprecedented invitation to address the country 's political leaders in the capital , accra , after his keynote speech in nigeria on thursday .
it was a clear sign that his much-criticised tour of west africa is increasingly being viewed as significant by the region 's leaders .
but the latest leg of his whirlwind tour of four countries comes as problems over possible industrial action by teachers and postal workers intensify at home .
mr blair is certain to face yet more criticism for being out of the country at such a time , but he believes he can concentrate on both domestic and international issues .
he is absolutely committed to his african mission and believes the majority of the british public are also concerned about tackling poverty and instability on the continent .
his unexpected invitation to address the parliament in accra will offer him ammunition in his claim that his trip is worthwhile .
he will use the off-the-cuff remarks to flesh out his proposals on changing the nature of financial aid to the region .
he believes the traditional practice of simply offering cash as a " handout " to the developing countries is flawed and fails to lead to lasting change .
instead , he wants to tie such aid to good governance as a way of " empowering people " to get their economies on a sound footing .
it is a " we help you best when you help yourselves " policy which he has long been promoting .
at the same time , the prime minister is to offer - on a similar basis - more military aid to african countries facing internal conflicts .
aides stressed he wanted to " help them build their own capacity for for conflict resolution " .
mr blair is not prepared to send more british troops into africa but is willing to extend the programme of advice and training of local forces which already operates in some areas of the continent .
before addressing parliament in ghana , he will present a paper fleshing out his offer to a special seminar on conflict resolution at the country 's armed forces command and staff college .
he will develop his themes of how the huge problem of small arms in particular can be tackled and how the countries can be helped to handle their own peacekeeping operations under the umbrella of the united nations .
following his speech to the parliament he will travel outside the capital to meet tribal chiefs before going on the visit the country 's cocoa research institute and a cocoa co-operative .
ghana is the second largest chocolate producer in the world and the prime minister wants to work towards opening up global markets for the produce .

bbc news -pipe- scotland -pipe- councillor ' let down ' over officegate categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk : scotland front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics friday , 8 february , 2002 , 06:28 gmt councillor ' let down ' over officegate the row centred on mr mcleish 's glenrothes office a labour councillor who helped run a charity which rented office space from former first minister henry mcleish has quit .
angela mccallum was due to stand down at next year 's council elections owing to ill health , but has brought forward her resignation - blaming media harassment over the controversy .
the member of fife council said she felt " badly let down " by mr mcleish 's handling of the affair .
council leader christine may has pledged that any wrong-doing would be rooted out and dealt with .
the officegate controversy which led to the central fife msp 's resignation as first minister last year centred on his constituency office in glenrothes .
it 's terribly sad when someone who has served the public feels they can no longer do that labour party spokesman he claimed expenses from the house of commons on the office during the 14 years he was westminster mp for central fife - but failed to declare the £ 36,000 he made from sub lets .
amid mounting controversy , mr mcleish decided to quit when a further sub let involving the third age group came to light after he had declared details of five others to the media .
ms mccallum , who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis , said she had been proud to work for the third age group .
in her resignation letter , she said she had worked part time for the organisation in 1995 and 1996 .
audit committee " i was proud to work for them and feel that i and they have been badly let down by the first minister 's decision not to acknowledge their existence as part of his full and frank disclosure and the resulting media attention , " she wrote .
fife council 's audit committee is carrying out an inquiry into allegations that it paid £ 40,000 to the charity - which provided services to old people - after it had been wound up .
scotland 's auditor general , robert black , has also been asked to investigate by scottish national party msp tricia marwick .
ms mccallum said she had raised the matter with the head of the council 's social work department after she discovered the group was still receiving council cash .
angela mccallum has resigned she said she was told the arrangement had been put in place " to ensure that the day centres continued to operate " .
ms mccallum now plans to " rebuild her life in peace " and campaign on behalf of arthritis sufferers .
fife council leader christine may said she was " very sorry " that ms mccallum had resigned .
she also promised that the council investigation would not be a cover-up .
she said she was " extremely concerned " at the damage the affair had done to the image of labour and the council itself .
independent inquiry ms may said she had told the council 's chief executive , douglas sinclair , that she wanted his report on the affair to be " full , open , frank and honest " .
ms marwick said the allegations in ms mccallum 's letter backed up her demand for an independent inquiry into fife council 's grants to the third age group .
scottish tory local government spokesman , keith harding , also called for an independent investigation .

angela mccallum was due to stand down at next year 's council elections owing to ill health , but has brought forward her resignation - blaming media harassment over the controversy .
the member of fife council said she felt " badly let down " by mr mcleish 's handling of the affair .
council leader christine may has pledged that any wrong-doing would be rooted out and dealt with .
the officegate controversy which led to the central fife msp 's resignation as first minister last year centred on his constituency office in glenrothes .
it 's terribly sad when someone who has served the public feels they can no longer do that labour party spokesman he claimed expenses from the house of commons on the office during the 14 years he was westminster mp for central fife - but failed to declare the £ 36,000 he made from sub lets .
amid mounting controversy , mr mcleish decided to quit when a further sub let involving the third age group came to light after he had declared details of five others to the media .
ms mccallum , who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis , said she had been proud to work for the third age group .
in her resignation letter , she said she had worked part time for the organisation in 1995 and 1996 .
audit committee " i was proud to work for them and feel that i and they have been badly let down by the first minister 's decision not to acknowledge their existence as part of his full and frank disclosure and the resulting media attention , " she wrote .
fife council 's audit committee is carrying out an inquiry into allegations that it paid £ 40,000 to the charity - which provided services to old people - after it had been wound up .
scotland 's auditor general , robert black , has also been asked to investigate by scottish national party msp tricia marwick .
ms mccallum said she had raised the matter with the head of the council 's social work department after she discovered the group was still receiving council cash .
she said she was told the arrangement had been put in place " to ensure that the day centres continued to operate " .
ms mccallum now plans to " rebuild her life in peace " and campaign on behalf of arthritis sufferers .
fife council leader christine may said she was " very sorry " that ms mccallum had resigned .
she also promised that the council investigation would not be a cover-up .
she said she was " extremely concerned " at the damage the affair had done to the image of labour and the council itself .
independent inquiry ms may said she had told the council 's chief executive , douglas sinclair , that she wanted his report on the affair to be " full , open , frank and honest " .
ms marwick said the allegations in ms mccallum 's letter backed up her demand for an independent inquiry into fife council 's grants to the third age group .
scottish tory local government spokesman , keith harding , also called for an independent investigation .
he said the resignation made it clear that " not everything about the officegate affair has been brought out into the public domain " .

" he is coming for two days to present his plans and start a discussion , " said the fund 's deputy managing director , eduardo aninat .
renewed economic aid is vital to enable argentina to restore economic and social stability to the country which has been racked by economic crisis and bloody street protests since the former government defaulted on debt payments late last year .
the fund is expected to be keen to help , though any assistance would be conditional .
further moves required the imf did not immediately comment on argentina 's crisis plan , which includes sharp cuts in public spending and the floating of the peso against the dollar .
this led mr remes lenicov to chastise the fund , insisting that " there should have been a stronger reply " .
on thursday , the imf 's silence was partially broken : " they have done a couple of things , but not enough yet to warrant a -lsb- loans -rsb- program , " said mr aninat .
" they are going to have to do some more things and this is a good opportunity to sit down and talk . "
further supportive statements are expected later on friday .
not imminent next week 's meeting will not include discussions about the size of any loans , mr aninat warned .
separately , a us official warned against assuming that lending is about to be resumed .
the official said the meeting would be just " one step on a very long road " .
