and they will be looking to chancellor gordon brown 's budget to tackle what they say is a serious funding shortfall .
universities uk has written to the education secretary estelle morris warning her that many vice chancellors are " deeply unhappy " with funding allocations .
they say that funding arrangements will mean cutbacks for some universities and departments .
the government wants universities to expand to provide places for at least 50 % of young people by the end of the decade .
but universities argue that they are not receiving budget increases to match these ambitions - which they say they will require an extra 17,000 staff .
these calls for more money have been echoed by the chair of the education select committee , barry sheerman - who says higher education should be a priority above health .
" the benefits are provable and apparent .
i believe that an extra pound invested in higher education is better value than an extra pound invested in health , " said mr sheerman .
" one of the real problems in our country is that we do n't take higher education seriously enough . "
student loans but students waiting to find how the government intends to reform the loans system are likely to have to wait until later this summer .
there has been speculation that graduate taxes could replace or complement loans and tuition fees , but this will not be known until the comprehensive spending review in july .
with little promised for education in the pre-budget statement in november , teachers might also be looking to the spending review for extra funds , rather than wednesday 's budget .
teachers ' unions have threatened industrial action unless the government resolves a long-running dispute over workload .
and they will be looking to the spending review to provide the extra funds needed to reduce working hours and to alleviate staff shortages .
but head teachers will be looking to the chancellor for a repeat of previous budgets , in which he has announced windfall payments for books and equipment .

a masterpiece of 60s memorabilia , its red and yellow wings sprung out at the flick of a switch .
it must be worth a fortune these days .
so does the lavish new stage production featuring ian fleming 's famous flying car manage to capture the elusive magic of childhood ?
the answer is a categorical yes - with wings on .
in fact , you come out of the london palladium feeling like a kid on christmas eve .
' assault on the senses ' right from the word go , this show , directed by adrian noble , launches a massive assault on the senses .
there is so much going on that the cast of dozens seems like hundreds .
and as each new piece of scenery glides into view there is a collective intake of breath at the sheer opulence of it all .
as storylines go it is basic goodies versus baddies fare .
and noble pulls out all the pantomime stops .
there 's a handsome hero looking for love -lrb- hooray ! -rrb- , a beautiful heroine -lrb- whoah ! -rrb- , a couple of comical villains with dodgy foreign accents -lrb- boo ! -rrb- and the utterly evil child catcher -lrb- hiss ! -rrb- .
although the cast is heavily populated with ragamuffin children - and several dogs - the show manages not to succumb to sentimentality and instead delivers spectacle in spades .
as anyone who grew up with the film will tell you , the child catcher is a nightmare figure .
and now it 's the turn of richard " rocky horror " o 'brien to terrify a new generation , stalking around the stage like nosferatu with a bad comb-over .
o 'brien is just one of an impressive cast : michael ball is a likeable caractacus potts , the inventor extraordinaire who is struggling to raise his two kids with the help of their eccentric grandpa -lrb- anton rodgers -rrb- .
rodgers steals many of the comic scenes , along with brian blessed and nichola mcauliffe as the colourful despots of vulgaria , baron and baroness bomburst .
blessed , in classic blackadder mode , is as hilarious and over-the-top as ever .
cast in this ocean of seasoned talent , west end newcomer emma williams manages to keep her head well above water as truly scrumptious .
cliff-hanger ending of course the car is the real star of the show - and it is mercifully not overused .
there are times during the second act that you begin to wonder where it has gone .
chitty chitty bang bang 's arrival on stage is breathtaking .
and at the cliff-hanger ending to the first half , even though you know it is going to sprout wings , there is still a tingling down the spine .
just how this production manages to make the car swoop over the stalls is pure mystery .
there 's no mystery though about what happened to my beloved chitty chitty bang bang in the toy cupboard .
i gave it away to a jumble sale , where it would have sold for 10p .
if anyone bought it - can i please have it back ?

when mr ahern came to power in 1997 , he promised his coalition government with the progressive democrats would last five years .
few believed him .
after all , his fianna fail party , more used to single party administrations , hardly had a good record of sharing power .
but that has now changed .
as for his achievements , mr ahern can point to the good friday agreement that has brought some form of stability to northern ireland and to the republic of ireland 's booming economy .
but the opposition parties say fianna fail remains an " ethically-challenged party " .
six of those 77 tds -lrb- mps -rrb- elected five years ago have suffered some form of humiliation or forced resignation .
most because of tax-evasion-related activity in the 1980s .
but the whiff of scandal remains .
sinn fein has a different whiff to deal with - that of cordite .
party president gerry adams claims there are " no organic links " between sinn fein and the ira .
mr ahern disagrees and says the continued existence of the ira means sinn fein can not , because of article 15 of the irish constitution , be a coalition partner .
" hypocrisy " , replies sinn fein .
" if it 's okay for us to be in government in northern ireland with the ulster unionists why not with fianna fail in the republic ? "
the party believes the constitutional argument is nonsense .
it is a view supported by at least one academic lawyer , gerard hogan from trinity college dublin .
he told the bbc northern ireland hearts and minds programme last week that while there were sound political reasons for excluding government , there was no legal or constitutional ground .
sinn fein has one td at the moment .
it hopes to come back with three but the bookies reckon seven . "
at stake are the wastelands of opposition or the lush plains of political power " opinion polls suggest that mr ahern is much more popular than michael noonan , the leader of the main opposition party fine gael .
indeed , if the same polls are to be believed , the only question that needs answering is : who will fianna fail be back in government with ?
will it be the progressive democrats , labour , the greens or independents ?
or is it conceivable that there will be a single party government ?
the phrase " single party government " for many fianna fail leaders is the hidden desire that dare not be spoken of , at least , in public .
that is just in case the electorate gets scared of trusting the party with an overall majority , given its ethical record .
but fianna fail and the other parties know that very soon the most important court they will soon face , that of public opinion and the electorate , will soon decide on their fate .
at stake , the wastelands of opposition or the lush plains of political power .

after all , his fianna fail party , more used to single party administrations , hardly had a good record of sharing power .
but that has now changed .
bertie ahern 's party has been in a coalition government since 1997 as for his achievements , mr ahern can point to the good friday agreement that has brought some form of stability to northern ireland and to the republic of ireland 's booming economy .
but the opposition parties say fianna fail remains an " ethically-challenged party " .
six of those 77 tds -lrb- mps -rrb- elected five years ago have suffered some form of humiliation or forced resignation .
most because of tax-evasion-related activity in the 1980s .
but the whiff of scandal remains .
sinn fein has a different whiff to deal with - that of cordite .
party president gerry adams claims there are " no organic links " between sinn fein and the ira .
mr ahern disagrees and says the continued existence of the ira means sinn fein can not , because of article 15 of the irish constitution , be a coalition partner .
" hypocrisy " , replies sinn fein .
" if it 's okay for us to be in government in northern ireland with the ulster unionists why not with fianna fail in the republic ? "
the party believes the constitutional argument is nonsense .
gerry adams : " no organic links " between sinn fein and ira it is a view supported by at least one academic lawyer , gerard hogan from trinity college dublin .
he told the bbc northern ireland hearts and minds programme last week that while there were sound political reasons for excluding government , there was no legal or constitutional ground .
sinn fein has one td at the moment .
it hopes to come back with three but the bookies reckon seven .
at stake are the wastelands of opposition or the lush plains of political power opinion polls suggest that mr ahern is much more popular than michael noonan , the leader of the main opposition party fine gael .
indeed , if the same polls are to be believed , the only question that needs answering is : who will fianna fail be back in government with ?
will it be the progressive democrats , labour , the greens or independents ?
or is it conceivable that there will be a single party government ?
the phrase " single party government " for many fianna fail leaders is the hidden desire that dare not be spoken of , at least , in public .
that is just in case the electorate gets scared of trusting the party with an overall majority , given its ethical record .
but fianna fail and the other parties know that very soon the most important court they will soon face , that of public opinion and the electorate , will soon decide on their fate .

it is technology that tends to lead countries and economies out of recession mark whitby intel md for northern europe the news has prompted renewed investor confidence in the technology sector in markets around the world .
" the semiconductor industry tends to be the first into a recession but pulls through the earliest , " mark whitby , intel 's managing director for northern europe told bbc news online .
this means that market watchers are particularly vigilant of the chip sector and the fact that intel has met its growth projections is a " healthy sign " , he added .
intel 's shares surged almost 7 % before the announcement , and a further 2 % in after hours trading once it had released its results .
the news prompted a tech rally in asian markets , with korea 's samsung - the largest chip maker in the world - gaining 5 % .

the firm insisted , however , that the decline in tech demand was far from over .
" we are being powered by the major emerging markets of china , india and russia , " said mr whitby , " but established markets such as the us and europe continue to be impacted by weak it spending . "
mr whitby was hesitant to predict when corporate spending on it would pick-up in the west , although he pointed out that a lot of equipment is coming up for renewal three years after the pre-millennium technology spend .
the semiconductor industry has been suffering from a global slump in demand for personal computers as companies have reined in spending due to the economic slowdown .
ramping up but intel says it is well positioned to take advantage of the upturn , when it happens .
on 2 april , the company unveiled a 2.4 gigahertz pentium 4 , its fastest chip yet .
its strategy has led it to continue investing heavily in research and development despite the tough times .
" we will be ready to ramp production up very rapidly , " mr whitby said .
the dire straits of the global chip market has driven many of intel 's smaller rivals to extreme measures to cut costs and remain afloat .
" it is technology that tends to lead countries and economies out of recession , " said mr whitby , explaining his firm 's continued emphasis on developing new products .

a european commission watchdog has criticised the hair dye industry for failing to provide evidence of the safety of its products .
is n't it amazing that a product should have such wide gaps in its toxicological requirements but be on sale ?
dr ian white the scientific committee on cosmetic and non-food products intended for consumers says without adequate evidence it is unable to carry out a full risk assessment .
the cancer research society has responded by advising consumers not to use the products until further research has been completed .
most concerns surround dark-coloured , permanent dyes used every four to six weeks .
scientists are particularly worried about two chemical ingredients , para-phenylenediamine and tetrahydro-6-nitroquinoxaline .
these chemicals have been shown to damage the body 's genetic material , and to cause cancer in animals .
it is not the first time that fears have been raised about the safety of permanent hair dyes , which have previously been linked to arthritis and damage to unborn children .
bladder risk last year a study by the university of southern california found women who used permanent hair dyes at least once a month were up to three times more likely to develop bladder cancer. studies to date have concluded that they are safe when used as directed cosmetic toiletry and perfumery association the researchers also found that long-serving hairdressers were also at increased risk .
no such link has been found between cancer and semi-permanent and temporary hair dyes .
commenting on the failure of the industry to provide necessary information , dr ian white , head of the committee and a consultant dermatologist at st thomas ' hospital , london , was quoted as saying : " they have not provided ample information that the dye is safe .
" is n't it amazing that a product should have such wide gaps in its toxicological requirements but be on sale ? "
however , dr white stressed that the products had been on sale for decades , and only women who had used them over many years could be at any kind of risk .
a spokesperson for the cosmetic toiletry and perfumery association said twice as many men as women contracted bladder cancer - not what would be expected if hair dye posed a significant risk .
" hair colorants are among the most thoroughly studied products on the market and studies to date have concluded that they are safe when used as directed . "
bladder cancer is diagnosed in more than 13,600 people in the uk each year .
it kills 4,850 .

as the fledgling nation elects its first president , she reflects on its struggle for freedom and future challenges .
thirty-one-year-old madalena made a tough personal sacrifice in the fight for her country 's freedom - she chose to inform on a member of her own family .
it was a terrible time .
i try to do the best i can to forget the time .
even now , if i hear the sound of a gun i run .
he was the second in command of aitarak , or " thorn " , a feared pro-indonesia militia led by the notorious eurico guterres , who is now wanted by the united nations on charges of crimes against humanity .
the militia member was also her cousin .
madalena , a student at the time , pretended to be sympathetic to his views and then fed the information he gave her to fretilin 's guerrillas fighting for independence and journalists .
madalena and her husband .
they married while refugees in australia .
" sometimes i wanted to cry in front of him because he did something very different to what i did , " she said .
" it was a terrible time .
i try to do the best i can to forget the time .
even now , if i hear the sound of a gun i run . "
but she said that even at the worst times , when she and her then-fiancé felt they had no room to move , " we still had something inside that we would become free " .
warning ignored as the vote for independence in august 1999 approached , madalena learned from her cousin that the pro-indonesia militias were planning to wreak terrible violence if the poll did not go their way .
eurico guterres : the feared leader of aitarak she said her partner , a journalist , tried to warn the un in east timor that a massacre would ensue .
but the un insisted that indonesia , as a member of the united nations , would respect east timor 's right to choose .
fearing the worst , on the day before the vote madalena packed her bags and sought refuge in the un compound in dili .
there she learned that east timor had won the right to independence .
