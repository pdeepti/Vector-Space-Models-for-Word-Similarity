the public health laboratory service is investigating three suspected cases in england and one in scotland .
it is thought the four contracted the disease through contaminated heroin .
a warning has now been issued to drug users and health care professionals across the uk .
prove fatal the rare condition is caused by bacteria that poison the body if injected .
more than 90 % of cases are treated successfully - but some prove fatal .
early symptoms - blurred vision and difficulty swallowing and speaking - can quickly progress to include paralysis and breathing problems .
a spokesman for the public health laboratory service said any drug users with these symptoms should immediately seek medical help .
' unprecedented outbreak ' he added that , as precautionary measures , heroin users should try to use as little citric acid as possible while injecting and refrain from sharing needles .
last year , 40 addicts across the uk and ireland , including 18 from glasgow , died after contracting an illness which caused severe inflammation of vital organs from infected heroin .
a health board report described an " unprecedented outbreak of severe illness " among 60 users in scotland , mostly in glasgow , between april and august 2000 .
and it identified the bacterium clostridium novyi - from the same family of organisms as wound botulism - as the cause of the illness .

that is why policy for next year 's manifesto is likely to be at the forefront of delegates ' minds when they descend on the dewar 's centre in perth .
a total of nine documents - touching on all areas of devolved government - will be up for discussion at this year 's conference .
labour said that each had been produced " through two-years consultation with the party membership , affiliate organisations and outside interest groups " .
it is promising that their content and the resulting discussions " will set the direction " for the manifesto in 2003 .

this conference will also be the first that jack mcconnell has addressed as scottish party leader .
after the messy demise of mr mcleish and the subsequent ' culling ' of his cabinet , the first minister will attempt to reassure the grassroots membership that he can lead them to victory .
his ' rookie ' cabinet appointees will also face a stern test on the platform .
they are already on a steep learning curve and must project a high degree of competence in their new portfolios .
overall , the objectives will be to put the party on an election footing , encourage unity and start the process of refining policies for next year 's manifesto .

security workers at manchester airport have begun a 36-hour strike .
talks which took place earlier this week between airport managers and the transport and general workers ' union -lrb- tgwu -rrb- in a last-ditch attempt to halt the stoppage , ended in deadlock .
the union wants managers to withdraw threats to cut 150 security jobs , cut wages by up to 40 % , reduce holidays and introduce new rosters .
a series of one and two-hour strikes has already taken place , but the tgwu has decided to step up its action .
contingency plans brian bowen , regional industrial organiser for the union , said : " all our actions so far have been designed to cause the least disruption possible for passengers .
" but our members are adamant they want to resolve this dispute and therefore decided to hold a 36-hour stoppage . "
we do not anticipate any serious delays " airport spokesman a spokeswoman for manchester airport said : " there will be robust contingency plans in place .
" it will be business as usual .
" passengers are advised to check-in as normal .
we do not anticipate any serious delays . "
manchester airport has been at the centre of three security breaches this year and unions are calling for the government to investigate .
bill morris , the tgwu 's general secretary , has written to transport minister stephen byers following the security breakdowns .
