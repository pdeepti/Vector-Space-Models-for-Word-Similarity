"
china 's explanation is completely unacceptable " japan 's foreign minister yoriko kawaguchi china says that a japanese consular official gave the police permission to enter the mission in shenyang and that the official later offered thanks for dealing with the situation .
however japan has denied this and says it intends to send a factfinding mission to investigate the incident in the north-east chinese city .
japanese foreign minister yoriko kawaguchi said that china must apologise for the incursion and hand over the five people - including a child .
television footage broadcast in recent days shows them successfully entering the compound before being dragged out by chinese guards despite the child 's screams and protests from the japanese diplomatic staff .
earlier reports said that only two men out of a group of five north koreans succeeded in rushing into the japanese consulate before being seized by chinese police .
the footage has galvanised public opinion in japan and increased pressure on the japanese government to act on the matter , especially since several people who appear to be japanese consulate staff are shown in the footage watching the incident yet making no move to intervene .
the japanese foreign ministry is sending an official to the consulate to look further into what happened , after admitting the reaction of the diplomats had been inadequate .
latest incident the asylum attempt was the latest in a series of moves by north koreans to enter foreign embassies and consulates in china .
at least two north koreans asylum seekers are still in the us consulate in shenyang , where us and chinese officials are continuing talks about their future .
in march , 25 north koreans successfully entered the spanish embassy in beijing demanding political asylum in south korea .
they threatened to kill themselves if china sent them back home .
beijing regards the tens of thousands of north koreans in china as economic migrants who must be sent home .
but in this and similar cases , the asylum seekers were allowed to go to south korea , prompting other groups to try similar tactics .

pw defence have " withdrawn from duty " david howell , who was allegedly secretly recorded offering to sell the weapons to a bbc reporter .
derbyshire police have started investigations - paying an " informal visit " to the factory - and the share price of parent company chemring group plc fell sharply as a result .
but chemring has denied the weapons are being manufactured and blamed mr howell 's comments on his own " confusion " .
the overseas sales manager appeared to offer 500 landmines at a price of £ 25,000 to bbc defence and diplomatic correspondent andrew gilligan , posing as a customer .
such weapons are banned under the ottawa convention and production and sale is outlawed in the uk under the 1998 landmines act .
mps demanded an inquiry into the company after the revelations on the bbc radio 4 's today programme on friday .
later that day , police visited the company factory in derbyshire .
' no sales since 1999 ' during a secretly recorded interview , mr howell was heard to admit to mr gilligan the grenades were " on the fringes of legality " .
a spokesman for chemring later told the bbc mr howell had been withdrawn from duty and was not currently involved in the selling process .
he added mr howell had been " confused " when he made the offer and had " forgotten " the company no longer sells anti-personnel landmines .
an earlier chemring statement said : " chemring maintains policies and procedures to ensure compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements , including proper vetting of proposed sales .
" chemring ceased manufacture and sale of this type of trip wire five years ago .
" we subsequently ceased manufacture of this type of fragmentation grenade and the final sale was made in may 1999 . "
labour mp roger berry , chairman of the commons select committee on defence exports , promised to send a dossier outlining the claims to derbyshire police and called for an immediate investigation .
his request was echoed by liberal democrat foreign affairs spokesman menzies campbell .
customs and excise say they are investigating the allegations , because it is their responsibility to oversee the export of landmines and the organisation of the international trade in landmines .
in january 2003 pw defence was cleared by the crown prosecution service and hm customs & excise , following a full investigation into claims that it had broken legislation banning the sale of anti-personnel landmines .

president castro waited four days to respond to us criticisms .
his government has been criticised by washington many times in the 43 years since he came to power and he almost seems to enjoy the bitter rivalry .
us ' lies ' reading from a carefully prepared text , he said the us had no proof that cuba was trying to produce biological weapons .
they do not have proof , he said , because it does not exist and it can not exist .
president castro added that he had been misquoted in the accusations made by the mr bolton .
the americans , he said , seem to have no alternative but to lie , lie and lie .
mr bolton - the top state department official dealing with weapons of mass destruction - said he believed that cuba was trying to develop biological weapons and was passing its technical expertise to countries hostile to the us .
carter visit his comments put cuba firmly on washington 's list of countries that make up what us president george bush had defined as an " axis of evil " .
carter : due to visit cuba in two days he noted that the cuban leader last year visited iran , libya and syria .
president castro responded by praising iran and noting that cuba does have a sophisticated biological medicine industry - exporting vaccines to more than 40 countries .
cuba has nothing to hide , he added .
the speech will increase the bitterness in the long-running conflict between washington and havana which has intensified in recent months .

in an hour-and-a-half long speech , he said the comments made by the us under secretary of state , john bolton , were full of lies and errors .
president castro waited four days to respond to us criticisms .
his government has been criticised by washington many times in the 43 years since he came to power and he almost seems to enjoy the bitter rivalry .
us ' lies ' reading from a carefully prepared text , he said the us had no proof that cuba was trying to produce biological weapons .
they do not have proof , he said , because it does not exist and it can not exist .
president castro added that he had been misquoted in the accusations made by the mr bolton .

"
it 's not going to be an easy task to have an inspection regime that can give us the kind of confidence we need to have " american deputy defence secretary , paul wolfowitz the united nations has been holding talks with iraq about resuming inspections against the background of reports that washington is considering military action to try to unseat the iraqi president , saddam hussein .
the outcome of the current dialogue between the un and iraq over new weapons inspections could be crucial to the prospects of a new confrontation between washington and baghdad .
but pentagon officials have made no secret of the fact that they are sceptical that new inspections can eliminate the security threat which president bush says iraq represents .
forging support in his state of the union address , mr bush labelled the country - along with iran and north korea - as part of an axis of evil pursuing weapons of mass destruction .
mr wolfowitz says that even at their most effective , previous un inspectors had to rely on defectors to provide crucial information on iraq 's weapons programmes .
" it 's not going to be an easy task to have an inspection regime that can give us the kind of confidence we need to have , " mr wolfowitz said .
but it is thought the state department believes that pursuing inspections could help in forging international support for a possible new showdown with iraq .
mid east conflict there is also a debate in washington over whether action against iraq is possible before the current israeli-palestinian tensions have been defused .
mr wolfowitz , who has a reputation as one of the bush administration 's more hawkish members , says the more progress that can be made on the israeli-palestinian conflict , the more support the us will be able to garner for other operations .
but he also suggests that the ability to make progress on the peace process is linked to us regional strength .
it was no accident , he says , that the breakthrough with the oslo peace process came after the us victory over iraq in 1991 .

uk customers of internet service provider telewest could find themselves cut off from the internet 's biggest information board .
last weekend more than 1m spam messages were sent to distribution network usenet , a level of abuse never seen before , according to usenet member david ritz .
this prompted the issue of what is called a usenet death penalty , which would see any telewest user banned from usenet newsgroups unless the isp takes action to get rid of the spammers .
spam is spam and none of it has a future seth goldin , direct marketer the problem is by no means limited to telewest though .
the bulk of last weekend 's junk email came via btopenworld servers .
widespread problem " i 've managed to get a few providers to take these things seriously but far too many appear to be ready to ignore these problems , " said mr rtiz .
" telewest just happened to be one of the two unlucky providers which pushed me over the edge this past week . "
the second is videotron , an isp based in canada .
telewest says it is trying to bring the problem under control .
" as far as i 'm aware a death penalty has not been issued , just a warning , " said a telewest spokesman .
" there has been a recent explosion of open relays -lsb- virtual servers which allow spam to be multiplied through the network -rsb- and we are in the process of contacting customers telling them to shut them down , " " there is a small minority that is evasive but it is an ongoing issue for all isps , " he said .
security issue spammers take advantage of open ports on proxy servers set up by isps to make connections faster for customers .
this hijacking of servers by spammers could be the tip of the iceberg , said mr ritz .
" while spam is the visible element being addressed under this usenet death penalty , the underlying issue is of even greater concern , as it deals with fundamental security issues being faced by users , providers and businesses around the world , " he said .
if e-mail has been the golden goose of the internet then spam is definitely the unfriendly giant looming over it .
in europe alone millions of spam e-mails are sent each day .
" the problem is a lot worse than consumers think .
a lot of it is filtered out before it reaches them , " said joe mcnamee from euro ispa -lrb- internet service providers ' association -rrb- .
the european parliament is currently looking at ways of limiting the activity of spammers and is due to vote on a ban at the end of this month .
no future e-mail marketing is a new and powerful way for marketers to get in touch with their customers .
many firms are increasing their digital marketing spend to include e-mail campaigns. f you say something once , it 's speech .
if you say the same thing a few hundred times every day , it becomes nothing more than noise david ritz , usenet member spam however is not acceptable , direct marketing guru seth godin told delegates at a marketing event in london organised by doubleclick .
" spam is spam and none of it has a future , " he said .
instead digital marketers must carefully build relationships with customers over time and make sure that any marketing done via e-mail has the permission of the consumer .
" in the past marketers have been neanderthals with a mentality of let 's get a gun and go and find us some strangers to sell to , " he said .
" in the future they need to be more like farmers , building their assets slowly over time . "
for mr ritz the war against spammers can not be won soon enough .
" when you begin to do the maths you 'll see the enormous cost involved both in terms of storage and the bandwidth required to transport this massive quantity of what amounts to the same thing being said over a million times , " he said .
