australia 's chief islamic cleric sheikh taj aldin al-hilali joined the rally protesters also took to the streets in canberra and adelaide and rallies are planned for other cities , including melbourne , as part of a co-ordinated weekend of events to call for diplomacy not military intervention .
australian prime minister john howard has backed the tough line on iraq taken by the united states and has pledged to send troops to back any campaign .
but the bbc 's dominic hughes in sydney says many of the protesters are concerned that the us is motivated by a desire to seize iraqi oil rather than by security concerns .
he adds that public opinion polls show australians want any action to be led by the united nations and to come only after the weapons inspectors have had a chance to do their job .
we must not confuse the need to rid ourselves of terrorism with a pre-emptive strike on iraq union leader sharan burrow australia 's supreme islamic cleric , sheikh taj aldin al-hilali , joined other religious leaders as well as politicians and showbusiness personalities on the sydney demonstration .
australian council of trade unions president sharan burrow told the crowd that the nation needed to send a message to the government that it was not acceptable for australia to be dragged into a us-led military attack .
" we must not confuse the need to rid ourselves of terrorism with a pre-emptive strike on iraq , " she said .

the recent attacks in kenya and bali highlight just how vulnerable tourists are as potential targets .
security experts have raised fears that osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network is increasingly switching its focus to ' soft targets ' such as holidaymakers .
experts say bali will need a year to recover from its bombing " nowhere in the world is really that safe , " david capitanchik , a terrorism expert at aberdeen university , told bbc news online .
" it could happen anywhere - my biggest fear is that it would happen in london 's oxford street in the christmas rush . "
but he says some places are safer than others because of how seriously the authorities take security issues .
" where there is no security , that 's where the terrorists go .
and developing countries are increasingly becoming the most desirable tourist destinations .
but , in such places , the authorities do n't pay much attention to security . "
mr capitanchik said that south-east asia and east africa were particularly bad for security - despite previous attacks on embassies in kenya and tanzania .
security clampdown but he described spain , with its decades of trouble with the basque separatist group eta , as relatively safe because the authorities take security seriously .
" egypt , too , has taken a tough line on terrorism and its tourism is starting to recover , " mr capitanchik added .
western tourists have been shunning islamic countries since the us-led war on terror began rok klancnik , world tourism organization the country 's tourism industry was devastated after 58 holidaymakers were killed by islamic extremists at luxor in 1997 .
since then it has clamped down on its islamic insurgency and tourism is picking up .
similarly , tunisia and morocco have recently launched security crackdowns .
a lorry bombing outside a synagogue in tunisia in april which killed 21 people , caused a downturn in tourism .
morocco is a trouble-free destination for most visitors .
but in may , authorities arrested suspected al-qaeda operatives who had allegedly planned to attack nato warships , as well as buses and a tourist site in marrakech .
islamic countries in general have suffered a downturn in tourism in the past year .
threat of war " western tourists have been shunning islamic countries since the us-led war on terror began , " rok klancnik of the world tourism organization told bbc news online .
" but what we are seeing is an increase in inter-regional travel in the middle east and south-east asia . "
dubai and beirut , for example , are encountering boom times in terms of arab visitors .
some commentators say some arabs have chosen holidays in the middle east over the us , because of fears of an anti-arab backlash since 11 september .
the conflict between the israelis and palestinians has had an effect on the whole middle east , as has the threat of a us-led war in iraq .
in jordan , correspondents say anti-american sentiment is rising because of the potential conflict .
in january 2000 , the first al-qaeda bomb plot against tourism in an islamic country was thwarted by police .
israel itself has suffered badly since the palestinian uprising started more than two years ago .
the country 's economy contracted as tourist revenues fell .
and the us - the third most popular tourist destination behind france and spain - has also been hard hit .
' resilient ' americans themselves have shunned overseas trips , largely because of post-11 september fears , sparking a slowdown in sales of world travel .
after the bali bombing , the state department issued a travel warning for 11 countries , including indonesia and much of south-east asia , where al-qaeda is known to have a network .
denmark , germany , britain and australia also issued a general travel warning for the area as well as for specified popular tourist places in thailand where the possibility of a terrorist attack was deemed high .
in thailand , for example , reports say tourists from south-east asia and adventurous youngsters have not been deterred , but wealthy , middle-aged tourists from elsewhere are shunning the luxury resorts .
in the philippines , which is also viewed as high risk by several western governments , a fight by the muslim minority for the independence of mindanao , has spilled over to one of the country 's top beach resorts .
according to the world tourism organization 's mr klancnik most destinations will bounce back because westerners ' perceptions of risk alter quickly .
" tourism is resilient , he says .
" egypt needed about three years to start recovering and our organisation agrees with the indonesian government that bali will take about a year and kenya will take about six months , under certain conditions . "

latest poll for euro : 43 % against euro : 43 % undecided : 14 % the governing social democrats want to join and so does the main opposition party .
the main political opposition to the euro comes from the left and green parties , two groups who usually support the social democrats in parliament .
now that the prime minister goran persson has fired the starting pistol , the two sides have the best part of a year to persuade the voters of their cases .
mr persson says he thinks the result will be a yes , but he knows the swedish public are deeply split .
" it 's far from certain , " he said after announcing the referendum .
tough call recent opinion polls have shown a declining majority for the yes camp .
one , published on thursday , showed opinion evenly divided .
the growing scepticism about the euro is probably linked to the country 's relatively good economic performance compared with some of the countries that have adopted the currency .
mr persson believes sweden will be better off with the euro .
it is a hard argument to sell just now .
the sluggish performance of the large economies in the euro area - germany , italy and to a lesser extent france - is not primarily due to the euro .
but their problems are not a good advertisement for the currency .
and in one respect , the euro is contributing to germany 's problem .
many economists believe that if there were an independent german central bank , it would be trying to revive the economy with lower interest rates .
as it is , germany is stuck with the higher rates that the european central bank thinks are right for the whole of the euro area .
the one nordic country already using the euro , finland has also seen a sharp slowdown in its economic growth this year and last .
again , it has little or nothing to with the euro , but it is not helpful for those seeking a yes vote .
and if mr persson can get the yes vote next year that he wants , he will then have to persuade the rest of the eu to let sweden in .
it is unlikely to be problem in practice , but there are some hoops sweden will have to jump through first .
isolation after the referendum was announced , the european commissioner responsible for the euro , pedro solbes , said sweden still has some way to go .
the commission has assessed sweden three times to decide whether it meets the criteria for membership that were set out in the maastricht treaty .
on each occasion sweden failed .
its government finances are strong .
it also meets the criteria on inflation and interest rates .
the most important failure is on the stability of its own currency .
the treaty says that countries must demonstrate two years of exchange rate stability .
exactly what that means in practice is rather unclear .
but the european commission interprets it as meaning that countries must be in the exchange rate mechanism - a system which keeps currencies within limited fluctuation bands against one another and which britain crashed out of humiliatingly in 1992 .
sweden is not in it - at present there are only two currencies , the euro and the danish crown .
but mr persson says he plans to take sweden in soon after the referendum , if the result is a ' yes ' .
sweden will also have to make some changes to the laws governing its central bank , the riksbank .
if sweden does vote yes , then denmark will seem much more isolated in scandinavia .
there are no plans for a second referendum soon - the danes voted no in 2000 .
but the government in copenhagen will probably feel it has more chance of a yes next time if sweden is already on course to join .

las vegas is a city consumed by gambling .
behind the glittery facade of its casinos there are dozens of ways in which this obsession in played out .
over the years technology has played a role in making the offerings ever more inventive .
yet until recently the entertainment corporations which run the vegas casinos had been reluctant to embrace the clicks-and-mortar world of internet gaming .
" many operators here are n't used to the challenges of being an online company , " said anthony cabot , a lawyer specialising in gambling legislation .
" the second major challenge is obviously legal .
unfortunately the position of the department of justice is that all gambling by us companies from the us is illegal . "
identifying players one of the largest entertainment groups in las vegas , mgm mirage , has thrown down a challenge to its rivals and the regulators .
it already owns some of the most prestigious properties in the city .
fed up of watching online gambling grow from the sidelines , the group decided to launch its own cyber-casino outside of us legal jurisdiction .
two years of careful planning gave way to celebration two months ago , when the online venture finally launched offshore just off the british mainland on the isle of man .
the site offers a variety of different games , which you can play purely for fun .
paid betting is only offered to citizens of six european countries .
to keep americans out , mgm has built a system that uses technology to monitor where players are betting from .
" we are 99.9 % confident it catches anybody who 's not of age or from places that do n't currently allow online gaming for its citizens or operators , " said bill hornbuckle of mgm mirage online .
mgm say their geographical verification software can identify where customers are coming from and prevent them from using the site .
cautious casinos despite its confidence , the fact is that mgm is taking a risk worthy of a vegas high-roller in deciding to launch an online casino .
if the bet pays off , they will grab a share of a $ 3.5bn gaming industry .
if it fails , the group risks its reputation and perhaps its long-term future .
with such high stakes , many of its vegas rivals are cautious about following suit .
" we 're watching it pretty closely , but we 're being very , very careful at this point and there 's a reason why , " said david strow of harrah 's entertainment .
" we 've spent the last 65 years building up this company .
we now have more than 24 casinos across the country , and billions of dollars invested .
" but the way it works in the us is that each of these casinos has to be licensed by a state in order to operate .
they view it as a privilege not a right .
" if we 're found in violation of federal or state laws regarding internet gaming they have the right to take our licences .
in essence we could lose our ability to operate our properties , " he said .
for these reasons harrah 's is wary of investing millions in online gambling until a whole range of technical , legal and regulatory issues are resolved .
brand recognition as far as mgm are concerned , it is aware of how much is riding on its online initiative .
" clearly everyone 's reputations are at stake , and most notably ours because we 've taken the first step , " said mr hornbuckle .
" but we believe it takes a leadership role .
we think we 've now identified that and we think it can reasonably be done . "
other casinos are now looking into the opportunities offered by the internet .
two of mgm mirage 's real world competitors have filed applications for an online licence and more could follow .
" the casino industry has a huge advantage in this marketplace because they have great brand recognition , they have databases , and they 're building a cross-market for their online product with their casino product , " explained mr cabot , " so i think a number of them will be involved . "

identifying players one of the largest entertainment groups in las vegas , mgm mirage , has thrown down a challenge to its rivals and the regulators .
it already owns some of the most prestigious properties in the city .
fed up of watching online gambling grow from the sidelines , the group decided to launch its own cyber-casino outside of us legal jurisdiction .
us has strict laws on gambling two years of careful planning gave way to celebration two months ago , when the online venture finally launched offshore just off the british mainland on the isle of man .
the site offers a variety of different games , which you can play purely for fun .
paid betting is only offered to citizens of six european countries .
to keep americans out , mgm has built a system that uses technology to monitor where players are betting from .
" we are 99.9 % confident it catches anybody who 's not of age or from places that do n't currently allow online gaming for its citizens or operators , " said bill hornbuckle of mgm mirage online .
mgm say their geographical verification software can identify where customers are coming from and prevent them from using the site .
cautious casinos despite its confidence , the fact is that mgm is taking a risk worthy of a vegas high-roller in deciding to launch an online casino .
you do not have to travel to vegas to gamble if the bet pays off , they will grab a share of a $ 3.5bn gaming industry .
if it fails , the group risks its reputation and perhaps its long-term future .
with such high stakes , many of its vegas rivals are cautious about following suit .
" we 're watching it pretty closely , but we 're being very , very careful at this point and there 's a reason why , " said david strow of harrah 's entertainment .
" we 've spent the last 65 years building up this company .
we now have more than 24 casinos across the country , and billions of dollars invested .
" but the way it works in the us is that each of these casinos has to be licensed by a state in order to operate .
they view it as a privilege not a right .
" if we 're found in violation of federal or state laws regarding internet gaming they have the right to take our licences .
in essence we could lose our ability to operate our properties , " he said .
for these reasons harrah 's is wary of investing millions in online gambling until a whole range of technical , legal and regulatory issues are resolved .
brand recognition as far as mgm are concerned , it is aware of how much is riding on its online initiative .
" clearly everyone 's reputations are at stake , and most notably ours because we 've taken the first step , " said mr hornbuckle .
" but we believe it takes a leadership role .
we think we 've now identified that and we think it can reasonably be done . "
other casinos are now looking into the opportunities offered by the internet .
two of mgm mirage 's real world competitors have filed applications for an online licence and more could follow .
" the casino industry has a huge advantage in this marketplace because they have great brand recognition , they have databases , and they 're building a cross-market for their online product with their casino product , " explained mr cabot , " so i think a number of them will be involved . "

in a nationwide tv address , she said she would close down the government agency in charge of a major motorway project mired in controversy end a contract for a new airport terminal with a spiralling budget refund people who have been overcharged for electricity .
joseph estrada was brought down by corruption she also said accusations that her justice minister had received a $ 2m bribe should be taken to the courts .
the bbc 's john mclean in manila says mrs arroyo 's aim seems to be to avoid the fate of previous presidents , whose administrations collapsed under the weight of corruption allegations .
former president joseph estrada is now in jail , while corruption charges against him are heard .
construction scandals mrs arroyo said that officials from the public estates authority would be held accountable for projects which have become tainted with corruption .
the agency was in charge of a motorway project , which has been involved in an overpricing scandal .
i will make sure that you the consumers will get your refund gloria arroyo now it will be closed down and its assets shared around other departments .
mrs arroyo also announced she would annul the contract for a new airport terminal for the capital , saying a " significant chunk " of the millions of dollars spent had not gone into construction costs .
and she promised consumers who had been faced with inflated electricity bills they would get their money back .
the supreme court has ordered the manila electric company to reimburse an estimated 28bn pesos -lrb- $ 528m -rrb- in overbillings .
" i tell our people again , if the supreme court orders with finality that the refund will be implemented , i will make sure that you the consumers will get your refund , " she said .
re-election bid mrs arroyo took a tough stance on allegations that her justice minister , hernando perez , received a $ 2m payment in return for a favourable court decision .
she said that the accusations should be taken to the courts , adding : " if the charges are true , everyone is going to jail " .
she said for decades the philippine state had been weak because " dominant classes " had shaped economic policy .
our correspondent says that there 's no threat yet that mrs arroyo will face the popular uprisings which overthrew mr estrada , and another former president ferdinand marcos .
but , he says , she clearly feels she must clean up her administration if she 's to stand a chance of being re-elected in less than two years ' time .

the united states is threatening war against one of the " axis of evil " because of its weapons of mass destruction .
for another of the " axis " countries , washington is still agonising over whether to stop multi-million dollar aid payments .
the two countries , of course , are iraq and north korea .
the difference between them ?
north korea is much further advanced in its programme to produce nuclear weapons .
the accusations of a double standard refuse to go away .
oil shipments in october north korea reportedly admitted what us intelligence had suspected for some time .
the bush administration has been accused of double standards it has pressed ahead with a programme to produce nuclear weapons , despite a 1994 agreement renouncing the programme .
as part of that deal , negotiated by the clinton administration , north korea received massive help with its energy needs from the us , japan , south korea and the european union .
that aid included oil shipments from the us , and assistance in building new nuclear reactors of a type which the north could not use to divert material for military purposes .
if america imposes economic sanctions , north korea could regard that as an act of war commentator kim myong chol yet the us has been slow to punish what appears a flagrant breach of north korea 's obligations .
an oil shipment on its way to the north is still being delivered .
finally , a couple of weeks ago , washington decided to suspend future deliveries .
but work is still continuing on the nuclear reactor the americans are helping to build in north korea .
playing safe it is a situation that must provoke deep frustration amongst all those in the bush administration who like to see the world in black and white .
yet the government of kim jong-il has mastered the technique of making the most of what might appear an indefensible position .
seoul is within easy range of thousands of north korean missiles every time it is found out , it just threatens more action .
when the americans considered ending the oil shipments , north korea reportedly threatened to pull out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
now the fear is that pyongyang will expel international inspectors stationed at a reactor in yongbyon , who help prevent the country producing more weapons-grade nuclear material .
" and if america imposes economic sanctions - depending on the nature of the sanctions - north korea could regard that as an act of war , " said kim myong chol , a commentator close to the north korean government .
war ' unthinkable ' all but the most extreme hardliners in washington know that war is unthinkable .
the south korean capital , seoul - one of the largest cities in the world - is within easy range of thousands of north korean missiles .
tens of thousands of us troops in south korea are vulnerable .
and that is without even factoring in whatever weapons of mass destruction the north may already possess .
no wonder the us has received only half-hearted support for its policy of trying to isolate north korea further .
it is much easier to talk tough from washington , than it is from within missile range of this strange stalinist country .
but even in the us itself , there appears little appetite for another confrontation , while saddam hussein is still so clearly in the sights .
