a long stretch of poland ’ s 700-mile border with kaliningrad , lithuania , belarus and ukraine is rough forest , which is where the main worry about cross-border crime lies . germany has been vigorously helping the poles , as well as other candidates in eastern europe , to tighten up their own eastern frontiers .

large consignments of drugs still find their way across the frontier . moreover , cross-border crime has expanded to include human trafficking .

the eu will indeed need lots of help from them since translators and interpreters are the lifeblood of the european union . a day in the life of the eu requires the services of 700 - 800 interpreters to work in and out of the 11 official languages .
from january 1 , 2004 , when cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia join the eu , multilingual europeans will have to accommodate the union 's 21 languages every day .
each new member state will need a contingent of 120 – 130 trained interpreters to fulfill its needs . real need the eu ’ s policy of multilingualism means that each language is on equal footing . " one day you may have a meeting in french , german , hungarian , estonian and polish , " ian andersen , a spokesman for the eu 's joint interpreting and conference service -lrb- jics -rrb- , told dw-world .
jics provides language skills to all eu institutions except the court of justice and the parliament , which have their own interpreters . in practice though , the eu functions on the " principle of real need rather than political need , " andersen explained . to keep costs down the choice of languages is adjusted to the importance of the content and the intended audience .
a real need does n't arise with eu officials , for example , as they must speak at least one of the eu 's three main languages , -lrb- english , french and german -rrb- .
thus , some eu meetings and documents are just translated or interpreted into the three .
when elected officials , such as members of the european parliament , take part in meetings though , language professionals may need to help out . multilingualism = 2 euros per year " two euros per year is the cost of multilingualism , " says andersen .
those two euros per citizen per year make up the eu 's yearly budget of 700 million euro for translation and interpretation . andersen says the addition of the ten new official languages will bring costs up by around 10 cents per citizen .
each new language will cost the same amount in real terms .
relatively though , poland 's language needs - with 38.6 million polish speakers - will be cheaper than estonia 's -lrb- 1.4 million speakers -rrb- . the number of languages interpreted at any one meeting , however , will stay constant .
for jics only meetings in which all 21 languages are interpreted will end up costing more . early star t since 1990 , jics has been actively involved in training interpreters in potential candidate countries , including bulgaria , romania and albania .
the multilingualism department has been training trainers , offering teaching assistance , producing teaching materials , providing bursaries to students and subsidies to teaching establishments over the past three years .
jics also participates in final exams and conducts yearly tests for interpreters in the candidate countries . estonia , latvia and lithuania pose a special problem because they do n't have a long-standing tradition of interpreters training .
the service has a special office in copenhagen to deal with the baltics .
andersen , however , is confident that there will be enough baltic language interpreters for the first meetings after enlargement . so far , andersen says , jics has 340 freelancers from the candidate countries on the books .
the highest number works with polish -lrb- 60 -rrb- , the lowest with romanian -lrb- 15 -rrb- , besides 20-30 more for each of the other languages soon to join the eu 's tower of babel . the space issue space is also a problem .
currently one-to-one translation of all official languages requires 33 interpreters and 11 aquariums , as practitioners call the glass booths where they do their work . by january 1 , 2004 only four eu meeting rooms will be equipped with the necessary 21 aquariums needed .
the jics will only be able to provide full coverage for four meetings a day .
" it 'll be enough for the beginning , " says andersen .
supply and demand while the eu 's three main languages require 70 – 80 interpreters on a daily basis , only 40 will be needed per new language per day as they wo n't be used for central communications . still , both the interpreting and translating services have had to lower their requirements to be sure to have enough extra hands in time for enlargement . although german interpreters , for example are required to be able to work with three languages on top of their mother tongue , applicants from the new candidate countries must merely be able to interpret between their native language and one other language . not all sorted translating is an entirely different issue and a field that - as opposed to interpretation - is decentralized in the eu : each institution has its own translators .
just to serve the eu 's institutions , each country needs a contingent of at least 80 translators . according to claude mazet , of the translation center for the bodies of the eu , it is not yet clear how enlargement will effect the center .
mazet points out that it depends largely on the needs of the agencies and institutions . for instance , the agency for the evaluation of medical products and the office for harmonization in the internal markets – trademarks and design in realspeak - will need practically every document translated into all official languages .
the offices responsible for training and social affairs , on the other hand , will require less translation , mazet reckons . going back to the baltic issue , mazet attests that there is enough interest there .
however , while 51 poles have passed the eu exams for translators , hardly a dozen have managed in the baltic states . still , the locally administered tests are n't the only source for translators .
the eu advertises in the mass media in the candidate countries and also accepts blind applications .
thus , the center has been able to compile reference lists of freelancer translators over the past two years . there 's no guarantee that preparations will meet the eu 's needs .
" we 'll see if it works , " andersen concedes . so for all you polyglots soon to possess a magenta union passport : the starting wage for an eu interpreter is 3000 euro per month .

it is the price to pay to join schengen , the security system that has scrapped internal border controls among most eu countries . by eliminating internal border posts , the eu ’ s members have pushed their frontiers to the outer rim of the union .
that makes security at the eastern borders particularly difficult .
a long stretch of poland ’ s 700-mile border with kaliningrad , lithuania , belarus and ukraine is rough forest , which is where the main worry about cross-border crime lies . germany has been vigorously helping the poles , as well as other candidates in eastern europe , to tighten up their own eastern frontiers .
yet , no sooner is one eu external border semi-sealed than smugglers shift their routes . security at estonia ’ s outside borders , for example , remains a problem , although finland trained estonia ’ s border guards and equipped them with modern radar systems .
large consignments of drugs still find their way across the frontier . moreover , cross-border crime has expanded to include human trafficking .
behind the lines , hundreds of thousands of would-be illegal immigrants are waiting for their chance to cross the border to the prosperous west making the need for action all the more urgent . strict security measures at the frontiers are a prerequisite for admission to europe ’ s top club .
poland is to beef up control of its borders under a recent agreement .

raimo bergt -rrb- european enlargement means that the union will need to translate back and forth between 21 languages soon .
but will it be up to the challenge ? last month when the european commission decided that accession talks would be completed with ten eu candidate countries , polyglots from north and south must have been rubbing their palms in anticipation of new job opportunities .
the eu will indeed need lots of help from them since translators and interpreters are the lifeblood of the european union . a day in the life of the eu requires the services of 700 - 800 interpreters to work in and out of the 11 official languages .
from january 1 , 2004 , when cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia join the eu , multilingual europeans will have to accommodate the union 's 21 languages every day .
each new member state will need a contingent of 120 – 130 trained interpreters to fulfill its needs . real need the eu ’ s policy of multilingualism means that each language is on equal footing . " one day you may have a meeting in french , german , hungarian , estonian and polish , " ian andersen , a spokesman for the eu 's joint interpreting and conference service -lrb- jics -rrb- , told dw-world .
jics provides language skills to all eu institutions except the court of justice and the parliament , which have their own interpreters . in practice though , the eu functions on the " principle of real need rather than political need , " andersen explained . to keep costs down the choice of languages is adjusted to the importance of the content and the intended audience .
a real need does n't arise with eu officials , for example , as they must speak at least one of the eu 's three main languages , -lrb- english , french and german -rrb- .
thus , some eu meetings and documents are just translated or interpreted into the three .
when elected officials , such as members of the european parliament , take part in meetings though , language professionals may need to help out . multilingualism = 2 euros per year " two euros per year is the cost of multilingualism , " says andersen .
those two euros per citizen per year make up the eu 's yearly budget of 700 million euro for translation and interpretation . andersen says the addition of the ten new official languages will bring costs up by around 10 cents per citizen .
each new language will cost the same amount in real terms .
relatively though , poland 's language needs - with 38.6 million polish speakers - will be cheaper than estonia 's -lrb- 1.4 million speakers -rrb- . the number of languages interpreted at any one meeting , however , will stay constant .
for jics only meetings in which all 21 languages are interpreted will end up costing more . early star t since 1990 , jics has been actively involved in training interpreters in potential candidate countries , including bulgaria , romania and albania .
the multilingualism department has been training trainers , offering teaching assistance , producing teaching materials , providing bursaries to students and subsidies to teaching establishments over the past three years .
jics also participates in final exams and conducts yearly tests for interpreters in the candidate countries . estonia , latvia and lithuania pose a special problem because they do n't have a long-standing tradition of interpreters training .
the service has a special office in copenhagen to deal with the baltics .
andersen , however , is confident that there will be enough baltic language interpreters for the first meetings after enlargement . so far , andersen says , jics has 340 freelancers from the candidate countries on the books .
the highest number works with polish -lrb- 60 -rrb- , the lowest with romanian -lrb- 15 -rrb- , besides 20-30 more for each of the other languages soon to join the eu 's tower of babel . the space issue space is also a problem .
currently one-to-one translation of all official languages requires 33 interpreters and 11 aquariums , as practitioners call the glass booths where they do their work . by january 1 , 2004 only four eu meeting rooms will be equipped with the necessary 21 aquariums needed .
the jics will only be able to provide full coverage for four meetings a day .
" it 'll be enough for the beginning , " says andersen .
supply and demand while the eu 's three main languages require 70 – 80 interpreters on a daily basis , only 40 will be needed per new language per day as they wo n't be used for central communications . still , both the interpreting and translating services have had to lower their requirements to be sure to have enough extra hands in time for enlargement . although german interpreters , for example are required to be able to work with three languages on top of their mother tongue , applicants from the new candidate countries must merely be able to interpret between their native language and one other language . not all sorted translating is an entirely different issue and a field that - as opposed to interpretation - is decentralized in the eu : each institution has its own translators .
just to serve the eu 's institutions , each country needs a contingent of at least 80 translators . according to claude mazet , of the translation center for the bodies of the eu , it is not yet clear how enlargement will effect the center .
mazet points out that it depends largely on the needs of the agencies and institutions . for instance , the agency for the evaluation of medical products and the office for harmonization in the internal markets – trademarks and design in realspeak - will need practically every document translated into all official languages .
the offices responsible for training and social affairs , on the other hand , will require less translation , mazet reckons . going back to the baltic issue , mazet attests that there is enough interest there .
however , while 51 poles have passed the eu exams for translators , hardly a dozen have managed in the baltic states . still , the locally administered tests are n't the only source for translators .
the eu advertises in the mass media in the candidate countries and also accepts blind applications .
thus , the center has been able to compile reference lists of freelancer translators over the past two years . there 's no guarantee that preparations will meet the eu 's needs .
" we 'll see if it works , " andersen concedes . so for all you polyglots soon to possess a magenta union passport : the starting wage for an eu interpreter is 3000 euro per month .

raimo bergt -rrb- european enlargement means that the union will need to translate back and forth between 21 languages soon .
but will it be up to the challenge ? last month when the european commission decided that accession talks would be completed with ten eu candidate countries , polyglots from north and south must have been rubbing their palms in anticipation of new job opportunities .
the eu will indeed need lots of help from them since translators and interpreters are the lifeblood of the european union . a day in the life of the eu requires the services of 700 - 800 interpreters to work in and out of the 11 official languages .
from january 1 , 2004 , when cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia join the eu , multilingual europeans will have to accommodate the union 's 21 languages every day .
each new member state will need a contingent of 120 – 130 trained interpreters to fulfill its needs . real need the eu ’ s policy of multilingualism means that each language is on equal footing . " one day you may have a meeting in french , german , hungarian , estonian and polish , " ian andersen , a spokesman for the eu 's joint interpreting and conference service -lrb- jics -rrb- , told dw-world .
jics provides language skills to all eu institutions except the court of justice and the parliament , which have their own interpreters . in practice though , the eu functions on the " principle of real need rather than political need , " andersen explained . to keep costs down the choice of languages is adjusted to the importance of the content and the intended audience .
a real need does n't arise with eu officials , for example , as they must speak at least one of the eu 's three main languages , -lrb- english , french and german -rrb- .
thus , some eu meetings and documents are just translated or interpreted into the three .
when elected officials , such as members of the european parliament , take part in meetings though , language professionals may need to help out . multilingualism = 2 euros per year " two euros per year is the cost of multilingualism , " says andersen .
those two euros per citizen per year make up the eu 's yearly budget of 700 million euro for translation and interpretation . andersen says the addition of the ten new official languages will bring costs up by around 10 cents per citizen .
each new language will cost the same amount in real terms .
relatively though , poland 's language needs - with 38.6 million polish speakers - will be cheaper than estonia 's -lrb- 1.4 million speakers -rrb- . the number of languages interpreted at any one meeting , however , will stay constant .
for jics only meetings in which all 21 languages are interpreted will end up costing more . early star t since 1990 , jics has been actively involved in training interpreters in potential candidate countries , including bulgaria , romania and albania .
the multilingualism department has been training trainers , offering teaching assistance , producing teaching materials , providing bursaries to students and subsidies to teaching establishments over the past three years .
jics also participates in final exams and conducts yearly tests for interpreters in the candidate countries . estonia , latvia and lithuania pose a special problem because they do n't have a long-standing tradition of interpreters training .
the service has a special office in copenhagen to deal with the baltics .
andersen , however , is confident that there will be enough baltic language interpreters for the first meetings after enlargement . so far , andersen says , jics has 340 freelancers from the candidate countries on the books .
the highest number works with polish -lrb- 60 -rrb- , the lowest with romanian -lrb- 15 -rrb- , besides 20-30 more for each of the other languages soon to join the eu 's tower of babel . the space issue space is also a problem .
currently one-to-one translation of all official languages requires 33 interpreters and 11 aquariums , as practitioners call the glass booths where they do their work . by january 1 , 2004 only four eu meeting rooms will be equipped with the necessary 21 aquariums needed .
the jics will only be able to provide full coverage for four meetings a day .
" it 'll be enough for the beginning , " says andersen .
supply and demand while the eu 's three main languages require 70 – 80 interpreters on a daily basis , only 40 will be needed per new language per day as they wo n't be used for central communications . still , both the interpreting and translating services have had to lower their requirements to be sure to have enough extra hands in time for enlargement . although german interpreters , for example are required to be able to work with three languages on top of their mother tongue , applicants from the new candidate countries must merely be able to interpret between their native language and one other language . not all sorted translating is an entirely different issue and a field that - as opposed to interpretation - is decentralized in the eu : each institution has its own translators .
just to serve the eu 's institutions , each country needs a contingent of at least 80 translators . according to claude mazet , of the translation center for the bodies of the eu , it is not yet clear how enlargement will effect the center .
mazet points out that it depends largely on the needs of the agencies and institutions . for instance , the agency for the evaluation of medical products and the office for harmonization in the internal markets – trademarks and design in realspeak - will need practically every document translated into all official languages .
the offices responsible for training and social affairs , on the other hand , will require less translation , mazet reckons . going back to the baltic issue , mazet attests that there is enough interest there .
however , while 51 poles have passed the eu exams for translators , hardly a dozen have managed in the baltic states . still , the locally administered tests are n't the only source for translators .
the eu advertises in the mass media in the candidate countries and also accepts blind applications .

raimo bergt -rrb- european enlargement means that the union will need to translate back and forth between 21 languages soon .
but will it be up to the challenge ? last month when the european commission decided that accession talks would be completed with ten eu candidate countries , polyglots from north and south must have been rubbing their palms in anticipation of new job opportunities .
the eu will indeed need lots of help from them since translators and interpreters are the lifeblood of the european union . a day in the life of the eu requires the services of 700 - 800 interpreters to work in and out of the 11 official languages .
from january 1 , 2004 , when cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia join the eu , multilingual europeans will have to accommodate the union 's 21 languages every day .
each new member state will need a contingent of 120 – 130 trained interpreters to fulfill its needs . real need the eu ’ s policy of multilingualism means that each language is on equal footing . " one day you may have a meeting in french , german , hungarian , estonian and polish , " ian andersen , a spokesman for the eu 's joint interpreting and conference service -lrb- jics -rrb- , told dw-world .
jics provides language skills to all eu institutions except the court of justice and the parliament , which have their own interpreters . in practice though , the eu functions on the " principle of real need rather than political need , " andersen explained . to keep costs down the choice of languages is adjusted to the importance of the content and the intended audience .
a real need does n't arise with eu officials , for example , as they must speak at least one of the eu 's three main languages , -lrb- english , french and german -rrb- .
thus , some eu meetings and documents are just translated or interpreted into the three .
when elected officials , such as members of the european parliament , take part in meetings though , language professionals may need to help out . multilingualism = 2 euros per year " two euros per year is the cost of multilingualism , " says andersen .
those two euros per citizen per year make up the eu 's yearly budget of 700 million euro for translation and interpretation . andersen says the addition of the ten new official languages will bring costs up by around 10 cents per citizen .
each new language will cost the same amount in real terms .
relatively though , poland 's language needs - with 38.6 million polish speakers - will be cheaper than estonia 's -lrb- 1.4 million speakers -rrb- . the number of languages interpreted at any one meeting , however , will stay constant .
for jics only meetings in which all 21 languages are interpreted will end up costing more . early star t since 1990 , jics has been actively involved in training interpreters in potential candidate countries , including bulgaria , romania and albania .
the multilingualism department has been training trainers , offering teaching assistance , producing teaching materials , providing bursaries to students and subsidies to teaching establishments over the past three years .
jics also participates in final exams and conducts yearly tests for interpreters in the candidate countries . estonia , latvia and lithuania pose a special problem because they do n't have a long-standing tradition of interpreters training .
the service has a special office in copenhagen to deal with the baltics .
andersen , however , is confident that there will be enough baltic language interpreters for the first meetings after enlargement . so far , andersen says , jics has 340 freelancers from the candidate countries on the books .
the highest number works with polish -lrb- 60 -rrb- , the lowest with romanian -lrb- 15 -rrb- , besides 20-30 more for each of the other languages soon to join the eu 's tower of babel . the space issue space is also a problem .
currently one-to-one translation of all official languages requires 33 interpreters and 11 aquariums , as practitioners call the glass booths where they do their work . by january 1 , 2004 only four eu meeting rooms will be equipped with the necessary 21 aquariums needed .
the jics will only be able to provide full coverage for four meetings a day .
" it 'll be enough for the beginning , " says andersen .
supply and demand while the eu 's three main languages require 70 – 80 interpreters on a daily basis , only 40 will be needed per new language per day as they wo n't be used for central communications . still , both the interpreting and translating services have had to lower their requirements to be sure to have enough extra hands in time for enlargement . although german interpreters , for example are required to be able to work with three languages on top of their mother tongue , applicants from the new candidate countries must merely be able to interpret between their native language and one other language . not all sorted translating is an entirely different issue and a field that - as opposed to interpretation - is decentralized in the eu : each institution has its own translators .
just to serve the eu 's institutions , each country needs a contingent of at least 80 translators . according to claude mazet , of the translation center for the bodies of the eu , it is not yet clear how enlargement will effect the center .
mazet points out that it depends largely on the needs of the agencies and institutions . for instance , the agency for the evaluation of medical products and the office for harmonization in the internal markets – trademarks and design in realspeak - will need practically every document translated into all official languages .

but with 15 already very different nations expanding to 25 , that dream may still be a ways off . in the treaty of helsinki 1999 , the european union agreed to set up a rapid reaction force – a sort of european army – composed of 60,000 troops that could deploy within 60 days to sort out problems within the union ’ s own backyard .
the union had twice failed , in bosnia in the early 1990s and in yugoslavia in 1999 , to take effective action to stop violence in the balkan region .
nato did it for them . but in the post-9/11 world , some european countries – at the urging of the united states – are realizing developing an effective fighting force with modern equipment is the best way for the union to establish itself as a credible mediator on the world stage .
such a force is already taking shape , and is due to take over policing duties in bosnia from nato troops some time in 2003 . the new countries bring little in terms of military backing .
only poland and the czech republic break the billion dollar mark on defense spending .
the combined defense spending of the ten eu candidates is 5.8 billion .
sweden alone spends more per year than that .
the uk almost six times that amount . the new countries will nevertheless have their head of state sitting on the european council , which decides on common eu foreign policy initiatives .

raimo bergt -rrb- european enlargement means that the union will need to translate back and forth between 21 languages soon .
but will it be up to the challenge ? last month when the european commission decided that accession talks would be completed with ten eu candidate countries , polyglots from north and south must have been rubbing their palms in anticipation of new job opportunities .
the eu will indeed need lots of help from them since translators and interpreters are the lifeblood of the european union . a day in the life of the eu requires the services of 700 - 800 interpreters to work in and out of the 11 official languages .
from january 1 , 2004 , when cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia join the eu , multilingual europeans will have to accommodate the union 's 21 languages every day .
each new member state will need a contingent of 120 – 130 trained interpreters to fulfill its needs . real need the eu ’ s policy of multilingualism means that each language is on equal footing . " one day you may have a meeting in french , german , hungarian , estonian and polish , " ian andersen , a spokesman for the eu 's joint interpreting and conference service -lrb- jics -rrb- , told dw-world .
jics provides language skills to all eu institutions except the court of justice and the parliament , which have their own interpreters . in practice though , the eu functions on the " principle of real need rather than political need , " andersen explained . to keep costs down the choice of languages is adjusted to the importance of the content and the intended audience .
a real need does n't arise with eu officials , for example , as they must speak at least one of the eu 's three main languages , -lrb- english , french and german -rrb- .
thus , some eu meetings and documents are just translated or interpreted into the three .
when elected officials , such as members of the european parliament , take part in meetings though , language professionals may need to help out . multilingualism = 2 euros per year " two euros per year is the cost of multilingualism , " says andersen .
those two euros per citizen per year make up the eu 's yearly budget of 700 million euro for translation and interpretation . andersen says the addition of the ten new official languages will bring costs up by around 10 cents per citizen .
each new language will cost the same amount in real terms .
relatively though , poland 's language needs - with 38.6 million polish speakers - will be cheaper than estonia 's -lrb- 1.4 million speakers -rrb- . the number of languages interpreted at any one meeting , however , will stay constant .
for jics only meetings in which all 21 languages are interpreted will end up costing more . early star t since 1990 , jics has been actively involved in training interpreters in potential candidate countries , including bulgaria , romania and albania .
the multilingualism department has been training trainers , offering teaching assistance , producing teaching materials , providing bursaries to students and subsidies to teaching establishments over the past three years .
jics also participates in final exams and conducts yearly tests for interpreters in the candidate countries . estonia , latvia and lithuania pose a special problem because they do n't have a long-standing tradition of interpreters training .
the service has a special office in copenhagen to deal with the baltics .
andersen , however , is confident that there will be enough baltic language interpreters for the first meetings after enlargement . so far , andersen says , jics has 340 freelancers from the candidate countries on the books .
the highest number works with polish -lrb- 60 -rrb- , the lowest with romanian -lrb- 15 -rrb- , besides 20-30 more for each of the other languages soon to join the eu 's tower of babel . the space issue space is also a problem .
currently one-to-one translation of all official languages requires 33 interpreters and 11 aquariums , as practitioners call the glass booths where they do their work . by january 1 , 2004 only four eu meeting rooms will be equipped with the necessary 21 aquariums needed .
the jics will only be able to provide full coverage for four meetings a day .
" it 'll be enough for the beginning , " says andersen .
supply and demand while the eu 's three main languages require 70 – 80 interpreters on a daily basis , only 40 will be needed per new language per day as they wo n't be used for central communications . still , both the interpreting and translating services have had to lower their requirements to be sure to have enough extra hands in time for enlargement . although german interpreters , for example are required to be able to work with three languages on top of their mother tongue , applicants from the new candidate countries must merely be able to interpret between their native language and one other language . not all sorted translating is an entirely different issue and a field that - as opposed to interpretation - is decentralized in the eu : each institution has its own translators .
just to serve the eu 's institutions , each country needs a contingent of at least 80 translators . according to claude mazet , of the translation center for the bodies of the eu , it is not yet clear how enlargement will effect the center .
mazet points out that it depends largely on the needs of the agencies and institutions . for instance , the agency for the evaluation of medical products and the office for harmonization in the internal markets – trademarks and design in realspeak - will need practically every document translated into all official languages .
the offices responsible for training and social affairs , on the other hand , will require less translation , mazet reckons . going back to the baltic issue , mazet attests that there is enough interest there .
however , while 51 poles have passed the eu exams for translators , hardly a dozen have managed in the baltic states . still , the locally administered tests are n't the only source for translators .
the eu advertises in the mass media in the candidate countries and also accepts blind applications .
thus , the center has been able to compile reference lists of freelancer translators over the past two years . there 's no guarantee that preparations will meet the eu 's needs .
" we 'll see if it works , " andersen concedes . so for all you polyglots soon to possess a magenta union passport : the starting wage for an eu interpreter is 3000 euro per month .

when elected officials , such as members of the european parliament , take part in meetings though , language professionals may need to help out . multilingualism = 2 euros per year " two euros per year is the cost of multilingualism , " says andersen .
those two euros per citizen per year make up the eu 's yearly budget of 700 million euro for translation and interpretation . andersen says the addition of the ten new official languages will bring costs up by around 10 cents per citizen .
each new language will cost the same amount in real terms .
relatively though , poland 's language needs - with 38.6 million polish speakers - will be cheaper than estonia 's -lrb- 1.4 million speakers -rrb- . the number of languages interpreted at any one meeting , however , will stay constant .
for jics only meetings in which all 21 languages are interpreted will end up costing more . early star t since 1990 , jics has been actively involved in training interpreters in potential candidate countries , including bulgaria , romania and albania .
the multilingualism department has been training trainers , offering teaching assistance , producing teaching materials , providing bursaries to students and subsidies to teaching establishments over the past three years .
jics also participates in final exams and conducts yearly tests for interpreters in the candidate countries . estonia , latvia and lithuania pose a special problem because they do n't have a long-standing tradition of interpreters training .
the service has a special office in copenhagen to deal with the baltics .
andersen , however , is confident that there will be enough baltic language interpreters for the first meetings after enlargement . so far , andersen says , jics has 340 freelancers from the candidate countries on the books .
the highest number works with polish -lrb- 60 -rrb- , the lowest with romanian -lrb- 15 -rrb- , besides 20-30 more for each of the other languages soon to join the eu 's tower of babel . the space issue space is also a problem .
currently one-to-one translation of all official languages requires 33 interpreters and 11 aquariums , as practitioners call the glass booths where they do their work . by january 1 , 2004 only four eu meeting rooms will be equipped with the necessary 21 aquariums needed .
the jics will only be able to provide full coverage for four meetings a day .
" it 'll be enough for the beginning , " says andersen .
supply and demand while the eu 's three main languages require 70 – 80 interpreters on a daily basis , only 40 will be needed per new language per day as they wo n't be used for central communications . still , both the interpreting and translating services have had to lower their requirements to be sure to have enough extra hands in time for enlargement . although german interpreters , for example are required to be able to work with three languages on top of their mother tongue , applicants from the new candidate countries must merely be able to interpret between their native language and one other language . not all sorted translating is an entirely different issue and a field that - as opposed to interpretation - is decentralized in the eu : each institution has its own translators .
just to serve the eu 's institutions , each country needs a contingent of at least 80 translators . according to claude mazet , of the translation center for the bodies of the eu , it is not yet clear how enlargement will effect the center .
mazet points out that it depends largely on the needs of the agencies and institutions . for instance , the agency for the evaluation of medical products and the office for harmonization in the internal markets – trademarks and design in realspeak - will need practically every document translated into all official languages .
the offices responsible for training and social affairs , on the other hand , will require less translation , mazet reckons . going back to the baltic issue , mazet attests that there is enough interest there .
however , while 51 poles have passed the eu exams for translators , hardly a dozen have managed in the baltic states . still , the locally administered tests are n't the only source for translators .
the eu advertises in the mass media in the candidate countries and also accepts blind applications .
thus , the center has been able to compile reference lists of freelancer translators over the past two years . there 's no guarantee that preparations will meet the eu 's needs .
" we 'll see if it works , " andersen concedes . so for all you polyglots soon to possess a magenta union passport : the starting wage for an eu interpreter is 3000 euro per month .

raimo bergt -rrb- european enlargement means that the union will need to translate back and forth between 21 languages soon .
but will it be up to the challenge ? last month when the european commission decided that accession talks would be completed with ten eu candidate countries , polyglots from north and south must have been rubbing their palms in anticipation of new job opportunities .
the eu will indeed need lots of help from them since translators and interpreters are the lifeblood of the european union . a day in the life of the eu requires the services of 700 - 800 interpreters to work in and out of the 11 official languages .
from january 1 , 2004 , when cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia join the eu , multilingual europeans will have to accommodate the union 's 21 languages every day .
each new member state will need a contingent of 120 – 130 trained interpreters to fulfill its needs . real need the eu ’ s policy of multilingualism means that each language is on equal footing . " one day you may have a meeting in french , german , hungarian , estonian and polish , " ian andersen , a spokesman for the eu 's joint interpreting and conference service -lrb- jics -rrb- , told dw-world .
jics provides language skills to all eu institutions except the court of justice and the parliament , which have their own interpreters . in practice though , the eu functions on the " principle of real need rather than political need , " andersen explained . to keep costs down the choice of languages is adjusted to the importance of the content and the intended audience .
a real need does n't arise with eu officials , for example , as they must speak at least one of the eu 's three main languages , -lrb- english , french and german -rrb- .
thus , some eu meetings and documents are just translated or interpreted into the three .

it is the price to pay to join schengen , the security system that has scrapped internal border controls among most eu countries . by eliminating internal border posts , the eu ’ s members have pushed their frontiers to the outer rim of the union .
that makes security at the eastern borders particularly difficult .
a long stretch of poland ’ s 700-mile border with kaliningrad , lithuania , belarus and ukraine is rough forest , which is where the main worry about cross-border crime lies . germany has been vigorously helping the poles , as well as other candidates in eastern europe , to tighten up their own eastern frontiers .
yet , no sooner is one eu external border semi-sealed than smugglers shift their routes . security at estonia ’ s outside borders , for example , remains a problem , although finland trained estonia ’ s border guards and equipped them with modern radar systems .
large consignments of drugs still find their way across the frontier . moreover , cross-border crime has expanded to include human trafficking .
behind the lines , hundreds of thousands of would-be illegal immigrants are waiting for their chance to cross the border to the prosperous west making the need for action all the more urgent . strict security measures at the frontiers are a prerequisite for admission to europe ’ s top club .
poland is to beef up control of its borders under a recent agreement .
but several other candidates still have work to do to prevent them becoming a gateway for illegal immigration , drugs and arms trafficking . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working out the sticky issues back to the sticky issues dossier ten new countries to join european union back to dw-world 's main dossier 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : expansion in focus image is everything for the eu chirac ruffles eu feathers with tirade paying -lrb- a lot -rrb- for eu membership eu finds common ground on iraq current affairs -pipe- 12.12.2002 adding ten more storeys to the eu ’ s tower of babel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : between 700 and 800 interpreters are already employed by the eu -lrb- illus .
raimo bergt -rrb- european enlargement means that the union will need to translate back and forth between 21 languages soon .
but will it be up to the challenge ? last month when the european commission decided that accession talks would be completed with ten eu candidate countries , polyglots from north and south must have been rubbing their palms in anticipation of new job opportunities .
the eu will indeed need lots of help from them since translators and interpreters are the lifeblood of the european union . a day in the life of the eu requires the services of 700 - 800 interpreters to work in and out of the 11 official languages .
from january 1 , 2004 , when cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia join the eu , multilingual europeans will have to accommodate the union 's 21 languages every day .
each new member state will need a contingent of 120 – 130 trained interpreters to fulfill its needs . real need the eu ’ s policy of multilingualism means that each language is on equal footing . " one day you may have a meeting in french , german , hungarian , estonian and polish , " ian andersen , a spokesman for the eu 's joint interpreting and conference service -lrb- jics -rrb- , told dw-world .
jics provides language skills to all eu institutions except the court of justice and the parliament , which have their own interpreters . in practice though , the eu functions on the " principle of real need rather than political need , " andersen explained . to keep costs down the choice of languages is adjusted to the importance of the content and the intended audience .
a real need does n't arise with eu officials , for example , as they must speak at least one of the eu 's three main languages , -lrb- english , french and german -rrb- .
thus , some eu meetings and documents are just translated or interpreted into the three .
when elected officials , such as members of the european parliament , take part in meetings though , language professionals may need to help out . multilingualism = 2 euros per year " two euros per year is the cost of multilingualism , " says andersen .
those two euros per citizen per year make up the eu 's yearly budget of 700 million euro for translation and interpretation . andersen says the addition of the ten new official languages will bring costs up by around 10 cents per citizen .
each new language will cost the same amount in real terms .
relatively though , poland 's language needs - with 38.6 million polish speakers - will be cheaper than estonia 's -lrb- 1.4 million speakers -rrb- . the number of languages interpreted at any one meeting , however , will stay constant .
for jics only meetings in which all 21 languages are interpreted will end up costing more . early star t since 1990 , jics has been actively involved in training interpreters in potential candidate countries , including bulgaria , romania and albania .
the multilingualism department has been training trainers , offering teaching assistance , producing teaching materials , providing bursaries to students and subsidies to teaching establishments over the past three years .
jics also participates in final exams and conducts yearly tests for interpreters in the candidate countries . estonia , latvia and lithuania pose a special problem because they do n't have a long-standing tradition of interpreters training .
the service has a special office in copenhagen to deal with the baltics .
andersen , however , is confident that there will be enough baltic language interpreters for the first meetings after enlargement . so far , andersen says , jics has 340 freelancers from the candidate countries on the books .
the highest number works with polish -lrb- 60 -rrb- , the lowest with romanian -lrb- 15 -rrb- , besides 20-30 more for each of the other languages soon to join the eu 's tower of babel . the space issue space is also a problem .
currently one-to-one translation of all official languages requires 33 interpreters and 11 aquariums , as practitioners call the glass booths where they do their work . by january 1 , 2004 only four eu meeting rooms will be equipped with the necessary 21 aquariums needed .
the jics will only be able to provide full coverage for four meetings a day .
" it 'll be enough for the beginning , " says andersen .
supply and demand while the eu 's three main languages require 70 – 80 interpreters on a daily basis , only 40 will be needed per new language per day as they wo n't be used for central communications . still , both the interpreting and translating services have had to lower their requirements to be sure to have enough extra hands in time for enlargement . although german interpreters , for example are required to be able to work with three languages on top of their mother tongue , applicants from the new candidate countries must merely be able to interpret between their native language and one other language . not all sorted translating is an entirely different issue and a field that - as opposed to interpretation - is decentralized in the eu : each institution has its own translators .

raimo bergt -rrb- european enlargement means that the union will need to translate back and forth between 21 languages soon .
but will it be up to the challenge ? last month when the european commission decided that accession talks would be completed with ten eu candidate countries , polyglots from north and south must have been rubbing their palms in anticipation of new job opportunities .
the eu will indeed need lots of help from them since translators and interpreters are the lifeblood of the european union . a day in the life of the eu requires the services of 700 - 800 interpreters to work in and out of the 11 official languages .
from january 1 , 2004 , when cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia join the eu , multilingual europeans will have to accommodate the union 's 21 languages every day .
each new member state will need a contingent of 120 – 130 trained interpreters to fulfill its needs . real need the eu ’ s policy of multilingualism means that each language is on equal footing . " one day you may have a meeting in french , german , hungarian , estonian and polish , " ian andersen , a spokesman for the eu 's joint interpreting and conference service -lrb- jics -rrb- , told dw-world .
jics provides language skills to all eu institutions except the court of justice and the parliament , which have their own interpreters . in practice though , the eu functions on the " principle of real need rather than political need , " andersen explained . to keep costs down the choice of languages is adjusted to the importance of the content and the intended audience .
a real need does n't arise with eu officials , for example , as they must speak at least one of the eu 's three main languages , -lrb- english , french and german -rrb- .
thus , some eu meetings and documents are just translated or interpreted into the three .
when elected officials , such as members of the european parliament , take part in meetings though , language professionals may need to help out . multilingualism = 2 euros per year " two euros per year is the cost of multilingualism , " says andersen .
those two euros per citizen per year make up the eu 's yearly budget of 700 million euro for translation and interpretation . andersen says the addition of the ten new official languages will bring costs up by around 10 cents per citizen .
each new language will cost the same amount in real terms .
relatively though , poland 's language needs - with 38.6 million polish speakers - will be cheaper than estonia 's -lrb- 1.4 million speakers -rrb- . the number of languages interpreted at any one meeting , however , will stay constant .
for jics only meetings in which all 21 languages are interpreted will end up costing more . early star t since 1990 , jics has been actively involved in training interpreters in potential candidate countries , including bulgaria , romania and albania .
the multilingualism department has been training trainers , offering teaching assistance , producing teaching materials , providing bursaries to students and subsidies to teaching establishments over the past three years .
jics also participates in final exams and conducts yearly tests for interpreters in the candidate countries . estonia , latvia and lithuania pose a special problem because they do n't have a long-standing tradition of interpreters training .
the service has a special office in copenhagen to deal with the baltics .
andersen , however , is confident that there will be enough baltic language interpreters for the first meetings after enlargement . so far , andersen says , jics has 340 freelancers from the candidate countries on the books .
the highest number works with polish -lrb- 60 -rrb- , the lowest with romanian -lrb- 15 -rrb- , besides 20-30 more for each of the other languages soon to join the eu 's tower of babel . the space issue space is also a problem .
currently one-to-one translation of all official languages requires 33 interpreters and 11 aquariums , as practitioners call the glass booths where they do their work . by january 1 , 2004 only four eu meeting rooms will be equipped with the necessary 21 aquariums needed .
the jics will only be able to provide full coverage for four meetings a day .
" it 'll be enough for the beginning , " says andersen .
supply and demand while the eu 's three main languages require 70 – 80 interpreters on a daily basis , only 40 will be needed per new language per day as they wo n't be used for central communications . still , both the interpreting and translating services have had to lower their requirements to be sure to have enough extra hands in time for enlargement . although german interpreters , for example are required to be able to work with three languages on top of their mother tongue , applicants from the new candidate countries must merely be able to interpret between their native language and one other language . not all sorted translating is an entirely different issue and a field that - as opposed to interpretation - is decentralized in the eu : each institution has its own translators .

supply and demand while the eu 's three main languages require 70 – 80 interpreters on a daily basis , only 40 will be needed per new language per day as they wo n't be used for central communications . still , both the interpreting and translating services have had to lower their requirements to be sure to have enough extra hands in time for enlargement . although german interpreters , for example are required to be able to work with three languages on top of their mother tongue , applicants from the new candidate countries must merely be able to interpret between their native language and one other language . not all sorted translating is an entirely different issue and a field that - as opposed to interpretation - is decentralized in the eu : each institution has its own translators .
just to serve the eu 's institutions , each country needs a contingent of at least 80 translators . according to claude mazet , of the translation center for the bodies of the eu , it is not yet clear how enlargement will effect the center .
mazet points out that it depends largely on the needs of the agencies and institutions . for instance , the agency for the evaluation of medical products and the office for harmonization in the internal markets – trademarks and design in realspeak - will need practically every document translated into all official languages .
the offices responsible for training and social affairs , on the other hand , will require less translation , mazet reckons . going back to the baltic issue , mazet attests that there is enough interest there .
however , while 51 poles have passed the eu exams for translators , hardly a dozen have managed in the baltic states . still , the locally administered tests are n't the only source for translators .

jics provides language skills to all eu institutions except the court of justice and the parliament , which have their own interpreters . in practice though , the eu functions on the " principle of real need rather than political need , " andersen explained . to keep costs down the choice of languages is adjusted to the importance of the content and the intended audience .
a real need does n't arise with eu officials , for example , as they must speak at least one of the eu 's three main languages , -lrb- english , french and german -rrb- .
thus , some eu meetings and documents are just translated or interpreted into the three .
when elected officials , such as members of the european parliament , take part in meetings though , language professionals may need to help out . multilingualism = 2 euros per year " two euros per year is the cost of multilingualism , " says andersen .
those two euros per citizen per year make up the eu 's yearly budget of 700 million euro for translation and interpretation . andersen says the addition of the ten new official languages will bring costs up by around 10 cents per citizen .
each new language will cost the same amount in real terms .
relatively though , poland 's language needs - with 38.6 million polish speakers - will be cheaper than estonia 's -lrb- 1.4 million speakers -rrb- . the number of languages interpreted at any one meeting , however , will stay constant .
for jics only meetings in which all 21 languages are interpreted will end up costing more . early star t since 1990 , jics has been actively involved in training interpreters in potential candidate countries , including bulgaria , romania and albania .

the service has a special office in copenhagen to deal with the baltics .
andersen , however , is confident that there will be enough baltic language interpreters for the first meetings after enlargement . so far , andersen says , jics has 340 freelancers from the candidate countries on the books .

in the film minority report , tom cruise heads a futuristic police team who have the technology to spot people who intend to commit serious crimes before the crime itself takes place .
the premise might seem far-fetched but it could be closer than we think .
in the pentagon in washington , a team is working on plans to collect as much information about every single aspect of everyone in america as they can .
this includes everything from doctor 's records to bank deposits , e-mail to travel tickets , phone conversations to magazine subscriptions .
the reason , according to the under secretary of defense pete aldridge , is to catch people intending to carry out terrorist crimes .
" the bottom line is that this is an important research project to determine the feasibility of using certain transactions and events to discover and respond to terrorists before they act . "
willing public backers of the project , known as total information awareness , admit that it sounds orwellian .
this is a technology-intensive approach that assumes if you have enough data you can produce clear conclusions mark rotenberg , epic a reluctant supporter of the pentagon 's plans is frank gaffney , a former assistant defence secretary .
he says that it would only take one more terrorist attack and public support is assured .
" at that point there will not only be a willingness to submit to those sorts of infringement but a demand that they be infringed upon in the hope of trying to protect us .
" if there were no war on terror , this is not something that we would want to do . "
not everyone though is convinced , particularly since the man heading the pentagon team has a dubious past .
hi-tech doubts total information awareness is the baby of admiral john poindexter .
pentagon has been rebuilt since the attacks as an adviser to former president reagan , he sold arms to iran and using the money to fund the nicaraguan contras .
most opponents , though , focus on the wider question of what admiral poindexter is trying to achieve and how likely it is to fail .
mark rotenberg monitors government attempts at surveillance and snooping .
he believes hi-tech solutions are often the ones with the highest rate of failure .
" this is a technology-intensive approach that assumes if you have enough data you can produce clear conclusions , " he said .
" we went through a period of time recently in washington with the sniper attacks when everyone was looking for a white truck .
" we could have had a computer database running profiles of every white truck owner in the country to try to decide which of them was the sniper .
in fact , the answer was that none of them were . "
the white van was found to be a false lead in the infamous washington sniper case .
in the film minority report things go horribly wrong with the system .
many in washington are predicting that this real-life scheme , if it ever got off the ground , would lead to hi-tech chaos and failure . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's gillian ni cheallaigh " they want to monitor everything everyone does all the time " see also : 25 nov 02 -pipe- americas tom ridge : tough man for tough job 25 nov 02 -pipe- americas bush signs landmark security act 22 nov 02 -pipe- business doubts over hi-tech terror fight 17 oct 01 -pipe- science / nature us plan for secure internet ' flawed ' 10 oct 01 -pipe- americas us names cyber-terrorism czar 10 aug 02 -pipe- technology science fiction edges towards fact internet links : information awareness office total information awareness systems epic total information awareness page the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top technology stories now : real boss tackles online piracy hacker breaches credit card security intel looks to the future indian police hunt bandit online salon warns time is running out phone mast emissions ' well below limits ' mobile phone firms look to future robots get cheeky links to more technology stories are at the foot of the page .

in the film minority report , tom cruise heads a futuristic police team who have the technology to spot people who intend to commit serious crimes before the crime itself takes place .
the premise might seem far-fetched but it could be closer than we think .
in the pentagon in washington , a team is working on plans to collect as much information about every single aspect of everyone in america as they can .
this includes everything from doctor 's records to bank deposits , e-mail to travel tickets , phone conversations to magazine subscriptions .
the reason , according to the under secretary of defense pete aldridge , is to catch people intending to carry out terrorist crimes .
" the bottom line is that this is an important research project to determine the feasibility of using certain transactions and events to discover and respond to terrorists before they act . "
willing public backers of the project , known as total information awareness , admit that it sounds orwellian . "
this is a technology-intensive approach that assumes if you have enough data you can produce clear conclusions " mark rotenberg , epic a reluctant supporter of the pentagon 's plans is frank gaffney , a former assistant defence secretary .
he says that it would only take one more terrorist attack and public support is assured .
" at that point there will not only be a willingness to submit to those sorts of infringement but a demand that they be infringed upon in the hope of trying to protect us .
" if there were no war on terror , this is not something that we would want to do . "
not everyone though is convinced , particularly since the man heading the pentagon team has a dubious past .
hi-tech doubts total information awareness is the baby of admiral john poindexter .
as an adviser to former president reagan , he sold arms to iran and using the money to fund the nicaraguan contras .
most opponents , though , focus on the wider question of what admiral poindexter is trying to achieve and how likely it is to fail .
mark rotenberg monitors government attempts at surveillance and snooping .
he believes hi-tech solutions are often the ones with the highest rate of failure .
" this is a technology-intensive approach that assumes if you have enough data you can produce clear conclusions , " he said .
" we went through a period of time recently in washington with the sniper attacks when everyone was looking for a white truck .
" we could have had a computer database running profiles of every white truck owner in the country to try to decide which of them was the sniper .
in fact , the answer was that none of them were . "
the white van was found to be a false lead in the infamous washington sniper case .
in the film minority report things go horribly wrong with the system .
many in washington are predicting that this real-life scheme , if it ever got off the ground , would lead to hi-tech chaos and failure .

the auditor general , who ensures value for money in public spending , has recommended that hospital managers look again at how they plan their workforce .
his report was described as " damning " by the scottish national party , which said it highlighted the crisis in scotland 's wards . "
getting the right number of nurses in place and managing them effectively is a complex task " auditor general robert black but health minister malcolm chisholm said the scottish executive was committed to increasing the numbers of nurses .
nurses and midwives account for almost 50 % of all nhs staff in scotland and cost more than £ 1bn each year .
audit scotland carried out a survey of staffing levels and the way staff are deployed .
it suggested that there were wide variations between hospitals .
the scottish executive has repeatedly pledged to make nursing a more attractive and a more family-friendly career .
quality of care however , auditor general robert black found that less than half of scotland 's hospital trusts had enough nurses to cover for maternity leave .
he also found that 50 % of wards were understaffed .
the report said this was putting pressure on staff , which could in turn lead to a compromise in the quality of care .
the staff shortages also contributed to an increase in the amount of money spent on temporary bank and agency nurses , which rose from £ 25m in 1997/98 to £ 35m last year .
mr black said : " nurses play an essential role in caring for patients and are a much valued nhs resource .
" getting the right number of nurses in place and managing them effectively is a complex task but vitally important if we are to ensure that patients get the care they need and that the best use is made of resources .
" nurse managers need good information on costs and quality to manage their staff effectively but there is significant variation in the availability of this information . "
the report makes a number of recommendations for action by trusts , nhs boards and the health department .

however , it said more work was needed to get nurse staffing levels right across scotland .
snp leader john swinney said : " the full extent of labour 's disastrous management of the nursing crisis is laid bare by this report .
" for almost half of our children 's wards to be understaffed is simply appalling and audit scotland themselves say it is damaging patient care . "
" there are more nurses than ever working in the nhs in scotland " malcolm chisholm health minister he said that an 11 % pay rise for nurses would give scotland a competitive edge in the recruitment market .

conservative deputy health pokesman ben wallace said : " the report is a damning indictment on labour 's tardiness in modernising nurse management . "
however , mr chisholm said the executive was committed to increasing the numbers of nurses .
" the major challenge from the report is how we can measure the real number of nurses working with patients in wards , " he said .
" there are more nurses than ever working in the nhs in scotland and i want us to continue to create more posts so that we can create new opportunities for nurses to care for patients . "
he added that workforce planning was at the heart of modernising the nhs in scotland .

burnley council will now support chorley borough council which has already applied for a judicial review .
they oppose lancashire county council 's decision to close its care homes and provide care for old people in their own homes instead .
burnley council 's move follows ribble valley 's decision in november to drop its legal action because of mounting costs .
too expensive burnley - which wants to cut more than £ 1m from its budget - faced a potential legal bill of £ 140,000 .
the council 's executive committee decided on wednesday night that legal action would be too expensive .
but council leader stuart caddy said the authority would continue to fight the county council 's plans .
chorley council 's court hearing is not expected until march 2003 .
' human rights breach ' it says the closure decision was taken without the consultation process taking enough account of its concerns .
the plans will mean only 16 council-run care homes remain in lancashire .
