program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.12.2002 wim duisenberg reflects on the euro 's first birthday großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro turns one soon it 's now been nearly a year since the jan .
1 introduction of the euro .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the president of the european central bank takes stock of the euro 's success . wim duisenberg has been president of the european central bank since 1997 .
during his five years there , duisenberg has overseen the smooth introduction of europe 's common currency , the euro , and managed interest rates , prices and inflation in the 12 euro zone countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president wim duisenberg recently , duisenberg has been criticized for not cutting interest rates as agressively as his american counterpart , alan greenspan of the federal reserve bank . he also wants members to maintain the rigid guidelines set in the euro stability pact , which prohibits countries to allow their deficit spending to rise over 3 percent of gross domestic product . in a recent interview with dw-radio , duisenberg took stock of the euro 's progress during the current year and offered frank criticism of a handful of member states for not keeping a tight- enough hold on their budget pursestrings .
it 's been nearly one year since the euro was introduced in europe .
how would you evaluate the year ?
for me , of course , the euro has already existed for sometime longer .
but it 's true the notes and coins have just been introduced .
i would evaluate that unambiguously as a success .
how has the new currency encouraged countries in the euro zone to cooperate more effectively ?
that is a slow process , but having one single currency has its effects on all areas of monetary policy - not only on fiscal and social policy , but even on foreign policy .
it brings countries that have the single currency closer together and it does necessitate ever-closer cooperation .
would you say the euro zone has brought nations together politically ?
that 's also a process .
it is working in that direction .
it is working to bring them closer together and it also works already now towards those countries that are about to become members of the european union - particularly in central and eastern europe .
they will not immediately adopt the euro , but the euro is already a force there .
it exerts its influence in bringing those countries closer to the europe they will one day be a part of .
do you see the candidate countries joining the euro zone ?
they undoubtably will .
they will first sign the accession treaty .
then a process will start involving a number of treaties that will have to be ratified by all the parliaments involved .
but we are already intensively working at the european central bank to integrate them into our work .
this involves working with their central banks to prepare them for the new situation .
they will have to adjust their legal frameworks in various fields .
the financial sector has to be adjusted and adapted - and that , too , is a long , drawn-out process .
but it could happen within five to seven years .
a central part of the treaty would no doubt be the stability pact , the criteria now in place for current euro zone countries .
those criteria are now being discussed in european capitals - especially the three-percent cap on deficit spending .
what do you think about suggestion criteria should be softened , especially in light of germany 's economic troubles ?
i would be very much against it .
the criteria are only just in place .
it 's natural that there are times when it really bites and causes difficulties for some european countries .
then countries talk about changing it .
but i 'm one who thinks you should never change the rules in the middle of the game .
the fact that some countries are now having difficulty meeting the criteria - like germany , france and italy .
it is precisely because of the fact that in the recent past , when everything was going well , they did n't grasp the opportunitiy to better consolidate their public finances .
now , because they have n't done that at that time , they are sitting on their blisters .
but that 's no reason to change the rules .
it 's all the more reason to finally do what should have been done long before .
out of the 12 euro zone countries , eight have already reached that goal .
do you feel undermined by comments by people like european commission president romano prodi , who severely criticizes the stability pact 's guidelines ?
well , i ca n't feel undermined because the ecb , though we are standing and shouting from the sidelines , is not part of the stability pact as such .
it 's the european commission that is the stability pact 's guardian .
we support the european commission in in every respect in their function as the guardian of the stability and growth pact .
but as for mr. prodi 's criticism , let me simply say that i do not share his views and would not have said what he said .
there has also been criticism in europe and america about the reluctance of the ecb to lower interest rates along the lines of the federal reserve bank under federal reserve chairman alan greenspan .
is this criticism justified ?
i think not .
we have interest rates at low levels which have not been seen in europe for the last 40 or 50 years .
the interest rate levels we have are being determined exclusively on the basis of what we think is best for the euro area and not for any other consideration .
last week we lowered our interest rate even further .
liquidity , money in the euro zone is ample .
in no way is the monetary policy stance an inhibition for the resumption of growth and growth of employment .
does that mean that at some point in the future lower rates could not be an economic tool ?
it 's sometimes overestimated what monetary policy can do and what it can not do .
our main goal is to safeguard price stability , thereby giving consumers and investors confidence in the future .
it 's mainly the lack of confidence at the moment which comes for other reasons - all the uncertainties - that we are going through a period of very slow economic development .
we have to rebuild confidence and that takes time .
you can lose confidence in a day , but to regain it may take a year .
you mentioned lack of confidence and instability .
how do you think a war against iraq would affect the euro ?
i ca n't possibly speculate on that .
the main impact we might see is on the oil market and oil prices .
that 's one of the uncertainties that hangs over our heads , but you ca n't possibly speculate to what extent it might have an impact on the euro .
as far as oil prices are concerned , if they rise suddenly , that would have an impact on our internal price stability .
that would be the main impact .
if it had a lasting impact , we would react .
if it had only a short-term impact , we would do nothing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the deed was allegedly recorded on video . for a day at least , germans may have forgotten about their economic woes as the country found itself hitting the headlines over an altogether more frightening story .
police have arrested a man who claims to have killed and eaten a friend and recorded the deed on video , allegedly with the victim 's approval .
the 41-year-old suspect from the picturesque hessian town of rotenburg told police that he met his 42-year-old victim , microchip engineer from berlin , via the internet .
he said they shared homosexual and cannibalistic leanings . police said they found the video along with deep-frozen flesh and skeletal remains when they searched the suspect 's flat .
the video allegedly shows the suspect and the victim agreeing on the murder .
forensic experts are searching the house and surrounding areas for the remains of other possible victims .
internet clue the killing goes back to 2001 .
police only stumbled across it after the man placed another ad in the internet looking for a man willing to allow himself to be killed and eaten .
the last alleged case of cannibalism in germany dates back to 1995 when a 33-year-old man standing trial for murder and robbery claimed to have eaten parts of his victim , however , his claim was never proven .
police say the suspect is not mentally disturbed .
a spokesman said had that been the case he would have been placed in a psychiatric unit instead of a detention cell .
the man is being held on suspicion of murder which carries a life sentence . should his story check out , he would only face a charge of so-called murder by demand . a conviction would be punishable by a maximum of five years in prison . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

turkish cypriots diplomats said on friday that they were prepared to sign a " letter of intent " with greek cypriots to discuss a u.n. plan to reunite their divided mediterranean island .
the u.n. plan forsees a state based on two largely autonomous greek and turkish zones and calls for an agreement by late february followed by referendums on both sides .
the " letter of intent " however is a diluted version of what eu leaders were hoping would be the inking of a framework agreement at the copenhagen summit by both sides .
a " christian fortress " around europe ?
earlier turkish leaders reacted angrily to the eu ’ s proposal of a december 2004 review of turkey ’ s implementation of reforms and if successful , a date for accession talks in 2005 .
they are also smarting that that the internationally recognized greek cypriot government on cyprus is set to join the eu in 2004 .
earlier on friday the turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash accused the european union of seeking to build a " christian fortress " around turkey and effectively ruled out a deal to reunite cyprus at the summit .
" the european union ’ s interest is to delay turkey and to take cyprus , to possess cyprus and to build something like a christian fortress around turkey , " he told a news conference in the turkish capital of ankara .
will any deal on cyprus be reached at all ?
however it remains unclear whether the summit will see any kind of agreement at all between the greeks and cypriots .
greek cypriot attorney general alecos markides told cyprus television from copenhagen that there was no need for any letter of intent .
" if they are committing themselves and they have told de soto -lrb- u.n. envoy -rrb- they are to cooperate , we don ’ t need letters of intent or anything like that . "
even u.n. secretary-general kofi anan acknowledged on friday that a deal to reunite cyprus would not be reached at the eu summit in copenhagen .
" we were very close , and i was very hopeful that we could get an agreement , and i recall telling -lrb- turkish leader tayyip -rrb- erdogan that like an old soccer player like himself , the games is not over until the final whistle , and it looks as if we are not going to get there , " anan said .
cyprus has been a divided island since a turkish invasion in 1974 prompted by a brief greek-inspired coup in nicosia .
the self-declared turkish republic of northern cyprus , which accounts for about 18 percent of the island ’ s 750,000-strong population is only recognized by turkey .
the eu has always maintained that in the absence of a settlement to unite the island , it would take in only the internationally recognized greek cypriot part of the island , with which it has been negotiating .
historic deal clinched with poland meanwhile the eu had better luck with another obstacle plaguing enlargement talks in recent months .
a danish presidency official announced on friday that all 10 candidates had accepted financial packages at the end of the two-day summit in copenhagen .
" we have a deal , " the official told reuters after swedish prime minister goran persson and polish finance minister grzegorz kolodko confirmed that poland , the biggest and most difficult candidate , had accepted a financial settlement .
german chancellor gerhard schröder had earlier said that a solution had been found to give poland a special cashflow facility for its years of eu membership without raising the overall cost of enlargement .
the eu had proposed reshuffling funds from various sources to give poland about a billion extra euros in 2005 and 6 .
that money would then have been deducted from eu aid to warsaw in following years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.12.2002 wim duisenberg reflects on the euro 's first birthday großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro turns one soon it 's now been nearly a year since the jan .
1 introduction of the euro .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the president of the european central bank takes stock of the euro 's success . wim duisenberg has been president of the european central bank since 1997 .
during his five years there , duisenberg has overseen the smooth introduction of europe 's common currency , the euro , and managed interest rates , prices and inflation in the 12 euro zone countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president wim duisenberg recently , duisenberg has been criticized for not cutting interest rates as agressively as his american counterpart , alan greenspan of the federal reserve bank . he also wants members to maintain the rigid guidelines set in the euro stability pact , which prohibits countries to allow their deficit spending to rise over 3 percent of gross domestic product . in a recent interview with dw-radio , duisenberg took stock of the euro 's progress during the current year and offered frank criticism of a handful of member states for not keeping a tight- enough hold on their budget pursestrings .
it 's been nearly one year since the euro was introduced in europe .
how would you evaluate the year ?
for me , of course , the euro has already existed for sometime longer .
but it 's true the notes and coins have just been introduced .
i would evaluate that unambiguously as a success .
how has the new currency encouraged countries in the euro zone to cooperate more effectively ?
that is a slow process , but having one single currency has its effects on all areas of monetary policy - not only on fiscal and social policy , but even on foreign policy .
it brings countries that have the single currency closer together and it does necessitate ever-closer cooperation .
would you say the euro zone has brought nations together politically ?
that 's also a process .
it is working in that direction .
it is working to bring them closer together and it also works already now towards those countries that are about to become members of the european union - particularly in central and eastern europe .
they will not immediately adopt the euro , but the euro is already a force there .
it exerts its influence in bringing those countries closer to the europe they will one day be a part of .
do you see the candidate countries joining the euro zone ?
they undoubtably will .
they will first sign the accession treaty .
then a process will start involving a number of treaties that will have to be ratified by all the parliaments involved .
but we are already intensively working at the european central bank to integrate them into our work .
this involves working with their central banks to prepare them for the new situation .
they will have to adjust their legal frameworks in various fields .
the financial sector has to be adjusted and adapted - and that , too , is a long , drawn-out process .
but it could happen within five to seven years .
a central part of the treaty would no doubt be the stability pact , the criteria now in place for current euro zone countries .
those criteria are now being discussed in european capitals - especially the three-percent cap on deficit spending .
what do you think about suggestion criteria should be softened , especially in light of germany 's economic troubles ?
i would be very much against it .
the criteria are only just in place .
it 's natural that there are times when it really bites and causes difficulties for some european countries .
then countries talk about changing it .
but i 'm one who thinks you should never change the rules in the middle of the game .
the fact that some countries are now having difficulty meeting the criteria - like germany , france and italy .
it is precisely because of the fact that in the recent past , when everything was going well , they did n't grasp the opportunitiy to better consolidate their public finances .
now , because they have n't done that at that time , they are sitting on their blisters .
but that 's no reason to change the rules .
it 's all the more reason to finally do what should have been done long before .
out of the 12 euro zone countries , eight have already reached that goal .
do you feel undermined by comments by people like european commission president romano prodi , who severely criticizes the stability pact 's guidelines ?
well , i ca n't feel undermined because the ecb , though we are standing and shouting from the sidelines , is not part of the stability pact as such .
it 's the european commission that is the stability pact 's guardian .
we support the european commission in in every respect in their function as the guardian of the stability and growth pact .
but as for mr. prodi 's criticism , let me simply say that i do not share his views and would not have said what he said .
there has also been criticism in europe and america about the reluctance of the ecb to lower interest rates along the lines of the federal reserve bank under federal reserve chairman alan greenspan .
is this criticism justified ?
i think not .
we have interest rates at low levels which have not been seen in europe for the last 40 or 50 years .
the interest rate levels we have are being determined exclusively on the basis of what we think is best for the euro area and not for any other consideration .
last week we lowered our interest rate even further .
liquidity , money in the euro zone is ample .
in no way is the monetary policy stance an inhibition for the resumption of growth and growth of employment .
does that mean that at some point in the future lower rates could not be an economic tool ?
it 's sometimes overestimated what monetary policy can do and what it can not do .
our main goal is to safeguard price stability , thereby giving consumers and investors confidence in the future .
it 's mainly the lack of confidence at the moment which comes for other reasons - all the uncertainties - that we are going through a period of very slow economic development .
we have to rebuild confidence and that takes time .
you can lose confidence in a day , but to regain it may take a year .
you mentioned lack of confidence and instability .
how do you think a war against iraq would affect the euro ?
i ca n't possibly speculate on that .
the main impact we might see is on the oil market and oil prices .
that 's one of the uncertainties that hangs over our heads , but you ca n't possibly speculate to what extent it might have an impact on the euro .
as far as oil prices are concerned , if they rise suddenly , that would have an impact on our internal price stability .
that would be the main impact .
if it had a lasting impact , we would react .
if it had only a short-term impact , we would do nothing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" we have a deal , " the official told reuters after swedish prime minister goran persson and polish finance minister grzegorz kolodko confirmed that poland , the biggest and most difficult candidate , had accepted a financial settlement .
german chancellor gerhard schröder had earlier said that a solution had been found to give poland a special cashflow facility for its years of eu membership without raising the overall cost of enlargement .
the eu had proposed reshuffling funds from various sources to give poland about a billion extra euros in 2005 and 6 .
that money would then have been deducted from eu aid to warsaw in following years .
the polish acceptance of the renewed offer came after agonizingly long-drawn out negotiations which dragged the summit into overtime .
however the deal with poland brings to a close one of the trickiest negotiation chapters in the enlargement project , which often threatened to jeopardize it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey gets its date with the eu the eu said turkey could begin negotiations for entry at the end of 2004 , more than one year later than ankara had hoped for .
turkish officials are upset with the decision .

european space chiefs are now trying to come up with answers to the baffling fiasco . the european space industry is still mystified about what caused the new ariane 5-esca rocket to fail this week , less than three minutes after lift-off .
the new heavy-payload version of the rocket strayed off course just 96 seconds into its maiden flight on wednesday and had to be blown up , ditching its $ 600 million payload of satellites into the atlantic ocean 800 kilometres off the coast of french guiana .
engineers and officials from the european space agency say the problem occurred in the cooling circuit of one of the rocket 's main engines .
a change in engine speed around 180 seconds after take-off caused the launcher to " demonstrate erratic behaviour " .
wednesday 's explosion was the fourth failure of an ariane 5 in fourteen missions .
it was carrying a 10-tonne cargo , heavier than any previous version .
on board were the hot bird 7 eutelsat television broadcast satellite and stentor , a telecommunications satellite developed by the french space agency at a cost of over $ 385 million .
inquiry arianespace , the company that designed the rocket , has announced the establishment of an independent inquiry board to investigate the failure and try to ensure future launches are not affected .
arianespace chief executive jean-yves le gall said the inquiry would begin early next week .
" we will have to clearly explain what happened and if it will have consequences on the ariane 5 launcher in its basic version , " le gall told reporters .
" second , it will tell us when we can resume ariane 5 flights . "
rosetta mission in danger experts say the ariane 5 could be out of action for several months , casting doubt over the mission of the comet-chasing rosetta probe , due to blast off on january 12 .
rosetta , estimated to have cost more than $ 1 billion , is to make an eight-year journey to meet the comet wirtanen , which it will study for nearly two years .
the timing of rosetta 's launch is critical because of its complex trajectory around the planet mars .

the deed was allegedly recorded on video . for a day at least , germans may have forgotten about their economic woes as the country found itself hitting the headlines over an altogether more frightening story .
police have arrested a man who claims to have killed and eaten a friend and recorded the deed on video , allegedly with the victim 's approval .
the 41-year-old suspect from the picturesque hessian town of rotenburg told police that he met his 42-year-old victim , microchip engineer from berlin , via the internet .
he said they shared homosexual and cannibalistic leanings . police said they found the video along with deep-frozen flesh and skeletal remains when they searched the suspect 's flat .
the video allegedly shows the suspect and the victim agreeing on the murder .
forensic experts are searching the house and surrounding areas for the remains of other possible victims .
internet clue the killing goes back to 2001 .
police only stumbled across it after the man placed another ad in the internet looking for a man willing to allow himself to be killed and eaten .
the last alleged case of cannibalism in germany dates back to 1995 when a 33-year-old man standing trial for murder and robbery claimed to have eaten parts of his victim , however , his claim was never proven .
police say the suspect is not mentally disturbed .
a spokesman said had that been the case he would have been placed in a psychiatric unit instead of a detention cell .
the man is being held on suspicion of murder which carries a life sentence . should his story check out , he would only face a charge of so-called murder by demand . a conviction would be punishable by a maximum of five years in prison . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

european space chiefs are now trying to come up with answers to the baffling fiasco . the european space industry is still mystified about what caused the new ariane 5-esca rocket to fail this week , less than three minutes after lift-off .
the new heavy-payload version of the rocket strayed off course just 96 seconds into its maiden flight on wednesday and had to be blown up , ditching its $ 600 million payload of satellites into the atlantic ocean 800 kilometres off the coast of french guiana .
engineers and officials from the european space agency say the problem occurred in the cooling circuit of one of the rocket 's main engines .
a change in engine speed around 180 seconds after take-off caused the launcher to " demonstrate erratic behaviour " .
wednesday 's explosion was the fourth failure of an ariane 5 in fourteen missions .
it was carrying a 10-tonne cargo , heavier than any previous version .
on board were the hot bird 7 eutelsat television broadcast satellite and stentor , a telecommunications satellite developed by the french space agency at a cost of over $ 385 million .
inquiry arianespace , the company that designed the rocket , has announced the establishment of an independent inquiry board to investigate the failure and try to ensure future launches are not affected .
arianespace chief executive jean-yves le gall said the inquiry would begin early next week .
" we will have to clearly explain what happened and if it will have consequences on the ariane 5 launcher in its basic version , " le gall told reporters .
" second , it will tell us when we can resume ariane 5 flights . "
rosetta mission in danger experts say the ariane 5 could be out of action for several months , casting doubt over the mission of the comet-chasing rosetta probe , due to blast off on january 12 .
rosetta , estimated to have cost more than $ 1 billion , is to make an eight-year journey to meet the comet wirtanen , which it will study for nearly two years .
the timing of rosetta 's launch is critical because of its complex trajectory around the planet mars .
setback for europe the ariane 5 failure comes as a huge blow to the european industry at a time when the satellite launch market is in a depression .
demand has been affected by a slowdown in the world telecommunications industry , with fewer commercial satellites being ordered than in previous years .
overproduction of rockets has also caused prices to fall thirty percent lower than they were a decade ago .
in addition , several competitors to ariane 5 have emerged in recent months .
boeing 's delta 4 and lockheed martin 's atlas 5 have both been well-received since their introduction .
arianespace 's dominant position in the commercial market now looks to be seriously threatened , with ariane 5 's failure expected to cause customers to look even more favourably on its rivals .
insurance woes some industry analysts have predicted that the market for satellite launchers could experience an up-turn in the second part of the decade , when satellites will have to be replaced .
they also say higher demand for broadband internet services could translate to a need for more satellite launchers .
but the fallout from wednesday 's failure , already being felt throughout the satellite launch industry , will be lasting .
insurance companies are saying they 'll be forced to increase premiums .
ariane 5 crashed just ten days after the failure of the astra 1k telecoms satellite launch , capping an already bad year for commercial insurers .
consultants say the situation could force some insurers to quit the space industry altogether .
another attempt the next arianespace mission , flight 156 , which will use ariane 5 's predecessor , ariane 4 to orbit the nss-6 satellite , has been set for the evening of tuesday , december 17 .
the arianespace consortium has stopped production of the ariane 4 and the last rocket has been booked for launch in february . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's galileo runs into rough weather europe ’ s ambitious 3.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.14 billion -rrb- flagship galileo satellite navigation programme is floundering on account of squabbling between germany and italy over the leadership of the european space agency .

turkish officials are upset with the decision . during evening discussions at the eu expansion summit thursday , european leaders and turkish negotiators were finally able to reach agreement on the elusive date on which turkey could begin negotiating for eu entry . danish prime minister anders fogh rassmussen , whose country is leading the summit , announced last night that turkey would begin negotiations for entry at the end of 2004 . the news was received with anger by turkish prime minister abdullah gül , who said the eu did n't appreciate all the efforts turkey has made so far . " this is impossible to accept , " gül said , after meeting with british prime minister tony blair , who supported an earlier negotiation date for turkey . turkey had been lobbying hard for eu entry since passing a host of human rights legislation last summer .
the eu first declared the country a candidate in 1999 .
since then , ankara had hoped it could join the union with the ten other eastern european and mediterranean countries in 2004 . the past few weeks have seen an intense lobbying effort in european capitals on the part of turkish leader recep tayyip erdogan .
though well received in italy , spain and the uk , erdogan ’ s lobbying seemed to annoy other countries . “ many found the -lrb- turkish lobbying -rrb- regrettable and unacceptable , ” said italian prime minister silvio berlusconi . the us , which will need turkey ’ s help in a possible iraq invasion , had also urged the eu to name a date .
the eventual compromise bore strong resemblance to a franco-german proposal to get turkey a date in 2005 should it continue to pass human rights legislation in line with eu membership requirements .

turkish cypriots diplomats said on friday that they were prepared to sign a " letter of intent " with greek cypriots to discuss a u.n. plan to reunite their divided mediterranean island .
the u.n. plan forsees a state based on two largely autonomous greek and turkish zones and calls for an agreement by late february followed by referendums on both sides .
the " letter of intent " however is a diluted version of what eu leaders were hoping would be the inking of a framework agreement at the copenhagen summit by both sides .
a " christian fortress " around europe ?
earlier turkish leaders reacted angrily to the eu ’ s proposal of a december 2004 review of turkey ’ s implementation of reforms and if successful , a date for accession talks in 2005 .
they are also smarting that that the internationally recognized greek cypriot government on cyprus is set to join the eu in 2004 .
earlier on friday the turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash accused the european union of seeking to build a " christian fortress " around turkey and effectively ruled out a deal to reunite cyprus at the summit .
" the european union ’ s interest is to delay turkey and to take cyprus , to possess cyprus and to build something like a christian fortress around turkey , " he told a news conference in the turkish capital of ankara .
will any deal on cyprus be reached at all ?
however it remains unclear whether the summit will see any kind of agreement at all between the greeks and cypriots .
greek cypriot attorney general alecos markides told cyprus television from copenhagen that there was no need for any letter of intent .
" if they are committing themselves and they have told de soto -lrb- u.n. envoy -rrb- they are to cooperate , we don ’ t need letters of intent or anything like that . "
even u.n. secretary-general kofi anan acknowledged on friday that a deal to reunite cyprus would not be reached at the eu summit in copenhagen .
" we were very close , and i was very hopeful that we could get an agreement , and i recall telling -lrb- turkish leader tayyip -rrb- erdogan that like an old soccer player like himself , the games is not over until the final whistle , and it looks as if we are not going to get there , " anan said .
cyprus has been a divided island since a turkish invasion in 1974 prompted by a brief greek-inspired coup in nicosia .
the self-declared turkish republic of northern cyprus , which accounts for about 18 percent of the island ’ s 750,000-strong population is only recognized by turkey .
the eu has always maintained that in the absence of a settlement to unite the island , it would take in only the internationally recognized greek cypriot part of the island , with which it has been negotiating .
historic deal clinched with poland meanwhile the eu had better luck with another obstacle plaguing enlargement talks in recent months .
a danish presidency official announced on friday that all 10 candidates had accepted financial packages at the end of the two-day summit in copenhagen .
" we have a deal , " the official told reuters after swedish prime minister goran persson and polish finance minister grzegorz kolodko confirmed that poland , the biggest and most difficult candidate , had accepted a financial settlement .
german chancellor gerhard schröder had earlier said that a solution had been found to give poland a special cashflow facility for its years of eu membership without raising the overall cost of enlargement .
the eu had proposed reshuffling funds from various sources to give poland about a billion extra euros in 2005 and 6 .
that money would then have been deducted from eu aid to warsaw in following years .
the polish acceptance of the renewed offer came after agonizingly long-drawn out negotiations which dragged the summit into overtime .

1 introduction of the euro .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the president of the european central bank takes stock of the euro 's success . wim duisenberg has been president of the european central bank since 1997 .
during his five years there , duisenberg has overseen the smooth introduction of europe 's common currency , the euro , and managed interest rates , prices and inflation in the 12 euro zone countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president wim duisenberg recently , duisenberg has been criticized for not cutting interest rates as agressively as his american counterpart , alan greenspan of the federal reserve bank . he also wants members to maintain the rigid guidelines set in the euro stability pact , which prohibits countries to allow their deficit spending to rise over 3 percent of gross domestic product . in a recent interview with dw-radio , duisenberg took stock of the euro 's progress during the current year and offered frank criticism of a handful of member states for not keeping a tight- enough hold on their budget pursestrings .
it 's been nearly one year since the euro was introduced in europe .
how would you evaluate the year ?
for me , of course , the euro has already existed for sometime longer .
but it 's true the notes and coins have just been introduced .
i would evaluate that unambiguously as a success .
how has the new currency encouraged countries in the euro zone to cooperate more effectively ?
that is a slow process , but having one single currency has its effects on all areas of monetary policy - not only on fiscal and social policy , but even on foreign policy .
it brings countries that have the single currency closer together and it does necessitate ever-closer cooperation .
would you say the euro zone has brought nations together politically ?
that 's also a process .
it is working in that direction .
it is working to bring them closer together and it also works already now towards those countries that are about to become members of the european union - particularly in central and eastern europe .
they will not immediately adopt the euro , but the euro is already a force there .
it exerts its influence in bringing those countries closer to the europe they will one day be a part of .
do you see the candidate countries joining the euro zone ?
they undoubtably will .
they will first sign the accession treaty .
then a process will start involving a number of treaties that will have to be ratified by all the parliaments involved .
but we are already intensively working at the european central bank to integrate them into our work .
this involves working with their central banks to prepare them for the new situation .
they will have to adjust their legal frameworks in various fields .
the financial sector has to be adjusted and adapted - and that , too , is a long , drawn-out process .
but it could happen within five to seven years .
a central part of the treaty would no doubt be the stability pact , the criteria now in place for current euro zone countries .
those criteria are now being discussed in european capitals - especially the three-percent cap on deficit spending .
what do you think about suggestion criteria should be softened , especially in light of germany 's economic troubles ?
i would be very much against it .
the criteria are only just in place .
it 's natural that there are times when it really bites and causes difficulties for some european countries .
then countries talk about changing it .
but i 'm one who thinks you should never change the rules in the middle of the game .
the fact that some countries are now having difficulty meeting the criteria - like germany , france and italy .
it is precisely because of the fact that in the recent past , when everything was going well , they did n't grasp the opportunitiy to better consolidate their public finances .
now , because they have n't done that at that time , they are sitting on their blisters .
but that 's no reason to change the rules .
it 's all the more reason to finally do what should have been done long before .
out of the 12 euro zone countries , eight have already reached that goal .
do you feel undermined by comments by people like european commission president romano prodi , who severely criticizes the stability pact 's guidelines ?
well , i ca n't feel undermined because the ecb , though we are standing and shouting from the sidelines , is not part of the stability pact as such .
it 's the european commission that is the stability pact 's guardian .
we support the european commission in in every respect in their function as the guardian of the stability and growth pact .
but as for mr. prodi 's criticism , let me simply say that i do not share his views and would not have said what he said .
there has also been criticism in europe and america about the reluctance of the ecb to lower interest rates along the lines of the federal reserve bank under federal reserve chairman alan greenspan .
is this criticism justified ?
i think not .
we have interest rates at low levels which have not been seen in europe for the last 40 or 50 years .
the interest rate levels we have are being determined exclusively on the basis of what we think is best for the euro area and not for any other consideration .
last week we lowered our interest rate even further .
liquidity , money in the euro zone is ample .
in no way is the monetary policy stance an inhibition for the resumption of growth and growth of employment .
does that mean that at some point in the future lower rates could not be an economic tool ?
it 's sometimes overestimated what monetary policy can do and what it can not do .
our main goal is to safeguard price stability , thereby giving consumers and investors confidence in the future .
it 's mainly the lack of confidence at the moment which comes for other reasons - all the uncertainties - that we are going through a period of very slow economic development .
we have to rebuild confidence and that takes time .
you can lose confidence in a day , but to regain it may take a year .
you mentioned lack of confidence and instability .
how do you think a war against iraq would affect the euro ?
i ca n't possibly speculate on that .
the main impact we might see is on the oil market and oil prices .
that 's one of the uncertainties that hangs over our heads , but you ca n't possibly speculate to what extent it might have an impact on the euro .
as far as oil prices are concerned , if they rise suddenly , that would have an impact on our internal price stability .
that would be the main impact .
if it had a lasting impact , we would react .
if it had only a short-term impact , we would do nothing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

does that mean that at some point in the future lower rates could not be an economic tool ?
it 's sometimes overestimated what monetary policy can do and what it can not do .
our main goal is to safeguard price stability , thereby giving consumers and investors confidence in the future .
it 's mainly the lack of confidence at the moment which comes for other reasons - all the uncertainties - that we are going through a period of very slow economic development .

you can lose confidence in a day , but to regain it may take a year .

how do you think a war against iraq would affect the euro ?

the main impact we might see is on the oil market and oil prices .
that 's one of the uncertainties that hangs over our heads , but you ca n't possibly speculate to what extent it might have an impact on the euro .
as far as oil prices are concerned , if they rise suddenly , that would have an impact on our internal price stability .
that would be the main impact .

turkish officials are upset with the decision . during evening discussions at the eu expansion summit thursday , european leaders and turkish negotiators were finally able to reach agreement on the elusive date on which turkey could begin negotiating for eu entry . danish prime minister anders fogh rassmussen , whose country is leading the summit , announced last night that turkey would begin negotiations for entry at the end of 2004 . the news was received with anger by turkish prime minister abdullah gül , who said the eu did n't appreciate all the efforts turkey has made so far . " this is impossible to accept , " gül said , after meeting with british prime minister tony blair , who supported an earlier negotiation date for turkey . turkey had been lobbying hard for eu entry since passing a host of human rights legislation last summer .
the eu first declared the country a candidate in 1999 .
since then , ankara had hoped it could join the union with the ten other eastern european and mediterranean countries in 2004 . the past few weeks have seen an intense lobbying effort in european capitals on the part of turkish leader recep tayyip erdogan .
though well received in italy , spain and the uk , erdogan ’ s lobbying seemed to annoy other countries . “ many found the -lrb- turkish lobbying -rrb- regrettable and unacceptable , ” said italian prime minister silvio berlusconi . the us , which will need turkey ’ s help in a possible iraq invasion , had also urged the eu to name a date .
the eventual compromise bore strong resemblance to a franco-german proposal to get turkey a date in 2005 should it continue to pass human rights legislation in line with eu membership requirements .
the turkish delegation to the copenhagen summit told reporters that they want to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder and french leader jacques chirac .
they promised to continue to fight to change the date . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union dw-world 's main eu dossier 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

since the irish gave the go-ahead for eu enlargement in october , the fifty-eight year old has been working round the clock to try to secure a peace deal in cyprus , find a way forward for turkey 's candidacy , keep poland 's financial expectations in check and persuade reluctant eu members that for forty billion euros , they 're getting enlargement on the cheap .
even as the enlargement project was poised to enter the final stages in copenhagen , commissioner verheugen was still at it - urging participants to show political courage and strong leadership .
european expansion must take place " now or never " , he told german television .
" a failure in copenhagen or a delay could have serious effects on public opinion in the future member states . "
the jewel in the crown for verheugen , the copenhagen summit represents his greatest achievement as enlargement commissioner .
" nothing more can go wrong , " he says .
" when it 's all over , i 'll feel an enormous sense of relief . "
this is about as close to sentimentality as verheugen gets .
even after succeeding in closing what looked like an impossible gap between the member states and accession countries ahead of the copenhagen meeting , the commissioner was insisting that it was still too soon for celebrations .
nor is verheugen inclined to take all the credit for creating an expanded europe .
" it 's a structure made up of many thousands of individual bricks , " he says .
verheugen sees himself as an architect , but not a miracle-worker .
challenges in office for four years , verheugen has complained that his is a lonely job .
that 's hardly surprising , given that he 's spent more time on the road , travelling between the eu candidate countries and the fifteen member states , than back home in brussels .
but the white-haired , thick-spectacled verheugen has no doubts about what he 's doing .
the peoples of central and eastern europe must be welcomed into the family of european democracies , he says , in order to close a historical chapter during which they were persecuted by oppressive totalitarian regimes .
maintaining enthusiasm for the european project within the eu as well as in the candidate countries has been one of the biggest challenges verheugen has faced as commissioner .
he 's had to work hard to convince eu members that the accession countries are doing their best to implement reforms .
all the while , verheugen sees that the candidate countries are losing patience , and they 're no longer prepared to accept membership at any price .
he 's issued a stern warning to poland , the czech republic and hungary to keep their demands in check , saying " the eu is n't an automatic teller machine .
you do n't just stick in your membership card and expect money to come out the bottom " .
getting eu members to agree on the hefty enlargement budget has been just as difficult .
verheugen has appealed to the member states to show more generosity , pushing the benefits he argues will come from an expanded european economic zone and new export markets .
a party man verheugen 's skills in diplomacy have been developed over a long political career . born in germany in 1944 , just before the end of wwii , he studied history and worked for a short time as a journalist before entering politics .
he became federal party manager of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- at the age of thirty-two .
five years later , having helped the fdp achieve its best result ever in national elections , he switched to the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
it was a difficult time for verheugen .
the son of a small-town banker , he was not welcomed by some in the spd , who never forgave him for his prior allegiance to the liberal democrats .
nevertheless , in 1993 , verheugen became the spd 's federal party manager , an important step in his political career .
the chance of a lifetime after gerhard schröder 's election victory in 1998 , verheugen had hoped to get the job of defence minister in his new cabinet .
instead , he was sent to brussels as foreign policy advisor , and a year later took up the post of eu commissioner responsible for enlargement .
verheugen has described the move as a " chance which only comes along once in a lifetime ... to do something that has a lasting impact and affects the lives of entire peoples " .

turkish cypriots diplomats said on friday that they were prepared to sign a " letter of intent " with greek cypriots to discuss a u.n. plan to reunite their divided mediterranean island .
the u.n. plan forsees a state based on two largely autonomous greek and turkish zones and calls for an agreement by late february followed by referendums on both sides .
the " letter of intent " however is a diluted version of what eu leaders were hoping would be the inking of a framework agreement at the copenhagen summit by both sides .
a " christian fortress " around europe ?
earlier turkish leaders reacted angrily to the eu ’ s proposal of a december 2004 review of turkey ’ s implementation of reforms and if successful , a date for accession talks in 2005 .
they are also smarting that that the internationally recognized greek cypriot government on cyprus is set to join the eu in 2004 .
earlier on friday the turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash accused the european union of seeking to build a " christian fortress " around turkey and effectively ruled out a deal to reunite cyprus at the summit .
" the european union ’ s interest is to delay turkey and to take cyprus , to possess cyprus and to build something like a christian fortress around turkey , " he told a news conference in the turkish capital of ankara .
will any deal on cyprus be reached at all ?
however it remains unclear whether the summit will see any kind of agreement at all between the greeks and cypriots .
greek cypriot attorney general alecos markides told cyprus television from copenhagen that there was no need for any letter of intent .
" if they are committing themselves and they have told de soto -lrb- u.n. envoy -rrb- they are to cooperate , we don ’ t need letters of intent or anything like that . "
even u.n. secretary-general kofi anan acknowledged on friday that a deal to reunite cyprus would not be reached at the eu summit in copenhagen .
" we were very close , and i was very hopeful that we could get an agreement , and i recall telling -lrb- turkish leader tayyip -rrb- erdogan that like an old soccer player like himself , the games is not over until the final whistle , and it looks as if we are not going to get there , " anan said .
cyprus has been a divided island since a turkish invasion in 1974 prompted by a brief greek-inspired coup in nicosia .
the self-declared turkish republic of northern cyprus , which accounts for about 18 percent of the island ’ s 750,000-strong population is only recognized by turkey .
the eu has always maintained that in the absence of a settlement to unite the island , it would take in only the internationally recognized greek cypriot part of the island , with which it has been negotiating .
historic deal clinched with poland meanwhile the eu had better luck with another obstacle plaguing enlargement talks in recent months .
a danish presidency official announced on friday that all 10 candidates had accepted financial packages at the end of the two-day summit in copenhagen .
" we have a deal , " the official told reuters after swedish prime minister goran persson and polish finance minister grzegorz kolodko confirmed that poland , the biggest and most difficult candidate , had accepted a financial settlement .
german chancellor gerhard schröder had earlier said that a solution had been found to give poland a special cashflow facility for its years of eu membership without raising the overall cost of enlargement .
the eu had proposed reshuffling funds from various sources to give poland about a billion extra euros in 2005 and 6 .
that money would then have been deducted from eu aid to warsaw in following years .
the polish acceptance of the renewed offer came after agonizingly long-drawn out negotiations which dragged the summit into overtime .

turkish cypriots diplomats said on friday that they were prepared to sign a " letter of intent " with greek cypriots to discuss a u.n. plan to reunite their divided mediterranean island .
the u.n. plan forsees a state based on two largely autonomous greek and turkish zones and calls for an agreement by late february followed by referendums on both sides .
the " letter of intent " however is a diluted version of what eu leaders were hoping would be the inking of a framework agreement at the copenhagen summit by both sides .
a " christian fortress " around europe ?
earlier turkish leaders reacted angrily to the eu ’ s proposal of a december 2004 review of turkey ’ s implementation of reforms and if successful , a date for accession talks in 2005 .
they are also smarting that that the internationally recognized greek cypriot government on cyprus is set to join the eu in 2004 .
earlier on friday the turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash accused the european union of seeking to build a " christian fortress " around turkey and effectively ruled out a deal to reunite cyprus at the summit .
" the european union ’ s interest is to delay turkey and to take cyprus , to possess cyprus and to build something like a christian fortress around turkey , " he told a news conference in the turkish capital of ankara .
will any deal on cyprus be reached at all ?
however it remains unclear whether the summit will see any kind of agreement at all between the greeks and cypriots .
greek cypriot attorney general alecos markides told cyprus television from copenhagen that there was no need for any letter of intent .
" if they are committing themselves and they have told de soto -lrb- u.n. envoy -rrb- they are to cooperate , we don ’ t need letters of intent or anything like that . "
even u.n. secretary-general kofi anan acknowledged on friday that a deal to reunite cyprus would not be reached at the eu summit in copenhagen .
" we were very close , and i was very hopeful that we could get an agreement , and i recall telling -lrb- turkish leader tayyip -rrb- erdogan that like an old soccer player like himself , the games is not over until the final whistle , and it looks as if we are not going to get there , " anan said .
cyprus has been a divided island since a turkish invasion in 1974 prompted by a brief greek-inspired coup in nicosia .
the self-declared turkish republic of northern cyprus , which accounts for about 18 percent of the island ’ s 750,000-strong population is only recognized by turkey .
the eu has always maintained that in the absence of a settlement to unite the island , it would take in only the internationally recognized greek cypriot part of the island , with which it has been negotiating .
historic deal clinched with poland meanwhile the eu had better luck with another obstacle plaguing enlargement talks in recent months .
a danish presidency official announced on friday that all 10 candidates had accepted financial packages at the end of the two-day summit in copenhagen .
" we have a deal , " the official told reuters after swedish prime minister goran persson and polish finance minister grzegorz kolodko confirmed that poland , the biggest and most difficult candidate , had accepted a financial settlement .
german chancellor gerhard schröder had earlier said that a solution had been found to give poland a special cashflow facility for its years of eu membership without raising the overall cost of enlargement .
the eu had proposed reshuffling funds from various sources to give poland about a billion extra euros in 2005 and 6 .
that money would then have been deducted from eu aid to warsaw in following years .
the polish acceptance of the renewed offer came after agonizingly long-drawn out negotiations which dragged the summit into overtime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.12.2002 bearing the precious burden of enlargement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indefatigable advocate of the european project : günter verheugen the success of the eu 's most ambitious project - the ' big bang ' expansion to include ten new countries , depends on günter verheugen , the first , and possibly the last , eu commissioner for enlargement . it 's been one of the most difficult months of günter verheugen 's career .
since the irish gave the go-ahead for eu enlargement in october , the fifty-eight year old has been working round the clock to try to secure a peace deal in cyprus , find a way forward for turkey 's candidacy , keep poland 's financial expectations in check and persuade reluctant eu members that for forty billion euros , they 're getting enlargement on the cheap .
even as the enlargement project was poised to enter the final stages in copenhagen , commissioner verheugen was still at it - urging participants to show political courage and strong leadership .
european expansion must take place " now or never " , he told german television .
" a failure in copenhagen or a delay could have serious effects on public opinion in the future member states . "
the jewel in the crown for verheugen , the copenhagen summit represents his greatest achievement as enlargement commissioner .
" nothing more can go wrong , " he says .
" when it 's all over , i 'll feel an enormous sense of relief . "
this is about as close to sentimentality as verheugen gets .
even after succeeding in closing what looked like an impossible gap between the member states and accession countries ahead of the copenhagen meeting , the commissioner was insisting that it was still too soon for celebrations .
nor is verheugen inclined to take all the credit for creating an expanded europe .
" it 's a structure made up of many thousands of individual bricks , " he says .
verheugen sees himself as an architect , but not a miracle-worker .
challenges in office for four years , verheugen has complained that his is a lonely job .
that 's hardly surprising , given that he 's spent more time on the road , travelling between the eu candidate countries and the fifteen member states , than back home in brussels .
but the white-haired , thick-spectacled verheugen has no doubts about what he 's doing .
the peoples of central and eastern europe must be welcomed into the family of european democracies , he says , in order to close a historical chapter during which they were persecuted by oppressive totalitarian regimes .
maintaining enthusiasm for the european project within the eu as well as in the candidate countries has been one of the biggest challenges verheugen has faced as commissioner .
he 's had to work hard to convince eu members that the accession countries are doing their best to implement reforms .
all the while , verheugen sees that the candidate countries are losing patience , and they 're no longer prepared to accept membership at any price .
he 's issued a stern warning to poland , the czech republic and hungary to keep their demands in check , saying " the eu is n't an automatic teller machine .
you do n't just stick in your membership card and expect money to come out the bottom " .
getting eu members to agree on the hefty enlargement budget has been just as difficult .
verheugen has appealed to the member states to show more generosity , pushing the benefits he argues will come from an expanded european economic zone and new export markets .
a party man verheugen 's skills in diplomacy have been developed over a long political career . born in germany in 1944 , just before the end of wwii , he studied history and worked for a short time as a journalist before entering politics .
he became federal party manager of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- at the age of thirty-two .
five years later , having helped the fdp achieve its best result ever in national elections , he switched to the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
it was a difficult time for verheugen .
the son of a small-town banker , he was not welcomed by some in the spd , who never forgave him for his prior allegiance to the liberal democrats .
nevertheless , in 1993 , verheugen became the spd 's federal party manager , an important step in his political career .
the chance of a lifetime after gerhard schröder 's election victory in 1998 , verheugen had hoped to get the job of defence minister in his new cabinet .
instead , he was sent to brussels as foreign policy advisor , and a year later took up the post of eu commissioner responsible for enlargement .
verheugen has described the move as a " chance which only comes along once in a lifetime ... to do something that has a lasting impact and affects the lives of entire peoples " .
probably the biggest test of günter verheugen 's career - the question of turkey 's membership - still lies ahead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.12.2002 turkey gets its date with the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan , left with rasmussen , had hoped for an earlier date the eu said turkey could begin negotiations for entry at the end of 2004 , more than one year later than ankara had hoped for .
turkish officials are upset with the decision . during evening discussions at the eu expansion summit thursday , european leaders and turkish negotiators were finally able to reach agreement on the elusive date on which turkey could begin negotiating for eu entry . danish prime minister anders fogh rassmussen , whose country is leading the summit , announced last night that turkey would begin negotiations for entry at the end of 2004 . the news was received with anger by turkish prime minister abdullah gül , who said the eu did n't appreciate all the efforts turkey has made so far . " this is impossible to accept , " gül said , after meeting with british prime minister tony blair , who supported an earlier negotiation date for turkey . turkey had been lobbying hard for eu entry since passing a host of human rights legislation last summer .
the eu first declared the country a candidate in 1999 .
since then , ankara had hoped it could join the union with the ten other eastern european and mediterranean countries in 2004 . the past few weeks have seen an intense lobbying effort in european capitals on the part of turkish leader recep tayyip erdogan .
though well received in italy , spain and the uk , erdogan ’ s lobbying seemed to annoy other countries . “ many found the -lrb- turkish lobbying -rrb- regrettable and unacceptable , ” said italian prime minister silvio berlusconi . the us , which will need turkey ’ s help in a possible iraq invasion , had also urged the eu to name a date .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.12.2002 rocket failure a setback for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ariane 5 rocket crashed , bringing the european satellite launch industry down with it the failure of ariane 5 has dealt a severe blow to the european satellite launch program .
european space chiefs are now trying to come up with answers to the baffling fiasco . the european space industry is still mystified about what caused the new ariane 5-esca rocket to fail this week , less than three minutes after lift-off .
the new heavy-payload version of the rocket strayed off course just 96 seconds into its maiden flight on wednesday and had to be blown up , ditching its $ 600 million payload of satellites into the atlantic ocean 800 kilometres off the coast of french guiana .
engineers and officials from the european space agency say the problem occurred in the cooling circuit of one of the rocket 's main engines .
a change in engine speed around 180 seconds after take-off caused the launcher to " demonstrate erratic behaviour " .
wednesday 's explosion was the fourth failure of an ariane 5 in fourteen missions .
it was carrying a 10-tonne cargo , heavier than any previous version .
on board were the hot bird 7 eutelsat television broadcast satellite and stentor , a telecommunications satellite developed by the french space agency at a cost of over $ 385 million .
inquiry arianespace , the company that designed the rocket , has announced the establishment of an independent inquiry board to investigate the failure and try to ensure future launches are not affected .
arianespace chief executive jean-yves le gall said the inquiry would begin early next week .
" we will have to clearly explain what happened and if it will have consequences on the ariane 5 launcher in its basic version , " le gall told reporters .
" second , it will tell us when we can resume ariane 5 flights . "
rosetta mission in danger experts say the ariane 5 could be out of action for several months , casting doubt over the mission of the comet-chasing rosetta probe , due to blast off on january 12 .
rosetta , estimated to have cost more than $ 1 billion , is to make an eight-year journey to meet the comet wirtanen , which it will study for nearly two years .
the timing of rosetta 's launch is critical because of its complex trajectory around the planet mars .
setback for europe the ariane 5 failure comes as a huge blow to the european industry at a time when the satellite launch market is in a depression .
demand has been affected by a slowdown in the world telecommunications industry , with fewer commercial satellites being ordered than in previous years .
overproduction of rockets has also caused prices to fall thirty percent lower than they were a decade ago .
in addition , several competitors to ariane 5 have emerged in recent months .
boeing 's delta 4 and lockheed martin 's atlas 5 have both been well-received since their introduction .
arianespace 's dominant position in the commercial market now looks to be seriously threatened , with ariane 5 's failure expected to cause customers to look even more favourably on its rivals .
insurance woes some industry analysts have predicted that the market for satellite launchers could experience an up-turn in the second part of the decade , when satellites will have to be replaced .
they also say higher demand for broadband internet services could translate to a need for more satellite launchers .
but the fallout from wednesday 's failure , already being felt throughout the satellite launch industry , will be lasting .
insurance companies are saying they 'll be forced to increase premiums .
ariane 5 crashed just ten days after the failure of the astra 1k telecoms satellite launch , capping an already bad year for commercial insurers .
consultants say the situation could force some insurers to quit the space industry altogether .
another attempt the next arianespace mission , flight 156 , which will use ariane 5 's predecessor , ariane 4 to orbit the nss-6 satellite , has been set for the evening of tuesday , december 17 .
the arianespace consortium has stopped production of the ariane 4 and the last rocket has been booked for launch in february . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's galileo runs into rough weather europe ’ s ambitious 3.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.14 billion -rrb- flagship galileo satellite navigation programme is floundering on account of squabbling between germany and italy over the leadership of the european space agency .

rosetta mission in danger experts say the ariane 5 could be out of action for several months , casting doubt over the mission of the comet-chasing rosetta probe , due to blast off on january 12 .
rosetta , estimated to have cost more than $ 1 billion , is to make an eight-year journey to meet the comet wirtanen , which it will study for nearly two years .
the timing of rosetta 's launch is critical because of its complex trajectory around the planet mars .
setback for europe the ariane 5 failure comes as a huge blow to the european industry at a time when the satellite launch market is in a depression .

european space chiefs are now trying to come up with answers to the baffling fiasco . the european space industry is still mystified about what caused the new ariane 5-esca rocket to fail this week , less than three minutes after lift-off .
the new heavy-payload version of the rocket strayed off course just 96 seconds into its maiden flight on wednesday and had to be blown up , ditching its $ 600 million payload of satellites into the atlantic ocean 800 kilometres off the coast of french guiana .
engineers and officials from the european space agency say the problem occurred in the cooling circuit of one of the rocket 's main engines .
a change in engine speed around 180 seconds after take-off caused the launcher to " demonstrate erratic behaviour " .
wednesday 's explosion was the fourth failure of an ariane 5 in fourteen missions .
it was carrying a 10-tonne cargo , heavier than any previous version .

overproduction of rockets has also caused prices to fall thirty percent lower than they were a decade ago .
in addition , several competitors to ariane 5 have emerged in recent months .
boeing 's delta 4 and lockheed martin 's atlas 5 have both been well-received since their introduction .
arianespace 's dominant position in the commercial market now looks to be seriously threatened , with ariane 5 's failure expected to cause customers to look even more favourably on its rivals .
insurance woes some industry analysts have predicted that the market for satellite launchers could experience an up-turn in the second part of the decade , when satellites will have to be replaced .
they also say higher demand for broadband internet services could translate to a need for more satellite launchers .
but the fallout from wednesday 's failure , already being felt throughout the satellite launch industry , will be lasting .
insurance companies are saying they 'll be forced to increase premiums .
ariane 5 crashed just ten days after the failure of the astra 1k telecoms satellite launch , capping an already bad year for commercial insurers .
consultants say the situation could force some insurers to quit the space industry altogether .
another attempt the next arianespace mission , flight 156 , which will use ariane 5 's predecessor , ariane 4 to orbit the nss-6 satellite , has been set for the evening of tuesday , december 17 .
the arianespace consortium has stopped production of the ariane 4 and the last rocket has been booked for launch in february . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's galileo runs into rough weather europe ’ s ambitious 3.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.14 billion -rrb- flagship galileo satellite navigation programme is floundering on account of squabbling between germany and italy over the leadership of the european space agency .

1 introduction of the euro .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the president of the european central bank takes stock of the euro 's success . wim duisenberg has been president of the european central bank since 1997 .
during his five years there , duisenberg has overseen the smooth introduction of europe 's common currency , the euro , and managed interest rates , prices and inflation in the 12 euro zone countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president wim duisenberg recently , duisenberg has been criticized for not cutting interest rates as agressively as his american counterpart , alan greenspan of the federal reserve bank . he also wants members to maintain the rigid guidelines set in the euro stability pact , which prohibits countries to allow their deficit spending to rise over 3 percent of gross domestic product . in a recent interview with dw-radio , duisenberg took stock of the euro 's progress during the current year and offered frank criticism of a handful of member states for not keeping a tight- enough hold on their budget pursestrings .
it 's been nearly one year since the euro was introduced in europe .
how would you evaluate the year ?
for me , of course , the euro has already existed for sometime longer .
but it 's true the notes and coins have just been introduced .
i would evaluate that unambiguously as a success .
how has the new currency encouraged countries in the euro zone to cooperate more effectively ?
that is a slow process , but having one single currency has its effects on all areas of monetary policy - not only on fiscal and social policy , but even on foreign policy .
it brings countries that have the single currency closer together and it does necessitate ever-closer cooperation .
would you say the euro zone has brought nations together politically ?
that 's also a process .
it is working in that direction .
it is working to bring them closer together and it also works already now towards those countries that are about to become members of the european union - particularly in central and eastern europe .
they will not immediately adopt the euro , but the euro is already a force there .
it exerts its influence in bringing those countries closer to the europe they will one day be a part of .
do you see the candidate countries joining the euro zone ?
they undoubtably will .
they will first sign the accession treaty .
then a process will start involving a number of treaties that will have to be ratified by all the parliaments involved .
but we are already intensively working at the european central bank to integrate them into our work .
this involves working with their central banks to prepare them for the new situation .
they will have to adjust their legal frameworks in various fields .
the financial sector has to be adjusted and adapted - and that , too , is a long , drawn-out process .
but it could happen within five to seven years .
a central part of the treaty would no doubt be the stability pact , the criteria now in place for current euro zone countries .
those criteria are now being discussed in european capitals - especially the three-percent cap on deficit spending .
what do you think about suggestion criteria should be softened , especially in light of germany 's economic troubles ?
i would be very much against it .
the criteria are only just in place .
it 's natural that there are times when it really bites and causes difficulties for some european countries .
then countries talk about changing it .
but i 'm one who thinks you should never change the rules in the middle of the game .
the fact that some countries are now having difficulty meeting the criteria - like germany , france and italy .
it is precisely because of the fact that in the recent past , when everything was going well , they did n't grasp the opportunitiy to better consolidate their public finances .
now , because they have n't done that at that time , they are sitting on their blisters .
but that 's no reason to change the rules .
it 's all the more reason to finally do what should have been done long before .
out of the 12 euro zone countries , eight have already reached that goal .
do you feel undermined by comments by people like european commission president romano prodi , who severely criticizes the stability pact 's guidelines ?
well , i ca n't feel undermined because the ecb , though we are standing and shouting from the sidelines , is not part of the stability pact as such .
it 's the european commission that is the stability pact 's guardian .
we support the european commission in in every respect in their function as the guardian of the stability and growth pact .
but as for mr. prodi 's criticism , let me simply say that i do not share his views and would not have said what he said .
there has also been criticism in europe and america about the reluctance of the ecb to lower interest rates along the lines of the federal reserve bank under federal reserve chairman alan greenspan .
is this criticism justified ?
i think not .
we have interest rates at low levels which have not been seen in europe for the last 40 or 50 years .
the interest rate levels we have are being determined exclusively on the basis of what we think is best for the euro area and not for any other consideration .
last week we lowered our interest rate even further .
liquidity , money in the euro zone is ample .
in no way is the monetary policy stance an inhibition for the resumption of growth and growth of employment .
does that mean that at some point in the future lower rates could not be an economic tool ?
it 's sometimes overestimated what monetary policy can do and what it can not do .
our main goal is to safeguard price stability , thereby giving consumers and investors confidence in the future .
it 's mainly the lack of confidence at the moment which comes for other reasons - all the uncertainties - that we are going through a period of very slow economic development .
we have to rebuild confidence and that takes time .
you can lose confidence in a day , but to regain it may take a year .
you mentioned lack of confidence and instability .
how do you think a war against iraq would affect the euro ?
i ca n't possibly speculate on that .
the main impact we might see is on the oil market and oil prices .
that 's one of the uncertainties that hangs over our heads , but you ca n't possibly speculate to what extent it might have an impact on the euro .
as far as oil prices are concerned , if they rise suddenly , that would have an impact on our internal price stability .
that would be the main impact .
if it had a lasting impact , we would react .
if it had only a short-term impact , we would do nothing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

well , i ca n't feel undermined because the ecb , though we are standing and shouting from the sidelines , is not part of the stability pact as such .
it 's the european commission that is the stability pact 's guardian .

i think not .
we have interest rates at low levels which have not been seen in europe for the last 40 or 50 years .

1 introduction of the euro .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the president of the european central bank takes stock of the euro 's success . wim duisenberg has been president of the european central bank since 1997 .
during his five years there , duisenberg has overseen the smooth introduction of europe 's common currency , the euro , and managed interest rates , prices and inflation in the 12 euro zone countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president wim duisenberg recently , duisenberg has been criticized for not cutting interest rates as agressively as his american counterpart , alan greenspan of the federal reserve bank . he also wants members to maintain the rigid guidelines set in the euro stability pact , which prohibits countries to allow their deficit spending to rise over 3 percent of gross domestic product . in a recent interview with dw-radio , duisenberg took stock of the euro 's progress during the current year and offered frank criticism of a handful of member states for not keeping a tight- enough hold on their budget pursestrings .
it 's been nearly one year since the euro was introduced in europe .
how would you evaluate the year ?
for me , of course , the euro has already existed for sometime longer .
but it 's true the notes and coins have just been introduced .
i would evaluate that unambiguously as a success .
how has the new currency encouraged countries in the euro zone to cooperate more effectively ?
that is a slow process , but having one single currency has its effects on all areas of monetary policy - not only on fiscal and social policy , but even on foreign policy .
it brings countries that have the single currency closer together and it does necessitate ever-closer cooperation .
would you say the euro zone has brought nations together politically ?
that 's also a process .
it is working in that direction .
it is working to bring them closer together and it also works already now towards those countries that are about to become members of the european union - particularly in central and eastern europe .
they will not immediately adopt the euro , but the euro is already a force there .
it exerts its influence in bringing those countries closer to the europe they will one day be a part of .
do you see the candidate countries joining the euro zone ?
they undoubtably will .
they will first sign the accession treaty .
then a process will start involving a number of treaties that will have to be ratified by all the parliaments involved .
but we are already intensively working at the european central bank to integrate them into our work .
this involves working with their central banks to prepare them for the new situation .
they will have to adjust their legal frameworks in various fields .
the financial sector has to be adjusted and adapted - and that , too , is a long , drawn-out process .
but it could happen within five to seven years .
a central part of the treaty would no doubt be the stability pact , the criteria now in place for current euro zone countries .
those criteria are now being discussed in european capitals - especially the three-percent cap on deficit spending .
what do you think about suggestion criteria should be softened , especially in light of germany 's economic troubles ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.12.2002 setbacks and triumphs at eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victorious - danish prime minister rasmussen , left , and german chancellor schröder clinch a deal with poland the eu enlargement summit in copenhagen achieved a breakthrough with poland on tricky financial negotiations , but failed to reach a solution on the precarious issue of the divided island of cyprus . hopes that one of the most troubling issues dodging the eu enlargement project would be resolved at the crucial copenhagen summit have been dashed .
turkish cypriots diplomats said on friday that they were prepared to sign a " letter of intent " with greek cypriots to discuss a u.n. plan to reunite their divided mediterranean island .
the u.n. plan forsees a state based on two largely autonomous greek and turkish zones and calls for an agreement by late february followed by referendums on both sides .
the " letter of intent " however is a diluted version of what eu leaders were hoping would be the inking of a framework agreement at the copenhagen summit by both sides .
a " christian fortress " around europe ?
earlier turkish leaders reacted angrily to the eu ’ s proposal of a december 2004 review of turkey ’ s implementation of reforms and if successful , a date for accession talks in 2005 .
they are also smarting that that the internationally recognized greek cypriot government on cyprus is set to join the eu in 2004 .
earlier on friday the turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash accused the european union of seeking to build a " christian fortress " around turkey and effectively ruled out a deal to reunite cyprus at the summit .
" the european union ’ s interest is to delay turkey and to take cyprus , to possess cyprus and to build something like a christian fortress around turkey , " he told a news conference in the turkish capital of ankara .
will any deal on cyprus be reached at all ?
however it remains unclear whether the summit will see any kind of agreement at all between the greeks and cypriots .
greek cypriot attorney general alecos markides told cyprus television from copenhagen that there was no need for any letter of intent .
" if they are committing themselves and they have told de soto -lrb- u.n. envoy -rrb- they are to cooperate , we don ’ t need letters of intent or anything like that . "

the eu had proposed reshuffling funds from various sources to give poland about a billion extra euros in 2005 and 6 .
that money would then have been deducted from eu aid to warsaw in following years .
the polish acceptance of the renewed offer came after agonizingly long-drawn out negotiations which dragged the summit into overtime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.12.2002 setbacks and triumphs at eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victorious - danish prime minister rasmussen , left , and german chancellor schröder clinch a deal with poland the eu enlargement summit in copenhagen achieved a breakthrough with poland on tricky financial negotiations , but failed to reach a solution on the precarious issue of the divided island of cyprus . hopes that one of the most troubling issues dodging the eu enlargement project would be resolved at the crucial copenhagen summit have been dashed .
turkish cypriots diplomats said on friday that they were prepared to sign a " letter of intent " with greek cypriots to discuss a u.n. plan to reunite their divided mediterranean island .
the u.n. plan forsees a state based on two largely autonomous greek and turkish zones and calls for an agreement by late february followed by referendums on both sides .
the " letter of intent " however is a diluted version of what eu leaders were hoping would be the inking of a framework agreement at the copenhagen summit by both sides .
a " christian fortress " around europe ?
earlier turkish leaders reacted angrily to the eu ’ s proposal of a december 2004 review of turkey ’ s implementation of reforms and if successful , a date for accession talks in 2005 .
they are also smarting that that the internationally recognized greek cypriot government on cyprus is set to join the eu in 2004 .
earlier on friday the turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash accused the european union of seeking to build a " christian fortress " around turkey and effectively ruled out a deal to reunite cyprus at the summit .
" the european union ’ s interest is to delay turkey and to take cyprus , to possess cyprus and to build something like a christian fortress around turkey , " he told a news conference in the turkish capital of ankara .
will any deal on cyprus be reached at all ?
however it remains unclear whether the summit will see any kind of agreement at all between the greeks and cypriots .
greek cypriot attorney general alecos markides told cyprus television from copenhagen that there was no need for any letter of intent .
" if they are committing themselves and they have told de soto -lrb- u.n. envoy -rrb- they are to cooperate , we don ’ t need letters of intent or anything like that . "
even u.n. secretary-general kofi anan acknowledged on friday that a deal to reunite cyprus would not be reached at the eu summit in copenhagen .
" we were very close , and i was very hopeful that we could get an agreement , and i recall telling -lrb- turkish leader tayyip -rrb- erdogan that like an old soccer player like himself , the games is not over until the final whistle , and it looks as if we are not going to get there , " anan said .
cyprus has been a divided island since a turkish invasion in 1974 prompted by a brief greek-inspired coup in nicosia .
the self-declared turkish republic of northern cyprus , which accounts for about 18 percent of the island ’ s 750,000-strong population is only recognized by turkey .
the eu has always maintained that in the absence of a settlement to unite the island , it would take in only the internationally recognized greek cypriot part of the island , with which it has been negotiating .
historic deal clinched with poland meanwhile the eu had better luck with another obstacle plaguing enlargement talks in recent months .
a danish presidency official announced on friday that all 10 candidates had accepted financial packages at the end of the two-day summit in copenhagen .
" we have a deal , " the official told reuters after swedish prime minister goran persson and polish finance minister grzegorz kolodko confirmed that poland , the biggest and most difficult candidate , had accepted a financial settlement .
german chancellor gerhard schröder had earlier said that a solution had been found to give poland a special cashflow facility for its years of eu membership without raising the overall cost of enlargement .
the eu had proposed reshuffling funds from various sources to give poland about a billion extra euros in 2005 and 6 .
that money would then have been deducted from eu aid to warsaw in following years .
the polish acceptance of the renewed offer came after agonizingly long-drawn out negotiations which dragged the summit into overtime .

german chancellor gerhard schröder had earlier said that a solution had been found to give poland a special cashflow facility for its years of eu membership without raising the overall cost of enlargement .
the eu had proposed reshuffling funds from various sources to give poland about a billion extra euros in 2005 and 6 .
that money would then have been deducted from eu aid to warsaw in following years .
the polish acceptance of the renewed offer came after agonizingly long-drawn out negotiations which dragged the summit into overtime .
however the deal with poland brings to a close one of the trickiest negotiation chapters in the enlargement project , which often threatened to jeopardize it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey gets its date with the eu the eu said turkey could begin negotiations for entry at the end of 2004 , more than one year later than ankara had hoped for .
turkish officials are upset with the decision .

1 introduction of the euro .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the president of the european central bank takes stock of the euro 's success . wim duisenberg has been president of the european central bank since 1997 .
during his five years there , duisenberg has overseen the smooth introduction of europe 's common currency , the euro , and managed interest rates , prices and inflation in the 12 euro zone countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president wim duisenberg recently , duisenberg has been criticized for not cutting interest rates as agressively as his american counterpart , alan greenspan of the federal reserve bank . he also wants members to maintain the rigid guidelines set in the euro stability pact , which prohibits countries to allow their deficit spending to rise over 3 percent of gross domestic product . in a recent interview with dw-radio , duisenberg took stock of the euro 's progress during the current year and offered frank criticism of a handful of member states for not keeping a tight- enough hold on their budget pursestrings .
it 's been nearly one year since the euro was introduced in europe .
how would you evaluate the year ?
for me , of course , the euro has already existed for sometime longer .
but it 's true the notes and coins have just been introduced .
i would evaluate that unambiguously as a success .
how has the new currency encouraged countries in the euro zone to cooperate more effectively ?
that is a slow process , but having one single currency has its effects on all areas of monetary policy - not only on fiscal and social policy , but even on foreign policy .
it brings countries that have the single currency closer together and it does necessitate ever-closer cooperation .
would you say the euro zone has brought nations together politically ?
that 's also a process .
it is working in that direction .
it is working to bring them closer together and it also works already now towards those countries that are about to become members of the european union - particularly in central and eastern europe .
they will not immediately adopt the euro , but the euro is already a force there .
it exerts its influence in bringing those countries closer to the europe they will one day be a part of .
do you see the candidate countries joining the euro zone ?
they undoubtably will .
they will first sign the accession treaty .
then a process will start involving a number of treaties that will have to be ratified by all the parliaments involved .
but we are already intensively working at the european central bank to integrate them into our work .
this involves working with their central banks to prepare them for the new situation .
they will have to adjust their legal frameworks in various fields .
the financial sector has to be adjusted and adapted - and that , too , is a long , drawn-out process .
but it could happen within five to seven years .
a central part of the treaty would no doubt be the stability pact , the criteria now in place for current euro zone countries .
those criteria are now being discussed in european capitals - especially the three-percent cap on deficit spending .
what do you think about suggestion criteria should be softened , especially in light of germany 's economic troubles ?
i would be very much against it .
the criteria are only just in place .
it 's natural that there are times when it really bites and causes difficulties for some european countries .
then countries talk about changing it .
but i 'm one who thinks you should never change the rules in the middle of the game .
the fact that some countries are now having difficulty meeting the criteria - like germany , france and italy .
it is precisely because of the fact that in the recent past , when everything was going well , they did n't grasp the opportunitiy to better consolidate their public finances .
now , because they have n't done that at that time , they are sitting on their blisters .
but that 's no reason to change the rules .
it 's all the more reason to finally do what should have been done long before .
out of the 12 euro zone countries , eight have already reached that goal .
do you feel undermined by comments by people like european commission president romano prodi , who severely criticizes the stability pact 's guidelines ?
well , i ca n't feel undermined because the ecb , though we are standing and shouting from the sidelines , is not part of the stability pact as such .
it 's the european commission that is the stability pact 's guardian .
we support the european commission in in every respect in their function as the guardian of the stability and growth pact .
but as for mr. prodi 's criticism , let me simply say that i do not share his views and would not have said what he said .
there has also been criticism in europe and america about the reluctance of the ecb to lower interest rates along the lines of the federal reserve bank under federal reserve chairman alan greenspan .
is this criticism justified ?
i think not .
we have interest rates at low levels which have not been seen in europe for the last 40 or 50 years .
the interest rate levels we have are being determined exclusively on the basis of what we think is best for the euro area and not for any other consideration .
last week we lowered our interest rate even further .
liquidity , money in the euro zone is ample .
in no way is the monetary policy stance an inhibition for the resumption of growth and growth of employment .
does that mean that at some point in the future lower rates could not be an economic tool ?
it 's sometimes overestimated what monetary policy can do and what it can not do .
our main goal is to safeguard price stability , thereby giving consumers and investors confidence in the future .
it 's mainly the lack of confidence at the moment which comes for other reasons - all the uncertainties - that we are going through a period of very slow economic development .
we have to rebuild confidence and that takes time .
you can lose confidence in a day , but to regain it may take a year .
you mentioned lack of confidence and instability .
how do you think a war against iraq would affect the euro ?
i ca n't possibly speculate on that .
the main impact we might see is on the oil market and oil prices .
that 's one of the uncertainties that hangs over our heads , but you ca n't possibly speculate to what extent it might have an impact on the euro .
as far as oil prices are concerned , if they rise suddenly , that would have an impact on our internal price stability .
that would be the main impact .
if it had a lasting impact , we would react .
if it had only a short-term impact , we would do nothing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

there has also been criticism in europe and america about the reluctance of the ecb to lower interest rates along the lines of the federal reserve bank under federal reserve chairman alan greenspan .
is this criticism justified ?
i think not .
we have interest rates at low levels which have not been seen in europe for the last 40 or 50 years .
the interest rate levels we have are being determined exclusively on the basis of what we think is best for the euro area and not for any other consideration .
last week we lowered our interest rate even further .
liquidity , money in the euro zone is ample .
in no way is the monetary policy stance an inhibition for the resumption of growth and growth of employment .
does that mean that at some point in the future lower rates could not be an economic tool ?
it 's sometimes overestimated what monetary policy can do and what it can not do .
our main goal is to safeguard price stability , thereby giving consumers and investors confidence in the future .
it 's mainly the lack of confidence at the moment which comes for other reasons - all the uncertainties - that we are going through a period of very slow economic development .
we have to rebuild confidence and that takes time .
you can lose confidence in a day , but to regain it may take a year .
you mentioned lack of confidence and instability .
how do you think a war against iraq would affect the euro ?
i ca n't possibly speculate on that .
the main impact we might see is on the oil market and oil prices .
that 's one of the uncertainties that hangs over our heads , but you ca n't possibly speculate to what extent it might have an impact on the euro .
as far as oil prices are concerned , if they rise suddenly , that would have an impact on our internal price stability .
that would be the main impact .
if it had a lasting impact , we would react .
if it had only a short-term impact , we would do nothing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

european space chiefs are now trying to come up with answers to the baffling fiasco . the european space industry is still mystified about what caused the new ariane 5-esca rocket to fail this week , less than three minutes after lift-off .
the new heavy-payload version of the rocket strayed off course just 96 seconds into its maiden flight on wednesday and had to be blown up , ditching its $ 600 million payload of satellites into the atlantic ocean 800 kilometres off the coast of french guiana .
engineers and officials from the european space agency say the problem occurred in the cooling circuit of one of the rocket 's main engines .
a change in engine speed around 180 seconds after take-off caused the launcher to " demonstrate erratic behaviour " .
wednesday 's explosion was the fourth failure of an ariane 5 in fourteen missions .
it was carrying a 10-tonne cargo , heavier than any previous version .
on board were the hot bird 7 eutelsat television broadcast satellite and stentor , a telecommunications satellite developed by the french space agency at a cost of over $ 385 million .
inquiry arianespace , the company that designed the rocket , has announced the establishment of an independent inquiry board to investigate the failure and try to ensure future launches are not affected .
arianespace chief executive jean-yves le gall said the inquiry would begin early next week .
" we will have to clearly explain what happened and if it will have consequences on the ariane 5 launcher in its basic version , " le gall told reporters .
" second , it will tell us when we can resume ariane 5 flights . "
rosetta mission in danger experts say the ariane 5 could be out of action for several months , casting doubt over the mission of the comet-chasing rosetta probe , due to blast off on january 12 .
rosetta , estimated to have cost more than $ 1 billion , is to make an eight-year journey to meet the comet wirtanen , which it will study for nearly two years .
the timing of rosetta 's launch is critical because of its complex trajectory around the planet mars .
setback for europe the ariane 5 failure comes as a huge blow to the european industry at a time when the satellite launch market is in a depression .
demand has been affected by a slowdown in the world telecommunications industry , with fewer commercial satellites being ordered than in previous years .
overproduction of rockets has also caused prices to fall thirty percent lower than they were a decade ago .
in addition , several competitors to ariane 5 have emerged in recent months .
boeing 's delta 4 and lockheed martin 's atlas 5 have both been well-received since their introduction .
arianespace 's dominant position in the commercial market now looks to be seriously threatened , with ariane 5 's failure expected to cause customers to look even more favourably on its rivals .
insurance woes some industry analysts have predicted that the market for satellite launchers could experience an up-turn in the second part of the decade , when satellites will have to be replaced .
they also say higher demand for broadband internet services could translate to a need for more satellite launchers .
but the fallout from wednesday 's failure , already being felt throughout the satellite launch industry , will be lasting .
insurance companies are saying they 'll be forced to increase premiums .
ariane 5 crashed just ten days after the failure of the astra 1k telecoms satellite launch , capping an already bad year for commercial insurers .
consultants say the situation could force some insurers to quit the space industry altogether .

turkish officials are upset with the decision . during evening discussions at the eu expansion summit thursday , european leaders and turkish negotiators were finally able to reach agreement on the elusive date on which turkey could begin negotiating for eu entry . danish prime minister anders fogh rassmussen , whose country is leading the summit , announced last night that turkey would begin negotiations for entry at the end of 2004 . the news was received with anger by turkish prime minister abdullah gül , who said the eu did n't appreciate all the efforts turkey has made so far . " this is impossible to accept , " gül said , after meeting with british prime minister tony blair , who supported an earlier negotiation date for turkey . turkey had been lobbying hard for eu entry since passing a host of human rights legislation last summer .
the eu first declared the country a candidate in 1999 .
since then , ankara had hoped it could join the union with the ten other eastern european and mediterranean countries in 2004 . the past few weeks have seen an intense lobbying effort in european capitals on the part of turkish leader recep tayyip erdogan .
though well received in italy , spain and the uk , erdogan ’ s lobbying seemed to annoy other countries . “ many found the -lrb- turkish lobbying -rrb- regrettable and unacceptable , ” said italian prime minister silvio berlusconi . the us , which will need turkey ’ s help in a possible iraq invasion , had also urged the eu to name a date .
the eventual compromise bore strong resemblance to a franco-german proposal to get turkey a date in 2005 should it continue to pass human rights legislation in line with eu membership requirements .
the turkish delegation to the copenhagen summit told reporters that they want to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder and french leader jacques chirac .
they promised to continue to fight to change the date . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union dw-world 's main eu dossier 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

turkish officials are upset with the decision . during evening discussions at the eu expansion summit thursday , european leaders and turkish negotiators were finally able to reach agreement on the elusive date on which turkey could begin negotiating for eu entry . danish prime minister anders fogh rassmussen , whose country is leading the summit , announced last night that turkey would begin negotiations for entry at the end of 2004 . the news was received with anger by turkish prime minister abdullah gül , who said the eu did n't appreciate all the efforts turkey has made so far . " this is impossible to accept , " gül said , after meeting with british prime minister tony blair , who supported an earlier negotiation date for turkey . turkey had been lobbying hard for eu entry since passing a host of human rights legislation last summer .

since then , ankara had hoped it could join the union with the ten other eastern european and mediterranean countries in 2004 . the past few weeks have seen an intense lobbying effort in european capitals on the part of turkish leader recep tayyip erdogan .

since the irish gave the go-ahead for eu enlargement in october , the fifty-eight year old has been working round the clock to try to secure a peace deal in cyprus , find a way forward for turkey 's candidacy , keep poland 's financial expectations in check and persuade reluctant eu members that for forty billion euros , they 're getting enlargement on the cheap .
even as the enlargement project was poised to enter the final stages in copenhagen , commissioner verheugen was still at it - urging participants to show political courage and strong leadership .
european expansion must take place " now or never " , he told german television .
" a failure in copenhagen or a delay could have serious effects on public opinion in the future member states . "
the jewel in the crown for verheugen , the copenhagen summit represents his greatest achievement as enlargement commissioner .
" nothing more can go wrong , " he says .
" when it 's all over , i 'll feel an enormous sense of relief . "
this is about as close to sentimentality as verheugen gets .
even after succeeding in closing what looked like an impossible gap between the member states and accession countries ahead of the copenhagen meeting , the commissioner was insisting that it was still too soon for celebrations .
nor is verheugen inclined to take all the credit for creating an expanded europe .
" it 's a structure made up of many thousands of individual bricks , " he says .
verheugen sees himself as an architect , but not a miracle-worker .
challenges in office for four years , verheugen has complained that his is a lonely job .
that 's hardly surprising , given that he 's spent more time on the road , travelling between the eu candidate countries and the fifteen member states , than back home in brussels .
but the white-haired , thick-spectacled verheugen has no doubts about what he 's doing .
the peoples of central and eastern europe must be welcomed into the family of european democracies , he says , in order to close a historical chapter during which they were persecuted by oppressive totalitarian regimes .
maintaining enthusiasm for the european project within the eu as well as in the candidate countries has been one of the biggest challenges verheugen has faced as commissioner .
he 's had to work hard to convince eu members that the accession countries are doing their best to implement reforms .
all the while , verheugen sees that the candidate countries are losing patience , and they 're no longer prepared to accept membership at any price .
he 's issued a stern warning to poland , the czech republic and hungary to keep their demands in check , saying " the eu is n't an automatic teller machine .
you do n't just stick in your membership card and expect money to come out the bottom " .
getting eu members to agree on the hefty enlargement budget has been just as difficult .
verheugen has appealed to the member states to show more generosity , pushing the benefits he argues will come from an expanded european economic zone and new export markets .
a party man verheugen 's skills in diplomacy have been developed over a long political career . born in germany in 1944 , just before the end of wwii , he studied history and worked for a short time as a journalist before entering politics .
he became federal party manager of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- at the age of thirty-two .
five years later , having helped the fdp achieve its best result ever in national elections , he switched to the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
it was a difficult time for verheugen .
the son of a small-town banker , he was not welcomed by some in the spd , who never forgave him for his prior allegiance to the liberal democrats .
nevertheless , in 1993 , verheugen became the spd 's federal party manager , an important step in his political career .
the chance of a lifetime after gerhard schröder 's election victory in 1998 , verheugen had hoped to get the job of defence minister in his new cabinet .
instead , he was sent to brussels as foreign policy advisor , and a year later took up the post of eu commissioner responsible for enlargement .
verheugen has described the move as a " chance which only comes along once in a lifetime ... to do something that has a lasting impact and affects the lives of entire peoples " .
probably the biggest test of günter verheugen 's career - the question of turkey 's membership - still lies ahead .

since the irish gave the go-ahead for eu enlargement in october , the fifty-eight year old has been working round the clock to try to secure a peace deal in cyprus , find a way forward for turkey 's candidacy , keep poland 's financial expectations in check and persuade reluctant eu members that for forty billion euros , they 're getting enlargement on the cheap .
even as the enlargement project was poised to enter the final stages in copenhagen , commissioner verheugen was still at it - urging participants to show political courage and strong leadership .
european expansion must take place " now or never " , he told german television .
" a failure in copenhagen or a delay could have serious effects on public opinion in the future member states . "
the jewel in the crown for verheugen , the copenhagen summit represents his greatest achievement as enlargement commissioner .
" nothing more can go wrong , " he says .
" when it 's all over , i 'll feel an enormous sense of relief . "
this is about as close to sentimentality as verheugen gets .
even after succeeding in closing what looked like an impossible gap between the member states and accession countries ahead of the copenhagen meeting , the commissioner was insisting that it was still too soon for celebrations .
nor is verheugen inclined to take all the credit for creating an expanded europe .
" it 's a structure made up of many thousands of individual bricks , " he says .
verheugen sees himself as an architect , but not a miracle-worker .
challenges in office for four years , verheugen has complained that his is a lonely job .
that 's hardly surprising , given that he 's spent more time on the road , travelling between the eu candidate countries and the fifteen member states , than back home in brussels .
but the white-haired , thick-spectacled verheugen has no doubts about what he 's doing .
the peoples of central and eastern europe must be welcomed into the family of european democracies , he says , in order to close a historical chapter during which they were persecuted by oppressive totalitarian regimes .
maintaining enthusiasm for the european project within the eu as well as in the candidate countries has been one of the biggest challenges verheugen has faced as commissioner .
he 's had to work hard to convince eu members that the accession countries are doing their best to implement reforms .
all the while , verheugen sees that the candidate countries are losing patience , and they 're no longer prepared to accept membership at any price .
he 's issued a stern warning to poland , the czech republic and hungary to keep their demands in check , saying " the eu is n't an automatic teller machine .
you do n't just stick in your membership card and expect money to come out the bottom " .
getting eu members to agree on the hefty enlargement budget has been just as difficult .
verheugen has appealed to the member states to show more generosity , pushing the benefits he argues will come from an expanded european economic zone and new export markets .
a party man verheugen 's skills in diplomacy have been developed over a long political career . born in germany in 1944 , just before the end of wwii , he studied history and worked for a short time as a journalist before entering politics .
he became federal party manager of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- at the age of thirty-two .
five years later , having helped the fdp achieve its best result ever in national elections , he switched to the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
it was a difficult time for verheugen .
the son of a small-town banker , he was not welcomed by some in the spd , who never forgave him for his prior allegiance to the liberal democrats .
nevertheless , in 1993 , verheugen became the spd 's federal party manager , an important step in his political career .
the chance of a lifetime after gerhard schröder 's election victory in 1998 , verheugen had hoped to get the job of defence minister in his new cabinet .
instead , he was sent to brussels as foreign policy advisor , and a year later took up the post of eu commissioner responsible for enlargement .
verheugen has described the move as a " chance which only comes along once in a lifetime ... to do something that has a lasting impact and affects the lives of entire peoples " .
probably the biggest test of günter verheugen 's career - the question of turkey 's membership - still lies ahead .
even if he succeeds , it 's unlikely that he 'll be around to see it happen .

european space chiefs are now trying to come up with answers to the baffling fiasco . the european space industry is still mystified about what caused the new ariane 5-esca rocket to fail this week , less than three minutes after lift-off .
the new heavy-payload version of the rocket strayed off course just 96 seconds into its maiden flight on wednesday and had to be blown up , ditching its $ 600 million payload of satellites into the atlantic ocean 800 kilometres off the coast of french guiana .
engineers and officials from the european space agency say the problem occurred in the cooling circuit of one of the rocket 's main engines .
a change in engine speed around 180 seconds after take-off caused the launcher to " demonstrate erratic behaviour " .
wednesday 's explosion was the fourth failure of an ariane 5 in fourteen missions .
it was carrying a 10-tonne cargo , heavier than any previous version .
on board were the hot bird 7 eutelsat television broadcast satellite and stentor , a telecommunications satellite developed by the french space agency at a cost of over $ 385 million .
inquiry arianespace , the company that designed the rocket , has announced the establishment of an independent inquiry board to investigate the failure and try to ensure future launches are not affected .
arianespace chief executive jean-yves le gall said the inquiry would begin early next week .
" we will have to clearly explain what happened and if it will have consequences on the ariane 5 launcher in its basic version , " le gall told reporters .
" second , it will tell us when we can resume ariane 5 flights . "
rosetta mission in danger experts say the ariane 5 could be out of action for several months , casting doubt over the mission of the comet-chasing rosetta probe , due to blast off on january 12 .
rosetta , estimated to have cost more than $ 1 billion , is to make an eight-year journey to meet the comet wirtanen , which it will study for nearly two years .
the timing of rosetta 's launch is critical because of its complex trajectory around the planet mars .

the timing of rosetta 's launch is critical because of its complex trajectory around the planet mars .
setback for europe the ariane 5 failure comes as a huge blow to the european industry at a time when the satellite launch market is in a depression .
demand has been affected by a slowdown in the world telecommunications industry , with fewer commercial satellites being ordered than in previous years .
overproduction of rockets has also caused prices to fall thirty percent lower than they were a decade ago .
in addition , several competitors to ariane 5 have emerged in recent months .
boeing 's delta 4 and lockheed martin 's atlas 5 have both been well-received since their introduction .
arianespace 's dominant position in the commercial market now looks to be seriously threatened , with ariane 5 's failure expected to cause customers to look even more favourably on its rivals .
insurance woes some industry analysts have predicted that the market for satellite launchers could experience an up-turn in the second part of the decade , when satellites will have to be replaced .
they also say higher demand for broadband internet services could translate to a need for more satellite launchers .
but the fallout from wednesday 's failure , already being felt throughout the satellite launch industry , will be lasting .
insurance companies are saying they 'll be forced to increase premiums .
ariane 5 crashed just ten days after the failure of the astra 1k telecoms satellite launch , capping an already bad year for commercial insurers .
consultants say the situation could force some insurers to quit the space industry altogether .
another attempt the next arianespace mission , flight 156 , which will use ariane 5 's predecessor , ariane 4 to orbit the nss-6 satellite , has been set for the evening of tuesday , december 17 .

european space chiefs are now trying to come up with answers to the baffling fiasco . the european space industry is still mystified about what caused the new ariane 5-esca rocket to fail this week , less than three minutes after lift-off .
the new heavy-payload version of the rocket strayed off course just 96 seconds into its maiden flight on wednesday and had to be blown up , ditching its $ 600 million payload of satellites into the atlantic ocean 800 kilometres off the coast of french guiana .
engineers and officials from the european space agency say the problem occurred in the cooling circuit of one of the rocket 's main engines .
a change in engine speed around 180 seconds after take-off caused the launcher to " demonstrate erratic behaviour " .
wednesday 's explosion was the fourth failure of an ariane 5 in fourteen missions .
it was carrying a 10-tonne cargo , heavier than any previous version .
on board were the hot bird 7 eutelsat television broadcast satellite and stentor , a telecommunications satellite developed by the french space agency at a cost of over $ 385 million .
inquiry arianespace , the company that designed the rocket , has announced the establishment of an independent inquiry board to investigate the failure and try to ensure future launches are not affected .
arianespace chief executive jean-yves le gall said the inquiry would begin early next week .
" we will have to clearly explain what happened and if it will have consequences on the ariane 5 launcher in its basic version , " le gall told reporters .
" second , it will tell us when we can resume ariane 5 flights . "

1 introduction of the euro .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the president of the european central bank takes stock of the euro 's success . wim duisenberg has been president of the european central bank since 1997 .
during his five years there , duisenberg has overseen the smooth introduction of europe 's common currency , the euro , and managed interest rates , prices and inflation in the 12 euro zone countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president wim duisenberg recently , duisenberg has been criticized for not cutting interest rates as agressively as his american counterpart , alan greenspan of the federal reserve bank . he also wants members to maintain the rigid guidelines set in the euro stability pact , which prohibits countries to allow their deficit spending to rise over 3 percent of gross domestic product . in a recent interview with dw-radio , duisenberg took stock of the euro 's progress during the current year and offered frank criticism of a handful of member states for not keeping a tight- enough hold on their budget pursestrings .
it 's been nearly one year since the euro was introduced in europe .
how would you evaluate the year ?
for me , of course , the euro has already existed for sometime longer .
but it 's true the notes and coins have just been introduced .
i would evaluate that unambiguously as a success .
how has the new currency encouraged countries in the euro zone to cooperate more effectively ?
that is a slow process , but having one single currency has its effects on all areas of monetary policy - not only on fiscal and social policy , but even on foreign policy .
it brings countries that have the single currency closer together and it does necessitate ever-closer cooperation .
would you say the euro zone has brought nations together politically ?
that 's also a process .
it is working in that direction .
it is working to bring them closer together and it also works already now towards those countries that are about to become members of the european union - particularly in central and eastern europe .
they will not immediately adopt the euro , but the euro is already a force there .
it exerts its influence in bringing those countries closer to the europe they will one day be a part of .
do you see the candidate countries joining the euro zone ?
they undoubtably will .
they will first sign the accession treaty .
then a process will start involving a number of treaties that will have to be ratified by all the parliaments involved .
but we are already intensively working at the european central bank to integrate them into our work .
this involves working with their central banks to prepare them for the new situation .
they will have to adjust their legal frameworks in various fields .
the financial sector has to be adjusted and adapted - and that , too , is a long , drawn-out process .
but it could happen within five to seven years .
a central part of the treaty would no doubt be the stability pact , the criteria now in place for current euro zone countries .
those criteria are now being discussed in european capitals - especially the three-percent cap on deficit spending .
what do you think about suggestion criteria should be softened , especially in light of germany 's economic troubles ?
i would be very much against it .
the criteria are only just in place .
it 's natural that there are times when it really bites and causes difficulties for some european countries .
then countries talk about changing it .
but i 'm one who thinks you should never change the rules in the middle of the game .
the fact that some countries are now having difficulty meeting the criteria - like germany , france and italy .
it is precisely because of the fact that in the recent past , when everything was going well , they did n't grasp the opportunitiy to better consolidate their public finances .
now , because they have n't done that at that time , they are sitting on their blisters .
but that 's no reason to change the rules .
it 's all the more reason to finally do what should have been done long before .
out of the 12 euro zone countries , eight have already reached that goal .
do you feel undermined by comments by people like european commission president romano prodi , who severely criticizes the stability pact 's guidelines ?
well , i ca n't feel undermined because the ecb , though we are standing and shouting from the sidelines , is not part of the stability pact as such .
it 's the european commission that is the stability pact 's guardian .
we support the european commission in in every respect in their function as the guardian of the stability and growth pact .
but as for mr. prodi 's criticism , let me simply say that i do not share his views and would not have said what he said .
there has also been criticism in europe and america about the reluctance of the ecb to lower interest rates along the lines of the federal reserve bank under federal reserve chairman alan greenspan .
is this criticism justified ?
i think not .
we have interest rates at low levels which have not been seen in europe for the last 40 or 50 years .
the interest rate levels we have are being determined exclusively on the basis of what we think is best for the euro area and not for any other consideration .
last week we lowered our interest rate even further .
liquidity , money in the euro zone is ample .
in no way is the monetary policy stance an inhibition for the resumption of growth and growth of employment .
does that mean that at some point in the future lower rates could not be an economic tool ?
it 's sometimes overestimated what monetary policy can do and what it can not do .
our main goal is to safeguard price stability , thereby giving consumers and investors confidence in the future .
it 's mainly the lack of confidence at the moment which comes for other reasons - all the uncertainties - that we are going through a period of very slow economic development .
we have to rebuild confidence and that takes time .
you can lose confidence in a day , but to regain it may take a year .
you mentioned lack of confidence and instability .
how do you think a war against iraq would affect the euro ?
i ca n't possibly speculate on that .
the main impact we might see is on the oil market and oil prices .
that 's one of the uncertainties that hangs over our heads , but you ca n't possibly speculate to what extent it might have an impact on the euro .
as far as oil prices are concerned , if they rise suddenly , that would have an impact on our internal price stability .
that would be the main impact .
if it had a lasting impact , we would react .
if it had only a short-term impact , we would do nothing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

1 introduction of the euro .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the president of the european central bank takes stock of the euro 's success . wim duisenberg has been president of the european central bank since 1997 .
during his five years there , duisenberg has overseen the smooth introduction of europe 's common currency , the euro , and managed interest rates , prices and inflation in the 12 euro zone countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president wim duisenberg recently , duisenberg has been criticized for not cutting interest rates as agressively as his american counterpart , alan greenspan of the federal reserve bank . he also wants members to maintain the rigid guidelines set in the euro stability pact , which prohibits countries to allow their deficit spending to rise over 3 percent of gross domestic product . in a recent interview with dw-radio , duisenberg took stock of the euro 's progress during the current year and offered frank criticism of a handful of member states for not keeping a tight- enough hold on their budget pursestrings .
it 's been nearly one year since the euro was introduced in europe .
how would you evaluate the year ?
for me , of course , the euro has already existed for sometime longer .
but it 's true the notes and coins have just been introduced .
i would evaluate that unambiguously as a success .
how has the new currency encouraged countries in the euro zone to cooperate more effectively ?
that is a slow process , but having one single currency has its effects on all areas of monetary policy - not only on fiscal and social policy , but even on foreign policy .
it brings countries that have the single currency closer together and it does necessitate ever-closer cooperation .
would you say the euro zone has brought nations together politically ?
that 's also a process .
it is working in that direction .
it is working to bring them closer together and it also works already now towards those countries that are about to become members of the european union - particularly in central and eastern europe .
they will not immediately adopt the euro , but the euro is already a force there .
it exerts its influence in bringing those countries closer to the europe they will one day be a part of .
do you see the candidate countries joining the euro zone ?
they undoubtably will .
they will first sign the accession treaty .
then a process will start involving a number of treaties that will have to be ratified by all the parliaments involved .
but we are already intensively working at the european central bank to integrate them into our work .
this involves working with their central banks to prepare them for the new situation .
they will have to adjust their legal frameworks in various fields .
the financial sector has to be adjusted and adapted - and that , too , is a long , drawn-out process .
but it could happen within five to seven years .
a central part of the treaty would no doubt be the stability pact , the criteria now in place for current euro zone countries .
those criteria are now being discussed in european capitals - especially the three-percent cap on deficit spending .
what do you think about suggestion criteria should be softened , especially in light of germany 's economic troubles ?
i would be very much against it .
the criteria are only just in place .
it 's natural that there are times when it really bites and causes difficulties for some european countries .
then countries talk about changing it .
but i 'm one who thinks you should never change the rules in the middle of the game .
the fact that some countries are now having difficulty meeting the criteria - like germany , france and italy .
it is precisely because of the fact that in the recent past , when everything was going well , they did n't grasp the opportunitiy to better consolidate their public finances .
now , because they have n't done that at that time , they are sitting on their blisters .
but that 's no reason to change the rules .
it 's all the more reason to finally do what should have been done long before .
out of the 12 euro zone countries , eight have already reached that goal .
do you feel undermined by comments by people like european commission president romano prodi , who severely criticizes the stability pact 's guidelines ?
well , i ca n't feel undermined because the ecb , though we are standing and shouting from the sidelines , is not part of the stability pact as such .
it 's the european commission that is the stability pact 's guardian .
we support the european commission in in every respect in their function as the guardian of the stability and growth pact .
but as for mr. prodi 's criticism , let me simply say that i do not share his views and would not have said what he said .
there has also been criticism in europe and america about the reluctance of the ecb to lower interest rates along the lines of the federal reserve bank under federal reserve chairman alan greenspan .
is this criticism justified ?
i think not .
we have interest rates at low levels which have not been seen in europe for the last 40 or 50 years .
the interest rate levels we have are being determined exclusively on the basis of what we think is best for the euro area and not for any other consideration .
last week we lowered our interest rate even further .
liquidity , money in the euro zone is ample .
in no way is the monetary policy stance an inhibition for the resumption of growth and growth of employment .
does that mean that at some point in the future lower rates could not be an economic tool ?
it 's sometimes overestimated what monetary policy can do and what it can not do .
our main goal is to safeguard price stability , thereby giving consumers and investors confidence in the future .
it 's mainly the lack of confidence at the moment which comes for other reasons - all the uncertainties - that we are going through a period of very slow economic development .
we have to rebuild confidence and that takes time .
you can lose confidence in a day , but to regain it may take a year .
you mentioned lack of confidence and instability .
how do you think a war against iraq would affect the euro ?
i ca n't possibly speculate on that .
the main impact we might see is on the oil market and oil prices .
that 's one of the uncertainties that hangs over our heads , but you ca n't possibly speculate to what extent it might have an impact on the euro .

turkish cypriots diplomats said on friday that they were prepared to sign a " letter of intent " with greek cypriots to discuss a u.n. plan to reunite their divided mediterranean island .
the u.n. plan forsees a state based on two largely autonomous greek and turkish zones and calls for an agreement by late february followed by referendums on both sides .
the " letter of intent " however is a diluted version of what eu leaders were hoping would be the inking of a framework agreement at the copenhagen summit by both sides .
a " christian fortress " around europe ?
earlier turkish leaders reacted angrily to the eu ’ s proposal of a december 2004 review of turkey ’ s implementation of reforms and if successful , a date for accession talks in 2005 .
they are also smarting that that the internationally recognized greek cypriot government on cyprus is set to join the eu in 2004 .
earlier on friday the turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash accused the european union of seeking to build a " christian fortress " around turkey and effectively ruled out a deal to reunite cyprus at the summit .
" the european union ’ s interest is to delay turkey and to take cyprus , to possess cyprus and to build something like a christian fortress around turkey , " he told a news conference in the turkish capital of ankara .
will any deal on cyprus be reached at all ?
however it remains unclear whether the summit will see any kind of agreement at all between the greeks and cypriots .
greek cypriot attorney general alecos markides told cyprus television from copenhagen that there was no need for any letter of intent .
" if they are committing themselves and they have told de soto -lrb- u.n. envoy -rrb- they are to cooperate , we don ’ t need letters of intent or anything like that . "
even u.n. secretary-general kofi anan acknowledged on friday that a deal to reunite cyprus would not be reached at the eu summit in copenhagen .
" we were very close , and i was very hopeful that we could get an agreement , and i recall telling -lrb- turkish leader tayyip -rrb- erdogan that like an old soccer player like himself , the games is not over until the final whistle , and it looks as if we are not going to get there , " anan said .
cyprus has been a divided island since a turkish invasion in 1974 prompted by a brief greek-inspired coup in nicosia .
the self-declared turkish republic of northern cyprus , which accounts for about 18 percent of the island ’ s 750,000-strong population is only recognized by turkey .
the eu has always maintained that in the absence of a settlement to unite the island , it would take in only the internationally recognized greek cypriot part of the island , with which it has been negotiating .
historic deal clinched with poland meanwhile the eu had better luck with another obstacle plaguing enlargement talks in recent months .
a danish presidency official announced on friday that all 10 candidates had accepted financial packages at the end of the two-day summit in copenhagen .
" we have a deal , " the official told reuters after swedish prime minister goran persson and polish finance minister grzegorz kolodko confirmed that poland , the biggest and most difficult candidate , had accepted a financial settlement .
german chancellor gerhard schröder had earlier said that a solution had been found to give poland a special cashflow facility for its years of eu membership without raising the overall cost of enlargement .
the eu had proposed reshuffling funds from various sources to give poland about a billion extra euros in 2005 and 6 .
that money would then have been deducted from eu aid to warsaw in following years .
the polish acceptance of the renewed offer came after agonizingly long-drawn out negotiations which dragged the summit into overtime .

however it remains unclear whether the summit will see any kind of agreement at all between the greeks and cypriots .
greek cypriot attorney general alecos markides told cyprus television from copenhagen that there was no need for any letter of intent .
" if they are committing themselves and they have told de soto -lrb- u.n. envoy -rrb- they are to cooperate , we don ’ t need letters of intent or anything like that . "
even u.n. secretary-general kofi anan acknowledged on friday that a deal to reunite cyprus would not be reached at the eu summit in copenhagen .
" we were very close , and i was very hopeful that we could get an agreement , and i recall telling -lrb- turkish leader tayyip -rrb- erdogan that like an old soccer player like himself , the games is not over until the final whistle , and it looks as if we are not going to get there , " anan said .
cyprus has been a divided island since a turkish invasion in 1974 prompted by a brief greek-inspired coup in nicosia .
the self-declared turkish republic of northern cyprus , which accounts for about 18 percent of the island ’ s 750,000-strong population is only recognized by turkey .
the eu has always maintained that in the absence of a settlement to unite the island , it would take in only the internationally recognized greek cypriot part of the island , with which it has been negotiating .
historic deal clinched with poland meanwhile the eu had better luck with another obstacle plaguing enlargement talks in recent months .
a danish presidency official announced on friday that all 10 candidates had accepted financial packages at the end of the two-day summit in copenhagen .
" we have a deal , " the official told reuters after swedish prime minister goran persson and polish finance minister grzegorz kolodko confirmed that poland , the biggest and most difficult candidate , had accepted a financial settlement .
german chancellor gerhard schröder had earlier said that a solution had been found to give poland a special cashflow facility for its years of eu membership without raising the overall cost of enlargement .
the eu had proposed reshuffling funds from various sources to give poland about a billion extra euros in 2005 and 6 .
that money would then have been deducted from eu aid to warsaw in following years .
the polish acceptance of the renewed offer came after agonizingly long-drawn out negotiations which dragged the summit into overtime .
however the deal with poland brings to a close one of the trickiest negotiation chapters in the enlargement project , which often threatened to jeopardize it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey gets its date with the eu the eu said turkey could begin negotiations for entry at the end of 2004 , more than one year later than ankara had hoped for .
turkish officials are upset with the decision .

since the irish gave the go-ahead for eu enlargement in october , the fifty-eight year old has been working round the clock to try to secure a peace deal in cyprus , find a way forward for turkey 's candidacy , keep poland 's financial expectations in check and persuade reluctant eu members that for forty billion euros , they 're getting enlargement on the cheap .
even as the enlargement project was poised to enter the final stages in copenhagen , commissioner verheugen was still at it - urging participants to show political courage and strong leadership .
european expansion must take place " now or never " , he told german television .
" a failure in copenhagen or a delay could have serious effects on public opinion in the future member states . "
the jewel in the crown for verheugen , the copenhagen summit represents his greatest achievement as enlargement commissioner .
" nothing more can go wrong , " he says .
" when it 's all over , i 'll feel an enormous sense of relief . "
this is about as close to sentimentality as verheugen gets .
even after succeeding in closing what looked like an impossible gap between the member states and accession countries ahead of the copenhagen meeting , the commissioner was insisting that it was still too soon for celebrations .
nor is verheugen inclined to take all the credit for creating an expanded europe .
" it 's a structure made up of many thousands of individual bricks , " he says .
verheugen sees himself as an architect , but not a miracle-worker .
challenges in office for four years , verheugen has complained that his is a lonely job .
that 's hardly surprising , given that he 's spent more time on the road , travelling between the eu candidate countries and the fifteen member states , than back home in brussels .
but the white-haired , thick-spectacled verheugen has no doubts about what he 's doing .
the peoples of central and eastern europe must be welcomed into the family of european democracies , he says , in order to close a historical chapter during which they were persecuted by oppressive totalitarian regimes .
maintaining enthusiasm for the european project within the eu as well as in the candidate countries has been one of the biggest challenges verheugen has faced as commissioner .
he 's had to work hard to convince eu members that the accession countries are doing their best to implement reforms .
all the while , verheugen sees that the candidate countries are losing patience , and they 're no longer prepared to accept membership at any price .
he 's issued a stern warning to poland , the czech republic and hungary to keep their demands in check , saying " the eu is n't an automatic teller machine .
you do n't just stick in your membership card and expect money to come out the bottom " .
getting eu members to agree on the hefty enlargement budget has been just as difficult .
verheugen has appealed to the member states to show more generosity , pushing the benefits he argues will come from an expanded european economic zone and new export markets .
a party man verheugen 's skills in diplomacy have been developed over a long political career . born in germany in 1944 , just before the end of wwii , he studied history and worked for a short time as a journalist before entering politics .
he became federal party manager of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- at the age of thirty-two .
five years later , having helped the fdp achieve its best result ever in national elections , he switched to the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
it was a difficult time for verheugen .
the son of a small-town banker , he was not welcomed by some in the spd , who never forgave him for his prior allegiance to the liberal democrats .
nevertheless , in 1993 , verheugen became the spd 's federal party manager , an important step in his political career .
the chance of a lifetime after gerhard schröder 's election victory in 1998 , verheugen had hoped to get the job of defence minister in his new cabinet .
instead , he was sent to brussels as foreign policy advisor , and a year later took up the post of eu commissioner responsible for enlargement .
verheugen has described the move as a " chance which only comes along once in a lifetime ... to do something that has a lasting impact and affects the lives of entire peoples " .
probably the biggest test of günter verheugen 's career - the question of turkey 's membership - still lies ahead .
even if he succeeds , it 's unlikely that he 'll be around to see it happen .

1 introduction of the euro .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the president of the european central bank takes stock of the euro 's success . wim duisenberg has been president of the european central bank since 1997 .
during his five years there , duisenberg has overseen the smooth introduction of europe 's common currency , the euro , and managed interest rates , prices and inflation in the 12 euro zone countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president wim duisenberg recently , duisenberg has been criticized for not cutting interest rates as agressively as his american counterpart , alan greenspan of the federal reserve bank . he also wants members to maintain the rigid guidelines set in the euro stability pact , which prohibits countries to allow their deficit spending to rise over 3 percent of gross domestic product . in a recent interview with dw-radio , duisenberg took stock of the euro 's progress during the current year and offered frank criticism of a handful of member states for not keeping a tight- enough hold on their budget pursestrings .
it 's been nearly one year since the euro was introduced in europe .
how would you evaluate the year ?
for me , of course , the euro has already existed for sometime longer .
but it 's true the notes and coins have just been introduced .
i would evaluate that unambiguously as a success .
how has the new currency encouraged countries in the euro zone to cooperate more effectively ?
that is a slow process , but having one single currency has its effects on all areas of monetary policy - not only on fiscal and social policy , but even on foreign policy .
it brings countries that have the single currency closer together and it does necessitate ever-closer cooperation .
would you say the euro zone has brought nations together politically ?
that 's also a process .
it is working in that direction .
it is working to bring them closer together and it also works already now towards those countries that are about to become members of the european union - particularly in central and eastern europe .
they will not immediately adopt the euro , but the euro is already a force there .
it exerts its influence in bringing those countries closer to the europe they will one day be a part of .
do you see the candidate countries joining the euro zone ?
they undoubtably will .
they will first sign the accession treaty .
then a process will start involving a number of treaties that will have to be ratified by all the parliaments involved .
but we are already intensively working at the european central bank to integrate them into our work .
this involves working with their central banks to prepare them for the new situation .
they will have to adjust their legal frameworks in various fields .
the financial sector has to be adjusted and adapted - and that , too , is a long , drawn-out process .
but it could happen within five to seven years .
a central part of the treaty would no doubt be the stability pact , the criteria now in place for current euro zone countries .
those criteria are now being discussed in european capitals - especially the three-percent cap on deficit spending .
what do you think about suggestion criteria should be softened , especially in light of germany 's economic troubles ?
i would be very much against it .
the criteria are only just in place .
it 's natural that there are times when it really bites and causes difficulties for some european countries .
then countries talk about changing it .
but i 'm one who thinks you should never change the rules in the middle of the game .
the fact that some countries are now having difficulty meeting the criteria - like germany , france and italy .
it is precisely because of the fact that in the recent past , when everything was going well , they did n't grasp the opportunitiy to better consolidate their public finances .
now , because they have n't done that at that time , they are sitting on their blisters .
but that 's no reason to change the rules .
it 's all the more reason to finally do what should have been done long before .
out of the 12 euro zone countries , eight have already reached that goal .
do you feel undermined by comments by people like european commission president romano prodi , who severely criticizes the stability pact 's guidelines ?
well , i ca n't feel undermined because the ecb , though we are standing and shouting from the sidelines , is not part of the stability pact as such .
it 's the european commission that is the stability pact 's guardian .
we support the european commission in in every respect in their function as the guardian of the stability and growth pact .
but as for mr. prodi 's criticism , let me simply say that i do not share his views and would not have said what he said .
there has also been criticism in europe and america about the reluctance of the ecb to lower interest rates along the lines of the federal reserve bank under federal reserve chairman alan greenspan .
is this criticism justified ?
i think not .
we have interest rates at low levels which have not been seen in europe for the last 40 or 50 years .
the interest rate levels we have are being determined exclusively on the basis of what we think is best for the euro area and not for any other consideration .
last week we lowered our interest rate even further .
liquidity , money in the euro zone is ample .
in no way is the monetary policy stance an inhibition for the resumption of growth and growth of employment .
does that mean that at some point in the future lower rates could not be an economic tool ?
it 's sometimes overestimated what monetary policy can do and what it can not do .
our main goal is to safeguard price stability , thereby giving consumers and investors confidence in the future .
it 's mainly the lack of confidence at the moment which comes for other reasons - all the uncertainties - that we are going through a period of very slow economic development .
we have to rebuild confidence and that takes time .
you can lose confidence in a day , but to regain it may take a year .
you mentioned lack of confidence and instability .
how do you think a war against iraq would affect the euro ?
i ca n't possibly speculate on that .
the main impact we might see is on the oil market and oil prices .
that 's one of the uncertainties that hangs over our heads , but you ca n't possibly speculate to what extent it might have an impact on the euro .
as far as oil prices are concerned , if they rise suddenly , that would have an impact on our internal price stability .
that would be the main impact .
if it had a lasting impact , we would react .
if it had only a short-term impact , we would do nothing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

european space chiefs are now trying to come up with answers to the baffling fiasco . the european space industry is still mystified about what caused the new ariane 5-esca rocket to fail this week , less than three minutes after lift-off .
the new heavy-payload version of the rocket strayed off course just 96 seconds into its maiden flight on wednesday and had to be blown up , ditching its $ 600 million payload of satellites into the atlantic ocean 800 kilometres off the coast of french guiana .
engineers and officials from the european space agency say the problem occurred in the cooling circuit of one of the rocket 's main engines .
a change in engine speed around 180 seconds after take-off caused the launcher to " demonstrate erratic behaviour " .
wednesday 's explosion was the fourth failure of an ariane 5 in fourteen missions .
it was carrying a 10-tonne cargo , heavier than any previous version .
on board were the hot bird 7 eutelsat television broadcast satellite and stentor , a telecommunications satellite developed by the french space agency at a cost of over $ 385 million .
inquiry arianespace , the company that designed the rocket , has announced the establishment of an independent inquiry board to investigate the failure and try to ensure future launches are not affected .
arianespace chief executive jean-yves le gall said the inquiry would begin early next week .
" we will have to clearly explain what happened and if it will have consequences on the ariane 5 launcher in its basic version , " le gall told reporters .
" second , it will tell us when we can resume ariane 5 flights . "
rosetta mission in danger experts say the ariane 5 could be out of action for several months , casting doubt over the mission of the comet-chasing rosetta probe , due to blast off on january 12 .
rosetta , estimated to have cost more than $ 1 billion , is to make an eight-year journey to meet the comet wirtanen , which it will study for nearly two years .
the timing of rosetta 's launch is critical because of its complex trajectory around the planet mars .
setback for europe the ariane 5 failure comes as a huge blow to the european industry at a time when the satellite launch market is in a depression .
demand has been affected by a slowdown in the world telecommunications industry , with fewer commercial satellites being ordered than in previous years .
overproduction of rockets has also caused prices to fall thirty percent lower than they were a decade ago .
in addition , several competitors to ariane 5 have emerged in recent months .
boeing 's delta 4 and lockheed martin 's atlas 5 have both been well-received since their introduction .
arianespace 's dominant position in the commercial market now looks to be seriously threatened , with ariane 5 's failure expected to cause customers to look even more favourably on its rivals .
insurance woes some industry analysts have predicted that the market for satellite launchers could experience an up-turn in the second part of the decade , when satellites will have to be replaced .
they also say higher demand for broadband internet services could translate to a need for more satellite launchers .
but the fallout from wednesday 's failure , already being felt throughout the satellite launch industry , will be lasting .
insurance companies are saying they 'll be forced to increase premiums .
ariane 5 crashed just ten days after the failure of the astra 1k telecoms satellite launch , capping an already bad year for commercial insurers .
consultants say the situation could force some insurers to quit the space industry altogether .
another attempt the next arianespace mission , flight 156 , which will use ariane 5 's predecessor , ariane 4 to orbit the nss-6 satellite , has been set for the evening of tuesday , december 17 .
the arianespace consortium has stopped production of the ariane 4 and the last rocket has been booked for launch in february . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's galileo runs into rough weather europe ’ s ambitious 3.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.14 billion -rrb- flagship galileo satellite navigation programme is floundering on account of squabbling between germany and italy over the leadership of the european space agency .

european space chiefs are now trying to come up with answers to the baffling fiasco . the european space industry is still mystified about what caused the new ariane 5-esca rocket to fail this week , less than three minutes after lift-off .
the new heavy-payload version of the rocket strayed off course just 96 seconds into its maiden flight on wednesday and had to be blown up , ditching its $ 600 million payload of satellites into the atlantic ocean 800 kilometres off the coast of french guiana .
engineers and officials from the european space agency say the problem occurred in the cooling circuit of one of the rocket 's main engines .
a change in engine speed around 180 seconds after take-off caused the launcher to " demonstrate erratic behaviour " .
wednesday 's explosion was the fourth failure of an ariane 5 in fourteen missions .
it was carrying a 10-tonne cargo , heavier than any previous version .
on board were the hot bird 7 eutelsat television broadcast satellite and stentor , a telecommunications satellite developed by the french space agency at a cost of over $ 385 million .
inquiry arianespace , the company that designed the rocket , has announced the establishment of an independent inquiry board to investigate the failure and try to ensure future launches are not affected .
arianespace chief executive jean-yves le gall said the inquiry would begin early next week .
" we will have to clearly explain what happened and if it will have consequences on the ariane 5 launcher in its basic version , " le gall told reporters .
" second , it will tell us when we can resume ariane 5 flights . "
rosetta mission in danger experts say the ariane 5 could be out of action for several months , casting doubt over the mission of the comet-chasing rosetta probe , due to blast off on january 12 .
rosetta , estimated to have cost more than $ 1 billion , is to make an eight-year journey to meet the comet wirtanen , which it will study for nearly two years .
the timing of rosetta 's launch is critical because of its complex trajectory around the planet mars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.12.2002 setbacks and triumphs at eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victorious - danish prime minister rasmussen , left , and german chancellor schröder clinch a deal with poland the eu enlargement summit in copenhagen achieved a breakthrough with poland on tricky financial negotiations , but failed to reach a solution on the precarious issue of the divided island of cyprus . hopes that one of the most troubling issues dodging the eu enlargement project would be resolved at the crucial copenhagen summit have been dashed .
turkish cypriots diplomats said on friday that they were prepared to sign a " letter of intent " with greek cypriots to discuss a u.n. plan to reunite their divided mediterranean island .
the u.n. plan forsees a state based on two largely autonomous greek and turkish zones and calls for an agreement by late february followed by referendums on both sides .
the " letter of intent " however is a diluted version of what eu leaders were hoping would be the inking of a framework agreement at the copenhagen summit by both sides .
a " christian fortress " around europe ?
earlier turkish leaders reacted angrily to the eu ’ s proposal of a december 2004 review of turkey ’ s implementation of reforms and if successful , a date for accession talks in 2005 .
they are also smarting that that the internationally recognized greek cypriot government on cyprus is set to join the eu in 2004 .
earlier on friday the turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash accused the european union of seeking to build a " christian fortress " around turkey and effectively ruled out a deal to reunite cyprus at the summit .
" the european union ’ s interest is to delay turkey and to take cyprus , to possess cyprus and to build something like a christian fortress around turkey , " he told a news conference in the turkish capital of ankara .
will any deal on cyprus be reached at all ?
however it remains unclear whether the summit will see any kind of agreement at all between the greeks and cypriots .
greek cypriot attorney general alecos markides told cyprus television from copenhagen that there was no need for any letter of intent .
" if they are committing themselves and they have told de soto -lrb- u.n. envoy -rrb- they are to cooperate , we don ’ t need letters of intent or anything like that . "
even u.n. secretary-general kofi anan acknowledged on friday that a deal to reunite cyprus would not be reached at the eu summit in copenhagen .
" we were very close , and i was very hopeful that we could get an agreement , and i recall telling -lrb- turkish leader tayyip -rrb- erdogan that like an old soccer player like himself , the games is not over until the final whistle , and it looks as if we are not going to get there , " anan said .
cyprus has been a divided island since a turkish invasion in 1974 prompted by a brief greek-inspired coup in nicosia .
the self-declared turkish republic of northern cyprus , which accounts for about 18 percent of the island ’ s 750,000-strong population is only recognized by turkey .
the eu has always maintained that in the absence of a settlement to unite the island , it would take in only the internationally recognized greek cypriot part of the island , with which it has been negotiating .
historic deal clinched with poland meanwhile the eu had better luck with another obstacle plaguing enlargement talks in recent months .

turkish cypriots diplomats said on friday that they were prepared to sign a " letter of intent " with greek cypriots to discuss a u.n. plan to reunite their divided mediterranean island .
the u.n. plan forsees a state based on two largely autonomous greek and turkish zones and calls for an agreement by late february followed by referendums on both sides .
the " letter of intent " however is a diluted version of what eu leaders were hoping would be the inking of a framework agreement at the copenhagen summit by both sides .
a " christian fortress " around europe ?
earlier turkish leaders reacted angrily to the eu ’ s proposal of a december 2004 review of turkey ’ s implementation of reforms and if successful , a date for accession talks in 2005 .
they are also smarting that that the internationally recognized greek cypriot government on cyprus is set to join the eu in 2004 .
earlier on friday the turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash accused the european union of seeking to build a " christian fortress " around turkey and effectively ruled out a deal to reunite cyprus at the summit .
" the european union ’ s interest is to delay turkey and to take cyprus , to possess cyprus and to build something like a christian fortress around turkey , " he told a news conference in the turkish capital of ankara .
will any deal on cyprus be reached at all ?
however it remains unclear whether the summit will see any kind of agreement at all between the greeks and cypriots .
greek cypriot attorney general alecos markides told cyprus television from copenhagen that there was no need for any letter of intent .
" if they are committing themselves and they have told de soto -lrb- u.n. envoy -rrb- they are to cooperate , we don ’ t need letters of intent or anything like that . "
even u.n. secretary-general kofi anan acknowledged on friday that a deal to reunite cyprus would not be reached at the eu summit in copenhagen .
" we were very close , and i was very hopeful that we could get an agreement , and i recall telling -lrb- turkish leader tayyip -rrb- erdogan that like an old soccer player like himself , the games is not over until the final whistle , and it looks as if we are not going to get there , " anan said .
cyprus has been a divided island since a turkish invasion in 1974 prompted by a brief greek-inspired coup in nicosia .
the self-declared turkish republic of northern cyprus , which accounts for about 18 percent of the island ’ s 750,000-strong population is only recognized by turkey .
the eu has always maintained that in the absence of a settlement to unite the island , it would take in only the internationally recognized greek cypriot part of the island , with which it has been negotiating .

turkish officials are upset with the decision . during evening discussions at the eu expansion summit thursday , european leaders and turkish negotiators were finally able to reach agreement on the elusive date on which turkey could begin negotiating for eu entry . danish prime minister anders fogh rassmussen , whose country is leading the summit , announced last night that turkey would begin negotiations for entry at the end of 2004 . the news was received with anger by turkish prime minister abdullah gül , who said the eu did n't appreciate all the efforts turkey has made so far . " this is impossible to accept , " gül said , after meeting with british prime minister tony blair , who supported an earlier negotiation date for turkey . turkey had been lobbying hard for eu entry since passing a host of human rights legislation last summer .
the eu first declared the country a candidate in 1999 .
since then , ankara had hoped it could join the union with the ten other eastern european and mediterranean countries in 2004 . the past few weeks have seen an intense lobbying effort in european capitals on the part of turkish leader recep tayyip erdogan .
though well received in italy , spain and the uk , erdogan ’ s lobbying seemed to annoy other countries . “ many found the -lrb- turkish lobbying -rrb- regrettable and unacceptable , ” said italian prime minister silvio berlusconi . the us , which will need turkey ’ s help in a possible iraq invasion , had also urged the eu to name a date .
the eventual compromise bore strong resemblance to a franco-german proposal to get turkey a date in 2005 should it continue to pass human rights legislation in line with eu membership requirements .

turkish officials are upset with the decision . during evening discussions at the eu expansion summit thursday , european leaders and turkish negotiators were finally able to reach agreement on the elusive date on which turkey could begin negotiating for eu entry . danish prime minister anders fogh rassmussen , whose country is leading the summit , announced last night that turkey would begin negotiations for entry at the end of 2004 . the news was received with anger by turkish prime minister abdullah gül , who said the eu did n't appreciate all the efforts turkey has made so far .

since then , ankara had hoped it could join the union with the ten other eastern european and mediterranean countries in 2004 . the past few weeks have seen an intense lobbying effort in european capitals on the part of turkish leader recep tayyip erdogan .

since the irish gave the go-ahead for eu enlargement in october , the fifty-eight year old has been working round the clock to try to secure a peace deal in cyprus , find a way forward for turkey 's candidacy , keep poland 's financial expectations in check and persuade reluctant eu members that for forty billion euros , they 're getting enlargement on the cheap .
even as the enlargement project was poised to enter the final stages in copenhagen , commissioner verheugen was still at it - urging participants to show political courage and strong leadership .
european expansion must take place " now or never " , he told german television .
" a failure in copenhagen or a delay could have serious effects on public opinion in the future member states . "
the jewel in the crown for verheugen , the copenhagen summit represents his greatest achievement as enlargement commissioner .
" nothing more can go wrong , " he says .
" when it 's all over , i 'll feel an enormous sense of relief . "
this is about as close to sentimentality as verheugen gets .
even after succeeding in closing what looked like an impossible gap between the member states and accession countries ahead of the copenhagen meeting , the commissioner was insisting that it was still too soon for celebrations .
nor is verheugen inclined to take all the credit for creating an expanded europe .
" it 's a structure made up of many thousands of individual bricks , " he says .
verheugen sees himself as an architect , but not a miracle-worker .
challenges in office for four years , verheugen has complained that his is a lonely job .
that 's hardly surprising , given that he 's spent more time on the road , travelling between the eu candidate countries and the fifteen member states , than back home in brussels .
but the white-haired , thick-spectacled verheugen has no doubts about what he 's doing .
the peoples of central and eastern europe must be welcomed into the family of european democracies , he says , in order to close a historical chapter during which they were persecuted by oppressive totalitarian regimes .
maintaining enthusiasm for the european project within the eu as well as in the candidate countries has been one of the biggest challenges verheugen has faced as commissioner .
he 's had to work hard to convince eu members that the accession countries are doing their best to implement reforms .
all the while , verheugen sees that the candidate countries are losing patience , and they 're no longer prepared to accept membership at any price .
he 's issued a stern warning to poland , the czech republic and hungary to keep their demands in check , saying " the eu is n't an automatic teller machine .
you do n't just stick in your membership card and expect money to come out the bottom " .
getting eu members to agree on the hefty enlargement budget has been just as difficult .
verheugen has appealed to the member states to show more generosity , pushing the benefits he argues will come from an expanded european economic zone and new export markets .
a party man verheugen 's skills in diplomacy have been developed over a long political career . born in germany in 1944 , just before the end of wwii , he studied history and worked for a short time as a journalist before entering politics .
he became federal party manager of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- at the age of thirty-two .
five years later , having helped the fdp achieve its best result ever in national elections , he switched to the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
it was a difficult time for verheugen .
the son of a small-town banker , he was not welcomed by some in the spd , who never forgave him for his prior allegiance to the liberal democrats .
nevertheless , in 1993 , verheugen became the spd 's federal party manager , an important step in his political career .
the chance of a lifetime after gerhard schröder 's election victory in 1998 , verheugen had hoped to get the job of defence minister in his new cabinet .
instead , he was sent to brussels as foreign policy advisor , and a year later took up the post of eu commissioner responsible for enlargement .
verheugen has described the move as a " chance which only comes along once in a lifetime ... to do something that has a lasting impact and affects the lives of entire peoples " .

since the irish gave the go-ahead for eu enlargement in october , the fifty-eight year old has been working round the clock to try to secure a peace deal in cyprus , find a way forward for turkey 's candidacy , keep poland 's financial expectations in check and persuade reluctant eu members that for forty billion euros , they 're getting enlargement on the cheap .
even as the enlargement project was poised to enter the final stages in copenhagen , commissioner verheugen was still at it - urging participants to show political courage and strong leadership .
european expansion must take place " now or never " , he told german television .
" a failure in copenhagen or a delay could have serious effects on public opinion in the future member states . "
the jewel in the crown for verheugen , the copenhagen summit represents his greatest achievement as enlargement commissioner .
" nothing more can go wrong , " he says .
" when it 's all over , i 'll feel an enormous sense of relief . "
this is about as close to sentimentality as verheugen gets .
even after succeeding in closing what looked like an impossible gap between the member states and accession countries ahead of the copenhagen meeting , the commissioner was insisting that it was still too soon for celebrations .
nor is verheugen inclined to take all the credit for creating an expanded europe .
" it 's a structure made up of many thousands of individual bricks , " he says .
verheugen sees himself as an architect , but not a miracle-worker .
challenges in office for four years , verheugen has complained that his is a lonely job .
that 's hardly surprising , given that he 's spent more time on the road , travelling between the eu candidate countries and the fifteen member states , than back home in brussels .
but the white-haired , thick-spectacled verheugen has no doubts about what he 's doing .
the peoples of central and eastern europe must be welcomed into the family of european democracies , he says , in order to close a historical chapter during which they were persecuted by oppressive totalitarian regimes .
maintaining enthusiasm for the european project within the eu as well as in the candidate countries has been one of the biggest challenges verheugen has faced as commissioner .
he 's had to work hard to convince eu members that the accession countries are doing their best to implement reforms .
all the while , verheugen sees that the candidate countries are losing patience , and they 're no longer prepared to accept membership at any price .
he 's issued a stern warning to poland , the czech republic and hungary to keep their demands in check , saying " the eu is n't an automatic teller machine .
you do n't just stick in your membership card and expect money to come out the bottom " .
getting eu members to agree on the hefty enlargement budget has been just as difficult .
verheugen has appealed to the member states to show more generosity , pushing the benefits he argues will come from an expanded european economic zone and new export markets .
a party man verheugen 's skills in diplomacy have been developed over a long political career . born in germany in 1944 , just before the end of wwii , he studied history and worked for a short time as a journalist before entering politics .
he became federal party manager of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- at the age of thirty-two .
five years later , having helped the fdp achieve its best result ever in national elections , he switched to the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
it was a difficult time for verheugen .
the son of a small-town banker , he was not welcomed by some in the spd , who never forgave him for his prior allegiance to the liberal democrats .
nevertheless , in 1993 , verheugen became the spd 's federal party manager , an important step in his political career .
the chance of a lifetime after gerhard schröder 's election victory in 1998 , verheugen had hoped to get the job of defence minister in his new cabinet .
instead , he was sent to brussels as foreign policy advisor , and a year later took up the post of eu commissioner responsible for enlargement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.12.2002 wim duisenberg reflects on the euro 's first birthday großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro turns one soon it 's now been nearly a year since the jan .
1 introduction of the euro .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the president of the european central bank takes stock of the euro 's success . wim duisenberg has been president of the european central bank since 1997 .
during his five years there , duisenberg has overseen the smooth introduction of europe 's common currency , the euro , and managed interest rates , prices and inflation in the 12 euro zone countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president wim duisenberg recently , duisenberg has been criticized for not cutting interest rates as agressively as his american counterpart , alan greenspan of the federal reserve bank . he also wants members to maintain the rigid guidelines set in the euro stability pact , which prohibits countries to allow their deficit spending to rise over 3 percent of gross domestic product . in a recent interview with dw-radio , duisenberg took stock of the euro 's progress during the current year and offered frank criticism of a handful of member states for not keeping a tight- enough hold on their budget pursestrings .
it 's been nearly one year since the euro was introduced in europe .
how would you evaluate the year ?
for me , of course , the euro has already existed for sometime longer .
but it 's true the notes and coins have just been introduced .
i would evaluate that unambiguously as a success .
how has the new currency encouraged countries in the euro zone to cooperate more effectively ?
that is a slow process , but having one single currency has its effects on all areas of monetary policy - not only on fiscal and social policy , but even on foreign policy .
it brings countries that have the single currency closer together and it does necessitate ever-closer cooperation .
would you say the euro zone has brought nations together politically ?
that 's also a process .
it is working in that direction .
it is working to bring them closer together and it also works already now towards those countries that are about to become members of the european union - particularly in central and eastern europe .
they will not immediately adopt the euro , but the euro is already a force there .
it exerts its influence in bringing those countries closer to the europe they will one day be a part of .
do you see the candidate countries joining the euro zone ?
they undoubtably will .
they will first sign the accession treaty .
then a process will start involving a number of treaties that will have to be ratified by all the parliaments involved .
but we are already intensively working at the european central bank to integrate them into our work .
this involves working with their central banks to prepare them for the new situation .
they will have to adjust their legal frameworks in various fields .
the financial sector has to be adjusted and adapted - and that , too , is a long , drawn-out process .
but it could happen within five to seven years .
a central part of the treaty would no doubt be the stability pact , the criteria now in place for current euro zone countries .
those criteria are now being discussed in european capitals - especially the three-percent cap on deficit spending .
what do you think about suggestion criteria should be softened , especially in light of germany 's economic troubles ?
i would be very much against it .
the criteria are only just in place .
it 's natural that there are times when it really bites and causes difficulties for some european countries .
then countries talk about changing it .
but i 'm one who thinks you should never change the rules in the middle of the game .
the fact that some countries are now having difficulty meeting the criteria - like germany , france and italy .
it is precisely because of the fact that in the recent past , when everything was going well , they did n't grasp the opportunitiy to better consolidate their public finances .
now , because they have n't done that at that time , they are sitting on their blisters .
but that 's no reason to change the rules .
it 's all the more reason to finally do what should have been done long before .
out of the 12 euro zone countries , eight have already reached that goal .
do you feel undermined by comments by people like european commission president romano prodi , who severely criticizes the stability pact 's guidelines ?
well , i ca n't feel undermined because the ecb , though we are standing and shouting from the sidelines , is not part of the stability pact as such .
it 's the european commission that is the stability pact 's guardian .
we support the european commission in in every respect in their function as the guardian of the stability and growth pact .
but as for mr. prodi 's criticism , let me simply say that i do not share his views and would not have said what he said .
there has also been criticism in europe and america about the reluctance of the ecb to lower interest rates along the lines of the federal reserve bank under federal reserve chairman alan greenspan .
is this criticism justified ?
i think not .
we have interest rates at low levels which have not been seen in europe for the last 40 or 50 years .
the interest rate levels we have are being determined exclusively on the basis of what we think is best for the euro area and not for any other consideration .
last week we lowered our interest rate even further .
liquidity , money in the euro zone is ample .
in no way is the monetary policy stance an inhibition for the resumption of growth and growth of employment .
does that mean that at some point in the future lower rates could not be an economic tool ?
it 's sometimes overestimated what monetary policy can do and what it can not do .
our main goal is to safeguard price stability , thereby giving consumers and investors confidence in the future .
it 's mainly the lack of confidence at the moment which comes for other reasons - all the uncertainties - that we are going through a period of very slow economic development .
we have to rebuild confidence and that takes time .
you can lose confidence in a day , but to regain it may take a year .
you mentioned lack of confidence and instability .
how do you think a war against iraq would affect the euro ?
i ca n't possibly speculate on that .
the main impact we might see is on the oil market and oil prices .
that 's one of the uncertainties that hangs over our heads , but you ca n't possibly speculate to what extent it might have an impact on the euro .
as far as oil prices are concerned , if they rise suddenly , that would have an impact on our internal price stability .
that would be the main impact .
if it had a lasting impact , we would react .
if it had only a short-term impact , we would do nothing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

turkish cypriots diplomats said on friday that they were prepared to sign a " letter of intent " with greek cypriots to discuss a u.n. plan to reunite their divided mediterranean island .
the u.n. plan forsees a state based on two largely autonomous greek and turkish zones and calls for an agreement by late february followed by referendums on both sides .
the " letter of intent " however is a diluted version of what eu leaders were hoping would be the inking of a framework agreement at the copenhagen summit by both sides .
a " christian fortress " around europe ?
earlier turkish leaders reacted angrily to the eu ’ s proposal of a december 2004 review of turkey ’ s implementation of reforms and if successful , a date for accession talks in 2005 .
they are also smarting that that the internationally recognized greek cypriot government on cyprus is set to join the eu in 2004 .
earlier on friday the turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash accused the european union of seeking to build a " christian fortress " around turkey and effectively ruled out a deal to reunite cyprus at the summit .
" the european union ’ s interest is to delay turkey and to take cyprus , to possess cyprus and to build something like a christian fortress around turkey , " he told a news conference in the turkish capital of ankara .
will any deal on cyprus be reached at all ?
however it remains unclear whether the summit will see any kind of agreement at all between the greeks and cypriots .
greek cypriot attorney general alecos markides told cyprus television from copenhagen that there was no need for any letter of intent .
" if they are committing themselves and they have told de soto -lrb- u.n. envoy -rrb- they are to cooperate , we don ’ t need letters of intent or anything like that . "
even u.n. secretary-general kofi anan acknowledged on friday that a deal to reunite cyprus would not be reached at the eu summit in copenhagen .
" we were very close , and i was very hopeful that we could get an agreement , and i recall telling -lrb- turkish leader tayyip -rrb- erdogan that like an old soccer player like himself , the games is not over until the final whistle , and it looks as if we are not going to get there , " anan said .
cyprus has been a divided island since a turkish invasion in 1974 prompted by a brief greek-inspired coup in nicosia .
the self-declared turkish republic of northern cyprus , which accounts for about 18 percent of the island ’ s 750,000-strong population is only recognized by turkey .
the eu has always maintained that in the absence of a settlement to unite the island , it would take in only the internationally recognized greek cypriot part of the island , with which it has been negotiating .
historic deal clinched with poland meanwhile the eu had better luck with another obstacle plaguing enlargement talks in recent months .
a danish presidency official announced on friday that all 10 candidates had accepted financial packages at the end of the two-day summit in copenhagen .
" we have a deal , " the official told reuters after swedish prime minister goran persson and polish finance minister grzegorz kolodko confirmed that poland , the biggest and most difficult candidate , had accepted a financial settlement .
german chancellor gerhard schröder had earlier said that a solution had been found to give poland a special cashflow facility for its years of eu membership without raising the overall cost of enlargement .
the eu had proposed reshuffling funds from various sources to give poland about a billion extra euros in 2005 and 6 .
that money would then have been deducted from eu aid to warsaw in following years .
the polish acceptance of the renewed offer came after agonizingly long-drawn out negotiations which dragged the summit into overtime .
however the deal with poland brings to a close one of the trickiest negotiation chapters in the enlargement project , which often threatened to jeopardize it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey gets its date with the eu the eu said turkey could begin negotiations for entry at the end of 2004 , more than one year later than ankara had hoped for .
turkish officials are upset with the decision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.12.2002 wim duisenberg reflects on the euro 's first birthday großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro turns one soon it 's now been nearly a year since the jan .
1 introduction of the euro .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the president of the european central bank takes stock of the euro 's success . wim duisenberg has been president of the european central bank since 1997 .
during his five years there , duisenberg has overseen the smooth introduction of europe 's common currency , the euro , and managed interest rates , prices and inflation in the 12 euro zone countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president wim duisenberg recently , duisenberg has been criticized for not cutting interest rates as agressively as his american counterpart , alan greenspan of the federal reserve bank . he also wants members to maintain the rigid guidelines set in the euro stability pact , which prohibits countries to allow their deficit spending to rise over 3 percent of gross domestic product . in a recent interview with dw-radio , duisenberg took stock of the euro 's progress during the current year and offered frank criticism of a handful of member states for not keeping a tight- enough hold on their budget pursestrings .
it 's been nearly one year since the euro was introduced in europe .
how would you evaluate the year ?
for me , of course , the euro has already existed for sometime longer .
but it 's true the notes and coins have just been introduced .
i would evaluate that unambiguously as a success .
how has the new currency encouraged countries in the euro zone to cooperate more effectively ?
that is a slow process , but having one single currency has its effects on all areas of monetary policy - not only on fiscal and social policy , but even on foreign policy .
it brings countries that have the single currency closer together and it does necessitate ever-closer cooperation .
would you say the euro zone has brought nations together politically ?
that 's also a process .
it is working in that direction .
it is working to bring them closer together and it also works already now towards those countries that are about to become members of the european union - particularly in central and eastern europe .
they will not immediately adopt the euro , but the euro is already a force there .
it exerts its influence in bringing those countries closer to the europe they will one day be a part of .
do you see the candidate countries joining the euro zone ?
they undoubtably will .
they will first sign the accession treaty .
then a process will start involving a number of treaties that will have to be ratified by all the parliaments involved .
but we are already intensively working at the european central bank to integrate them into our work .
this involves working with their central banks to prepare them for the new situation .
they will have to adjust their legal frameworks in various fields .
the financial sector has to be adjusted and adapted - and that , too , is a long , drawn-out process .
but it could happen within five to seven years .
a central part of the treaty would no doubt be the stability pact , the criteria now in place for current euro zone countries .
those criteria are now being discussed in european capitals - especially the three-percent cap on deficit spending .
what do you think about suggestion criteria should be softened , especially in light of germany 's economic troubles ?
i would be very much against it .
the criteria are only just in place .
it 's natural that there are times when it really bites and causes difficulties for some european countries .
then countries talk about changing it .
but i 'm one who thinks you should never change the rules in the middle of the game .
the fact that some countries are now having difficulty meeting the criteria - like germany , france and italy .
it is precisely because of the fact that in the recent past , when everything was going well , they did n't grasp the opportunitiy to better consolidate their public finances .
now , because they have n't done that at that time , they are sitting on their blisters .
but that 's no reason to change the rules .
it 's all the more reason to finally do what should have been done long before .

well , i ca n't feel undermined because the ecb , though we are standing and shouting from the sidelines , is not part of the stability pact as such .
it 's the european commission that is the stability pact 's guardian .

there has also been criticism in europe and america about the reluctance of the ecb to lower interest rates along the lines of the federal reserve bank under federal reserve chairman alan greenspan .
is this criticism justified ?
i think not .
we have interest rates at low levels which have not been seen in europe for the last 40 or 50 years .
the interest rate levels we have are being determined exclusively on the basis of what we think is best for the euro area and not for any other consideration .

it 's sometimes overestimated what monetary policy can do and what it can not do .
our main goal is to safeguard price stability , thereby giving consumers and investors confidence in the future .
it 's mainly the lack of confidence at the moment which comes for other reasons - all the uncertainties - that we are going through a period of very slow economic development .

1 introduction of the euro .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the president of the european central bank takes stock of the euro 's success . wim duisenberg has been president of the european central bank since 1997 .
during his five years there , duisenberg has overseen the smooth introduction of europe 's common currency , the euro , and managed interest rates , prices and inflation in the 12 euro zone countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president wim duisenberg recently , duisenberg has been criticized for not cutting interest rates as agressively as his american counterpart , alan greenspan of the federal reserve bank . he also wants members to maintain the rigid guidelines set in the euro stability pact , which prohibits countries to allow their deficit spending to rise over 3 percent of gross domestic product . in a recent interview with dw-radio , duisenberg took stock of the euro 's progress during the current year and offered frank criticism of a handful of member states for not keeping a tight- enough hold on their budget pursestrings .
it 's been nearly one year since the euro was introduced in europe .
how would you evaluate the year ?
for me , of course , the euro has already existed for sometime longer .
but it 's true the notes and coins have just been introduced .
i would evaluate that unambiguously as a success .
how has the new currency encouraged countries in the euro zone to cooperate more effectively ?
that is a slow process , but having one single currency has its effects on all areas of monetary policy - not only on fiscal and social policy , but even on foreign policy .
it brings countries that have the single currency closer together and it does necessitate ever-closer cooperation .
would you say the euro zone has brought nations together politically ?
that 's also a process .
it is working in that direction .
it is working to bring them closer together and it also works already now towards those countries that are about to become members of the european union - particularly in central and eastern europe .
they will not immediately adopt the euro , but the euro is already a force there .
it exerts its influence in bringing those countries closer to the europe they will one day be a part of .
do you see the candidate countries joining the euro zone ?
they undoubtably will .
they will first sign the accession treaty .
then a process will start involving a number of treaties that will have to be ratified by all the parliaments involved .
but we are already intensively working at the european central bank to integrate them into our work .
this involves working with their central banks to prepare them for the new situation .
they will have to adjust their legal frameworks in various fields .
the financial sector has to be adjusted and adapted - and that , too , is a long , drawn-out process .
but it could happen within five to seven years .
a central part of the treaty would no doubt be the stability pact , the criteria now in place for current euro zone countries .
those criteria are now being discussed in european capitals - especially the three-percent cap on deficit spending .
what do you think about suggestion criteria should be softened , especially in light of germany 's economic troubles ?
i would be very much against it .
the criteria are only just in place .
it 's natural that there are times when it really bites and causes difficulties for some european countries .
then countries talk about changing it .
but i 'm one who thinks you should never change the rules in the middle of the game .
the fact that some countries are now having difficulty meeting the criteria - like germany , france and italy .
it is precisely because of the fact that in the recent past , when everything was going well , they did n't grasp the opportunitiy to better consolidate their public finances .
now , because they have n't done that at that time , they are sitting on their blisters .
but that 's no reason to change the rules .
it 's all the more reason to finally do what should have been done long before .
out of the 12 euro zone countries , eight have already reached that goal .
do you feel undermined by comments by people like european commission president romano prodi , who severely criticizes the stability pact 's guidelines ?
well , i ca n't feel undermined because the ecb , though we are standing and shouting from the sidelines , is not part of the stability pact as such .

turkish officials are upset with the decision . during evening discussions at the eu expansion summit thursday , european leaders and turkish negotiators were finally able to reach agreement on the elusive date on which turkey could begin negotiating for eu entry . danish prime minister anders fogh rassmussen , whose country is leading the summit , announced last night that turkey would begin negotiations for entry at the end of 2004 . the news was received with anger by turkish prime minister abdullah gül , who said the eu did n't appreciate all the efforts turkey has made so far .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.12.2002 rocket failure a setback for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ariane 5 rocket crashed , bringing the european satellite launch industry down with it the failure of ariane 5 has dealt a severe blow to the european satellite launch program .
european space chiefs are now trying to come up with answers to the baffling fiasco . the european space industry is still mystified about what caused the new ariane 5-esca rocket to fail this week , less than three minutes after lift-off .
the new heavy-payload version of the rocket strayed off course just 96 seconds into its maiden flight on wednesday and had to be blown up , ditching its $ 600 million payload of satellites into the atlantic ocean 800 kilometres off the coast of french guiana .
engineers and officials from the european space agency say the problem occurred in the cooling circuit of one of the rocket 's main engines .
a change in engine speed around 180 seconds after take-off caused the launcher to " demonstrate erratic behaviour " .
wednesday 's explosion was the fourth failure of an ariane 5 in fourteen missions .
it was carrying a 10-tonne cargo , heavier than any previous version .
on board were the hot bird 7 eutelsat television broadcast satellite and stentor , a telecommunications satellite developed by the french space agency at a cost of over $ 385 million .
inquiry arianespace , the company that designed the rocket , has announced the establishment of an independent inquiry board to investigate the failure and try to ensure future launches are not affected .
arianespace chief executive jean-yves le gall said the inquiry would begin early next week .
" we will have to clearly explain what happened and if it will have consequences on the ariane 5 launcher in its basic version , " le gall told reporters .
" second , it will tell us when we can resume ariane 5 flights . "
rosetta mission in danger experts say the ariane 5 could be out of action for several months , casting doubt over the mission of the comet-chasing rosetta probe , due to blast off on january 12 .
rosetta , estimated to have cost more than $ 1 billion , is to make an eight-year journey to meet the comet wirtanen , which it will study for nearly two years .
the timing of rosetta 's launch is critical because of its complex trajectory around the planet mars .
setback for europe the ariane 5 failure comes as a huge blow to the european industry at a time when the satellite launch market is in a depression .
demand has been affected by a slowdown in the world telecommunications industry , with fewer commercial satellites being ordered than in previous years .
overproduction of rockets has also caused prices to fall thirty percent lower than they were a decade ago .
in addition , several competitors to ariane 5 have emerged in recent months .
boeing 's delta 4 and lockheed martin 's atlas 5 have both been well-received since their introduction .
arianespace 's dominant position in the commercial market now looks to be seriously threatened , with ariane 5 's failure expected to cause customers to look even more favourably on its rivals .
insurance woes some industry analysts have predicted that the market for satellite launchers could experience an up-turn in the second part of the decade , when satellites will have to be replaced .
they also say higher demand for broadband internet services could translate to a need for more satellite launchers .
but the fallout from wednesday 's failure , already being felt throughout the satellite launch industry , will be lasting .
insurance companies are saying they 'll be forced to increase premiums .
ariane 5 crashed just ten days after the failure of the astra 1k telecoms satellite launch , capping an already bad year for commercial insurers .

european space chiefs are now trying to come up with answers to the baffling fiasco . the european space industry is still mystified about what caused the new ariane 5-esca rocket to fail this week , less than three minutes after lift-off .
the new heavy-payload version of the rocket strayed off course just 96 seconds into its maiden flight on wednesday and had to be blown up , ditching its $ 600 million payload of satellites into the atlantic ocean 800 kilometres off the coast of french guiana .
engineers and officials from the european space agency say the problem occurred in the cooling circuit of one of the rocket 's main engines .
a change in engine speed around 180 seconds after take-off caused the launcher to " demonstrate erratic behaviour " .
wednesday 's explosion was the fourth failure of an ariane 5 in fourteen missions .
it was carrying a 10-tonne cargo , heavier than any previous version .
on board were the hot bird 7 eutelsat television broadcast satellite and stentor , a telecommunications satellite developed by the french space agency at a cost of over $ 385 million .
inquiry arianespace , the company that designed the rocket , has announced the establishment of an independent inquiry board to investigate the failure and try to ensure future launches are not affected .
arianespace chief executive jean-yves le gall said the inquiry would begin early next week .
" we will have to clearly explain what happened and if it will have consequences on the ariane 5 launcher in its basic version , " le gall told reporters .
" second , it will tell us when we can resume ariane 5 flights . "
rosetta mission in danger experts say the ariane 5 could be out of action for several months , casting doubt over the mission of the comet-chasing rosetta probe , due to blast off on january 12 .
rosetta , estimated to have cost more than $ 1 billion , is to make an eight-year journey to meet the comet wirtanen , which it will study for nearly two years .
the timing of rosetta 's launch is critical because of its complex trajectory around the planet mars .
setback for europe the ariane 5 failure comes as a huge blow to the european industry at a time when the satellite launch market is in a depression .
demand has been affected by a slowdown in the world telecommunications industry , with fewer commercial satellites being ordered than in previous years .
overproduction of rockets has also caused prices to fall thirty percent lower than they were a decade ago .
in addition , several competitors to ariane 5 have emerged in recent months .
boeing 's delta 4 and lockheed martin 's atlas 5 have both been well-received since their introduction .
arianespace 's dominant position in the commercial market now looks to be seriously threatened , with ariane 5 's failure expected to cause customers to look even more favourably on its rivals .
insurance woes some industry analysts have predicted that the market for satellite launchers could experience an up-turn in the second part of the decade , when satellites will have to be replaced .
they also say higher demand for broadband internet services could translate to a need for more satellite launchers .
but the fallout from wednesday 's failure , already being felt throughout the satellite launch industry , will be lasting .
insurance companies are saying they 'll be forced to increase premiums .

1 introduction of the euro .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the president of the european central bank takes stock of the euro 's success . wim duisenberg has been president of the european central bank since 1997 .
during his five years there , duisenberg has overseen the smooth introduction of europe 's common currency , the euro , and managed interest rates , prices and inflation in the 12 euro zone countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president wim duisenberg recently , duisenberg has been criticized for not cutting interest rates as agressively as his american counterpart , alan greenspan of the federal reserve bank . he also wants members to maintain the rigid guidelines set in the euro stability pact , which prohibits countries to allow their deficit spending to rise over 3 percent of gross domestic product . in a recent interview with dw-radio , duisenberg took stock of the euro 's progress during the current year and offered frank criticism of a handful of member states for not keeping a tight- enough hold on their budget pursestrings .
it 's been nearly one year since the euro was introduced in europe .
how would you evaluate the year ?
for me , of course , the euro has already existed for sometime longer .
but it 's true the notes and coins have just been introduced .
i would evaluate that unambiguously as a success .
how has the new currency encouraged countries in the euro zone to cooperate more effectively ?
that is a slow process , but having one single currency has its effects on all areas of monetary policy - not only on fiscal and social policy , but even on foreign policy .
it brings countries that have the single currency closer together and it does necessitate ever-closer cooperation .
would you say the euro zone has brought nations together politically ?
that 's also a process .
it is working in that direction .
it is working to bring them closer together and it also works already now towards those countries that are about to become members of the european union - particularly in central and eastern europe .
they will not immediately adopt the euro , but the euro is already a force there .
it exerts its influence in bringing those countries closer to the europe they will one day be a part of .
do you see the candidate countries joining the euro zone ?
they undoubtably will .
they will first sign the accession treaty .
then a process will start involving a number of treaties that will have to be ratified by all the parliaments involved .
but we are already intensively working at the european central bank to integrate them into our work .
this involves working with their central banks to prepare them for the new situation .
they will have to adjust their legal frameworks in various fields .
the financial sector has to be adjusted and adapted - and that , too , is a long , drawn-out process .
but it could happen within five to seven years .
a central part of the treaty would no doubt be the stability pact , the criteria now in place for current euro zone countries .
those criteria are now being discussed in european capitals - especially the three-percent cap on deficit spending .
what do you think about suggestion criteria should be softened , especially in light of germany 's economic troubles ?
i would be very much against it .
the criteria are only just in place .
it 's natural that there are times when it really bites and causes difficulties for some european countries .
then countries talk about changing it .
but i 'm one who thinks you should never change the rules in the middle of the game .
the fact that some countries are now having difficulty meeting the criteria - like germany , france and italy .
it is precisely because of the fact that in the recent past , when everything was going well , they did n't grasp the opportunitiy to better consolidate their public finances .
now , because they have n't done that at that time , they are sitting on their blisters .
but that 's no reason to change the rules .
it 's all the more reason to finally do what should have been done long before .
out of the 12 euro zone countries , eight have already reached that goal .
do you feel undermined by comments by people like european commission president romano prodi , who severely criticizes the stability pact 's guidelines ?
well , i ca n't feel undermined because the ecb , though we are standing and shouting from the sidelines , is not part of the stability pact as such .
it 's the european commission that is the stability pact 's guardian .
we support the european commission in in every respect in their function as the guardian of the stability and growth pact .
but as for mr. prodi 's criticism , let me simply say that i do not share his views and would not have said what he said .
there has also been criticism in europe and america about the reluctance of the ecb to lower interest rates along the lines of the federal reserve bank under federal reserve chairman alan greenspan .
is this criticism justified ?
i think not .
we have interest rates at low levels which have not been seen in europe for the last 40 or 50 years .
the interest rate levels we have are being determined exclusively on the basis of what we think is best for the euro area and not for any other consideration .
last week we lowered our interest rate even further .
liquidity , money in the euro zone is ample .
in no way is the monetary policy stance an inhibition for the resumption of growth and growth of employment .
does that mean that at some point in the future lower rates could not be an economic tool ?
it 's sometimes overestimated what monetary policy can do and what it can not do .
our main goal is to safeguard price stability , thereby giving consumers and investors confidence in the future .
it 's mainly the lack of confidence at the moment which comes for other reasons - all the uncertainties - that we are going through a period of very slow economic development .
we have to rebuild confidence and that takes time .
you can lose confidence in a day , but to regain it may take a year .
you mentioned lack of confidence and instability .
how do you think a war against iraq would affect the euro ?
i ca n't possibly speculate on that .
the main impact we might see is on the oil market and oil prices .
that 's one of the uncertainties that hangs over our heads , but you ca n't possibly speculate to what extent it might have an impact on the euro .
as far as oil prices are concerned , if they rise suddenly , that would have an impact on our internal price stability .
that would be the main impact .
if it had a lasting impact , we would react .
if it had only a short-term impact , we would do nothing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

1 introduction of the euro .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the president of the european central bank takes stock of the euro 's success . wim duisenberg has been president of the european central bank since 1997 .
during his five years there , duisenberg has overseen the smooth introduction of europe 's common currency , the euro , and managed interest rates , prices and inflation in the 12 euro zone countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president wim duisenberg recently , duisenberg has been criticized for not cutting interest rates as agressively as his american counterpart , alan greenspan of the federal reserve bank . he also wants members to maintain the rigid guidelines set in the euro stability pact , which prohibits countries to allow their deficit spending to rise over 3 percent of gross domestic product . in a recent interview with dw-radio , duisenberg took stock of the euro 's progress during the current year and offered frank criticism of a handful of member states for not keeping a tight- enough hold on their budget pursestrings .
it 's been nearly one year since the euro was introduced in europe .
how would you evaluate the year ?
for me , of course , the euro has already existed for sometime longer .
but it 's true the notes and coins have just been introduced .
i would evaluate that unambiguously as a success .
how has the new currency encouraged countries in the euro zone to cooperate more effectively ?
that is a slow process , but having one single currency has its effects on all areas of monetary policy - not only on fiscal and social policy , but even on foreign policy .
it brings countries that have the single currency closer together and it does necessitate ever-closer cooperation .
would you say the euro zone has brought nations together politically ?
that 's also a process .
it is working in that direction .
it is working to bring them closer together and it also works already now towards those countries that are about to become members of the european union - particularly in central and eastern europe .
they will not immediately adopt the euro , but the euro is already a force there .
it exerts its influence in bringing those countries closer to the europe they will one day be a part of .

turkish cypriots diplomats said on friday that they were prepared to sign a " letter of intent " with greek cypriots to discuss a u.n. plan to reunite their divided mediterranean island .
the u.n. plan forsees a state based on two largely autonomous greek and turkish zones and calls for an agreement by late february followed by referendums on both sides .
the " letter of intent " however is a diluted version of what eu leaders were hoping would be the inking of a framework agreement at the copenhagen summit by both sides .
a " christian fortress " around europe ?
earlier turkish leaders reacted angrily to the eu ’ s proposal of a december 2004 review of turkey ’ s implementation of reforms and if successful , a date for accession talks in 2005 .
they are also smarting that that the internationally recognized greek cypriot government on cyprus is set to join the eu in 2004 .
earlier on friday the turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash accused the european union of seeking to build a " christian fortress " around turkey and effectively ruled out a deal to reunite cyprus at the summit .
" the european union ’ s interest is to delay turkey and to take cyprus , to possess cyprus and to build something like a christian fortress around turkey , " he told a news conference in the turkish capital of ankara .
will any deal on cyprus be reached at all ?
however it remains unclear whether the summit will see any kind of agreement at all between the greeks and cypriots .
greek cypriot attorney general alecos markides told cyprus television from copenhagen that there was no need for any letter of intent .
" if they are committing themselves and they have told de soto -lrb- u.n. envoy -rrb- they are to cooperate , we don ’ t need letters of intent or anything like that . "
even u.n. secretary-general kofi anan acknowledged on friday that a deal to reunite cyprus would not be reached at the eu summit in copenhagen .
" we were very close , and i was very hopeful that we could get an agreement , and i recall telling -lrb- turkish leader tayyip -rrb- erdogan that like an old soccer player like himself , the games is not over until the final whistle , and it looks as if we are not going to get there , " anan said .
cyprus has been a divided island since a turkish invasion in 1974 prompted by a brief greek-inspired coup in nicosia .
the self-declared turkish republic of northern cyprus , which accounts for about 18 percent of the island ’ s 750,000-strong population is only recognized by turkey .
the eu has always maintained that in the absence of a settlement to unite the island , it would take in only the internationally recognized greek cypriot part of the island , with which it has been negotiating .
historic deal clinched with poland meanwhile the eu had better luck with another obstacle plaguing enlargement talks in recent months .
a danish presidency official announced on friday that all 10 candidates had accepted financial packages at the end of the two-day summit in copenhagen .
" we have a deal , " the official told reuters after swedish prime minister goran persson and polish finance minister grzegorz kolodko confirmed that poland , the biggest and most difficult candidate , had accepted a financial settlement .
german chancellor gerhard schröder had earlier said that a solution had been found to give poland a special cashflow facility for its years of eu membership without raising the overall cost of enlargement .
the eu had proposed reshuffling funds from various sources to give poland about a billion extra euros in 2005 and 6 .
that money would then have been deducted from eu aid to warsaw in following years .
the polish acceptance of the renewed offer came after agonizingly long-drawn out negotiations which dragged the summit into overtime .
however the deal with poland brings to a close one of the trickiest negotiation chapters in the enlargement project , which often threatened to jeopardize it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey gets its date with the eu the eu said turkey could begin negotiations for entry at the end of 2004 , more than one year later than ankara had hoped for .
turkish officials are upset with the decision .

turkish cypriots diplomats said on friday that they were prepared to sign a " letter of intent " with greek cypriots to discuss a u.n. plan to reunite their divided mediterranean island .
the u.n. plan forsees a state based on two largely autonomous greek and turkish zones and calls for an agreement by late february followed by referendums on both sides .

they are also smarting that that the internationally recognized greek cypriot government on cyprus is set to join the eu in 2004 .

however it remains unclear whether the summit will see any kind of agreement at all between the greeks and cypriots .
greek cypriot attorney general alecos markides told cyprus television from copenhagen that there was no need for any letter of intent .
" if they are committing themselves and they have told de soto -lrb- u.n. envoy -rrb- they are to cooperate , we don ’ t need letters of intent or anything like that . "

turkish officials are upset with the decision . during evening discussions at the eu expansion summit thursday , european leaders and turkish negotiators were finally able to reach agreement on the elusive date on which turkey could begin negotiating for eu entry . danish prime minister anders fogh rassmussen , whose country is leading the summit , announced last night that turkey would begin negotiations for entry at the end of 2004 . the news was received with anger by turkish prime minister abdullah gül , who said the eu did n't appreciate all the efforts turkey has made so far . " this is impossible to accept , " gül said , after meeting with british prime minister tony blair , who supported an earlier negotiation date for turkey . turkey had been lobbying hard for eu entry since passing a host of human rights legislation last summer .
the eu first declared the country a candidate in 1999 .
since then , ankara had hoped it could join the union with the ten other eastern european and mediterranean countries in 2004 . the past few weeks have seen an intense lobbying effort in european capitals on the part of turkish leader recep tayyip erdogan .
though well received in italy , spain and the uk , erdogan ’ s lobbying seemed to annoy other countries . “ many found the -lrb- turkish lobbying -rrb- regrettable and unacceptable , ” said italian prime minister silvio berlusconi . the us , which will need turkey ’ s help in a possible iraq invasion , had also urged the eu to name a date .
the eventual compromise bore strong resemblance to a franco-german proposal to get turkey a date in 2005 should it continue to pass human rights legislation in line with eu membership requirements .
the turkish delegation to the copenhagen summit told reporters that they want to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder and french leader jacques chirac .

police have arrested a man who claims to have killed and eaten a friend and recorded the deed on video , allegedly with the victim 's approval .
the 41-year-old suspect from the picturesque hessian town of rotenburg told police that he met his 42-year-old victim , microchip engineer from berlin , via the internet .
he said they shared homosexual and cannibalistic leanings . police said they found the video along with deep-frozen flesh and skeletal remains when they searched the suspect 's flat .

forensic experts are searching the house and surrounding areas for the remains of other possible victims .
internet clue the killing goes back to 2001 .
police only stumbled across it after the man placed another ad in the internet looking for a man willing to allow himself to be killed and eaten .
the last alleged case of cannibalism in germany dates back to 1995 when a 33-year-old man standing trial for murder and robbery claimed to have eaten parts of his victim , however , his claim was never proven .
police say the suspect is not mentally disturbed .
a spokesman said had that been the case he would have been placed in a psychiatric unit instead of a detention cell .
the man is being held on suspicion of murder which carries a life sentence . should his story check out , he would only face a charge of so-called murder by demand . a conviction would be punishable by a maximum of five years in prison . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.12.2002 bearing the precious burden of enlargement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indefatigable advocate of the european project : günter verheugen the success of the eu 's most ambitious project - the ' big bang ' expansion to include ten new countries , depends on günter verheugen , the first , and possibly the last , eu commissioner for enlargement . it 's been one of the most difficult months of günter verheugen 's career .
since the irish gave the go-ahead for eu enlargement in october , the fifty-eight year old has been working round the clock to try to secure a peace deal in cyprus , find a way forward for turkey 's candidacy , keep poland 's financial expectations in check and persuade reluctant eu members that for forty billion euros , they 're getting enlargement on the cheap .
even as the enlargement project was poised to enter the final stages in copenhagen , commissioner verheugen was still at it - urging participants to show political courage and strong leadership .
european expansion must take place " now or never " , he told german television .
" a failure in copenhagen or a delay could have serious effects on public opinion in the future member states . "
the jewel in the crown for verheugen , the copenhagen summit represents his greatest achievement as enlargement commissioner .
" nothing more can go wrong , " he says .
" when it 's all over , i 'll feel an enormous sense of relief . "
this is about as close to sentimentality as verheugen gets .
even after succeeding in closing what looked like an impossible gap between the member states and accession countries ahead of the copenhagen meeting , the commissioner was insisting that it was still too soon for celebrations .
nor is verheugen inclined to take all the credit for creating an expanded europe .
" it 's a structure made up of many thousands of individual bricks , " he says .
verheugen sees himself as an architect , but not a miracle-worker .
challenges in office for four years , verheugen has complained that his is a lonely job .
that 's hardly surprising , given that he 's spent more time on the road , travelling between the eu candidate countries and the fifteen member states , than back home in brussels .
but the white-haired , thick-spectacled verheugen has no doubts about what he 's doing .
the peoples of central and eastern europe must be welcomed into the family of european democracies , he says , in order to close a historical chapter during which they were persecuted by oppressive totalitarian regimes .
maintaining enthusiasm for the european project within the eu as well as in the candidate countries has been one of the biggest challenges verheugen has faced as commissioner .
he 's had to work hard to convince eu members that the accession countries are doing their best to implement reforms .
all the while , verheugen sees that the candidate countries are losing patience , and they 're no longer prepared to accept membership at any price .
he 's issued a stern warning to poland , the czech republic and hungary to keep their demands in check , saying " the eu is n't an automatic teller machine .
you do n't just stick in your membership card and expect money to come out the bottom " .
getting eu members to agree on the hefty enlargement budget has been just as difficult .
verheugen has appealed to the member states to show more generosity , pushing the benefits he argues will come from an expanded european economic zone and new export markets .
a party man verheugen 's skills in diplomacy have been developed over a long political career . born in germany in 1944 , just before the end of wwii , he studied history and worked for a short time as a journalist before entering politics .
he became federal party manager of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- at the age of thirty-two .
five years later , having helped the fdp achieve its best result ever in national elections , he switched to the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
it was a difficult time for verheugen .
the son of a small-town banker , he was not welcomed by some in the spd , who never forgave him for his prior allegiance to the liberal democrats .
nevertheless , in 1993 , verheugen became the spd 's federal party manager , an important step in his political career .
the chance of a lifetime after gerhard schröder 's election victory in 1998 , verheugen had hoped to get the job of defence minister in his new cabinet .
instead , he was sent to brussels as foreign policy advisor , and a year later took up the post of eu commissioner responsible for enlargement .
verheugen has described the move as a " chance which only comes along once in a lifetime ... to do something that has a lasting impact and affects the lives of entire peoples " .
probably the biggest test of günter verheugen 's career - the question of turkey 's membership - still lies ahead .

since the irish gave the go-ahead for eu enlargement in october , the fifty-eight year old has been working round the clock to try to secure a peace deal in cyprus , find a way forward for turkey 's candidacy , keep poland 's financial expectations in check and persuade reluctant eu members that for forty billion euros , they 're getting enlargement on the cheap .
even as the enlargement project was poised to enter the final stages in copenhagen , commissioner verheugen was still at it - urging participants to show political courage and strong leadership .
european expansion must take place " now or never " , he told german television .
" a failure in copenhagen or a delay could have serious effects on public opinion in the future member states . "
the jewel in the crown for verheugen , the copenhagen summit represents his greatest achievement as enlargement commissioner .
" nothing more can go wrong , " he says .
" when it 's all over , i 'll feel an enormous sense of relief . "
this is about as close to sentimentality as verheugen gets .
even after succeeding in closing what looked like an impossible gap between the member states and accession countries ahead of the copenhagen meeting , the commissioner was insisting that it was still too soon for celebrations .
nor is verheugen inclined to take all the credit for creating an expanded europe .
" it 's a structure made up of many thousands of individual bricks , " he says .
verheugen sees himself as an architect , but not a miracle-worker .
challenges in office for four years , verheugen has complained that his is a lonely job .
that 's hardly surprising , given that he 's spent more time on the road , travelling between the eu candidate countries and the fifteen member states , than back home in brussels .
but the white-haired , thick-spectacled verheugen has no doubts about what he 's doing .
the peoples of central and eastern europe must be welcomed into the family of european democracies , he says , in order to close a historical chapter during which they were persecuted by oppressive totalitarian regimes .
maintaining enthusiasm for the european project within the eu as well as in the candidate countries has been one of the biggest challenges verheugen has faced as commissioner .
he 's had to work hard to convince eu members that the accession countries are doing their best to implement reforms .
all the while , verheugen sees that the candidate countries are losing patience , and they 're no longer prepared to accept membership at any price .
he 's issued a stern warning to poland , the czech republic and hungary to keep their demands in check , saying " the eu is n't an automatic teller machine .
you do n't just stick in your membership card and expect money to come out the bottom " .
getting eu members to agree on the hefty enlargement budget has been just as difficult .
verheugen has appealed to the member states to show more generosity , pushing the benefits he argues will come from an expanded european economic zone and new export markets .
a party man verheugen 's skills in diplomacy have been developed over a long political career . born in germany in 1944 , just before the end of wwii , he studied history and worked for a short time as a journalist before entering politics .
he became federal party manager of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- at the age of thirty-two .
five years later , having helped the fdp achieve its best result ever in national elections , he switched to the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
it was a difficult time for verheugen .
the son of a small-town banker , he was not welcomed by some in the spd , who never forgave him for his prior allegiance to the liberal democrats .
nevertheless , in 1993 , verheugen became the spd 's federal party manager , an important step in his political career .
the chance of a lifetime after gerhard schröder 's election victory in 1998 , verheugen had hoped to get the job of defence minister in his new cabinet .
instead , he was sent to brussels as foreign policy advisor , and a year later took up the post of eu commissioner responsible for enlargement .
verheugen has described the move as a " chance which only comes along once in a lifetime ... to do something that has a lasting impact and affects the lives of entire peoples " .
probably the biggest test of günter verheugen 's career - the question of turkey 's membership - still lies ahead .
even if he succeeds , it 's unlikely that he 'll be around to see it happen .

turkish officials are upset with the decision . during evening discussions at the eu expansion summit thursday , european leaders and turkish negotiators were finally able to reach agreement on the elusive date on which turkey could begin negotiating for eu entry . danish prime minister anders fogh rassmussen , whose country is leading the summit , announced last night that turkey would begin negotiations for entry at the end of 2004 . the news was received with anger by turkish prime minister abdullah gül , who said the eu did n't appreciate all the efforts turkey has made so far . " this is impossible to accept , " gül said , after meeting with british prime minister tony blair , who supported an earlier negotiation date for turkey . turkey had been lobbying hard for eu entry since passing a host of human rights legislation last summer .
the eu first declared the country a candidate in 1999 .
since then , ankara had hoped it could join the union with the ten other eastern european and mediterranean countries in 2004 . the past few weeks have seen an intense lobbying effort in european capitals on the part of turkish leader recep tayyip erdogan .
though well received in italy , spain and the uk , erdogan ’ s lobbying seemed to annoy other countries . “ many found the -lrb- turkish lobbying -rrb- regrettable and unacceptable , ” said italian prime minister silvio berlusconi . the us , which will need turkey ’ s help in a possible iraq invasion , had also urged the eu to name a date .
the eventual compromise bore strong resemblance to a franco-german proposal to get turkey a date in 2005 should it continue to pass human rights legislation in line with eu membership requirements .
the turkish delegation to the copenhagen summit told reporters that they want to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder and french leader jacques chirac .
they promised to continue to fight to change the date . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union dw-world 's main eu dossier 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the deed was allegedly recorded on video . for a day at least , germans may have forgotten about their economic woes as the country found itself hitting the headlines over an altogether more frightening story .
police have arrested a man who claims to have killed and eaten a friend and recorded the deed on video , allegedly with the victim 's approval .
the 41-year-old suspect from the picturesque hessian town of rotenburg told police that he met his 42-year-old victim , microchip engineer from berlin , via the internet .
he said they shared homosexual and cannibalistic leanings . police said they found the video along with deep-frozen flesh and skeletal remains when they searched the suspect 's flat .
the video allegedly shows the suspect and the victim agreeing on the murder .
forensic experts are searching the house and surrounding areas for the remains of other possible victims .
internet clue the killing goes back to 2001 .
police only stumbled across it after the man placed another ad in the internet looking for a man willing to allow himself to be killed and eaten .
the last alleged case of cannibalism in germany dates back to 1995 when a 33-year-old man standing trial for murder and robbery claimed to have eaten parts of his victim , however , his claim was never proven .
police say the suspect is not mentally disturbed .
a spokesman said had that been the case he would have been placed in a psychiatric unit instead of a detention cell .
the man is being held on suspicion of murder which carries a life sentence . should his story check out , he would only face a charge of so-called murder by demand . a conviction would be punishable by a maximum of five years in prison . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 07 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

nine of the deaths were directly attributable to sub-standard care and a further 268 were closely linked to it , according to an independent report .
in all there were 4,493 recorded deaths in surgical departments in 2001 , of which 4,049 were examined by the study .
the figures come in a review carried out by the scottish audit of surgical mortality -lrb- sasm -rrb- into deaths under the care of a surgeon in hospital before and after operations .
in 330 cases , the participating surgeon or anaesthetist said there were shortfalls in the quality of care received by patients but thought this had not affected their condition .
it is only by undertaking a careful and critical look at the work we do that we can hope to improve further dr peter terry british medical association health minister malcolm chisholm welcomed the report , which he said was a thorough examination of care provided by hospital surgeons .
" it enables surgeons to receive feedback on individual cases , while for patients and their families , it provides the reassurance that their surgeon 's work is reviewed by professional surgical and anaesthetic colleagues , " he said .
he said steps were being taken to improve areas in which some surgeons were under-performing .
' cause for concern ' but scottish national party health spokeswoman nicola sturgeon said it was " a matter of genuine concern " that 277 deaths had been linked to poor surgical care .
she said : " a single death is one too many and we must forever be working to improve standards and prevent mistakes . "
she also called for the publication of individual death rates for all consultants .
professor john temple , the chairman of sasm , said the study showed that surgeons ' performance had improved in recent years .
the study examined 4,049 deaths " this report contains much good news : a continuing reduction in elective deaths and improvements in pre- and post-operative care , " he said .
the chairman of the british medical association 's scottish committee for hospital medical services , dr peter terry , said the figures showed that most surgeons were continuing to do a good job , despite upheavals in the nhs .
he said : " it is only by undertaking a careful and critical look at the work we do that we can hope to improve further . "
deaths falling overall , the number of reported patient deaths in surgical care has fallen from a high of 4,579 in 1996 .
the audit is compiled from forms filled out by surgeons about deaths in their care , which are then assessed by consultant surgeons and anaesthetists .
participation is voluntary , and this year consultants failed to return forms on 444 deaths .
members of the sasm board have expressed concern that the number of forms which are not returned has increased in recent years .

stuart rhys cunningham-jones , 12 , died and at least 10 other cowbridge comprehensive school pupils were injured when their bus fell down an embankment and hit a tree on 3 december .
an inquest opened on wednesday could not determine the exact cause of his death without more tests , but heard he was sitting at the front of the top deck .
teachers and school friends joined stuart 's parents for a funeral service at holy cross church , cowbridge , on friday .
the reverend richard spencer said : " we wanted to have a service that reflected some of stuart 's personality and also enable people to grieve , because people will need to grieve . "

current uk law exempts double-decker buses carrying children from installing seatbelts - that rule only applies to coaches and mini-buses used for school journeys .
detectives said the number of passengers on the vehicle - which did not have seatbelts - was 75 , which did not exceed the legal limit .
last week in the house of commons , prime minister tony blair expressed his deepest sympathy for stuart 's family .
vale of glamorgan mp john smith had asked him whether the uk government would launch a comprehensive review of the safe transportation of school children .
but mr blair said the police inquiry should be allowed to finish its work .

the bank of japan 's quarterly tankan survey recorded a better-than-expected rise in confidence .
but the lull is likely to be short-lived , with gains in manufacturing outweighed by persistent gloom among service industries .
the tankan " confirms the 2002 story of strong export-led growth and no feed-through to domestic demand " , said jesper koll , chief economist at merrill lynch .
unless the export benefits do make it into the home market , the chances of stopping deflation strangling any potential recovery remain slim .
export-led japan 's miraculous economic performance for most of the past half-century was built on a concerted drive for exports , and the experience gained is still paying off .
in june confidence rose sharply as hopes for a strong turnaround in the us fed optimism among manufacturers .
but since then the us recovery has faltered and japanese optimism has faded .
the tankan survey of 8,414 firms said there was little hope of a sustained recovery in sentiment even among the big manufacturers , with more investment cutbacks pencilled in for 2003 .
market gloom the news from within japan remained pessimistic as growth slowed .
the construction industry is still building huge tower blocks , partly funded by public money and helped by the fact that the building firms ' unsustainable debts are still being propped up by their banks .
but profits and revenues are plunging , and the tankan survey found that in the construction sector , confidence had slipped .
the markets were disappointed by the bank of japan 's figures .
the benchmark nikkei 225 index slid more than 2 % to end friday at a three-week low of 8,516 points .
and there was a 0.7 yen slip against the dollar to 122.58 yen at 0600 gmt .
