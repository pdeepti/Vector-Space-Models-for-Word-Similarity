22 elections . views on how to proceed split down party lines , with the red-green government , led by schröder and green foreign minister joschka fischer reiterating their position that germany would not participate in any military action against iraq and the conservative opposition showing a willingness to consider bush 's un ultimatum . schröder : bush partly correct " his -lrb- bush 's -rrb- demand that the regime in baghdad must comply with the u.n. resolutions is partly correct , " schröder told members of the german parliament , the bundestag .
" it was never debatable that weapons inspectors must return to the country .
but what remains disputable is whether another objective should be allowed to replace this objective as the focal point of the discussion . " schröder said it was a positive development that bush had pushed the issue of u.n. resolutions back to the center of the debate and praised bush for reaffirming the un 's importance .
he added germany would use all " diplomatic " and " economic " possibilities to support efforts to force saddam hussein into compliance . however , the chancellor reiterated his concern that any military action against iraq could cause the loosely-knit international coalition against terror to unravel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- joined schröder friday in defending germany 's stance .

" stoiber warned that , with its " anti-american " position , the red-green government threatened to isolate germany from other european countries . but he said he doubted that germany 's army , the bundeswehr , would be asked to participate in any military intervention , anyway . in words that seemed to mirror warnings issued against bush lately , christian democratic union chairwoman angela merkel cautioned against germany " going its own way " on the iraq issue .
she said the government 's current position could not be maintained and accused schröder of changing his position from " unlimited solidarity " with the u.s. to " unlimited unilateralism . " eu lauds bush speech as the iraq debate raged on in germany , it reduced intensity in other parts of europe on friday .
speaking for the european union , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said bush 's speech proved that the united states was interested in pursuing a multilateralist approach .

22 elections . views on how to proceed split down party lines , with the red-green government , led by schröder and green foreign minister joschka fischer reiterating their position that germany would not participate in any military action against iraq and the conservative opposition showing a willingness to consider bush 's un ultimatum . schröder : bush partly correct " his -lrb- bush 's -rrb- demand that the regime in baghdad must comply with the u.n. resolutions is partly correct , " schröder told members of the german parliament , the bundestag .
" it was never debatable that weapons inspectors must return to the country .
but what remains disputable is whether another objective should be allowed to replace this objective as the focal point of the discussion . " schröder said it was a positive development that bush had pushed the issue of u.n. resolutions back to the center of the debate and praised bush for reaffirming the un 's importance .

the news is not good .
the hopeful states have been told that funding promised on receiving full membership is being delayed by at least two years .
on top of that , the countries are still expected to make membership payments while they wait . the european commission 's so-called ' working document ' on the calculation of net budgetary balances for new members sums up the full financial consequences of enlargement for potential new member states between 2004 and 2006 .
the possible enlargement of the european union to 30 countries is the most significant event in the history of the eu since its inception in 1957 .
spreading its borders as far as finland in the north and greece in the east , the eu hopes to become a more powerful player in international political and economic spheres .
however , the subject of enlargement has already divided europe before it has brought it together .
the payment of farming subsidies to be delayed those wanting to be part of the eu now have major financial concerns .
the european commission 's offer to give new members 25 per cent of the agricultural subsidies it gives current members is not going to happen in 2004 , as planned .
the subject is already a thorny one between eu members , many of which object to paying out farm subsidies to new members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash for crops payment to come two years later according to the commission 's working paper , the root cause of the whole funding problem is not the lack of money , but its slow movement .
the paper states that the farming subsidy payment is subject to what it calls " budget lag . "
the commission document assumes the flow of funds will speed up in 2005 and 2006 , but even then , a major part of the new members ' income will come from late payments for allocations made for 2004 .
it has already been made clear by the commission that these terms are the best the candidates can get .
the explanation for the lack of promised cash will not please any of the candidates , all of which have said they are looking for significant improvements in their finances from the first year of enlargement onward .
new members will have trouble ' making ends meet ' in fact , the european commission reckons the european union will have a difficult time helping the new members make ends meet in 2004 , with the situation only improving over the next two years .
what happens after 2006 is an open question at this point , as the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 has yet to be negotiated .
by that time , the new members hope to be full partners at the negotiating table .
until then , however , most of them will have a hard time avoiding paying more into the eu budget than they receive from it . in fact , the european commission calculates that in 2004 , only the three baltic countries will see sizeable improvements in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the safety of nuclear sites will not be compromised by funding problems lithuania , which will already benefit from the nuclear ' safety-program ' fund , latvia , and estonia expect to receive well needed money after one year of membership .
poland , by far the largest , and far from the richest , of the applicants will benefit to a lesser degree .
all the others - cyprus , malta , slovenia , hungary , the czech republic , and even slovakia - could lose out , according to the projections .
redevelopment funds are also subject to ' budget lag ' and it gets worse .
in the case of the second biggest expense for the eu after agricultural subsidies , the ' structural funds ' which are designed to finance regional economies , only 16 per cent of the 2004 allocations can be released that year in the form of advance payments .
other development funds will also be less than expected .
the allure of membership is beginning to dim in the light of the paper .
while waiting for delayed payments , the new members are expected to assume full responsibility for their own financial membership obligations .
new states will have to pay up like the rest of the club from 2004 onward , they will be making full contributions to the eu budget , which demand the same percentage of their gross national products -lrb- gnp -rrb- as the contributions made by current eu members .
the candidates are expected to contribute roughly three billion euro of the annual eu budget of 98.6 billion euro that all member states pay into .
intriguingly , some of the current net contributors to the eu budget - germany , the netherlands , austria , and sweden - have negotiated a reduction in their share of the british rebate payments .
according to commission calculations , the new members will in addition need to share the extra burden generated by these reductions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links european union enlargement the european union 's web site concerning all aspects of the proposed enlargement with a clickable map with information on candidate states .

europe 's editorialists were n't as satisfied . the european union , which has so far presented a schizophrenic stance on a possible us invasion of iraq , welcomed president george w. bush 's speech at the united nations on thursday .
the speech proved that the united states was interested in pursuing a multilateralist approach , said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , the eu representative at the speech .
other european ministers echoed rasmussen , saying they were pleased that bush had agreed to involve the united nations in the final decision .
the speech was " very hard , clear and obvious , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who attended the speech . he said the signal sent to iraq was clear and demanded bagdad let un weapons inspectors back into the country .
germany is the only one of the 15 eu member countries to categorically reject a us invasion of iraq , even with a un mandate .
in reference to his country 's position , fischer said the german government was still " deeply concerned " about the aftermath of such an invasion .
british prime minister tony blair , bush 's staunchest ally in europe , greeted the speech " warmly " said a spokesperson .
blair said great britain would be heavily involved in shaping the un resolution , talks on which are expected by the end of the month .
preparations have already begun the comments came amid reports great britain 's armed forces had already begun preparing itself for the " biggest operation in years " according to the british broadcasting corporation . british media said the army was stockpiling weapons , supplies and military craft in a harbor in the south of the country .
the united states has already moved its operational command to qatar , a half-island abbuting saudi arabia .
such preparations prove that in the " thoughts and decisions of many , the war against iraq has already begun , " wrote the french daily " le figaro " in a friday editorial .
" only appeasement by iraq or a miracle can still stop it .
should war be avoided then it would definitely not hurt the usa , and this also wo n't occur without their support . " the left-leaning danish newspaper " politiken " praised bush 's attempt at multiateralism .
" no democratic government can call bush 's demands unreasonable , " it wrote .
" they are not meant as a threat against the iraqi people .
nothing is keeping saddam hussein from doing his people a favor ...
bush did right to demand the international community show some backbone . "
great britain 's left-leaning " guardian " newspaper said bush left a major question unanswered .
" what was signally lacking from mr bush 's speech was any information showing how or why these abuses have suddenly grown more egregious or less tolerable than before , " according to the editorial . " in other words , mr bush had the chance to answer the much-asked question : why now ?
and he dodged it . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush offers un , iraq ultimatum u.s. president george w. bush made it clear in his speech before the general assembly on thursday that if the united nations doesn ’ t take joint action against iraq and saddam hussein , then the united states will .

more than 100,000 mini coopers and mini cooper s models have been sold all over the world , 76,500 alone in the first half of this year . sales rise in germany with the help of mini , but also other bmw brands , such as the new 7 series , sales have surged in europe – reaching an all-time sales increase in the uk of 71 per cent to 7,800 cars -lrb- 2001:4,500 -rrb- , followed by italy – up by 46 per cent to 6,100 automobiles , and spain – up 23 per cent to 4,700 cars . on the the difficult german market , sales increased by 11 per cent to 23,900 units . in addition , sales rose by 15 per cent in the us , and in canada by 50 per cent . new image ? analysts say the car maker ’ s current sales success – at a time of weakness both globally and in bmw ’ s key markets in the us and germany – are the result of the careful reshaping of the company ’ s image . “ bmw has moved on from the negative “ yuppie ” envy provoking connotations that haunted the brand in the late 1980s -lrb- … . -rrb- to become a widely recognized mark of achievement , ” merrill lynch automative analyst stephan reitmann told the bbc earlier this year . new cars for new target groups but bmw also sees its current success in the widening of its range of models , and the introduction of new brands for new target groups . “ what is going on on the automobile market is an increasing polarisation , ” ganal told spiegel online this week .
“ on the one hand the number of premium brands for exclusive cars is growing .
on the other hand , however , there are too many markets , who are still grappling with simple transport problems ” – meaning the increasing demand for small , simple , but still high-quality cars . after this year ’ s success with mini , bmw is now planning on introducing a new 1 series in 2004 , a car , according to ganal for “ people , who don ’ t necessarily want a large car , but one with substance ” . in addition , bmw will continue to focus on exclusive brands , including rolls royce which bmw will take over in 2003 .
to fill the gap between rolls royce and the 1 series , bmw will also be introducing the 6 series in 2004 , a large sport coupe ´ which , ganal said in spiegel , “ will help streamline bmw ’ s character and profile .

the news is not good .
the hopeful states have been told that funding promised on receiving full membership is being delayed by at least two years .
on top of that , the countries are still expected to make membership payments while they wait . the european commission 's so-called ' working document ' on the calculation of net budgetary balances for new members sums up the full financial consequences of enlargement for potential new member states between 2004 and 2006 .
the possible enlargement of the european union to 30 countries is the most significant event in the history of the eu since its inception in 1957 .
spreading its borders as far as finland in the north and greece in the east , the eu hopes to become a more powerful player in international political and economic spheres .
however , the subject of enlargement has already divided europe before it has brought it together .
the payment of farming subsidies to be delayed those wanting to be part of the eu now have major financial concerns .
the european commission 's offer to give new members 25 per cent of the agricultural subsidies it gives current members is not going to happen in 2004 , as planned .
the subject is already a thorny one between eu members , many of which object to paying out farm subsidies to new members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash for crops payment to come two years later according to the commission 's working paper , the root cause of the whole funding problem is not the lack of money , but its slow movement .
the paper states that the farming subsidy payment is subject to what it calls " budget lag . "
the commission document assumes the flow of funds will speed up in 2005 and 2006 , but even then , a major part of the new members ' income will come from late payments for allocations made for 2004 .
it has already been made clear by the commission that these terms are the best the candidates can get .
the explanation for the lack of promised cash will not please any of the candidates , all of which have said they are looking for significant improvements in their finances from the first year of enlargement onward .
new members will have trouble ' making ends meet ' in fact , the european commission reckons the european union will have a difficult time helping the new members make ends meet in 2004 , with the situation only improving over the next two years .
what happens after 2006 is an open question at this point , as the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 has yet to be negotiated .
by that time , the new members hope to be full partners at the negotiating table .
until then , however , most of them will have a hard time avoiding paying more into the eu budget than they receive from it . in fact , the european commission calculates that in 2004 , only the three baltic countries will see sizeable improvements in 2003 .

all the others - cyprus , malta , slovenia , hungary , the czech republic , and even slovakia - could lose out , according to the projections .
redevelopment funds are also subject to ' budget lag ' and it gets worse .
in the case of the second biggest expense for the eu after agricultural subsidies , the ' structural funds ' which are designed to finance regional economies , only 16 per cent of the 2004 allocations can be released that year in the form of advance payments .
other development funds will also be less than expected .
the allure of membership is beginning to dim in the light of the paper .
while waiting for delayed payments , the new members are expected to assume full responsibility for their own financial membership obligations .

the candidates are expected to contribute roughly three billion euro of the annual eu budget of 98.6 billion euro that all member states pay into .

bmw brands have sold more than 600,000 models so far in 2002 . “ this result confirms our expectations of being able to deliver over a million bmw and mini brand vehicles to customers this year for the first time , ” bmw ’ s marketing and sales director , michael ganal told the bbc . particularly the mini brand has proved a real hit after its market launch in the united kingdom in july 2001 , 40 years after tiny car first appeared on the car market .
more than 100,000 mini coopers and mini cooper s models have been sold all over the world , 76,500 alone in the first half of this year . sales rise in germany with the help of mini , but also other bmw brands , such as the new 7 series , sales have surged in europe – reaching an all-time sales increase in the uk of 71 per cent to 7,800 cars -lrb- 2001:4,500 -rrb- , followed by italy – up by 46 per cent to 6,100 automobiles , and spain – up 23 per cent to 4,700 cars . on the the difficult german market , sales increased by 11 per cent to 23,900 units . in addition , sales rose by 15 per cent in the us , and in canada by 50 per cent . new image ? analysts say the car maker ’ s current sales success – at a time of weakness both globally and in bmw ’ s key markets in the us and germany – are the result of the careful reshaping of the company ’ s image . “ bmw has moved on from the negative “ yuppie ” envy provoking connotations that haunted the brand in the late 1980s -lrb- … . -rrb- to become a widely recognized mark of achievement , ” merrill lynch automative analyst stephan reitmann told the bbc earlier this year . new cars for new target groups but bmw also sees its current success in the widening of its range of models , and the introduction of new brands for new target groups . “ what is going on on the automobile market is an increasing polarisation , ” ganal told spiegel online this week .
“ on the one hand the number of premium brands for exclusive cars is growing .
on the other hand , however , there are too many markets , who are still grappling with simple transport problems ” – meaning the increasing demand for small , simple , but still high-quality cars . after this year ’ s success with mini , bmw is now planning on introducing a new 1 series in 2004 , a car , according to ganal for “ people , who don ’ t necessarily want a large car , but one with substance ” . in addition , bmw will continue to focus on exclusive brands , including rolls royce which bmw will take over in 2003 .
to fill the gap between rolls royce and the 1 series , bmw will also be introducing the 6 series in 2004 , a large sport coupe ´ which , ganal said in spiegel , “ will help streamline bmw ’ s character and profile .

the news is not good .
the hopeful states have been told that funding promised on receiving full membership is being delayed by at least two years .
on top of that , the countries are still expected to make membership payments while they wait . the european commission 's so-called ' working document ' on the calculation of net budgetary balances for new members sums up the full financial consequences of enlargement for potential new member states between 2004 and 2006 .
the possible enlargement of the european union to 30 countries is the most significant event in the history of the eu since its inception in 1957 .
spreading its borders as far as finland in the north and greece in the east , the eu hopes to become a more powerful player in international political and economic spheres .
however , the subject of enlargement has already divided europe before it has brought it together .
the payment of farming subsidies to be delayed those wanting to be part of the eu now have major financial concerns .
the european commission 's offer to give new members 25 per cent of the agricultural subsidies it gives current members is not going to happen in 2004 , as planned .
the subject is already a thorny one between eu members , many of which object to paying out farm subsidies to new members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash for crops payment to come two years later according to the commission 's working paper , the root cause of the whole funding problem is not the lack of money , but its slow movement .
the paper states that the farming subsidy payment is subject to what it calls " budget lag . "
the commission document assumes the flow of funds will speed up in 2005 and 2006 , but even then , a major part of the new members ' income will come from late payments for allocations made for 2004 .
it has already been made clear by the commission that these terms are the best the candidates can get .
the explanation for the lack of promised cash will not please any of the candidates , all of which have said they are looking for significant improvements in their finances from the first year of enlargement onward .
new members will have trouble ' making ends meet ' in fact , the european commission reckons the european union will have a difficult time helping the new members make ends meet in 2004 , with the situation only improving over the next two years .
what happens after 2006 is an open question at this point , as the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 has yet to be negotiated .
by that time , the new members hope to be full partners at the negotiating table .
until then , however , most of them will have a hard time avoiding paying more into the eu budget than they receive from it . in fact , the european commission calculates that in 2004 , only the three baltic countries will see sizeable improvements in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the safety of nuclear sites will not be compromised by funding problems lithuania , which will already benefit from the nuclear ' safety-program ' fund , latvia , and estonia expect to receive well needed money after one year of membership .
poland , by far the largest , and far from the richest , of the applicants will benefit to a lesser degree .
all the others - cyprus , malta , slovenia , hungary , the czech republic , and even slovakia - could lose out , according to the projections .
redevelopment funds are also subject to ' budget lag ' and it gets worse .
in the case of the second biggest expense for the eu after agricultural subsidies , the ' structural funds ' which are designed to finance regional economies , only 16 per cent of the 2004 allocations can be released that year in the form of advance payments .
other development funds will also be less than expected .
the allure of membership is beginning to dim in the light of the paper .
while waiting for delayed payments , the new members are expected to assume full responsibility for their own financial membership obligations .
new states will have to pay up like the rest of the club from 2004 onward , they will be making full contributions to the eu budget , which demand the same percentage of their gross national products -lrb- gnp -rrb- as the contributions made by current eu members .
the candidates are expected to contribute roughly three billion euro of the annual eu budget of 98.6 billion euro that all member states pay into .
intriguingly , some of the current net contributors to the eu budget - germany , the netherlands , austria , and sweden - have negotiated a reduction in their share of the british rebate payments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.09.2002 european reaction to bush 's un speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has wanted to proceed very carefully on iraq the european union greeted president george w. bush 's united nations speech as a convincing effort to finding a multilateral solution to the iraq problem .
europe 's editorialists were n't as satisfied . the european union , which has so far presented a schizophrenic stance on a possible us invasion of iraq , welcomed president george w. bush 's speech at the united nations on thursday .
the speech proved that the united states was interested in pursuing a multilateralist approach , said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , the eu representative at the speech .
other european ministers echoed rasmussen , saying they were pleased that bush had agreed to involve the united nations in the final decision .
the speech was " very hard , clear and obvious , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who attended the speech . he said the signal sent to iraq was clear and demanded bagdad let un weapons inspectors back into the country .
germany is the only one of the 15 eu member countries to categorically reject a us invasion of iraq , even with a un mandate .
in reference to his country 's position , fischer said the german government was still " deeply concerned " about the aftermath of such an invasion .
british prime minister tony blair , bush 's staunchest ally in europe , greeted the speech " warmly " said a spokesperson .
blair said great britain would be heavily involved in shaping the un resolution , talks on which are expected by the end of the month .
preparations have already begun the comments came amid reports great britain 's armed forces had already begun preparing itself for the " biggest operation in years " according to the british broadcasting corporation . british media said the army was stockpiling weapons , supplies and military craft in a harbor in the south of the country .
the united states has already moved its operational command to qatar , a half-island abbuting saudi arabia .
such preparations prove that in the " thoughts and decisions of many , the war against iraq has already begun , " wrote the french daily " le figaro " in a friday editorial .
" only appeasement by iraq or a miracle can still stop it .
should war be avoided then it would definitely not hurt the usa , and this also wo n't occur without their support . " the left-leaning danish newspaper " politiken " praised bush 's attempt at multiateralism .
" no democratic government can call bush 's demands unreasonable , " it wrote .
" they are not meant as a threat against the iraqi people .
nothing is keeping saddam hussein from doing his people a favor ...
bush did right to demand the international community show some backbone . "
great britain 's left-leaning " guardian " newspaper said bush left a major question unanswered .

europe 's editorialists were n't as satisfied . the european union , which has so far presented a schizophrenic stance on a possible us invasion of iraq , welcomed president george w. bush 's speech at the united nations on thursday .
the speech proved that the united states was interested in pursuing a multilateralist approach , said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , the eu representative at the speech .
other european ministers echoed rasmussen , saying they were pleased that bush had agreed to involve the united nations in the final decision .
the speech was " very hard , clear and obvious , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who attended the speech . he said the signal sent to iraq was clear and demanded bagdad let un weapons inspectors back into the country .
germany is the only one of the 15 eu member countries to categorically reject a us invasion of iraq , even with a un mandate .
in reference to his country 's position , fischer said the german government was still " deeply concerned " about the aftermath of such an invasion .
british prime minister tony blair , bush 's staunchest ally in europe , greeted the speech " warmly " said a spokesperson .
blair said great britain would be heavily involved in shaping the un resolution , talks on which are expected by the end of the month .
preparations have already begun the comments came amid reports great britain 's armed forces had already begun preparing itself for the " biggest operation in years " according to the british broadcasting corporation . british media said the army was stockpiling weapons , supplies and military craft in a harbor in the south of the country .
the united states has already moved its operational command to qatar , a half-island abbuting saudi arabia .
such preparations prove that in the " thoughts and decisions of many , the war against iraq has already begun , " wrote the french daily " le figaro " in a friday editorial .
" only appeasement by iraq or a miracle can still stop it .
should war be avoided then it would definitely not hurt the usa , and this also wo n't occur without their support . " the left-leaning danish newspaper " politiken " praised bush 's attempt at multiateralism .
" no democratic government can call bush 's demands unreasonable , " it wrote .
" they are not meant as a threat against the iraqi people .
nothing is keeping saddam hussein from doing his people a favor ...
bush did right to demand the international community show some backbone . "
great britain 's left-leaning " guardian " newspaper said bush left a major question unanswered .
" what was signally lacking from mr bush 's speech was any information showing how or why these abuses have suddenly grown more egregious or less tolerable than before , " according to the editorial . " in other words , mr bush had the chance to answer the much-asked question : why now ?

bmw brands have sold more than 600,000 models so far in 2002 . “ this result confirms our expectations of being able to deliver over a million bmw and mini brand vehicles to customers this year for the first time , ” bmw ’ s marketing and sales director , michael ganal told the bbc . particularly the mini brand has proved a real hit after its market launch in the united kingdom in july 2001 , 40 years after tiny car first appeared on the car market .
more than 100,000 mini coopers and mini cooper s models have been sold all over the world , 76,500 alone in the first half of this year . sales rise in germany with the help of mini , but also other bmw brands , such as the new 7 series , sales have surged in europe – reaching an all-time sales increase in the uk of 71 per cent to 7,800 cars -lrb- 2001:4,500 -rrb- , followed by italy – up by 46 per cent to 6,100 automobiles , and spain – up 23 per cent to 4,700 cars . on the the difficult german market , sales increased by 11 per cent to 23,900 units . in addition , sales rose by 15 per cent in the us , and in canada by 50 per cent . new image ? analysts say the car maker ’ s current sales success – at a time of weakness both globally and in bmw ’ s key markets in the us and germany – are the result of the careful reshaping of the company ’ s image . “ bmw has moved on from the negative “ yuppie ” envy provoking connotations that haunted the brand in the late 1980s -lrb- … . -rrb- to become a widely recognized mark of achievement , ” merrill lynch automative analyst stephan reitmann told the bbc earlier this year . new cars for new target groups but bmw also sees its current success in the widening of its range of models , and the introduction of new brands for new target groups . “ what is going on on the automobile market is an increasing polarisation , ” ganal told spiegel online this week .
“ on the one hand the number of premium brands for exclusive cars is growing .
on the other hand , however , there are too many markets , who are still grappling with simple transport problems ” – meaning the increasing demand for small , simple , but still high-quality cars . after this year ’ s success with mini , bmw is now planning on introducing a new 1 series in 2004 , a car , according to ganal for “ people , who don ’ t necessarily want a large car , but one with substance ” . in addition , bmw will continue to focus on exclusive brands , including rolls royce which bmw will take over in 2003 .
to fill the gap between rolls royce and the 1 series , bmw will also be introducing the 6 series in 2004 , a large sport coupe ´ which , ganal said in spiegel , “ will help streamline bmw ’ s character and profile .

the news is not good .
the hopeful states have been told that funding promised on receiving full membership is being delayed by at least two years .
on top of that , the countries are still expected to make membership payments while they wait . the european commission 's so-called ' working document ' on the calculation of net budgetary balances for new members sums up the full financial consequences of enlargement for potential new member states between 2004 and 2006 .
the possible enlargement of the european union to 30 countries is the most significant event in the history of the eu since its inception in 1957 .
spreading its borders as far as finland in the north and greece in the east , the eu hopes to become a more powerful player in international political and economic spheres .
however , the subject of enlargement has already divided europe before it has brought it together .
the payment of farming subsidies to be delayed those wanting to be part of the eu now have major financial concerns .
the european commission 's offer to give new members 25 per cent of the agricultural subsidies it gives current members is not going to happen in 2004 , as planned .
the subject is already a thorny one between eu members , many of which object to paying out farm subsidies to new members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash for crops payment to come two years later according to the commission 's working paper , the root cause of the whole funding problem is not the lack of money , but its slow movement .
the paper states that the farming subsidy payment is subject to what it calls " budget lag . "
the commission document assumes the flow of funds will speed up in 2005 and 2006 , but even then , a major part of the new members ' income will come from late payments for allocations made for 2004 .
it has already been made clear by the commission that these terms are the best the candidates can get .
the explanation for the lack of promised cash will not please any of the candidates , all of which have said they are looking for significant improvements in their finances from the first year of enlargement onward .
new members will have trouble ' making ends meet ' in fact , the european commission reckons the european union will have a difficult time helping the new members make ends meet in 2004 , with the situation only improving over the next two years .
what happens after 2006 is an open question at this point , as the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 has yet to be negotiated .
by that time , the new members hope to be full partners at the negotiating table .
until then , however , most of them will have a hard time avoiding paying more into the eu budget than they receive from it . in fact , the european commission calculates that in 2004 , only the three baltic countries will see sizeable improvements in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the safety of nuclear sites will not be compromised by funding problems lithuania , which will already benefit from the nuclear ' safety-program ' fund , latvia , and estonia expect to receive well needed money after one year of membership .
poland , by far the largest , and far from the richest , of the applicants will benefit to a lesser degree .
all the others - cyprus , malta , slovenia , hungary , the czech republic , and even slovakia - could lose out , according to the projections .
redevelopment funds are also subject to ' budget lag ' and it gets worse .
in the case of the second biggest expense for the eu after agricultural subsidies , the ' structural funds ' which are designed to finance regional economies , only 16 per cent of the 2004 allocations can be released that year in the form of advance payments .
other development funds will also be less than expected .
the allure of membership is beginning to dim in the light of the paper .
while waiting for delayed payments , the new members are expected to assume full responsibility for their own financial membership obligations .
new states will have to pay up like the rest of the club from 2004 onward , they will be making full contributions to the eu budget , which demand the same percentage of their gross national products -lrb- gnp -rrb- as the contributions made by current eu members .
the candidates are expected to contribute roughly three billion euro of the annual eu budget of 98.6 billion euro that all member states pay into .
intriguingly , some of the current net contributors to the eu budget - germany , the netherlands , austria , and sweden - have negotiated a reduction in their share of the british rebate payments .
according to commission calculations , the new members will in addition need to share the extra burden generated by these reductions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links european union enlargement the european union 's web site concerning all aspects of the proposed enlargement with a clickable map with information on candidate states . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

22 elections . views on how to proceed split down party lines , with the red-green government , led by schröder and green foreign minister joschka fischer reiterating their position that germany would not participate in any military action against iraq and the conservative opposition showing a willingness to consider bush 's un ultimatum . schröder : bush partly correct " his -lrb- bush 's -rrb- demand that the regime in baghdad must comply with the u.n. resolutions is partly correct , " schröder told members of the german parliament , the bundestag .
" it was never debatable that weapons inspectors must return to the country .
but what remains disputable is whether another objective should be allowed to replace this objective as the focal point of the discussion . " schröder said it was a positive development that bush had pushed the issue of u.n. resolutions back to the center of the debate and praised bush for reaffirming the un 's importance .
he added germany would use all " diplomatic " and " economic " possibilities to support efforts to force saddam hussein into compliance . however , the chancellor reiterated his concern that any military action against iraq could cause the loosely-knit international coalition against terror to unravel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- joined schröder friday in defending germany 's stance .
fischer said bush 's speech did little to allay his concerns about america 's intentions in iraq .
the conditions imposed by the president , he said , " are anything but simple . " opposition attacks ' anti-american ' campaign tactics with barely a week to go until federal elections on sept .
22 , opposition politicians took advantage of the bundestag session to criticize the government 's recent foreign policy position , which has frayed relations with washington and also threatened the stability of europe 's joint defence and foreign policy . despite the willingness of other european leaders – including britain 's tony blair to france 's jacqués chirac – to consider military intervention under a u.n. mandate , schröder and fischer have steadfastly refused to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag bavarian premier edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is seeking to unseat schröder as the joint candidate for the conservative christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , accused the red-green government of " creating an anti-american atmosphere in its campaign . " stoiber warned that , with its " anti-american " position , the red-green government threatened to isolate germany from other european countries . but he said he doubted that germany 's army , the bundeswehr , would be asked to participate in any military intervention , anyway . in words that seemed to mirror warnings issued against bush lately , christian democratic union chairwoman angela merkel cautioned against germany " going its own way " on the iraq issue .
she said the government 's current position could not be maintained and accused schröder of changing his position from " unlimited solidarity " with the u.s. to " unlimited unilateralism . " eu lauds bush speech as the iraq debate raged on in germany , it reduced intensity in other parts of europe on friday .
speaking for the european union , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said bush 's speech proved that the united states was interested in pursuing a multilateralist approach .
other european ministers echoed rasmussen , saying they were pleased that bush had agreed to involve the u.n. in the final decision . british prime minister tony blair , bush 's staunchest ally in europe , greeted the speech " warmly " said a spokesperson .
blair said the united kingdom would be heavily involved in shaping the un resolution , talks on which are expected by the end of the month . bbc : british troops mobilizing the comments came amid reports the u.k. 's armed forces had already begun preparing itself for the " biggest operation in years " according to the bbc .

the news is not good .
the hopeful states have been told that funding promised on receiving full membership is being delayed by at least two years .
on top of that , the countries are still expected to make membership payments while they wait . the european commission 's so-called ' working document ' on the calculation of net budgetary balances for new members sums up the full financial consequences of enlargement for potential new member states between 2004 and 2006 .
the possible enlargement of the european union to 30 countries is the most significant event in the history of the eu since its inception in 1957 .
spreading its borders as far as finland in the north and greece in the east , the eu hopes to become a more powerful player in international political and economic spheres .
however , the subject of enlargement has already divided europe before it has brought it together .
the payment of farming subsidies to be delayed those wanting to be part of the eu now have major financial concerns .
the european commission 's offer to give new members 25 per cent of the agricultural subsidies it gives current members is not going to happen in 2004 , as planned .
the subject is already a thorny one between eu members , many of which object to paying out farm subsidies to new members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash for crops payment to come two years later according to the commission 's working paper , the root cause of the whole funding problem is not the lack of money , but its slow movement .
the paper states that the farming subsidy payment is subject to what it calls " budget lag . "
the commission document assumes the flow of funds will speed up in 2005 and 2006 , but even then , a major part of the new members ' income will come from late payments for allocations made for 2004 .
it has already been made clear by the commission that these terms are the best the candidates can get .
the explanation for the lack of promised cash will not please any of the candidates , all of which have said they are looking for significant improvements in their finances from the first year of enlargement onward .
new members will have trouble ' making ends meet ' in fact , the european commission reckons the european union will have a difficult time helping the new members make ends meet in 2004 , with the situation only improving over the next two years .
what happens after 2006 is an open question at this point , as the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 has yet to be negotiated .
by that time , the new members hope to be full partners at the negotiating table .
until then , however , most of them will have a hard time avoiding paying more into the eu budget than they receive from it . in fact , the european commission calculates that in 2004 , only the three baltic countries will see sizeable improvements in 2003 .

the news is not good .
the hopeful states have been told that funding promised on receiving full membership is being delayed by at least two years .
on top of that , the countries are still expected to make membership payments while they wait . the european commission 's so-called ' working document ' on the calculation of net budgetary balances for new members sums up the full financial consequences of enlargement for potential new member states between 2004 and 2006 .
the possible enlargement of the european union to 30 countries is the most significant event in the history of the eu since its inception in 1957 .
spreading its borders as far as finland in the north and greece in the east , the eu hopes to become a more powerful player in international political and economic spheres .
however , the subject of enlargement has already divided europe before it has brought it together .
the payment of farming subsidies to be delayed those wanting to be part of the eu now have major financial concerns .
the european commission 's offer to give new members 25 per cent of the agricultural subsidies it gives current members is not going to happen in 2004 , as planned .
the subject is already a thorny one between eu members , many of which object to paying out farm subsidies to new members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash for crops payment to come two years later according to the commission 's working paper , the root cause of the whole funding problem is not the lack of money , but its slow movement .
the paper states that the farming subsidy payment is subject to what it calls " budget lag . "
the commission document assumes the flow of funds will speed up in 2005 and 2006 , but even then , a major part of the new members ' income will come from late payments for allocations made for 2004 .
it has already been made clear by the commission that these terms are the best the candidates can get .
the explanation for the lack of promised cash will not please any of the candidates , all of which have said they are looking for significant improvements in their finances from the first year of enlargement onward .
new members will have trouble ' making ends meet ' in fact , the european commission reckons the european union will have a difficult time helping the new members make ends meet in 2004 , with the situation only improving over the next two years .
what happens after 2006 is an open question at this point , as the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 has yet to be negotiated .
by that time , the new members hope to be full partners at the negotiating table .
until then , however , most of them will have a hard time avoiding paying more into the eu budget than they receive from it . in fact , the european commission calculates that in 2004 , only the three baltic countries will see sizeable improvements in 2003 .

22 elections . views on how to proceed split down party lines , with the red-green government , led by schröder and green foreign minister joschka fischer reiterating their position that germany would not participate in any military action against iraq and the conservative opposition showing a willingness to consider bush 's un ultimatum . schröder : bush partly correct " his -lrb- bush 's -rrb- demand that the regime in baghdad must comply with the u.n. resolutions is partly correct , " schröder told members of the german parliament , the bundestag .
" it was never debatable that weapons inspectors must return to the country .
but what remains disputable is whether another objective should be allowed to replace this objective as the focal point of the discussion . " schröder said it was a positive development that bush had pushed the issue of u.n. resolutions back to the center of the debate and praised bush for reaffirming the un 's importance .
he added germany would use all " diplomatic " and " economic " possibilities to support efforts to force saddam hussein into compliance . however , the chancellor reiterated his concern that any military action against iraq could cause the loosely-knit international coalition against terror to unravel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- joined schröder friday in defending germany 's stance .
fischer said bush 's speech did little to allay his concerns about america 's intentions in iraq .
the conditions imposed by the president , he said , " are anything but simple . " opposition attacks ' anti-american ' campaign tactics with barely a week to go until federal elections on sept .
22 , opposition politicians took advantage of the bundestag session to criticize the government 's recent foreign policy position , which has frayed relations with washington and also threatened the stability of europe 's joint defence and foreign policy . despite the willingness of other european leaders – including britain 's tony blair to france 's jacqués chirac – to consider military intervention under a u.n. mandate , schröder and fischer have steadfastly refused to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag bavarian premier edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is seeking to unseat schröder as the joint candidate for the conservative christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , accused the red-green government of " creating an anti-american atmosphere in its campaign . " stoiber warned that , with its " anti-american " position , the red-green government threatened to isolate germany from other european countries . but he said he doubted that germany 's army , the bundeswehr , would be asked to participate in any military intervention , anyway . in words that seemed to mirror warnings issued against bush lately , christian democratic union chairwoman angela merkel cautioned against germany " going its own way " on the iraq issue .
she said the government 's current position could not be maintained and accused schröder of changing his position from " unlimited solidarity " with the u.s. to " unlimited unilateralism . " eu lauds bush speech as the iraq debate raged on in germany , it reduced intensity in other parts of europe on friday .
speaking for the european union , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said bush 's speech proved that the united states was interested in pursuing a multilateralist approach .
other european ministers echoed rasmussen , saying they were pleased that bush had agreed to involve the u.n. in the final decision . british prime minister tony blair , bush 's staunchest ally in europe , greeted the speech " warmly " said a spokesperson .
blair said the united kingdom would be heavily involved in shaping the un resolution , talks on which are expected by the end of the month . bbc : british troops mobilizing the comments came amid reports the u.k.

the news is not good .
the hopeful states have been told that funding promised on receiving full membership is being delayed by at least two years .
on top of that , the countries are still expected to make membership payments while they wait . the european commission 's so-called ' working document ' on the calculation of net budgetary balances for new members sums up the full financial consequences of enlargement for potential new member states between 2004 and 2006 .
the possible enlargement of the european union to 30 countries is the most significant event in the history of the eu since its inception in 1957 .
spreading its borders as far as finland in the north and greece in the east , the eu hopes to become a more powerful player in international political and economic spheres .
however , the subject of enlargement has already divided europe before it has brought it together .
the payment of farming subsidies to be delayed those wanting to be part of the eu now have major financial concerns .
the european commission 's offer to give new members 25 per cent of the agricultural subsidies it gives current members is not going to happen in 2004 , as planned .
the subject is already a thorny one between eu members , many of which object to paying out farm subsidies to new members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash for crops payment to come two years later according to the commission 's working paper , the root cause of the whole funding problem is not the lack of money , but its slow movement .
the paper states that the farming subsidy payment is subject to what it calls " budget lag . "
the commission document assumes the flow of funds will speed up in 2005 and 2006 , but even then , a major part of the new members ' income will come from late payments for allocations made for 2004 .
it has already been made clear by the commission that these terms are the best the candidates can get .
the explanation for the lack of promised cash will not please any of the candidates , all of which have said they are looking for significant improvements in their finances from the first year of enlargement onward .
new members will have trouble ' making ends meet ' in fact , the european commission reckons the european union will have a difficult time helping the new members make ends meet in 2004 , with the situation only improving over the next two years .
what happens after 2006 is an open question at this point , as the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 has yet to be negotiated .
by that time , the new members hope to be full partners at the negotiating table .
until then , however , most of them will have a hard time avoiding paying more into the eu budget than they receive from it . in fact , the european commission calculates that in 2004 , only the three baltic countries will see sizeable improvements in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the safety of nuclear sites will not be compromised by funding problems lithuania , which will already benefit from the nuclear ' safety-program ' fund , latvia , and estonia expect to receive well needed money after one year of membership .
poland , by far the largest , and far from the richest , of the applicants will benefit to a lesser degree .
all the others - cyprus , malta , slovenia , hungary , the czech republic , and even slovakia - could lose out , according to the projections .
redevelopment funds are also subject to ' budget lag ' and it gets worse .
in the case of the second biggest expense for the eu after agricultural subsidies , the ' structural funds ' which are designed to finance regional economies , only 16 per cent of the 2004 allocations can be released that year in the form of advance payments .
other development funds will also be less than expected .
the allure of membership is beginning to dim in the light of the paper .
while waiting for delayed payments , the new members are expected to assume full responsibility for their own financial membership obligations .
new states will have to pay up like the rest of the club from 2004 onward , they will be making full contributions to the eu budget , which demand the same percentage of their gross national products -lrb- gnp -rrb- as the contributions made by current eu members .
the candidates are expected to contribute roughly three billion euro of the annual eu budget of 98.6 billion euro that all member states pay into .
intriguingly , some of the current net contributors to the eu budget - germany , the netherlands , austria , and sweden - have negotiated a reduction in their share of the british rebate payments .
according to commission calculations , the new members will in addition need to share the extra burden generated by these reductions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links european union enlargement the european union 's web site concerning all aspects of the proposed enlargement with a clickable map with information on candidate states . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

europe 's editorialists were n't as satisfied . the european union , which has so far presented a schizophrenic stance on a possible us invasion of iraq , welcomed president george w. bush 's speech at the united nations on thursday .
the speech proved that the united states was interested in pursuing a multilateralist approach , said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , the eu representative at the speech .
other european ministers echoed rasmussen , saying they were pleased that bush had agreed to involve the united nations in the final decision .
the speech was " very hard , clear and obvious , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who attended the speech . he said the signal sent to iraq was clear and demanded bagdad let un weapons inspectors back into the country .
germany is the only one of the 15 eu member countries to categorically reject a us invasion of iraq , even with a un mandate .
in reference to his country 's position , fischer said the german government was still " deeply concerned " about the aftermath of such an invasion .
british prime minister tony blair , bush 's staunchest ally in europe , greeted the speech " warmly " said a spokesperson .
blair said great britain would be heavily involved in shaping the un resolution , talks on which are expected by the end of the month .
preparations have already begun the comments came amid reports great britain 's armed forces had already begun preparing itself for the " biggest operation in years " according to the british broadcasting corporation . british media said the army was stockpiling weapons , supplies and military craft in a harbor in the south of the country .
the united states has already moved its operational command to qatar , a half-island abbuting saudi arabia .
such preparations prove that in the " thoughts and decisions of many , the war against iraq has already begun , " wrote the french daily " le figaro " in a friday editorial .
" only appeasement by iraq or a miracle can still stop it .
should war be avoided then it would definitely not hurt the usa , and this also wo n't occur without their support . " the left-leaning danish newspaper " politiken " praised bush 's attempt at multiateralism .
" no democratic government can call bush 's demands unreasonable , " it wrote .
" they are not meant as a threat against the iraqi people .
nothing is keeping saddam hussein from doing his people a favor ...
bush did right to demand the international community show some backbone . "
great britain 's left-leaning " guardian " newspaper said bush left a major question unanswered .
" what was signally lacking from mr bush 's speech was any information showing how or why these abuses have suddenly grown more egregious or less tolerable than before , " according to the editorial . " in other words , mr bush had the chance to answer the much-asked question : why now ?
and he dodged it . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush offers un , iraq ultimatum u.s. president george w. bush made it clear in his speech before the general assembly on thursday that if the united nations doesn ’ t take joint action against iraq and saddam hussein , then the united states will .

bmw brands have sold more than 600,000 models so far in 2002 . “ this result confirms our expectations of being able to deliver over a million bmw and mini brand vehicles to customers this year for the first time , ” bmw ’ s marketing and sales director , michael ganal told the bbc . particularly the mini brand has proved a real hit after its market launch in the united kingdom in july 2001 , 40 years after tiny car first appeared on the car market .
more than 100,000 mini coopers and mini cooper s models have been sold all over the world , 76,500 alone in the first half of this year . sales rise in germany with the help of mini , but also other bmw brands , such as the new 7 series , sales have surged in europe – reaching an all-time sales increase in the uk of 71 per cent to 7,800 cars -lrb- 2001:4,500 -rrb- , followed by italy – up by 46 per cent to 6,100 automobiles , and spain – up 23 per cent to 4,700 cars . on the the difficult german market , sales increased by 11 per cent to 23,900 units . in addition , sales rose by 15 per cent in the us , and in canada by 50 per cent . new image ? analysts say the car maker ’ s current sales success – at a time of weakness both globally and in bmw ’ s key markets in the us and germany – are the result of the careful reshaping of the company ’ s image . “ bmw has moved on from the negative “ yuppie ” envy provoking connotations that haunted the brand in the late 1980s -lrb- … . -rrb- to become a widely recognized mark of achievement , ” merrill lynch automative analyst stephan reitmann told the bbc earlier this year . new cars for new target groups but bmw also sees its current success in the widening of its range of models , and the introduction of new brands for new target groups . “ what is going on on the automobile market is an increasing polarisation , ” ganal told spiegel online this week .
“ on the one hand the number of premium brands for exclusive cars is growing .
on the other hand , however , there are too many markets , who are still grappling with simple transport problems ” – meaning the increasing demand for small , simple , but still high-quality cars . after this year ’ s success with mini , bmw is now planning on introducing a new 1 series in 2004 , a car , according to ganal for “ people , who don ’ t necessarily want a large car , but one with substance ” . in addition , bmw will continue to focus on exclusive brands , including rolls royce which bmw will take over in 2003 .
to fill the gap between rolls royce and the 1 series , bmw will also be introducing the 6 series in 2004 , a large sport coupe ´ which , ganal said in spiegel , “ will help streamline bmw ’ s character and profile .

bmw brands have sold more than 600,000 models so far in 2002 . “ this result confirms our expectations of being able to deliver over a million bmw and mini brand vehicles to customers this year for the first time , ” bmw ’ s marketing and sales director , michael ganal told the bbc . particularly the mini brand has proved a real hit after its market launch in the united kingdom in july 2001 , 40 years after tiny car first appeared on the car market .
more than 100,000 mini coopers and mini cooper s models have been sold all over the world , 76,500 alone in the first half of this year . sales rise in germany with the help of mini , but also other bmw brands , such as the new 7 series , sales have surged in europe – reaching an all-time sales increase in the uk of 71 per cent to 7,800 cars -lrb- 2001:4,500 -rrb- , followed by italy – up by 46 per cent to 6,100 automobiles , and spain – up 23 per cent to 4,700 cars . on the the difficult german market , sales increased by 11 per cent to 23,900 units . in addition , sales rose by 15 per cent in the us , and in canada by 50 per cent . new image ? analysts say the car maker ’ s current sales success – at a time of weakness both globally and in bmw ’ s key markets in the us and germany – are the result of the careful reshaping of the company ’ s image . “ bmw has moved on from the negative “ yuppie ” envy provoking connotations that haunted the brand in the late 1980s -lrb- … . -rrb- to become a widely recognized mark of achievement , ” merrill lynch automative analyst stephan reitmann told the bbc earlier this year . new cars for new target groups but bmw also sees its current success in the widening of its range of models , and the introduction of new brands for new target groups . “ what is going on on the automobile market is an increasing polarisation , ” ganal told spiegel online this week .
“ on the one hand the number of premium brands for exclusive cars is growing .
on the other hand , however , there are too many markets , who are still grappling with simple transport problems ” – meaning the increasing demand for small , simple , but still high-quality cars . after this year ’ s success with mini , bmw is now planning on introducing a new 1 series in 2004 , a car , according to ganal for “ people , who don ’ t necessarily want a large car , but one with substance ” . in addition , bmw will continue to focus on exclusive brands , including rolls royce which bmw will take over in 2003 .
to fill the gap between rolls royce and the 1 series , bmw will also be introducing the 6 series in 2004 , a large sport coupe ´ which , ganal said in spiegel , “ will help streamline bmw ’ s character and profile .

22 elections . views on how to proceed split down party lines , with the red-green government , led by schröder and green foreign minister joschka fischer reiterating their position that germany would not participate in any military action against iraq and the conservative opposition showing a willingness to consider bush 's un ultimatum . schröder : bush partly correct " his -lrb- bush 's -rrb- demand that the regime in baghdad must comply with the u.n. resolutions is partly correct , " schröder told members of the german parliament , the bundestag .
" it was never debatable that weapons inspectors must return to the country .
but what remains disputable is whether another objective should be allowed to replace this objective as the focal point of the discussion . " schröder said it was a positive development that bush had pushed the issue of u.n. resolutions back to the center of the debate and praised bush for reaffirming the un 's importance .

“ if anyone ’ s not happy that a product is on the list , they have two months to let the commission know ” , an official said . biggest transatlantic trade dispute the eu was authorised to impose sanctions worth 4.043 billion euro -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- by the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- two weeks ago . the wto approved the sanctions after the eu claimed the tax break was costing the european economy billions of dollars in lost trade . by publishing the sanctions list , the eu hopes to put maximum pressure on the us to change its offending legislation . but eu trade commissioner pascal lamy will face a delicate balancing act over the coming months over what is regarded as the biggest transatlantic trade dispute in history . " a nuclear bomb in trade relations " transatlantic trade relations are already overshadowed by the us 's threats to place protective tariffs on european imported steel . in addition , heavy eu duties on specific products made in america would harm european importers and , as a result , european customers , something that concerns the continent 's trade groups . the eu is keen to maintain the pressure but still hopes to avoid heavy sanctions – a step robert zoellick , the us trade representative , has said would be like detonating a “ nuclear bomb ” in the world trading system . it has therefore made it clear that is will not rush into sanctions , saying it would only apply sanctions if washington did not make sufficient progress in scrapping the illegal tax scheme in the coming months . hopes for us reform but so far , washington has failed to fulfill the wto ’ s demands for reform . the wto first ruled the us tax breaks as illegal in 2000 .
the original us corporate tax law allowed some of the foreign profits of american exporters to be tax exempt .
the eu declared these breaks as unfair as they favoured sales to foreign customers over domestic ones . after the first ruling , the law was rewritten by congress .
but in 2001 , the wto renewed its warning , saying the revision did not go far enough . two weeks ago , the world trade organisation finally gave the eu the right to impose sanctions on us products worth some 4 billion euro . u.s. president george w. bush has repeatedly promised reform .
but congress , under pressure from u.s. corporations , is still reluctant to give way .
various attempts at introducing bills have been blocked by both democrats and republicans , who have been lobbied by big exporters in their various districts . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us loses decades-old trade dispute a wto decision allowed the european union to place duties on $ 4.04 billion worth of us exports , but both sides do n't want it to get to that point .

europe 's editorialists were n't as satisfied . the european union , which has so far presented a schizophrenic stance on a possible us invasion of iraq , welcomed president george w. bush 's speech at the united nations on thursday .
the speech proved that the united states was interested in pursuing a multilateralist approach , said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , the eu representative at the speech .
other european ministers echoed rasmussen , saying they were pleased that bush had agreed to involve the united nations in the final decision .
the speech was " very hard , clear and obvious , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who attended the speech . he said the signal sent to iraq was clear and demanded bagdad let un weapons inspectors back into the country .
germany is the only one of the 15 eu member countries to categorically reject a us invasion of iraq , even with a un mandate .
in reference to his country 's position , fischer said the german government was still " deeply concerned " about the aftermath of such an invasion .
british prime minister tony blair , bush 's staunchest ally in europe , greeted the speech " warmly " said a spokesperson .
blair said great britain would be heavily involved in shaping the un resolution , talks on which are expected by the end of the month .
preparations have already begun the comments came amid reports great britain 's armed forces had already begun preparing itself for the " biggest operation in years " according to the british broadcasting corporation . british media said the army was stockpiling weapons , supplies and military craft in a harbor in the south of the country .
the united states has already moved its operational command to qatar , a half-island abbuting saudi arabia .
such preparations prove that in the " thoughts and decisions of many , the war against iraq has already begun , " wrote the french daily " le figaro " in a friday editorial .
" only appeasement by iraq or a miracle can still stop it .
should war be avoided then it would definitely not hurt the usa , and this also wo n't occur without their support . " the left-leaning danish newspaper " politiken " praised bush 's attempt at multiateralism .
" no democratic government can call bush 's demands unreasonable , " it wrote .
" they are not meant as a threat against the iraqi people .
nothing is keeping saddam hussein from doing his people a favor ...
bush did right to demand the international community show some backbone . "
great britain 's left-leaning " guardian " newspaper said bush left a major question unanswered .
" what was signally lacking from mr bush 's speech was any information showing how or why these abuses have suddenly grown more egregious or less tolerable than before , " according to the editorial . " in other words , mr bush had the chance to answer the much-asked question : why now ?
and he dodged it . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush offers un , iraq ultimatum u.s. president george w. bush made it clear in his speech before the general assembly on thursday that if the united nations doesn ’ t take joint action against iraq and saddam hussein , then the united states will .

europe 's editorialists were n't as satisfied . the european union , which has so far presented a schizophrenic stance on a possible us invasion of iraq , welcomed president george w. bush 's speech at the united nations on thursday .
the speech proved that the united states was interested in pursuing a multilateralist approach , said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , the eu representative at the speech .
other european ministers echoed rasmussen , saying they were pleased that bush had agreed to involve the united nations in the final decision .
the speech was " very hard , clear and obvious , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who attended the speech . he said the signal sent to iraq was clear and demanded bagdad let un weapons inspectors back into the country .
germany is the only one of the 15 eu member countries to categorically reject a us invasion of iraq , even with a un mandate .
in reference to his country 's position , fischer said the german government was still " deeply concerned " about the aftermath of such an invasion .
british prime minister tony blair , bush 's staunchest ally in europe , greeted the speech " warmly " said a spokesperson .
blair said great britain would be heavily involved in shaping the un resolution , talks on which are expected by the end of the month .
preparations have already begun the comments came amid reports great britain 's armed forces had already begun preparing itself for the " biggest operation in years " according to the british broadcasting corporation . british media said the army was stockpiling weapons , supplies and military craft in a harbor in the south of the country .
the united states has already moved its operational command to qatar , a half-island abbuting saudi arabia .
such preparations prove that in the " thoughts and decisions of many , the war against iraq has already begun , " wrote the french daily " le figaro " in a friday editorial .
" only appeasement by iraq or a miracle can still stop it .
should war be avoided then it would definitely not hurt the usa , and this also wo n't occur without their support . " the left-leaning danish newspaper " politiken " praised bush 's attempt at multiateralism .
" no democratic government can call bush 's demands unreasonable , " it wrote .
" they are not meant as a threat against the iraqi people .
nothing is keeping saddam hussein from doing his people a favor ...
bush did right to demand the international community show some backbone . "
great britain 's left-leaning " guardian " newspaper said bush left a major question unanswered .
" what was signally lacking from mr bush 's speech was any information showing how or why these abuses have suddenly grown more egregious or less tolerable than before , " according to the editorial . " in other words , mr bush had the chance to answer the much-asked question : why now ?
and he dodged it . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush offers un , iraq ultimatum u.s. president george w. bush made it clear in his speech before the general assembly on thursday that if the united nations doesn ’ t take joint action against iraq and saddam hussein , then the united states will .

the news is not good .
the hopeful states have been told that funding promised on receiving full membership is being delayed by at least two years .
on top of that , the countries are still expected to make membership payments while they wait . the european commission 's so-called ' working document ' on the calculation of net budgetary balances for new members sums up the full financial consequences of enlargement for potential new member states between 2004 and 2006 .
the possible enlargement of the european union to 30 countries is the most significant event in the history of the eu since its inception in 1957 .
spreading its borders as far as finland in the north and greece in the east , the eu hopes to become a more powerful player in international political and economic spheres .
however , the subject of enlargement has already divided europe before it has brought it together .
the payment of farming subsidies to be delayed those wanting to be part of the eu now have major financial concerns .
the european commission 's offer to give new members 25 per cent of the agricultural subsidies it gives current members is not going to happen in 2004 , as planned .
the subject is already a thorny one between eu members , many of which object to paying out farm subsidies to new members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash for crops payment to come two years later according to the commission 's working paper , the root cause of the whole funding problem is not the lack of money , but its slow movement .
the paper states that the farming subsidy payment is subject to what it calls " budget lag . "
the commission document assumes the flow of funds will speed up in 2005 and 2006 , but even then , a major part of the new members ' income will come from late payments for allocations made for 2004 .
it has already been made clear by the commission that these terms are the best the candidates can get .
the explanation for the lack of promised cash will not please any of the candidates , all of which have said they are looking for significant improvements in their finances from the first year of enlargement onward .
new members will have trouble ' making ends meet ' in fact , the european commission reckons the european union will have a difficult time helping the new members make ends meet in 2004 , with the situation only improving over the next two years .
what happens after 2006 is an open question at this point , as the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 has yet to be negotiated .
by that time , the new members hope to be full partners at the negotiating table .
until then , however , most of them will have a hard time avoiding paying more into the eu budget than they receive from it . in fact , the european commission calculates that in 2004 , only the three baltic countries will see sizeable improvements in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the safety of nuclear sites will not be compromised by funding problems lithuania , which will already benefit from the nuclear ' safety-program ' fund , latvia , and estonia expect to receive well needed money after one year of membership .
poland , by far the largest , and far from the richest , of the applicants will benefit to a lesser degree .
all the others - cyprus , malta , slovenia , hungary , the czech republic , and even slovakia - could lose out , according to the projections .
redevelopment funds are also subject to ' budget lag ' and it gets worse .
in the case of the second biggest expense for the eu after agricultural subsidies , the ' structural funds ' which are designed to finance regional economies , only 16 per cent of the 2004 allocations can be released that year in the form of advance payments .
other development funds will also be less than expected .
the allure of membership is beginning to dim in the light of the paper .
while waiting for delayed payments , the new members are expected to assume full responsibility for their own financial membership obligations .
new states will have to pay up like the rest of the club from 2004 onward , they will be making full contributions to the eu budget , which demand the same percentage of their gross national products -lrb- gnp -rrb- as the contributions made by current eu members .
the candidates are expected to contribute roughly three billion euro of the annual eu budget of 98.6 billion euro that all member states pay into .
intriguingly , some of the current net contributors to the eu budget - germany , the netherlands , austria , and sweden - have negotiated a reduction in their share of the british rebate payments .

the news is not good .
the hopeful states have been told that funding promised on receiving full membership is being delayed by at least two years .
on top of that , the countries are still expected to make membership payments while they wait . the european commission 's so-called ' working document ' on the calculation of net budgetary balances for new members sums up the full financial consequences of enlargement for potential new member states between 2004 and 2006 .
the possible enlargement of the european union to 30 countries is the most significant event in the history of the eu since its inception in 1957 .
spreading its borders as far as finland in the north and greece in the east , the eu hopes to become a more powerful player in international political and economic spheres .
however , the subject of enlargement has already divided europe before it has brought it together .
the payment of farming subsidies to be delayed those wanting to be part of the eu now have major financial concerns .
the european commission 's offer to give new members 25 per cent of the agricultural subsidies it gives current members is not going to happen in 2004 , as planned .
the subject is already a thorny one between eu members , many of which object to paying out farm subsidies to new members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash for crops payment to come two years later according to the commission 's working paper , the root cause of the whole funding problem is not the lack of money , but its slow movement .
the paper states that the farming subsidy payment is subject to what it calls " budget lag . "

more than 100,000 mini coopers and mini cooper s models have been sold all over the world , 76,500 alone in the first half of this year . sales rise in germany with the help of mini , but also other bmw brands , such as the new 7 series , sales have surged in europe – reaching an all-time sales increase in the uk of 71 per cent to 7,800 cars -lrb- 2001:4,500 -rrb- , followed by italy – up by 46 per cent to 6,100 automobiles , and spain – up 23 per cent to 4,700 cars . on the the difficult german market , sales increased by 11 per cent to 23,900 units . in addition , sales rose by 15 per cent in the us , and in canada by 50 per cent . new image ? analysts say the car maker ’ s current sales success – at a time of weakness both globally and in bmw ’ s key markets in the us and germany – are the result of the careful reshaping of the company ’ s image . “ bmw has moved on from the negative “ yuppie ” envy provoking connotations that haunted the brand in the late 1980s -lrb- … . -rrb- to become a widely recognized mark of achievement , ” merrill lynch automative analyst stephan reitmann told the bbc earlier this year . new cars for new target groups but bmw also sees its current success in the widening of its range of models , and the introduction of new brands for new target groups . “ what is going on on the automobile market is an increasing polarisation , ” ganal told spiegel online this week .
“ on the one hand the number of premium brands for exclusive cars is growing .
on the other hand , however , there are too many markets , who are still grappling with simple transport problems ” – meaning the increasing demand for small , simple , but still high-quality cars . after this year ’ s success with mini , bmw is now planning on introducing a new 1 series in 2004 , a car , according to ganal for “ people , who don ’ t necessarily want a large car , but one with substance ” . in addition , bmw will continue to focus on exclusive brands , including rolls royce which bmw will take over in 2003 .
to fill the gap between rolls royce and the 1 series , bmw will also be introducing the 6 series in 2004 , a large sport coupe ´ which , ganal said in spiegel , “ will help streamline bmw ’ s character and profile .

22 elections . views on how to proceed split down party lines , with the red-green government , led by schröder and green foreign minister joschka fischer reiterating their position that germany would not participate in any military action against iraq and the conservative opposition showing a willingness to consider bush 's un ultimatum . schröder : bush partly correct " his -lrb- bush 's -rrb- demand that the regime in baghdad must comply with the u.n. resolutions is partly correct , " schröder told members of the german parliament , the bundestag .
" it was never debatable that weapons inspectors must return to the country .
but what remains disputable is whether another objective should be allowed to replace this objective as the focal point of the discussion . " schröder said it was a positive development that bush had pushed the issue of u.n. resolutions back to the center of the debate and praised bush for reaffirming the un 's importance .

the news is not good .
the hopeful states have been told that funding promised on receiving full membership is being delayed by at least two years .
on top of that , the countries are still expected to make membership payments while they wait . the european commission 's so-called ' working document ' on the calculation of net budgetary balances for new members sums up the full financial consequences of enlargement for potential new member states between 2004 and 2006 .
the possible enlargement of the european union to 30 countries is the most significant event in the history of the eu since its inception in 1957 .
spreading its borders as far as finland in the north and greece in the east , the eu hopes to become a more powerful player in international political and economic spheres .
however , the subject of enlargement has already divided europe before it has brought it together .
the payment of farming subsidies to be delayed those wanting to be part of the eu now have major financial concerns .
the european commission 's offer to give new members 25 per cent of the agricultural subsidies it gives current members is not going to happen in 2004 , as planned .
the subject is already a thorny one between eu members , many of which object to paying out farm subsidies to new members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash for crops payment to come two years later according to the commission 's working paper , the root cause of the whole funding problem is not the lack of money , but its slow movement .
the paper states that the farming subsidy payment is subject to what it calls " budget lag . "
the commission document assumes the flow of funds will speed up in 2005 and 2006 , but even then , a major part of the new members ' income will come from late payments for allocations made for 2004 .
it has already been made clear by the commission that these terms are the best the candidates can get .
the explanation for the lack of promised cash will not please any of the candidates , all of which have said they are looking for significant improvements in their finances from the first year of enlargement onward .
new members will have trouble ' making ends meet ' in fact , the european commission reckons the european union will have a difficult time helping the new members make ends meet in 2004 , with the situation only improving over the next two years .
what happens after 2006 is an open question at this point , as the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 has yet to be negotiated .
by that time , the new members hope to be full partners at the negotiating table .
until then , however , most of them will have a hard time avoiding paying more into the eu budget than they receive from it . in fact , the european commission calculates that in 2004 , only the three baltic countries will see sizeable improvements in 2003 .

all the others - cyprus , malta , slovenia , hungary , the czech republic , and even slovakia - could lose out , according to the projections .
redevelopment funds are also subject to ' budget lag ' and it gets worse .
in the case of the second biggest expense for the eu after agricultural subsidies , the ' structural funds ' which are designed to finance regional economies , only 16 per cent of the 2004 allocations can be released that year in the form of advance payments .
other development funds will also be less than expected .
the allure of membership is beginning to dim in the light of the paper .
while waiting for delayed payments , the new members are expected to assume full responsibility for their own financial membership obligations .
new states will have to pay up like the rest of the club from 2004 onward , they will be making full contributions to the eu budget , which demand the same percentage of their gross national products -lrb- gnp -rrb- as the contributions made by current eu members .
the candidates are expected to contribute roughly three billion euro of the annual eu budget of 98.6 billion euro that all member states pay into .
intriguingly , some of the current net contributors to the eu budget - germany , the netherlands , austria , and sweden - have negotiated a reduction in their share of the british rebate payments .

the european commission 's offer to give new members 25 per cent of the agricultural subsidies it gives current members is not going to happen in 2004 , as planned .
the subject is already a thorny one between eu members , many of which object to paying out farm subsidies to new members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash for crops payment to come two years later according to the commission 's working paper , the root cause of the whole funding problem is not the lack of money , but its slow movement .
the paper states that the farming subsidy payment is subject to what it calls " budget lag . "
the commission document assumes the flow of funds will speed up in 2005 and 2006 , but even then , a major part of the new members ' income will come from late payments for allocations made for 2004 .
it has already been made clear by the commission that these terms are the best the candidates can get .
the explanation for the lack of promised cash will not please any of the candidates , all of which have said they are looking for significant improvements in their finances from the first year of enlargement onward .
new members will have trouble ' making ends meet ' in fact , the european commission reckons the european union will have a difficult time helping the new members make ends meet in 2004 , with the situation only improving over the next two years .
what happens after 2006 is an open question at this point , as the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 has yet to be negotiated .
by that time , the new members hope to be full partners at the negotiating table .
until then , however , most of them will have a hard time avoiding paying more into the eu budget than they receive from it . in fact , the european commission calculates that in 2004 , only the three baltic countries will see sizeable improvements in 2003 .

in the case of the second biggest expense for the eu after agricultural subsidies , the ' structural funds ' which are designed to finance regional economies , only 16 per cent of the 2004 allocations can be released that year in the form of advance payments .

the news is not good .
the hopeful states have been told that funding promised on receiving full membership is being delayed by at least two years .
on top of that , the countries are still expected to make membership payments while they wait . the european commission 's so-called ' working document ' on the calculation of net budgetary balances for new members sums up the full financial consequences of enlargement for potential new member states between 2004 and 2006 .
the possible enlargement of the european union to 30 countries is the most significant event in the history of the eu since its inception in 1957 .
spreading its borders as far as finland in the north and greece in the east , the eu hopes to become a more powerful player in international political and economic spheres .
however , the subject of enlargement has already divided europe before it has brought it together .

europe 's editorialists were n't as satisfied . the european union , which has so far presented a schizophrenic stance on a possible us invasion of iraq , welcomed president george w. bush 's speech at the united nations on thursday .
the speech proved that the united states was interested in pursuing a multilateralist approach , said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , the eu representative at the speech .
other european ministers echoed rasmussen , saying they were pleased that bush had agreed to involve the united nations in the final decision .
the speech was " very hard , clear and obvious , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who attended the speech . he said the signal sent to iraq was clear and demanded bagdad let un weapons inspectors back into the country .
germany is the only one of the 15 eu member countries to categorically reject a us invasion of iraq , even with a un mandate .
in reference to his country 's position , fischer said the german government was still " deeply concerned " about the aftermath of such an invasion .
british prime minister tony blair , bush 's staunchest ally in europe , greeted the speech " warmly " said a spokesperson .
blair said great britain would be heavily involved in shaping the un resolution , talks on which are expected by the end of the month .
preparations have already begun the comments came amid reports great britain 's armed forces had already begun preparing itself for the " biggest operation in years " according to the british broadcasting corporation . british media said the army was stockpiling weapons , supplies and military craft in a harbor in the south of the country .
the united states has already moved its operational command to qatar , a half-island abbuting saudi arabia .
such preparations prove that in the " thoughts and decisions of many , the war against iraq has already begun , " wrote the french daily " le figaro " in a friday editorial .
" only appeasement by iraq or a miracle can still stop it .
should war be avoided then it would definitely not hurt the usa , and this also wo n't occur without their support . " the left-leaning danish newspaper " politiken " praised bush 's attempt at multiateralism .
" no democratic government can call bush 's demands unreasonable , " it wrote .
" they are not meant as a threat against the iraqi people .
nothing is keeping saddam hussein from doing his people a favor ...
bush did right to demand the international community show some backbone . "
great britain 's left-leaning " guardian " newspaper said bush left a major question unanswered .
" what was signally lacking from mr bush 's speech was any information showing how or why these abuses have suddenly grown more egregious or less tolerable than before , " according to the editorial . " in other words , mr bush had the chance to answer the much-asked question : why now ?
and he dodged it . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush offers un , iraq ultimatum u.s. president george w. bush made it clear in his speech before the general assembly on thursday that if the united nations doesn ’ t take joint action against iraq and saddam hussein , then the united states will .

europe 's editorialists were n't as satisfied . the european union , which has so far presented a schizophrenic stance on a possible us invasion of iraq , welcomed president george w. bush 's speech at the united nations on thursday .
the speech proved that the united states was interested in pursuing a multilateralist approach , said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , the eu representative at the speech .
other european ministers echoed rasmussen , saying they were pleased that bush had agreed to involve the united nations in the final decision .
the speech was " very hard , clear and obvious , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who attended the speech . he said the signal sent to iraq was clear and demanded bagdad let un weapons inspectors back into the country .
germany is the only one of the 15 eu member countries to categorically reject a us invasion of iraq , even with a un mandate .
in reference to his country 's position , fischer said the german government was still " deeply concerned " about the aftermath of such an invasion .
british prime minister tony blair , bush 's staunchest ally in europe , greeted the speech " warmly " said a spokesperson .
blair said great britain would be heavily involved in shaping the un resolution , talks on which are expected by the end of the month .
preparations have already begun the comments came amid reports great britain 's armed forces had already begun preparing itself for the " biggest operation in years " according to the british broadcasting corporation . british media said the army was stockpiling weapons , supplies and military craft in a harbor in the south of the country .
the united states has already moved its operational command to qatar , a half-island abbuting saudi arabia .
such preparations prove that in the " thoughts and decisions of many , the war against iraq has already begun , " wrote the french daily " le figaro " in a friday editorial .
" only appeasement by iraq or a miracle can still stop it .
should war be avoided then it would definitely not hurt the usa , and this also wo n't occur without their support . " the left-leaning danish newspaper " politiken " praised bush 's attempt at multiateralism .
" no democratic government can call bush 's demands unreasonable , " it wrote .
" they are not meant as a threat against the iraqi people .
nothing is keeping saddam hussein from doing his people a favor ...
bush did right to demand the international community show some backbone . "
great britain 's left-leaning " guardian " newspaper said bush left a major question unanswered .
" what was signally lacking from mr bush 's speech was any information showing how or why these abuses have suddenly grown more egregious or less tolerable than before , " according to the editorial . " in other words , mr bush had the chance to answer the much-asked question : why now ?
and he dodged it .

22 elections . views on how to proceed split down party lines , with the red-green government , led by schröder and green foreign minister joschka fischer reiterating their position that germany would not participate in any military action against iraq and the conservative opposition showing a willingness to consider bush 's un ultimatum . schröder : bush partly correct " his -lrb- bush 's -rrb- demand that the regime in baghdad must comply with the u.n. resolutions is partly correct , " schröder told members of the german parliament , the bundestag .
" it was never debatable that weapons inspectors must return to the country .
but what remains disputable is whether another objective should be allowed to replace this objective as the focal point of the discussion . " schröder said it was a positive development that bush had pushed the issue of u.n. resolutions back to the center of the debate and praised bush for reaffirming the un 's importance .
he added germany would use all " diplomatic " and " economic " possibilities to support efforts to force saddam hussein into compliance . however , the chancellor reiterated his concern that any military action against iraq could cause the loosely-knit international coalition against terror to unravel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- joined schröder friday in defending germany 's stance .

22 , opposition politicians took advantage of the bundestag session to criticize the government 's recent foreign policy position , which has frayed relations with washington and also threatened the stability of europe 's joint defence and foreign policy . despite the willingness of other european leaders – including britain 's tony blair to france 's jacqués chirac – to consider military intervention under a u.n. mandate , schröder and fischer have steadfastly refused to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag bavarian premier edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is seeking to unseat schröder as the joint candidate for the conservative christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , accused the red-green government of " creating an anti-american atmosphere in its campaign . " stoiber warned that , with its " anti-american " position , the red-green government threatened to isolate germany from other european countries . but he said he doubted that germany 's army , the bundeswehr , would be asked to participate in any military intervention , anyway . in words that seemed to mirror warnings issued against bush lately , christian democratic union chairwoman angela merkel cautioned against germany " going its own way " on the iraq issue .
she said the government 's current position could not be maintained and accused schröder of changing his position from " unlimited solidarity " with the u.s. to " unlimited unilateralism .

the news is not good .
the hopeful states have been told that funding promised on receiving full membership is being delayed by at least two years .
on top of that , the countries are still expected to make membership payments while they wait . the european commission 's so-called ' working document ' on the calculation of net budgetary balances for new members sums up the full financial consequences of enlargement for potential new member states between 2004 and 2006 .
the possible enlargement of the european union to 30 countries is the most significant event in the history of the eu since its inception in 1957 .
spreading its borders as far as finland in the north and greece in the east , the eu hopes to become a more powerful player in international political and economic spheres .
however , the subject of enlargement has already divided europe before it has brought it together .
the payment of farming subsidies to be delayed those wanting to be part of the eu now have major financial concerns .
the european commission 's offer to give new members 25 per cent of the agricultural subsidies it gives current members is not going to happen in 2004 , as planned .
the subject is already a thorny one between eu members , many of which object to paying out farm subsidies to new members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash for crops payment to come two years later according to the commission 's working paper , the root cause of the whole funding problem is not the lack of money , but its slow movement .
the paper states that the farming subsidy payment is subject to what it calls " budget lag . "
the commission document assumes the flow of funds will speed up in 2005 and 2006 , but even then , a major part of the new members ' income will come from late payments for allocations made for 2004 .
it has already been made clear by the commission that these terms are the best the candidates can get .
the explanation for the lack of promised cash will not please any of the candidates , all of which have said they are looking for significant improvements in their finances from the first year of enlargement onward .
new members will have trouble ' making ends meet ' in fact , the european commission reckons the european union will have a difficult time helping the new members make ends meet in 2004 , with the situation only improving over the next two years .
what happens after 2006 is an open question at this point , as the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 has yet to be negotiated .
by that time , the new members hope to be full partners at the negotiating table .
until then , however , most of them will have a hard time avoiding paying more into the eu budget than they receive from it . in fact , the european commission calculates that in 2004 , only the three baltic countries will see sizeable improvements in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the safety of nuclear sites will not be compromised by funding problems lithuania , which will already benefit from the nuclear ' safety-program ' fund , latvia , and estonia expect to receive well needed money after one year of membership .
poland , by far the largest , and far from the richest , of the applicants will benefit to a lesser degree .
all the others - cyprus , malta , slovenia , hungary , the czech republic , and even slovakia - could lose out , according to the projections .
redevelopment funds are also subject to ' budget lag ' and it gets worse .
in the case of the second biggest expense for the eu after agricultural subsidies , the ' structural funds ' which are designed to finance regional economies , only 16 per cent of the 2004 allocations can be released that year in the form of advance payments .
other development funds will also be less than expected .
the allure of membership is beginning to dim in the light of the paper .
while waiting for delayed payments , the new members are expected to assume full responsibility for their own financial membership obligations .
new states will have to pay up like the rest of the club from 2004 onward , they will be making full contributions to the eu budget , which demand the same percentage of their gross national products -lrb- gnp -rrb- as the contributions made by current eu members .
the candidates are expected to contribute roughly three billion euro of the annual eu budget of 98.6 billion euro that all member states pay into .
intriguingly , some of the current net contributors to the eu budget - germany , the netherlands , austria , and sweden - have negotiated a reduction in their share of the british rebate payments .
according to commission calculations , the new members will in addition need to share the extra burden generated by these reductions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links european union enlargement the european union 's web site concerning all aspects of the proposed enlargement with a clickable map with information on candidate states .

“ if anyone ’ s not happy that a product is on the list , they have two months to let the commission know ” , an official said . biggest transatlantic trade dispute the eu was authorised to impose sanctions worth 4.043 billion euro -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- by the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- two weeks ago . the wto approved the sanctions after the eu claimed the tax break was costing the european economy billions of dollars in lost trade . by publishing the sanctions list , the eu hopes to put maximum pressure on the us to change its offending legislation . but eu trade commissioner pascal lamy will face a delicate balancing act over the coming months over what is regarded as the biggest transatlantic trade dispute in history . " a nuclear bomb in trade relations " transatlantic trade relations are already overshadowed by the us 's threats to place protective tariffs on european imported steel . in addition , heavy eu duties on specific products made in america would harm european importers and , as a result , european customers , something that concerns the continent 's trade groups . the eu is keen to maintain the pressure but still hopes to avoid heavy sanctions – a step robert zoellick , the us trade representative , has said would be like detonating a “ nuclear bomb ” in the world trading system . it has therefore made it clear that is will not rush into sanctions , saying it would only apply sanctions if washington did not make sufficient progress in scrapping the illegal tax scheme in the coming months . hopes for us reform but so far , washington has failed to fulfill the wto ’ s demands for reform . the wto first ruled the us tax breaks as illegal in 2000 .
the original us corporate tax law allowed some of the foreign profits of american exporters to be tax exempt .
the eu declared these breaks as unfair as they favoured sales to foreign customers over domestic ones . after the first ruling , the law was rewritten by congress .
but in 2001 , the wto renewed its warning , saying the revision did not go far enough . two weeks ago , the world trade organisation finally gave the eu the right to impose sanctions on us products worth some 4 billion euro . u.s. president george w. bush has repeatedly promised reform .
but congress , under pressure from u.s. corporations , is still reluctant to give way .

the news is not good .
the hopeful states have been told that funding promised on receiving full membership is being delayed by at least two years .
on top of that , the countries are still expected to make membership payments while they wait . the european commission 's so-called ' working document ' on the calculation of net budgetary balances for new members sums up the full financial consequences of enlargement for potential new member states between 2004 and 2006 .
the possible enlargement of the european union to 30 countries is the most significant event in the history of the eu since its inception in 1957 .
spreading its borders as far as finland in the north and greece in the east , the eu hopes to become a more powerful player in international political and economic spheres .
however , the subject of enlargement has already divided europe before it has brought it together .
the payment of farming subsidies to be delayed those wanting to be part of the eu now have major financial concerns .
the european commission 's offer to give new members 25 per cent of the agricultural subsidies it gives current members is not going to happen in 2004 , as planned .
the subject is already a thorny one between eu members , many of which object to paying out farm subsidies to new members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash for crops payment to come two years later according to the commission 's working paper , the root cause of the whole funding problem is not the lack of money , but its slow movement .
the paper states that the farming subsidy payment is subject to what it calls " budget lag . "
the commission document assumes the flow of funds will speed up in 2005 and 2006 , but even then , a major part of the new members ' income will come from late payments for allocations made for 2004 .
it has already been made clear by the commission that these terms are the best the candidates can get .
the explanation for the lack of promised cash will not please any of the candidates , all of which have said they are looking for significant improvements in their finances from the first year of enlargement onward .
new members will have trouble ' making ends meet ' in fact , the european commission reckons the european union will have a difficult time helping the new members make ends meet in 2004 , with the situation only improving over the next two years .
what happens after 2006 is an open question at this point , as the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 has yet to be negotiated .
by that time , the new members hope to be full partners at the negotiating table .
until then , however , most of them will have a hard time avoiding paying more into the eu budget than they receive from it . in fact , the european commission calculates that in 2004 , only the three baltic countries will see sizeable improvements in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the safety of nuclear sites will not be compromised by funding problems lithuania , which will already benefit from the nuclear ' safety-program ' fund , latvia , and estonia expect to receive well needed money after one year of membership .
poland , by far the largest , and far from the richest , of the applicants will benefit to a lesser degree .
all the others - cyprus , malta , slovenia , hungary , the czech republic , and even slovakia - could lose out , according to the projections .
redevelopment funds are also subject to ' budget lag ' and it gets worse .
in the case of the second biggest expense for the eu after agricultural subsidies , the ' structural funds ' which are designed to finance regional economies , only 16 per cent of the 2004 allocations can be released that year in the form of advance payments .
other development funds will also be less than expected .
the allure of membership is beginning to dim in the light of the paper .
while waiting for delayed payments , the new members are expected to assume full responsibility for their own financial membership obligations .
new states will have to pay up like the rest of the club from 2004 onward , they will be making full contributions to the eu budget , which demand the same percentage of their gross national products -lrb- gnp -rrb- as the contributions made by current eu members .
the candidates are expected to contribute roughly three billion euro of the annual eu budget of 98.6 billion euro that all member states pay into .
intriguingly , some of the current net contributors to the eu budget - germany , the netherlands , austria , and sweden - have negotiated a reduction in their share of the british rebate payments .
according to commission calculations , the new members will in addition need to share the extra burden generated by these reductions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links european union enlargement the european union 's web site concerning all aspects of the proposed enlargement with a clickable map with information on candidate states .

“ if anyone ’ s not happy that a product is on the list , they have two months to let the commission know ” , an official said . biggest transatlantic trade dispute the eu was authorised to impose sanctions worth 4.043 billion euro -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- by the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- two weeks ago . the wto approved the sanctions after the eu claimed the tax break was costing the european economy billions of dollars in lost trade . by publishing the sanctions list , the eu hopes to put maximum pressure on the us to change its offending legislation . but eu trade commissioner pascal lamy will face a delicate balancing act over the coming months over what is regarded as the biggest transatlantic trade dispute in history . " a nuclear bomb in trade relations " transatlantic trade relations are already overshadowed by the us 's threats to place protective tariffs on european imported steel . in addition , heavy eu duties on specific products made in america would harm european importers and , as a result , european customers , something that concerns the continent 's trade groups . the eu is keen to maintain the pressure but still hopes to avoid heavy sanctions – a step robert zoellick , the us trade representative , has said would be like detonating a “ nuclear bomb ” in the world trading system . it has therefore made it clear that is will not rush into sanctions , saying it would only apply sanctions if washington did not make sufficient progress in scrapping the illegal tax scheme in the coming months . hopes for us reform but so far , washington has failed to fulfill the wto ’ s demands for reform . the wto first ruled the us tax breaks as illegal in 2000 .
the original us corporate tax law allowed some of the foreign profits of american exporters to be tax exempt .
the eu declared these breaks as unfair as they favoured sales to foreign customers over domestic ones . after the first ruling , the law was rewritten by congress .
but in 2001 , the wto renewed its warning , saying the revision did not go far enough . two weeks ago , the world trade organisation finally gave the eu the right to impose sanctions on us products worth some 4 billion euro . u.s. president george w. bush has repeatedly promised reform .
but congress , under pressure from u.s. corporations , is still reluctant to give way .
various attempts at introducing bills have been blocked by both democrats and republicans , who have been lobbied by big exporters in their various districts . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us loses decades-old trade dispute a wto decision allowed the european union to place duties on $ 4.04 billion worth of us exports , but both sides do n't want it to get to that point .

bmw brands have sold more than 600,000 models so far in 2002 . “ this result confirms our expectations of being able to deliver over a million bmw and mini brand vehicles to customers this year for the first time , ” bmw ’ s marketing and sales director , michael ganal told the bbc . particularly the mini brand has proved a real hit after its market launch in the united kingdom in july 2001 , 40 years after tiny car first appeared on the car market .
more than 100,000 mini coopers and mini cooper s models have been sold all over the world , 76,500 alone in the first half of this year . sales rise in germany with the help of mini , but also other bmw brands , such as the new 7 series , sales have surged in europe – reaching an all-time sales increase in the uk of 71 per cent to 7,800 cars -lrb- 2001:4,500 -rrb- , followed by italy – up by 46 per cent to 6,100 automobiles , and spain – up 23 per cent to 4,700 cars . on the the difficult german market , sales increased by 11 per cent to 23,900 units . in addition , sales rose by 15 per cent in the us , and in canada by 50 per cent . new image ? analysts say the car maker ’ s current sales success – at a time of weakness both globally and in bmw ’ s key markets in the us and germany – are the result of the careful reshaping of the company ’ s image . “ bmw has moved on from the negative “ yuppie ” envy provoking connotations that haunted the brand in the late 1980s -lrb- … . -rrb- to become a widely recognized mark of achievement , ” merrill lynch automative analyst stephan reitmann told the bbc earlier this year . new cars for new target groups but bmw also sees its current success in the widening of its range of models , and the introduction of new brands for new target groups . “ what is going on on the automobile market is an increasing polarisation , ” ganal told spiegel online this week .
“ on the one hand the number of premium brands for exclusive cars is growing .
on the other hand , however , there are too many markets , who are still grappling with simple transport problems ” – meaning the increasing demand for small , simple , but still high-quality cars . after this year ’ s success with mini , bmw is now planning on introducing a new 1 series in 2004 , a car , according to ganal for “ people , who don ’ t necessarily want a large car , but one with substance ” . in addition , bmw will continue to focus on exclusive brands , including rolls royce which bmw will take over in 2003 .
to fill the gap between rolls royce and the 1 series , bmw will also be introducing the 6 series in 2004 , a large sport coupe ´ which , ganal said in spiegel , “ will help streamline bmw ’ s character and profile .

the news is not good .
the hopeful states have been told that funding promised on receiving full membership is being delayed by at least two years .
on top of that , the countries are still expected to make membership payments while they wait . the european commission 's so-called ' working document ' on the calculation of net budgetary balances for new members sums up the full financial consequences of enlargement for potential new member states between 2004 and 2006 .
the possible enlargement of the european union to 30 countries is the most significant event in the history of the eu since its inception in 1957 .
spreading its borders as far as finland in the north and greece in the east , the eu hopes to become a more powerful player in international political and economic spheres .
however , the subject of enlargement has already divided europe before it has brought it together .
the payment of farming subsidies to be delayed those wanting to be part of the eu now have major financial concerns .
the european commission 's offer to give new members 25 per cent of the agricultural subsidies it gives current members is not going to happen in 2004 , as planned .
the subject is already a thorny one between eu members , many of which object to paying out farm subsidies to new members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash for crops payment to come two years later according to the commission 's working paper , the root cause of the whole funding problem is not the lack of money , but its slow movement .
the paper states that the farming subsidy payment is subject to what it calls " budget lag . "
the commission document assumes the flow of funds will speed up in 2005 and 2006 , but even then , a major part of the new members ' income will come from late payments for allocations made for 2004 .
it has already been made clear by the commission that these terms are the best the candidates can get .
the explanation for the lack of promised cash will not please any of the candidates , all of which have said they are looking for significant improvements in their finances from the first year of enlargement onward .
new members will have trouble ' making ends meet ' in fact , the european commission reckons the european union will have a difficult time helping the new members make ends meet in 2004 , with the situation only improving over the next two years .
what happens after 2006 is an open question at this point , as the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 has yet to be negotiated .
by that time , the new members hope to be full partners at the negotiating table .
until then , however , most of them will have a hard time avoiding paying more into the eu budget than they receive from it . in fact , the european commission calculates that in 2004 , only the three baltic countries will see sizeable improvements in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the safety of nuclear sites will not be compromised by funding problems lithuania , which will already benefit from the nuclear ' safety-program ' fund , latvia , and estonia expect to receive well needed money after one year of membership .
poland , by far the largest , and far from the richest , of the applicants will benefit to a lesser degree .
all the others - cyprus , malta , slovenia , hungary , the czech republic , and even slovakia - could lose out , according to the projections .
redevelopment funds are also subject to ' budget lag ' and it gets worse .
in the case of the second biggest expense for the eu after agricultural subsidies , the ' structural funds ' which are designed to finance regional economies , only 16 per cent of the 2004 allocations can be released that year in the form of advance payments .
other development funds will also be less than expected .
the allure of membership is beginning to dim in the light of the paper .
while waiting for delayed payments , the new members are expected to assume full responsibility for their own financial membership obligations .
new states will have to pay up like the rest of the club from 2004 onward , they will be making full contributions to the eu budget , which demand the same percentage of their gross national products -lrb- gnp -rrb- as the contributions made by current eu members .
the candidates are expected to contribute roughly three billion euro of the annual eu budget of 98.6 billion euro that all member states pay into .
intriguingly , some of the current net contributors to the eu budget - germany , the netherlands , austria , and sweden - have negotiated a reduction in their share of the british rebate payments .
according to commission calculations , the new members will in addition need to share the extra burden generated by these reductions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links european union enlargement the european union 's web site concerning all aspects of the proposed enlargement with a clickable map with information on candidate states .

22 elections . views on how to proceed split down party lines , with the red-green government , led by schröder and green foreign minister joschka fischer reiterating their position that germany would not participate in any military action against iraq and the conservative opposition showing a willingness to consider bush 's un ultimatum . schröder : bush partly correct " his -lrb- bush 's -rrb- demand that the regime in baghdad must comply with the u.n. resolutions is partly correct , " schröder told members of the german parliament , the bundestag .
" it was never debatable that weapons inspectors must return to the country .
but what remains disputable is whether another objective should be allowed to replace this objective as the focal point of the discussion . " schröder said it was a positive development that bush had pushed the issue of u.n. resolutions back to the center of the debate and praised bush for reaffirming the un 's importance .
he added germany would use all " diplomatic " and " economic " possibilities to support efforts to force saddam hussein into compliance . however , the chancellor reiterated his concern that any military action against iraq could cause the loosely-knit international coalition against terror to unravel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- joined schröder friday in defending germany 's stance .
fischer said bush 's speech did little to allay his concerns about america 's intentions in iraq .
the conditions imposed by the president , he said , " are anything but simple . " opposition attacks ' anti-american ' campaign tactics with barely a week to go until federal elections on sept .
22 , opposition politicians took advantage of the bundestag session to criticize the government 's recent foreign policy position , which has frayed relations with washington and also threatened the stability of europe 's joint defence and foreign policy . despite the willingness of other european leaders – including britain 's tony blair to france 's jacqués chirac – to consider military intervention under a u.n. mandate , schröder and fischer have steadfastly refused to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag bavarian premier edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is seeking to unseat schröder as the joint candidate for the conservative christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , accused the red-green government of " creating an anti-american atmosphere in its campaign . " stoiber warned that , with its " anti-american " position , the red-green government threatened to isolate germany from other european countries . but he said he doubted that germany 's army , the bundeswehr , would be asked to participate in any military intervention , anyway . in words that seemed to mirror warnings issued against bush lately , christian democratic union chairwoman angela merkel cautioned against germany " going its own way " on the iraq issue .
she said the government 's current position could not be maintained and accused schröder of changing his position from " unlimited solidarity " with the u.s. to " unlimited unilateralism . " eu lauds bush speech as the iraq debate raged on in germany , it reduced intensity in other parts of europe on friday .
speaking for the european union , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said bush 's speech proved that the united states was interested in pursuing a multilateralist approach .
other european ministers echoed rasmussen , saying they were pleased that bush had agreed to involve the u.n. in the final decision . british prime minister tony blair , bush 's staunchest ally in europe , greeted the speech " warmly " said a spokesperson .
blair said the united kingdom would be heavily involved in shaping the un resolution , talks on which are expected by the end of the month . bbc : british troops mobilizing the comments came amid reports the u.k.

“ if anyone ’ s not happy that a product is on the list , they have two months to let the commission know ” , an official said . biggest transatlantic trade dispute the eu was authorised to impose sanctions worth 4.043 billion euro -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- by the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- two weeks ago . the wto approved the sanctions after the eu claimed the tax break was costing the european economy billions of dollars in lost trade . by publishing the sanctions list , the eu hopes to put maximum pressure on the us to change its offending legislation . but eu trade commissioner pascal lamy will face a delicate balancing act over the coming months over what is regarded as the biggest transatlantic trade dispute in history . " a nuclear bomb in trade relations " transatlantic trade relations are already overshadowed by the us 's threats to place protective tariffs on european imported steel . in addition , heavy eu duties on specific products made in america would harm european importers and , as a result , european customers , something that concerns the continent 's trade groups . the eu is keen to maintain the pressure but still hopes to avoid heavy sanctions – a step robert zoellick , the us trade representative , has said would be like detonating a “ nuclear bomb ” in the world trading system . it has therefore made it clear that is will not rush into sanctions , saying it would only apply sanctions if washington did not make sufficient progress in scrapping the illegal tax scheme in the coming months . hopes for us reform but so far , washington has failed to fulfill the wto ’ s demands for reform . the wto first ruled the us tax breaks as illegal in 2000 .
the original us corporate tax law allowed some of the foreign profits of american exporters to be tax exempt .
the eu declared these breaks as unfair as they favoured sales to foreign customers over domestic ones . after the first ruling , the law was rewritten by congress .
but in 2001 , the wto renewed its warning , saying the revision did not go far enough . two weeks ago , the world trade organisation finally gave the eu the right to impose sanctions on us products worth some 4 billion euro . u.s. president george w. bush has repeatedly promised reform .

bmw brands have sold more than 600,000 models so far in 2002 . “ this result confirms our expectations of being able to deliver over a million bmw and mini brand vehicles to customers this year for the first time , ” bmw ’ s marketing and sales director , michael ganal told the bbc . particularly the mini brand has proved a real hit after its market launch in the united kingdom in july 2001 , 40 years after tiny car first appeared on the car market .
more than 100,000 mini coopers and mini cooper s models have been sold all over the world , 76,500 alone in the first half of this year . sales rise in germany with the help of mini , but also other bmw brands , such as the new 7 series , sales have surged in europe – reaching an all-time sales increase in the uk of 71 per cent to 7,800 cars -lrb- 2001:4,500 -rrb- , followed by italy – up by 46 per cent to 6,100 automobiles , and spain – up 23 per cent to 4,700 cars . on the the difficult german market , sales increased by 11 per cent to 23,900 units . in addition , sales rose by 15 per cent in the us , and in canada by 50 per cent . new image ? analysts say the car maker ’ s current sales success – at a time of weakness both globally and in bmw ’ s key markets in the us and germany – are the result of the careful reshaping of the company ’ s image . “ bmw has moved on from the negative “ yuppie ” envy provoking connotations that haunted the brand in the late 1980s -lrb- … . -rrb- to become a widely recognized mark of achievement , ” merrill lynch automative analyst stephan reitmann told the bbc earlier this year . new cars for new target groups but bmw also sees its current success in the widening of its range of models , and the introduction of new brands for new target groups . “ what is going on on the automobile market is an increasing polarisation , ” ganal told spiegel online this week .

europe 's editorialists were n't as satisfied . the european union , which has so far presented a schizophrenic stance on a possible us invasion of iraq , welcomed president george w. bush 's speech at the united nations on thursday .
the speech proved that the united states was interested in pursuing a multilateralist approach , said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , the eu representative at the speech .
other european ministers echoed rasmussen , saying they were pleased that bush had agreed to involve the united nations in the final decision .
the speech was " very hard , clear and obvious , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who attended the speech . he said the signal sent to iraq was clear and demanded bagdad let un weapons inspectors back into the country .
germany is the only one of the 15 eu member countries to categorically reject a us invasion of iraq , even with a un mandate .
in reference to his country 's position , fischer said the german government was still " deeply concerned " about the aftermath of such an invasion .
british prime minister tony blair , bush 's staunchest ally in europe , greeted the speech " warmly " said a spokesperson .
blair said great britain would be heavily involved in shaping the un resolution , talks on which are expected by the end of the month .
preparations have already begun the comments came amid reports great britain 's armed forces had already begun preparing itself for the " biggest operation in years " according to the british broadcasting corporation . british media said the army was stockpiling weapons , supplies and military craft in a harbor in the south of the country .
the united states has already moved its operational command to qatar , a half-island abbuting saudi arabia .
such preparations prove that in the " thoughts and decisions of many , the war against iraq has already begun , " wrote the french daily " le figaro " in a friday editorial .
" only appeasement by iraq or a miracle can still stop it .
should war be avoided then it would definitely not hurt the usa , and this also wo n't occur without their support . " the left-leaning danish newspaper " politiken " praised bush 's attempt at multiateralism .
" no democratic government can call bush 's demands unreasonable , " it wrote .
" they are not meant as a threat against the iraqi people .
nothing is keeping saddam hussein from doing his people a favor ...
bush did right to demand the international community show some backbone . "
great britain 's left-leaning " guardian " newspaper said bush left a major question unanswered .
" what was signally lacking from mr bush 's speech was any information showing how or why these abuses have suddenly grown more egregious or less tolerable than before , " according to the editorial . " in other words , mr bush had the chance to answer the much-asked question : why now ?
and he dodged it .

europe 's editorialists were n't as satisfied . the european union , which has so far presented a schizophrenic stance on a possible us invasion of iraq , welcomed president george w. bush 's speech at the united nations on thursday .
the speech proved that the united states was interested in pursuing a multilateralist approach , said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , the eu representative at the speech .
other european ministers echoed rasmussen , saying they were pleased that bush had agreed to involve the united nations in the final decision .
the speech was " very hard , clear and obvious , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who attended the speech . he said the signal sent to iraq was clear and demanded bagdad let un weapons inspectors back into the country .
germany is the only one of the 15 eu member countries to categorically reject a us invasion of iraq , even with a un mandate .
in reference to his country 's position , fischer said the german government was still " deeply concerned " about the aftermath of such an invasion .
british prime minister tony blair , bush 's staunchest ally in europe , greeted the speech " warmly " said a spokesperson .
blair said great britain would be heavily involved in shaping the un resolution , talks on which are expected by the end of the month .
preparations have already begun the comments came amid reports great britain 's armed forces had already begun preparing itself for the " biggest operation in years " according to the british broadcasting corporation . british media said the army was stockpiling weapons , supplies and military craft in a harbor in the south of the country .
the united states has already moved its operational command to qatar , a half-island abbuting saudi arabia .
such preparations prove that in the " thoughts and decisions of many , the war against iraq has already begun , " wrote the french daily " le figaro " in a friday editorial .
" only appeasement by iraq or a miracle can still stop it .
should war be avoided then it would definitely not hurt the usa , and this also wo n't occur without their support . " the left-leaning danish newspaper " politiken " praised bush 's attempt at multiateralism .
" no democratic government can call bush 's demands unreasonable , " it wrote .
" they are not meant as a threat against the iraqi people .
nothing is keeping saddam hussein from doing his people a favor ...
bush did right to demand the international community show some backbone . "
great britain 's left-leaning " guardian " newspaper said bush left a major question unanswered .
" what was signally lacking from mr bush 's speech was any information showing how or why these abuses have suddenly grown more egregious or less tolerable than before , " according to the editorial . " in other words , mr bush had the chance to answer the much-asked question : why now ?
and he dodged it . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush offers un , iraq ultimatum u.s. president george w. bush made it clear in his speech before the general assembly on thursday that if the united nations doesn ’ t take joint action against iraq and saddam hussein , then the united states will .

the news is not good .
the hopeful states have been told that funding promised on receiving full membership is being delayed by at least two years .
on top of that , the countries are still expected to make membership payments while they wait . the european commission 's so-called ' working document ' on the calculation of net budgetary balances for new members sums up the full financial consequences of enlargement for potential new member states between 2004 and 2006 .
the possible enlargement of the european union to 30 countries is the most significant event in the history of the eu since its inception in 1957 .
spreading its borders as far as finland in the north and greece in the east , the eu hopes to become a more powerful player in international political and economic spheres .
however , the subject of enlargement has already divided europe before it has brought it together .
the payment of farming subsidies to be delayed those wanting to be part of the eu now have major financial concerns .
the european commission 's offer to give new members 25 per cent of the agricultural subsidies it gives current members is not going to happen in 2004 , as planned .
the subject is already a thorny one between eu members , many of which object to paying out farm subsidies to new members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash for crops payment to come two years later according to the commission 's working paper , the root cause of the whole funding problem is not the lack of money , but its slow movement .
the paper states that the farming subsidy payment is subject to what it calls " budget lag . "
the commission document assumes the flow of funds will speed up in 2005 and 2006 , but even then , a major part of the new members ' income will come from late payments for allocations made for 2004 .
it has already been made clear by the commission that these terms are the best the candidates can get .
the explanation for the lack of promised cash will not please any of the candidates , all of which have said they are looking for significant improvements in their finances from the first year of enlargement onward .
new members will have trouble ' making ends meet ' in fact , the european commission reckons the european union will have a difficult time helping the new members make ends meet in 2004 , with the situation only improving over the next two years .
what happens after 2006 is an open question at this point , as the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 has yet to be negotiated .
by that time , the new members hope to be full partners at the negotiating table .
until then , however , most of them will have a hard time avoiding paying more into the eu budget than they receive from it . in fact , the european commission calculates that in 2004 , only the three baltic countries will see sizeable improvements in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the safety of nuclear sites will not be compromised by funding problems lithuania , which will already benefit from the nuclear ' safety-program ' fund , latvia , and estonia expect to receive well needed money after one year of membership .
poland , by far the largest , and far from the richest , of the applicants will benefit to a lesser degree .
all the others - cyprus , malta , slovenia , hungary , the czech republic , and even slovakia - could lose out , according to the projections .
redevelopment funds are also subject to ' budget lag ' and it gets worse .
in the case of the second biggest expense for the eu after agricultural subsidies , the ' structural funds ' which are designed to finance regional economies , only 16 per cent of the 2004 allocations can be released that year in the form of advance payments .
other development funds will also be less than expected .
the allure of membership is beginning to dim in the light of the paper .
while waiting for delayed payments , the new members are expected to assume full responsibility for their own financial membership obligations .
new states will have to pay up like the rest of the club from 2004 onward , they will be making full contributions to the eu budget , which demand the same percentage of their gross national products -lrb- gnp -rrb- as the contributions made by current eu members .
the candidates are expected to contribute roughly three billion euro of the annual eu budget of 98.6 billion euro that all member states pay into .
intriguingly , some of the current net contributors to the eu budget - germany , the netherlands , austria , and sweden - have negotiated a reduction in their share of the british rebate payments .
according to commission calculations , the new members will in addition need to share the extra burden generated by these reductions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links european union enlargement the european union 's web site concerning all aspects of the proposed enlargement with a clickable map with information on candidate states .

22 elections . views on how to proceed split down party lines , with the red-green government , led by schröder and green foreign minister joschka fischer reiterating their position that germany would not participate in any military action against iraq and the conservative opposition showing a willingness to consider bush 's un ultimatum . schröder : bush partly correct " his -lrb- bush 's -rrb- demand that the regime in baghdad must comply with the u.n. resolutions is partly correct , " schröder told members of the german parliament , the bundestag .
" it was never debatable that weapons inspectors must return to the country .
but what remains disputable is whether another objective should be allowed to replace this objective as the focal point of the discussion . " schröder said it was a positive development that bush had pushed the issue of u.n. resolutions back to the center of the debate and praised bush for reaffirming the un 's importance .

“ if anyone ’ s not happy that a product is on the list , they have two months to let the commission know ” , an official said . biggest transatlantic trade dispute the eu was authorised to impose sanctions worth 4.043 billion euro -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- by the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- two weeks ago . the wto approved the sanctions after the eu claimed the tax break was costing the european economy billions of dollars in lost trade . by publishing the sanctions list , the eu hopes to put maximum pressure on the us to change its offending legislation . but eu trade commissioner pascal lamy will face a delicate balancing act over the coming months over what is regarded as the biggest transatlantic trade dispute in history . " a nuclear bomb in trade relations " transatlantic trade relations are already overshadowed by the us 's threats to place protective tariffs on european imported steel . in addition , heavy eu duties on specific products made in america would harm european importers and , as a result , european customers , something that concerns the continent 's trade groups . the eu is keen to maintain the pressure but still hopes to avoid heavy sanctions – a step robert zoellick , the us trade representative , has said would be like detonating a “ nuclear bomb ” in the world trading system . it has therefore made it clear that is will not rush into sanctions , saying it would only apply sanctions if washington did not make sufficient progress in scrapping the illegal tax scheme in the coming months . hopes for us reform but so far , washington has failed to fulfill the wto ’ s demands for reform . the wto first ruled the us tax breaks as illegal in 2000 .
the original us corporate tax law allowed some of the foreign profits of american exporters to be tax exempt .
the eu declared these breaks as unfair as they favoured sales to foreign customers over domestic ones . after the first ruling , the law was rewritten by congress .
but in 2001 , the wto renewed its warning , saying the revision did not go far enough . two weeks ago , the world trade organisation finally gave the eu the right to impose sanctions on us products worth some 4 billion euro . u.s. president george w. bush has repeatedly promised reform .
but congress , under pressure from u.s. corporations , is still reluctant to give way .
various attempts at introducing bills have been blocked by both democrats and republicans , who have been lobbied by big exporters in their various districts . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us loses decades-old trade dispute a wto decision allowed the european union to place duties on $ 4.04 billion worth of us exports , but both sides do n't want it to get to that point .

the news is not good .
the hopeful states have been told that funding promised on receiving full membership is being delayed by at least two years .
on top of that , the countries are still expected to make membership payments while they wait . the european commission 's so-called ' working document ' on the calculation of net budgetary balances for new members sums up the full financial consequences of enlargement for potential new member states between 2004 and 2006 .
the possible enlargement of the european union to 30 countries is the most significant event in the history of the eu since its inception in 1957 .
spreading its borders as far as finland in the north and greece in the east , the eu hopes to become a more powerful player in international political and economic spheres .
however , the subject of enlargement has already divided europe before it has brought it together .
the payment of farming subsidies to be delayed those wanting to be part of the eu now have major financial concerns .
the european commission 's offer to give new members 25 per cent of the agricultural subsidies it gives current members is not going to happen in 2004 , as planned .
the subject is already a thorny one between eu members , many of which object to paying out farm subsidies to new members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash for crops payment to come two years later according to the commission 's working paper , the root cause of the whole funding problem is not the lack of money , but its slow movement .
the paper states that the farming subsidy payment is subject to what it calls " budget lag . "
the commission document assumes the flow of funds will speed up in 2005 and 2006 , but even then , a major part of the new members ' income will come from late payments for allocations made for 2004 .
it has already been made clear by the commission that these terms are the best the candidates can get .
the explanation for the lack of promised cash will not please any of the candidates , all of which have said they are looking for significant improvements in their finances from the first year of enlargement onward .
new members will have trouble ' making ends meet ' in fact , the european commission reckons the european union will have a difficult time helping the new members make ends meet in 2004 , with the situation only improving over the next two years .
what happens after 2006 is an open question at this point , as the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 has yet to be negotiated .
by that time , the new members hope to be full partners at the negotiating table .
until then , however , most of them will have a hard time avoiding paying more into the eu budget than they receive from it . in fact , the european commission calculates that in 2004 , only the three baltic countries will see sizeable improvements in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the safety of nuclear sites will not be compromised by funding problems lithuania , which will already benefit from the nuclear ' safety-program ' fund , latvia , and estonia expect to receive well needed money after one year of membership .
poland , by far the largest , and far from the richest , of the applicants will benefit to a lesser degree .
all the others - cyprus , malta , slovenia , hungary , the czech republic , and even slovakia - could lose out , according to the projections .
redevelopment funds are also subject to ' budget lag ' and it gets worse .
in the case of the second biggest expense for the eu after agricultural subsidies , the ' structural funds ' which are designed to finance regional economies , only 16 per cent of the 2004 allocations can be released that year in the form of advance payments .
other development funds will also be less than expected .
the allure of membership is beginning to dim in the light of the paper .
while waiting for delayed payments , the new members are expected to assume full responsibility for their own financial membership obligations .
new states will have to pay up like the rest of the club from 2004 onward , they will be making full contributions to the eu budget , which demand the same percentage of their gross national products -lrb- gnp -rrb- as the contributions made by current eu members .
the candidates are expected to contribute roughly three billion euro of the annual eu budget of 98.6 billion euro that all member states pay into .
intriguingly , some of the current net contributors to the eu budget - germany , the netherlands , austria , and sweden - have negotiated a reduction in their share of the british rebate payments .
according to commission calculations , the new members will in addition need to share the extra burden generated by these reductions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links european union enlargement the european union 's web site concerning all aspects of the proposed enlargement with a clickable map with information on candidate states .

“ if anyone ’ s not happy that a product is on the list , they have two months to let the commission know ” , an official said . biggest transatlantic trade dispute the eu was authorised to impose sanctions worth 4.043 billion euro -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- by the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- two weeks ago . the wto approved the sanctions after the eu claimed the tax break was costing the european economy billions of dollars in lost trade . by publishing the sanctions list , the eu hopes to put maximum pressure on the us to change its offending legislation . but eu trade commissioner pascal lamy will face a delicate balancing act over the coming months over what is regarded as the biggest transatlantic trade dispute in history . " a nuclear bomb in trade relations " transatlantic trade relations are already overshadowed by the us 's threats to place protective tariffs on european imported steel . in addition , heavy eu duties on specific products made in america would harm european importers and , as a result , european customers , something that concerns the continent 's trade groups . the eu is keen to maintain the pressure but still hopes to avoid heavy sanctions – a step robert zoellick , the us trade representative , has said would be like detonating a “ nuclear bomb ” in the world trading system . it has therefore made it clear that is will not rush into sanctions , saying it would only apply sanctions if washington did not make sufficient progress in scrapping the illegal tax scheme in the coming months . hopes for us reform but so far , washington has failed to fulfill the wto ’ s demands for reform . the wto first ruled the us tax breaks as illegal in 2000 .
the original us corporate tax law allowed some of the foreign profits of american exporters to be tax exempt .
the eu declared these breaks as unfair as they favoured sales to foreign customers over domestic ones . after the first ruling , the law was rewritten by congress .
but in 2001 , the wto renewed its warning , saying the revision did not go far enough . two weeks ago , the world trade organisation finally gave the eu the right to impose sanctions on us products worth some 4 billion euro . u.s. president george w. bush has repeatedly promised reform .
but congress , under pressure from u.s. corporations , is still reluctant to give way .
various attempts at introducing bills have been blocked by both democrats and republicans , who have been lobbied by big exporters in their various districts . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us loses decades-old trade dispute a wto decision allowed the european union to place duties on $ 4.04 billion worth of us exports , but both sides do n't want it to get to that point .

the news is not good .
the hopeful states have been told that funding promised on receiving full membership is being delayed by at least two years .
on top of that , the countries are still expected to make membership payments while they wait . the european commission 's so-called ' working document ' on the calculation of net budgetary balances for new members sums up the full financial consequences of enlargement for potential new member states between 2004 and 2006 .
the possible enlargement of the european union to 30 countries is the most significant event in the history of the eu since its inception in 1957 .
spreading its borders as far as finland in the north and greece in the east , the eu hopes to become a more powerful player in international political and economic spheres .
however , the subject of enlargement has already divided europe before it has brought it together .
the payment of farming subsidies to be delayed those wanting to be part of the eu now have major financial concerns .
the european commission 's offer to give new members 25 per cent of the agricultural subsidies it gives current members is not going to happen in 2004 , as planned .

the paper states that the farming subsidy payment is subject to what it calls " budget lag . "
the commission document assumes the flow of funds will speed up in 2005 and 2006 , but even then , a major part of the new members ' income will come from late payments for allocations made for 2004 .
it has already been made clear by the commission that these terms are the best the candidates can get .
the explanation for the lack of promised cash will not please any of the candidates , all of which have said they are looking for significant improvements in their finances from the first year of enlargement onward .
new members will have trouble ' making ends meet ' in fact , the european commission reckons the european union will have a difficult time helping the new members make ends meet in 2004 , with the situation only improving over the next two years .
what happens after 2006 is an open question at this point , as the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 has yet to be negotiated .
by that time , the new members hope to be full partners at the negotiating table .
until then , however , most of them will have a hard time avoiding paying more into the eu budget than they receive from it . in fact , the european commission calculates that in 2004 , only the three baltic countries will see sizeable improvements in 2003 .

22 elections . views on how to proceed split down party lines , with the red-green government , led by schröder and green foreign minister joschka fischer reiterating their position that germany would not participate in any military action against iraq and the conservative opposition showing a willingness to consider bush 's un ultimatum . schröder : bush partly correct " his -lrb- bush 's -rrb- demand that the regime in baghdad must comply with the u.n. resolutions is partly correct , " schröder told members of the german parliament , the bundestag .
" it was never debatable that weapons inspectors must return to the country .
but what remains disputable is whether another objective should be allowed to replace this objective as the focal point of the discussion . " schröder said it was a positive development that bush had pushed the issue of u.n. resolutions back to the center of the debate and praised bush for reaffirming the un 's importance .
he added germany would use all " diplomatic " and " economic " possibilities to support efforts to force saddam hussein into compliance . however , the chancellor reiterated his concern that any military action against iraq could cause the loosely-knit international coalition against terror to unravel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- joined schröder friday in defending germany 's stance .
fischer said bush 's speech did little to allay his concerns about america 's intentions in iraq .
the conditions imposed by the president , he said , " are anything but simple . " opposition attacks ' anti-american ' campaign tactics with barely a week to go until federal elections on sept .
22 , opposition politicians took advantage of the bundestag session to criticize the government 's recent foreign policy position , which has frayed relations with washington and also threatened the stability of europe 's joint defence and foreign policy . despite the willingness of other european leaders – including britain 's tony blair to france 's jacqués chirac – to consider military intervention under a u.n. mandate , schröder and fischer have steadfastly refused to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag bavarian premier edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is seeking to unseat schröder as the joint candidate for the conservative christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , accused the red-green government of " creating an anti-american atmosphere in its campaign . " stoiber warned that , with its " anti-american " position , the red-green government threatened to isolate germany from other european countries . but he said he doubted that germany 's army , the bundeswehr , would be asked to participate in any military intervention , anyway . in words that seemed to mirror warnings issued against bush lately , christian democratic union chairwoman angela merkel cautioned against germany " going its own way " on the iraq issue .
she said the government 's current position could not be maintained and accused schröder of changing his position from " unlimited solidarity " with the u.s. to " unlimited unilateralism . " eu lauds bush speech as the iraq debate raged on in germany , it reduced intensity in other parts of europe on friday .
speaking for the european union , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said bush 's speech proved that the united states was interested in pursuing a multilateralist approach .
other european ministers echoed rasmussen , saying they were pleased that bush had agreed to involve the u.n. in the final decision . british prime minister tony blair , bush 's staunchest ally in europe , greeted the speech " warmly " said a spokesperson .
blair said the united kingdom would be heavily involved in shaping the un resolution , talks on which are expected by the end of the month . bbc : british troops mobilizing the comments came amid reports the u.k. 's armed forces had already begun preparing itself for the " biggest operation in years " according to the bbc .

“ if anyone ’ s not happy that a product is on the list , they have two months to let the commission know ” , an official said . biggest transatlantic trade dispute the eu was authorised to impose sanctions worth 4.043 billion euro -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- by the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- two weeks ago . the wto approved the sanctions after the eu claimed the tax break was costing the european economy billions of dollars in lost trade . by publishing the sanctions list , the eu hopes to put maximum pressure on the us to change its offending legislation . but eu trade commissioner pascal lamy will face a delicate balancing act over the coming months over what is regarded as the biggest transatlantic trade dispute in history . " a nuclear bomb in trade relations " transatlantic trade relations are already overshadowed by the us 's threats to place protective tariffs on european imported steel . in addition , heavy eu duties on specific products made in america would harm european importers and , as a result , european customers , something that concerns the continent 's trade groups . the eu is keen to maintain the pressure but still hopes to avoid heavy sanctions – a step robert zoellick , the us trade representative , has said would be like detonating a “ nuclear bomb ” in the world trading system . it has therefore made it clear that is will not rush into sanctions , saying it would only apply sanctions if washington did not make sufficient progress in scrapping the illegal tax scheme in the coming months . hopes for us reform but so far , washington has failed to fulfill the wto ’ s demands for reform . the wto first ruled the us tax breaks as illegal in 2000 .
the original us corporate tax law allowed some of the foreign profits of american exporters to be tax exempt .
the eu declared these breaks as unfair as they favoured sales to foreign customers over domestic ones . after the first ruling , the law was rewritten by congress .
but in 2001 , the wto renewed its warning , saying the revision did not go far enough . two weeks ago , the world trade organisation finally gave the eu the right to impose sanctions on us products worth some 4 billion euro . u.s. president george w. bush has repeatedly promised reform .
but congress , under pressure from u.s. corporations , is still reluctant to give way .

the news is not good .
the hopeful states have been told that funding promised on receiving full membership is being delayed by at least two years .
on top of that , the countries are still expected to make membership payments while they wait . the european commission 's so-called ' working document ' on the calculation of net budgetary balances for new members sums up the full financial consequences of enlargement for potential new member states between 2004 and 2006 .
the possible enlargement of the european union to 30 countries is the most significant event in the history of the eu since its inception in 1957 .
spreading its borders as far as finland in the north and greece in the east , the eu hopes to become a more powerful player in international political and economic spheres .
however , the subject of enlargement has already divided europe before it has brought it together .
the payment of farming subsidies to be delayed those wanting to be part of the eu now have major financial concerns .
the european commission 's offer to give new members 25 per cent of the agricultural subsidies it gives current members is not going to happen in 2004 , as planned .
the subject is already a thorny one between eu members , many of which object to paying out farm subsidies to new members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash for crops payment to come two years later according to the commission 's working paper , the root cause of the whole funding problem is not the lack of money , but its slow movement .
the paper states that the farming subsidy payment is subject to what it calls " budget lag . "
the commission document assumes the flow of funds will speed up in 2005 and 2006 , but even then , a major part of the new members ' income will come from late payments for allocations made for 2004 .
it has already been made clear by the commission that these terms are the best the candidates can get .
the explanation for the lack of promised cash will not please any of the candidates , all of which have said they are looking for significant improvements in their finances from the first year of enlargement onward .
new members will have trouble ' making ends meet ' in fact , the european commission reckons the european union will have a difficult time helping the new members make ends meet in 2004 , with the situation only improving over the next two years .
what happens after 2006 is an open question at this point , as the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 has yet to be negotiated .
by that time , the new members hope to be full partners at the negotiating table .
until then , however , most of them will have a hard time avoiding paying more into the eu budget than they receive from it . in fact , the european commission calculates that in 2004 , only the three baltic countries will see sizeable improvements in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the safety of nuclear sites will not be compromised by funding problems lithuania , which will already benefit from the nuclear ' safety-program ' fund , latvia , and estonia expect to receive well needed money after one year of membership .
poland , by far the largest , and far from the richest , of the applicants will benefit to a lesser degree .
all the others - cyprus , malta , slovenia , hungary , the czech republic , and even slovakia - could lose out , according to the projections .
redevelopment funds are also subject to ' budget lag ' and it gets worse .
in the case of the second biggest expense for the eu after agricultural subsidies , the ' structural funds ' which are designed to finance regional economies , only 16 per cent of the 2004 allocations can be released that year in the form of advance payments .
other development funds will also be less than expected .
the allure of membership is beginning to dim in the light of the paper .
while waiting for delayed payments , the new members are expected to assume full responsibility for their own financial membership obligations .
new states will have to pay up like the rest of the club from 2004 onward , they will be making full contributions to the eu budget , which demand the same percentage of their gross national products -lrb- gnp -rrb- as the contributions made by current eu members .
the candidates are expected to contribute roughly three billion euro of the annual eu budget of 98.6 billion euro that all member states pay into .
intriguingly , some of the current net contributors to the eu budget - germany , the netherlands , austria , and sweden - have negotiated a reduction in their share of the british rebate payments .

europe 's editorialists were n't as satisfied . the european union , which has so far presented a schizophrenic stance on a possible us invasion of iraq , welcomed president george w. bush 's speech at the united nations on thursday .
the speech proved that the united states was interested in pursuing a multilateralist approach , said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , the eu representative at the speech .
other european ministers echoed rasmussen , saying they were pleased that bush had agreed to involve the united nations in the final decision .
the speech was " very hard , clear and obvious , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who attended the speech . he said the signal sent to iraq was clear and demanded bagdad let un weapons inspectors back into the country .
germany is the only one of the 15 eu member countries to categorically reject a us invasion of iraq , even with a un mandate .
in reference to his country 's position , fischer said the german government was still " deeply concerned " about the aftermath of such an invasion .
british prime minister tony blair , bush 's staunchest ally in europe , greeted the speech " warmly " said a spokesperson .
blair said great britain would be heavily involved in shaping the un resolution , talks on which are expected by the end of the month .
preparations have already begun the comments came amid reports great britain 's armed forces had already begun preparing itself for the " biggest operation in years " according to the british broadcasting corporation . british media said the army was stockpiling weapons , supplies and military craft in a harbor in the south of the country .
the united states has already moved its operational command to qatar , a half-island abbuting saudi arabia .
such preparations prove that in the " thoughts and decisions of many , the war against iraq has already begun , " wrote the french daily " le figaro " in a friday editorial .
" only appeasement by iraq or a miracle can still stop it .
should war be avoided then it would definitely not hurt the usa , and this also wo n't occur without their support . " the left-leaning danish newspaper " politiken " praised bush 's attempt at multiateralism .
" no democratic government can call bush 's demands unreasonable , " it wrote .
" they are not meant as a threat against the iraqi people .
nothing is keeping saddam hussein from doing his people a favor ...
bush did right to demand the international community show some backbone . "
great britain 's left-leaning " guardian " newspaper said bush left a major question unanswered .
" what was signally lacking from mr bush 's speech was any information showing how or why these abuses have suddenly grown more egregious or less tolerable than before , " according to the editorial . " in other words , mr bush had the chance to answer the much-asked question : why now ?
and he dodged it . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush offers un , iraq ultimatum u.s. president george w. bush made it clear in his speech before the general assembly on thursday that if the united nations doesn ’ t take joint action against iraq and saddam hussein , then the united states will .

22 elections . views on how to proceed split down party lines , with the red-green government , led by schröder and green foreign minister joschka fischer reiterating their position that germany would not participate in any military action against iraq and the conservative opposition showing a willingness to consider bush 's un ultimatum . schröder : bush partly correct " his -lrb- bush 's -rrb- demand that the regime in baghdad must comply with the u.n. resolutions is partly correct , " schröder told members of the german parliament , the bundestag .
" it was never debatable that weapons inspectors must return to the country .
but what remains disputable is whether another objective should be allowed to replace this objective as the focal point of the discussion . " schröder said it was a positive development that bush had pushed the issue of u.n. resolutions back to the center of the debate and praised bush for reaffirming the un 's importance .
he added germany would use all " diplomatic " and " economic " possibilities to support efforts to force saddam hussein into compliance . however , the chancellor reiterated his concern that any military action against iraq could cause the loosely-knit international coalition against terror to unravel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- joined schröder friday in defending germany 's stance .
fischer said bush 's speech did little to allay his concerns about america 's intentions in iraq .
the conditions imposed by the president , he said , " are anything but simple . " opposition attacks ' anti-american ' campaign tactics with barely a week to go until federal elections on sept .
22 , opposition politicians took advantage of the bundestag session to criticize the government 's recent foreign policy position , which has frayed relations with washington and also threatened the stability of europe 's joint defence and foreign policy . despite the willingness of other european leaders – including britain 's tony blair to france 's jacqués chirac – to consider military intervention under a u.n. mandate , schröder and fischer have steadfastly refused to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag bavarian premier edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is seeking to unseat schröder as the joint candidate for the conservative christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , accused the red-green government of " creating an anti-american atmosphere in its campaign . " stoiber warned that , with its " anti-american " position , the red-green government threatened to isolate germany from other european countries . but he said he doubted that germany 's army , the bundeswehr , would be asked to participate in any military intervention , anyway . in words that seemed to mirror warnings issued against bush lately , christian democratic union chairwoman angela merkel cautioned against germany " going its own way " on the iraq issue .
she said the government 's current position could not be maintained and accused schröder of changing his position from " unlimited solidarity " with the u.s. to " unlimited unilateralism . " eu lauds bush speech as the iraq debate raged on in germany , it reduced intensity in other parts of europe on friday .

the news is not good .
the hopeful states have been told that funding promised on receiving full membership is being delayed by at least two years .
on top of that , the countries are still expected to make membership payments while they wait . the european commission 's so-called ' working document ' on the calculation of net budgetary balances for new members sums up the full financial consequences of enlargement for potential new member states between 2004 and 2006 .
the possible enlargement of the european union to 30 countries is the most significant event in the history of the eu since its inception in 1957 .
spreading its borders as far as finland in the north and greece in the east , the eu hopes to become a more powerful player in international political and economic spheres .
however , the subject of enlargement has already divided europe before it has brought it together .
the payment of farming subsidies to be delayed those wanting to be part of the eu now have major financial concerns .
the european commission 's offer to give new members 25 per cent of the agricultural subsidies it gives current members is not going to happen in 2004 , as planned .
the subject is already a thorny one between eu members , many of which object to paying out farm subsidies to new members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash for crops payment to come two years later according to the commission 's working paper , the root cause of the whole funding problem is not the lack of money , but its slow movement .
the paper states that the farming subsidy payment is subject to what it calls " budget lag . "
the commission document assumes the flow of funds will speed up in 2005 and 2006 , but even then , a major part of the new members ' income will come from late payments for allocations made for 2004 .
it has already been made clear by the commission that these terms are the best the candidates can get .
the explanation for the lack of promised cash will not please any of the candidates , all of which have said they are looking for significant improvements in their finances from the first year of enlargement onward .
new members will have trouble ' making ends meet ' in fact , the european commission reckons the european union will have a difficult time helping the new members make ends meet in 2004 , with the situation only improving over the next two years .
what happens after 2006 is an open question at this point , as the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 has yet to be negotiated .
by that time , the new members hope to be full partners at the negotiating table .
until then , however , most of them will have a hard time avoiding paying more into the eu budget than they receive from it . in fact , the european commission calculates that in 2004 , only the three baltic countries will see sizeable improvements in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the safety of nuclear sites will not be compromised by funding problems lithuania , which will already benefit from the nuclear ' safety-program ' fund , latvia , and estonia expect to receive well needed money after one year of membership .
poland , by far the largest , and far from the richest , of the applicants will benefit to a lesser degree .
all the others - cyprus , malta , slovenia , hungary , the czech republic , and even slovakia - could lose out , according to the projections .
redevelopment funds are also subject to ' budget lag ' and it gets worse .
in the case of the second biggest expense for the eu after agricultural subsidies , the ' structural funds ' which are designed to finance regional economies , only 16 per cent of the 2004 allocations can be released that year in the form of advance payments .
other development funds will also be less than expected .
the allure of membership is beginning to dim in the light of the paper .
while waiting for delayed payments , the new members are expected to assume full responsibility for their own financial membership obligations .
new states will have to pay up like the rest of the club from 2004 onward , they will be making full contributions to the eu budget , which demand the same percentage of their gross national products -lrb- gnp -rrb- as the contributions made by current eu members .
the candidates are expected to contribute roughly three billion euro of the annual eu budget of 98.6 billion euro that all member states pay into .
intriguingly , some of the current net contributors to the eu budget - germany , the netherlands , austria , and sweden - have negotiated a reduction in their share of the british rebate payments .
according to commission calculations , the new members will in addition need to share the extra burden generated by these reductions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links european union enlargement the european union 's web site concerning all aspects of the proposed enlargement with a clickable map with information on candidate states .

a few days ago al-jazeera broadcast comments reportedly by bin laden the qatar-based tv station , which has previously broadcast videotaped statements by al-qaeda leader osama bin laden , showed an unclear printed statement that appeared to be in arabic .
it said it was issued on 11 september this year .
" he -lsb- omar -rsb- warned that holy struggle would continue until afghanistan is liberated and islamic teachings were re-installed , " al-jazeera said in a news bulletin .
the station told reuters news agency that the statement from mullah omar , the spiritual leader of afghanistan 's former taleban regime , appeared to be genuine , compared with previous statements .
us accused mullah omar also reportedly accuses the us of being " arrogant and simple minded " .
hijacker abdulaziz al-omari read out his will on one broadcast tape the statement says the us disregarded human rights , referring to the revolt by taleban prisoners at the qala-e-jhangi prison fort near the afghan city of mazar-e-sharif last november .
hundreds of prisoners and one american cia agent were killed in the carnage as the uprising was crushed by northern alliance forces backed by us and british special forces .
mullah omar also claims in the statement that the us had planned to attack afghanistan before the 11 september attacks .
he said the us had launched military operations in the country , before even knowing for certain who was responsible for the attacks , al-jazeera reported .
unsubstantiated sightings the broadcast comes only days after al-jazeera broadcast excerpts from a recorded statement purportedly by osama bin laden and a will of one of the 11 september hijackers , abdulaziz al-omari .
the tape features a voice reading out the names of all 19 of the hijackers involved in the 11 september attacks .
bbc correspondents say the voice is very similar to that of osama bin laden .
the whereabouts of both mullah omar and osama bin laden , accused by the us of being the masterminds behind the 11 september attacks in new york and washington , are currently unknown .
mullah omar is said to have escaped from his hideout in southern afghanistan on a motorbike with four sympathisers in january this year following us airstrikes .

"
our principles and our security are challenged today by outlaw groups and regimes that accept no law of morality and have no limit to their violent ambitions " we meet one year and one day after a terrorist attack brought grief to my country and brought grief to many citizens of our world .
yesterday we remembered the innocent lives taken that terrible morning .
today we turn to the urgent duty of protecting other lives without illusion and without fear .
we 've accomplished much in the last year in afghanistan and beyond .
we have much yet to do in afghanistan and beyond .
many nations represented here have joined in the fight against global terror and the people of the united states are grateful .
standards challenged the united nations was born in the hope that survived a world war , the hope of a world moving toward justice , escaping old patterns of conflict and fear .
the founding members resolved that the peace of the world must never again be destroyed by the will and wickedness of any man .
we created a united nations security council so that , unlike the league of nations , our deliberations would be more than talk , our resolutions would be more than wishes .
after generations of deceitful dictators and broken treaties and squandered lives , we 've dedicated ourselves to standards of human dignity shared by all and to a system of security defended by all .
today , these standards and this security are challenged .
commitment to dignity our commitment to human dignity is challenged by persistent poverty and raging disease .
the suffering is great .
and our responsibilities are clear .
the united states is joining with the world to supply aid where it reaches people and lifts up lives , to extend trade and the prosperity it brings , and to bring medical care where it is desperately needed .
as a symbol of our commitment to human dignity , the united states will return to unesco .
this organization has been reformed , and america will participate fully in its mission to advance human rights and tolerance and learning .
our common security is challenged by regional conflicts , ethnic and religious strife that is ancient , but not inevitable .
middle east settlement in the middle east there can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides . "
our greatest fear is that terrorists will find a shortcut to their mad ambitions when an outlaw regime supplies them with the technologies to kill " america stands committed to an independent and democratic palestine , living side-by-side with israel in peace and security .
like all other people , the palestinians deserve a government that serves their interests and listens to their voices .
my nation will continue to encourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the conflict .
above all , our principles and our security are challenged today by outlaw groups and regimes that accept no law of morality and have no limit to their violent ambitions .
aggressive threats in the attacks on america a year ago , we saw the destructive intentions of our enemies .
this threat hides within many nations , including my own .
in cells , in camps , terrorists are plotting further destruction and building new bases for their war against civilization .
and our greatest fear is that terrorists will find a shortcut to their mad ambitions when an outlaw regime supplies them with the technologies to kill on a massive scale .
in one place and one regime , we find all these dangers in their most lethal and aggressive forms , exactly the kind of aggressive threat the united nations was born to confront .
twelve years ago , iraq invaded kuwait without provocation .
and the regime 's forces were poised to continue their march to seize other countries and their resources .
saddam 's ' contempt ' had saddam hussein been appeased instead of stopped , he would have endangered the peace and stability of the world .
yet this aggression was stopped by the might of coalition forces and the will of the united nations .
to suspend hostilities , to spare himself , iraq 's dictator accepted a series of commitments .
the terms were clear to him and to all , and he agreed to prove he is complying with every one of those obligations .
he has proven instead only his contempt for the united nations and for all his pledges .
by breaking every pledge , by his deceptions and by his cruelties , saddam hussein has made the case against himself .
in 1991 , security council resolution 688 demanded that the iraqi regime cease at once the repression of its own people , including the systematic repression of minorities , which the council said threatened international peace and security in the region .
this demand goes ignored .
iraqi repression last year , the un commission on human rights found that iraq continues to commit extremely grave violations of human rights and that the regime 's repression is all-pervasive .
tens of thousands of political opponents and ordinary citizens have been subjected to arbitrary arrest and imprisonment , summary execution and torture by beating and burning , electric shock , starvation , mutilation and rape .
wives are tortured in front of their husbands ; children in the presence of their parents ; and all of these horrors concealed from the world by the apparatus of a totalitarian state .
in 1991 , the un security council , through resolutions 686 and 687 , demanded that iraq return all prisoners from kuwait and other lands .
iraq 's regime agreed .
it broke this promise .
last year , the secretary general 's high-level coordinator for this issue reported that kuwaiti , saudi , indian , syrian , lebanese , iranian , egyptian , bahraini and armeni nationals remain unaccounted for ; more than 600 people .
one american pilot is among them .
iraq 's broken promises in 1991 , the un security council through resolution 687 demanded that iraq renounce all involvement with terrorism and permit no terrorist organizations to operate in iraq . "
right now , iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the production of biological weapons " iraq 's regime agreed but broke this promise .
in violation of security council resolution 1373 , iraq continues to shelter and support terrorist organizations that direct violence against iran , israel and western governments .
iraqi dissidents abroad are targeted for murder .
in 1993 , iraq attempted to assassinate the emir of kuwait and a former american president .
iraq 's government openly praised the attacks of 11 september .
and al-qaeda terrorists escaped from afghanistan and are known to be in iraq .
in 1991 , the iraqi regime agreed to destroy and stop developing all weapons of mass destruction and long range missiles and to prove to the world it has done so by complying with rigorous inspections .
iraq has broken every aspect of this fundamental pledge .
iraq 's biological arsenal from 1991 to 1995 , the iraqi regime said it had no biological weapons .
after a senior official in its weapons program defected and exposed this lie , the regime admitted to producing tens of thousands of litres of anthrax and other deadly biological agents for use with scud warheads , aerial bombs and aircraft spray tanks .
un inspectors believe iraq has produced two to four times the amount of biological agents it declared and has failed to account for more than three metric tons of material that could be used to produce biological weapons .
right now , iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the production of biological weapons .
united nations ' inspections also revealed that iraq maintains stockpiles of vx , mustard and other chemical agents , and that the regime is rebuilding and expanding facilities capable of producing chemical weapons .
nuclear weapons and in 1995 , after four years of deception , iraq finally admitted it had a crash nuclear weapons programme prior to the gulf war .
we know now , were it not for that war , the regime in iraq would likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later than 1993 .
today , iraq continues to withhold important information about its nuclear program , weapons design , procurement logs , experiment data , and accounting of nuclear materials and documentation of foreign assistance .
iraq employs capable nuclear scientists and technicians .
it retains physical infrastructure needed to build a nuclear weapon .
iraq has made several attempts to buy high-strength aluminium tubes used to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon .
should iraq acquire fissile material , it would be able to build a nuclear weapon within a year .
and iraq 's state-controlled media has reported numerous meetings between saddam hussein and his nuclear scientists , leaving little doubt about his continued appetite for these weapons .
iraq also possesses a force of scud-type missiles with ranges beyond the 150 kilometres permitted by the un .
work at testing and production facilities shows that iraq is building more long range missiles that can inflict mass death throughout the region .
un inspections in 1990 , after iraq 's invasion of kuwait , the world imposed economic sanctions on iraq .
those sanctions were maintained after the war to compel the regime 's compliance with security council resolutions .
in time , iraq was allowed to use oil revenues to buy food .
saddam hussein has subverted this program , working around the sanctions to buy missile technology and military materials .
he blames the suffering of iraq 's people on the united nations , even as he uses his oil wealth to build lavish palaces for himself and to buy arms for his country .
by refusing to comply with his own agreements , he bears full guilt for the hunger and misery of innocent iraqi citizens .
in 1991 , iraq promised un inspectors immediate and unrestricted access to verify iraq 's commitment to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction and long range missiles .
iraq broke this promise , spending seven years deceiving , evading and harassing un inspectors before ceasing cooperation entirely .
' grave and gathering danger ' just months after the 1991 cease-fire , the security council twice renewed its demand that the iraqi regime cooperate fully with inspectors , condemning iraq 's serious violations of its obligations . "
the conduct of the iraqi regime is a threat to the authority of the united nations and a threat to peace " the security council again renewed that demand in 1994 , and twice more in 1996 , deploring iraq 's clear violations of its obligations .
the security council renewed its demand three more times in 1997 , citing flagrant violations , and three more times in 1998 , calling iraq 's behaviour totally unacceptable .
and in 1999 , the demand was renewed yet again .
as we meet today , it 's been almost four years since the last un inspector set foot in iraq - four years for the iraqi regime to plan and to build and to test behind the cloak of secrecy .
we know that saddam hussein pursued weapons of mass murder even when inspectors were in his country .
are we to assume that he stopped when they left ?
the history , the logic and the facts lead to one conclusion : saddam hussein regime is a grave and gathering danger .
to suggest otherwise is to hope against the evidence .
to assume this regime 's good faith is to bet the lives of millions and the peace of the world in a reckless gamble , and this is a risk we must not take .
prevention delegates to the general assembly , we have been more than patient .
we 've tried sanctions .
we 've tried the carrot of oil-for-food and the stick of coalition military strikes . "
will the united nations serve the purpose of its founding or will it be irrelevant " but saddam hussein has defied all these efforts and continues to develop weapons of mass destruction .
the first time we may be completely certain he has nuclear weapons is when , god forbid , he uses one .
we owe it to all our citizens to do everything in our power to prevent that day from coming .
the conduct of the iraqi regime is a threat to the authority of the united nations and a threat to peace .
iraq has answered a decade of un demands with a decade of defiance .
all the world now faces a test , and the united nations a difficult and defining moment .
are security council resolutions to be honoured and enforced or cast aside without consequence ?
will the united nations serve the purpose of its founding or will it be irrelevant ?
partnership of nations the united states help found the united nations .
we want the united nations to be effective and respectful and successful .
we want the resolutions of the world 's most important multilateral body to be enforced .
and right now those resolutions are being unilaterally subverted by the iraqi regime .
our partnership of nations can meet the test before us by making clear what we now expect of the iraqi regime .
if the iraqi regime wishes peace , it will immediately and unconditionally forswear , disclose and remove or destroy all weapons of mass destruction , long-range missiles and all related material .
if the iraqi regime wishes peace , it will immediately end all support for terrorism and act to suppress it - as all states are required to do by un security council resolutions .
if the iraqi regime wishes peace , it will cease persecution of its civilian population , including shia , sunnis , kurds , turkmens and others - again , as required by security council resolutions .
openness if the iraqi regime wishes peace , it will release or account for all gulf war personnel whose fate is still unknown . "
if iraq 's regime defies us again , the world must move deliberately , decisively to hold iraq to account " it will return the remains of any who are deceased , return stolen property , accept liability for losses resulting from the invasion of kuwait and fully cooperate with international efforts to resolve these issues as required by security council resolutions .
if the iraqi regime wishes peace , it will immediately end all illicit trade outside the oil-for-food program .
it will accept un administration of funds from that program to ensure that the money is used fairly and promptly for the benefit of the iraqi people .
if all these steps are taken , it will signal a new openness and accountability in iraq and it could open the prospect of the united nations helping to build a government that represents all iraqis , a government based on respect for human rights , economic liberty and internationally supervised elections .
the united states has no quarrel with the iraqi people .
they 've suffered too long in silent captivity .
liberty for the iraqi people is a great moral cause and a great strategic goal .
the people of iraq deserve it .
the security of all nations requires it .
obtaining security free societies do not intimidate through cruelty and conquest .
and open societies do not threaten the world with mass murder .
the united states supports political and economic liberty in a unified iraq .
we can harbour no illusions , and that 's important today to remember .
saddam hussein attacked iran in 1980 and kuwait in 1990 .
he 's fired ballistic missiles at iran and saudi arabia , bahrain and israel .
his regime once ordered the killing of every person between the ages of 15 and 70 in certain kurdish villages in northern iraq .
he has gassed many iranians and 40 iraqi villages .
my nation will work with the un security council to meet our common challenge .
if iraq 's regime defies us again , the world must move deliberately , decisively to hold iraq to account .
stabilising the region we will work with the un security council for the necessary resolutions . "
we must choose between a world of fear and a world of progress " but the purposes of the united states should not be doubted .
the security council resolutions will be enforced , the just demands of peace and security will be met or action will be unavoidable and a regime that has lost its legitimacy will also lose its power .
events can turn in one of two ways .
if we fail to act in the face of danger , the people of iraq will continue to live in brutal submission .
the regime will have new power to bully and dominate and conquer its neighbours , condemning the middle east to more years of bloodshed and fear .
the regime will remain unstable - the region will remain unstable , with little hope of freedom and isolated from the progress of our times .
with every step the iraqi regime takes toward gaining and deploying the most terrible weapons , our own options to confront that regime will narrow .
and if an emboldened regime were to supply these weapons to terrorists allies , then the attacks of 11 september would be a prelude to far greater horrors .
taking a stand if we meet our responsibilities , if we overcome this danger , we can arrive at a very different future .
the people of iraq can shake off their captivity .
they can one day join a democratic afghanistan and a democratic palestine inspiring reforms throughout the muslim world .
these nations can show by their example that honest government and respect for women and the great islamic tradition of learning can triumph in the middle east and beyond .
and we will show that the promise of the united nations can be fulfilled in our time .
neither of these outcomes is certain .
both have been set before us .
we must choose between a world of fear and a world of progress .
we can not stand by and do nothing while dangers gather .
we must stand up for our security and for the permanent rights and the hopes of mankind .
by heritage and by choice , the united states of america will make that stand .
and , delegates to the united nations , you have the power to make that stand , as well .
thank you very much .

our principles and our security are challenged today by outlaw groups and regimes that accept no law of morality and have no limit to their violent ambitions we meet one year and one day after a terrorist attack brought grief to my country and brought grief to many citizens of our world .
yesterday we remembered the innocent lives taken that terrible morning .
today we turn to the urgent duty of protecting other lives without illusion and without fear .
we 've accomplished much in the last year in afghanistan and beyond .
we have much yet to do in afghanistan and beyond .
many nations represented here have joined in the fight against global terror and the people of the united states are grateful .
standards challenged the united nations was born in the hope that survived a world war , the hope of a world moving toward justice , escaping old patterns of conflict and fear .
the founding members resolved that the peace of the world must never again be destroyed by the will and wickedness of any man .
we created a united nations security council so that , unlike the league of nations , our deliberations would be more than talk , our resolutions would be more than wishes .
after generations of deceitful dictators and broken treaties and squandered lives , we 've dedicated ourselves to standards of human dignity shared by all and to a system of security defended by all .
today , these standards and this security are challenged .
commitment to dignity our commitment to human dignity is challenged by persistent poverty and raging disease .
the suffering is great .
and our responsibilities are clear .
the united states is joining with the world to supply aid where it reaches people and lifts up lives , to extend trade and the prosperity it brings , and to bring medical care where it is desperately needed .
as a symbol of our commitment to human dignity , the united states will return to unesco .
this organization has been reformed , and america will participate fully in its mission to advance human rights and tolerance and learning .
our common security is challenged by regional conflicts , ethnic and religious strife that is ancient , but not inevitable .
middle east settlement in the middle east there can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides .
our greatest fear is that terrorists will find a shortcut to their mad ambitions when an outlaw regime supplies them with the technologies to kill america stands committed to an independent and democratic palestine , living side-by-side with israel in peace and security .
like all other people , the palestinians deserve a government that serves their interests and listens to their voices .
my nation will continue to encourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the conflict .
above all , our principles and our security are challenged today by outlaw groups and regimes that accept no law of morality and have no limit to their violent ambitions .
aggressive threats in the attacks on america a year ago , we saw the destructive intentions of our enemies .
this threat hides within many nations , including my own .
in cells , in camps , terrorists are plotting further destruction and building new bases for their war against civilization .
and our greatest fear is that terrorists will find a shortcut to their mad ambitions when an outlaw regime supplies them with the technologies to kill on a massive scale .
in one place and one regime , we find all these dangers in their most lethal and aggressive forms , exactly the kind of aggressive threat the united nations was born to confront .
twelve years ago , iraq invaded kuwait without provocation .
and the regime 's forces were poised to continue their march to seize other countries and their resources .
saddam 's ' contempt ' had saddam hussein been appeased instead of stopped , he would have endangered the peace and stability of the world .
yet this aggression was stopped by the might of coalition forces and the will of the united nations .
to suspend hostilities , to spare himself , iraq 's dictator accepted a series of commitments .
the terms were clear to him and to all , and he agreed to prove he is complying with every one of those obligations .
he has proven instead only his contempt for the united nations and for all his pledges .
by breaking every pledge , by his deceptions and by his cruelties , saddam hussein has made the case against himself .
in 1991 , security council resolution 688 demanded that the iraqi regime cease at once the repression of its own people , including the systematic repression of minorities , which the council said threatened international peace and security in the region .
this demand goes ignored .
iraqi repression last year , the un commission on human rights found that iraq continues to commit extremely grave violations of human rights and that the regime 's repression is all-pervasive .
tens of thousands of political opponents and ordinary citizens have been subjected to arbitrary arrest and imprisonment , summary execution and torture by beating and burning , electric shock , starvation , mutilation and rape .
wives are tortured in front of their husbands ; children in the presence of their parents ; and all of these horrors concealed from the world by the apparatus of a totalitarian state .
in 1991 , the un security council , through resolutions 686 and 687 , demanded that iraq return all prisoners from kuwait and other lands .
iraq 's regime agreed .
it broke this promise .
last year , the secretary general 's high-level coordinator for this issue reported that kuwaiti , saudi , indian , syrian , lebanese , iranian , egyptian , bahraini and armeni nationals remain unaccounted for ; more than 600 people .
one american pilot is among them .
iraq 's broken promises in 1991 , the un security council through resolution 687 demanded that iraq renounce all involvement with terrorism and permit no terrorist organizations to operate in iraq .
right now , iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the production of biological weapons iraq 's regime agreed but broke this promise .
in violation of security council resolution 1373 , iraq continues to shelter and support terrorist organizations that direct violence against iran , israel and western governments .
iraqi dissidents abroad are targeted for murder .
in 1993 , iraq attempted to assassinate the emir of kuwait and a former american president .
iraq 's government openly praised the attacks of 11 september .
and al-qaeda terrorists escaped from afghanistan and are known to be in iraq .
in 1991 , the iraqi regime agreed to destroy and stop developing all weapons of mass destruction and long range missiles and to prove to the world it has done so by complying with rigorous inspections .
iraq has broken every aspect of this fundamental pledge .
iraq 's biological arsenal from 1991 to 1995 , the iraqi regime said it had no biological weapons .
after a senior official in its weapons program defected and exposed this lie , the regime admitted to producing tens of thousands of litres of anthrax and other deadly biological agents for use with scud warheads , aerial bombs and aircraft spray tanks .
un inspectors believe iraq has produced two to four times the amount of biological agents it declared and has failed to account for more than three metric tons of material that could be used to produce biological weapons .
right now , iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the production of biological weapons .
united nations ' inspections also revealed that iraq maintains stockpiles of vx , mustard and other chemical agents , and that the regime is rebuilding and expanding facilities capable of producing chemical weapons .
nuclear weapons and in 1995 , after four years of deception , iraq finally admitted it had a crash nuclear weapons programme prior to the gulf war .
we know now , were it not for that war , the regime in iraq would likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later than 1993 .
today , iraq continues to withhold important information about its nuclear program , weapons design , procurement logs , experiment data , and accounting of nuclear materials and documentation of foreign assistance .
iraq employs capable nuclear scientists and technicians .
it retains physical infrastructure needed to build a nuclear weapon .
iraq has made several attempts to buy high-strength aluminium tubes used to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon .
should iraq acquire fissile material , it would be able to build a nuclear weapon within a year .
and iraq 's state-controlled media has reported numerous meetings between saddam hussein and his nuclear scientists , leaving little doubt about his continued appetite for these weapons .
iraq also possesses a force of scud-type missiles with ranges beyond the 150 kilometres permitted by the un .

to assume this regime 's good faith is to bet the lives of millions and the peace of the world in a reckless gamble , and this is a risk we must not take .
prevention delegates to the general assembly , we have been more than patient .
we 've tried sanctions .
we 've tried the carrot of oil-for-food and the stick of coalition military strikes .

the united states is joining with the world to supply aid where it reaches people and lifts up lives , to extend trade and the prosperity it brings , and to bring medical care where it is desperately needed .
as a symbol of our commitment to human dignity , the united states will return to unesco .
this organization has been reformed , and america will participate fully in its mission to advance human rights and tolerance and learning .
our common security is challenged by regional conflicts , ethnic and religious strife that is ancient , but not inevitable .
middle east settlement in the middle east there can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides .
our greatest fear is that terrorists will find a shortcut to their mad ambitions when an outlaw regime supplies them with the technologies to kill america stands committed to an independent and democratic palestine , living side-by-side with israel in peace and security .
like all other people , the palestinians deserve a government that serves their interests and listens to their voices .
my nation will continue to encourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the conflict .
above all , our principles and our security are challenged today by outlaw groups and regimes that accept no law of morality and have no limit to their violent ambitions .
aggressive threats in the attacks on america a year ago , we saw the destructive intentions of our enemies .
this threat hides within many nations , including my own .
in cells , in camps , terrorists are plotting further destruction and building new bases for their war against civilization .
and our greatest fear is that terrorists will find a shortcut to their mad ambitions when an outlaw regime supplies them with the technologies to kill on a massive scale .
in one place and one regime , we find all these dangers in their most lethal and aggressive forms , exactly the kind of aggressive threat the united nations was born to confront .
twelve years ago , iraq invaded kuwait without provocation .
and the regime 's forces were poised to continue their march to seize other countries and their resources .
saddam 's ' contempt ' had saddam hussein been appeased instead of stopped , he would have endangered the peace and stability of the world .
yet this aggression was stopped by the might of coalition forces and the will of the united nations .
to suspend hostilities , to spare himself , iraq 's dictator accepted a series of commitments .
the terms were clear to him and to all , and he agreed to prove he is complying with every one of those obligations .
he has proven instead only his contempt for the united nations and for all his pledges .
by breaking every pledge , by his deceptions and by his cruelties , saddam hussein has made the case against himself .
in 1991 , security council resolution 688 demanded that the iraqi regime cease at once the repression of its own people , including the systematic repression of minorities , which the council said threatened international peace and security in the region .
this demand goes ignored .
iraqi repression last year , the un commission on human rights found that iraq continues to commit extremely grave violations of human rights and that the regime 's repression is all-pervasive .
tens of thousands of political opponents and ordinary citizens have been subjected to arbitrary arrest and imprisonment , summary execution and torture by beating and burning , electric shock , starvation , mutilation and rape .
wives are tortured in front of their husbands ; children in the presence of their parents ; and all of these horrors concealed from the world by the apparatus of a totalitarian state .
in 1991 , the un security council , through resolutions 686 and 687 , demanded that iraq return all prisoners from kuwait and other lands .
iraq 's regime agreed .
it broke this promise .
last year , the secretary general 's high-level coordinator for this issue reported that kuwaiti , saudi , indian , syrian , lebanese , iranian , egyptian , bahraini and armeni nationals remain unaccounted for ; more than 600 people .
one american pilot is among them .
iraq 's broken promises in 1991 , the un security council through resolution 687 demanded that iraq renounce all involvement with terrorism and permit no terrorist organizations to operate in iraq .
right now , iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the production of biological weapons iraq 's regime agreed but broke this promise .
in violation of security council resolution 1373 , iraq continues to shelter and support terrorist organizations that direct violence against iran , israel and western governments .
iraqi dissidents abroad are targeted for murder .
in 1993 , iraq attempted to assassinate the emir of kuwait and a former american president .
iraq 's government openly praised the attacks of 11 september .
and al-qaeda terrorists escaped from afghanistan and are known to be in iraq .
in 1991 , the iraqi regime agreed to destroy and stop developing all weapons of mass destruction and long range missiles and to prove to the world it has done so by complying with rigorous inspections .
iraq has broken every aspect of this fundamental pledge .
iraq 's biological arsenal from 1991 to 1995 , the iraqi regime said it had no biological weapons .
after a senior official in its weapons program defected and exposed this lie , the regime admitted to producing tens of thousands of litres of anthrax and other deadly biological agents for use with scud warheads , aerial bombs and aircraft spray tanks .
un inspectors believe iraq has produced two to four times the amount of biological agents it declared and has failed to account for more than three metric tons of material that could be used to produce biological weapons .
right now , iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the production of biological weapons .
united nations ' inspections also revealed that iraq maintains stockpiles of vx , mustard and other chemical agents , and that the regime is rebuilding and expanding facilities capable of producing chemical weapons .
nuclear weapons and in 1995 , after four years of deception , iraq finally admitted it had a crash nuclear weapons programme prior to the gulf war .
we know now , were it not for that war , the regime in iraq would likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later than 1993 .
today , iraq continues to withhold important information about its nuclear program , weapons design , procurement logs , experiment data , and accounting of nuclear materials and documentation of foreign assistance .
iraq employs capable nuclear scientists and technicians .
it retains physical infrastructure needed to build a nuclear weapon .
iraq has made several attempts to buy high-strength aluminium tubes used to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon .
should iraq acquire fissile material , it would be able to build a nuclear weapon within a year .
and iraq 's state-controlled media has reported numerous meetings between saddam hussein and his nuclear scientists , leaving little doubt about his continued appetite for these weapons .
iraq also possesses a force of scud-type missiles with ranges beyond the 150 kilometres permitted by the un .
work at testing and production facilities shows that iraq is building more long range missiles that can inflict mass death throughout the region .
un inspections in 1990 , after iraq 's invasion of kuwait , the world imposed economic sanctions on iraq .
those sanctions were maintained after the war to compel the regime 's compliance with security council resolutions .
in time , iraq was allowed to use oil revenues to buy food .
saddam hussein has subverted this program , working around the sanctions to buy missile technology and military materials .
he blames the suffering of iraq 's people on the united nations , even as he uses his oil wealth to build lavish palaces for himself and to buy arms for his country .
by refusing to comply with his own agreements , he bears full guilt for the hunger and misery of innocent iraqi citizens .
in 1991 , iraq promised un inspectors immediate and unrestricted access to verify iraq 's commitment to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction and long range missiles .
iraq broke this promise , spending seven years deceiving , evading and harassing un inspectors before ceasing cooperation entirely .
' grave and gathering danger ' just months after the 1991 cease-fire , the security council twice renewed its demand that the iraqi regime cooperate fully with inspectors , condemning iraq 's serious violations of its obligations .
the conduct of the iraqi regime is a threat to the authority of the united nations and a threat to peace the security council again renewed that demand in 1994 , and twice more in 1996 , deploring iraq 's clear violations of its obligations .
the security council renewed its demand three more times in 1997 , citing flagrant violations , and three more times in 1998 , calling iraq 's behaviour totally unacceptable .
and in 1999 , the demand was renewed yet again .
as we meet today , it 's been almost four years since the last un inspector set foot in iraq - four years for the iraqi regime to plan and to build and to test behind the cloak of secrecy .
we know that saddam hussein pursued weapons of mass murder even when inspectors were in his country .
are we to assume that he stopped when they left ?
the history , the logic and the facts lead to one conclusion : saddam hussein regime is a grave and gathering danger .
to suggest otherwise is to hope against the evidence .
to assume this regime 's good faith is to bet the lives of millions and the peace of the world in a reckless gamble , and this is a risk we must not take .
prevention delegates to the general assembly , we have been more than patient .
we 've tried sanctions .
we 've tried the carrot of oil-for-food and the stick of coalition military strikes .
will the united nations serve the purpose of its founding or will it be irrelevant but saddam hussein has defied all these efforts and continues to develop weapons of mass destruction .
the first time we may be completely certain he has nuclear weapons is when , god forbid , he uses one .
we owe it to all our citizens to do everything in our power to prevent that day from coming .
the conduct of the iraqi regime is a threat to the authority of the united nations and a threat to peace .
iraq has answered a decade of un demands with a decade of defiance .
all the world now faces a test , and the united nations a difficult and defining moment .
are security council resolutions to be honoured and enforced or cast aside without consequence ?
will the united nations serve the purpose of its founding or will it be irrelevant ?
partnership of nations the united states help found the united nations .
we want the united nations to be effective and respectful and successful .
we want the resolutions of the world 's most important multilateral body to be enforced .
and right now those resolutions are being unilaterally subverted by the iraqi regime .
our partnership of nations can meet the test before us by making clear what we now expect of the iraqi regime .
if the iraqi regime wishes peace , it will immediately and unconditionally forswear , disclose and remove or destroy all weapons of mass destruction , long-range missiles and all related material .
if the iraqi regime wishes peace , it will immediately end all support for terrorism and act to suppress it - as all states are required to do by un security council resolutions .
if the iraqi regime wishes peace , it will cease persecution of its civilian population , including shia , sunnis , kurds , turkmens and others - again , as required by security council resolutions .
openness if the iraqi regime wishes peace , it will release or account for all gulf war personnel whose fate is still unknown .
if iraq 's regime defies us again , the world must move deliberately , decisively to hold iraq to account it will return the remains of any who are deceased , return stolen property , accept liability for losses resulting from the invasion of kuwait and fully cooperate with international efforts to resolve these issues as required by security council resolutions .
if the iraqi regime wishes peace , it will immediately end all illicit trade outside the oil-for-food program .
it will accept un administration of funds from that program to ensure that the money is used fairly and promptly for the benefit of the iraqi people .
if all these steps are taken , it will signal a new openness and accountability in iraq and it could open the prospect of the united nations helping to build a government that represents all iraqis , a government based on respect for human rights , economic liberty and internationally supervised elections .
the united states has no quarrel with the iraqi people .
they 've suffered too long in silent captivity .
liberty for the iraqi people is a great moral cause and a great strategic goal .
the people of iraq deserve it .
the security of all nations requires it .
obtaining security free societies do not intimidate through cruelty and conquest .
and open societies do not threaten the world with mass murder .
the united states supports political and economic liberty in a unified iraq .
we can harbour no illusions , and that 's important today to remember .
saddam hussein attacked iran in 1980 and kuwait in 1990 .
he 's fired ballistic missiles at iran and saudi arabia , bahrain and israel .
his regime once ordered the killing of every person between the ages of 15 and 70 in certain kurdish villages in northern iraq .
he has gassed many iranians and 40 iraqi villages .
my nation will work with the un security council to meet our common challenge .
if iraq 's regime defies us again , the world must move deliberately , decisively to hold iraq to account .
stabilising the region we will work with the un security council for the necessary resolutions .
we must choose between a world of fear and a world of progress but the purposes of the united states should not be doubted .
the security council resolutions will be enforced , the just demands of peace and security will be met or action will be unavoidable and a regime that has lost its legitimacy will also lose its power .
events can turn in one of two ways .
if we fail to act in the face of danger , the people of iraq will continue to live in brutal submission .
the regime will have new power to bully and dominate and conquer its neighbours , condemning the middle east to more years of bloodshed and fear .
the regime will remain unstable - the region will remain unstable , with little hope of freedom and isolated from the progress of our times .
with every step the iraqi regime takes toward gaining and deploying the most terrible weapons , our own options to confront that regime will narrow .
and if an emboldened regime were to supply these weapons to terrorists allies , then the attacks of 11 september would be a prelude to far greater horrors .
taking a stand if we meet our responsibilities , if we overcome this danger , we can arrive at a very different future .
the people of iraq can shake off their captivity .
they can one day join a democratic afghanistan and a democratic palestine inspiring reforms throughout the muslim world .
these nations can show by their example that honest government and respect for women and the great islamic tradition of learning can triumph in the middle east and beyond .
and we will show that the promise of the united nations can be fulfilled in our time .
neither of these outcomes is certain .
both have been set before us .
we must choose between a world of fear and a world of progress .
we can not stand by and do nothing while dangers gather .
we must stand up for our security and for the permanent rights and the hopes of mankind .
by heritage and by choice , the united states of america will make that stand .
and , delegates to the united nations , you have the power to make that stand , as well .

our principles and our security are challenged today by outlaw groups and regimes that accept no law of morality and have no limit to their violent ambitions we meet one year and one day after a terrorist attack brought grief to my country and brought grief to many citizens of our world .
yesterday we remembered the innocent lives taken that terrible morning .
today we turn to the urgent duty of protecting other lives without illusion and without fear .
we 've accomplished much in the last year in afghanistan and beyond .
we have much yet to do in afghanistan and beyond .
many nations represented here have joined in the fight against global terror and the people of the united states are grateful .
standards challenged the united nations was born in the hope that survived a world war , the hope of a world moving toward justice , escaping old patterns of conflict and fear .
the founding members resolved that the peace of the world must never again be destroyed by the will and wickedness of any man .
we created a united nations security council so that , unlike the league of nations , our deliberations would be more than talk , our resolutions would be more than wishes .
after generations of deceitful dictators and broken treaties and squandered lives , we 've dedicated ourselves to standards of human dignity shared by all and to a system of security defended by all .
today , these standards and this security are challenged .
commitment to dignity our commitment to human dignity is challenged by persistent poverty and raging disease .
the suffering is great .
and our responsibilities are clear .
the united states is joining with the world to supply aid where it reaches people and lifts up lives , to extend trade and the prosperity it brings , and to bring medical care where it is desperately needed .
as a symbol of our commitment to human dignity , the united states will return to unesco .
this organization has been reformed , and america will participate fully in its mission to advance human rights and tolerance and learning .
our common security is challenged by regional conflicts , ethnic and religious strife that is ancient , but not inevitable .
middle east settlement in the middle east there can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides .

the country 's finance minister , francisco arosemana , is heading for washington dc on friday to present a letter of intent containing the commitments which he hopes will sway the imf into granting $ 240m in new loans .
the central bank president , mauricio yepez , went on a radio station in the capital , quito , to say the imf could agree the letter of intent - and thus come closer to signing off on the loan - the same day .
but imf sources have told the reuters news agency that the government is far too confident .
no deal , they said , will be made till after the 20 october election .
holding back ecuador needs the money to prime the pump for a wholesale restructuring of its international debts , which amount to about $ 14bn .
thus far , the imf has been holding off - a sign that officials in washington feel comfortable that ecuador will escape the fate of close neighbour argentina and the battering administered to brazil 's currency and markets .
and that looks set to continue , according to reuters .
mr yepez 's contention that a deal was around the corner was " just part of the political process " with the election so imminent , the sources told the news agency .
" they have said this many times before , that they are just about to make a deal ...
it is very difficult to seal an agreement when the elections are just weeks away . "
with the exception of brazil - whose $ 30bn loan was granted earlier this year despite elections due this month - the imf generally avoids sealing new deals in the runup to elections to avoid the chance of swaying the result .
off message the imf 's caution also stems from ecuador 's breach of agreed conditions in the past .
the country has promised wholesale privatisations in line with the usual imf requirements , but in the past agreements to cap spending have not been kept .
some estimates set the funding gap in the $ 5.6m budget at as much as $ 350m .
ecuador 's economy shrank by 0.9 % in the first quarter of 2002 - the first time the country has posted negative quarterly growth since it adopted the us dollar in april 2000 .
the country had seen the strongest economic growth in latin america last year , and is expected to expand by a further 4 % in 2002 .

' positive input ' mr haass said northern ireland was in a transition which was not yet complete .
while he said the ira had made positive steps with two acts of decommissioning , he added : " at the same time there are question marks and there are problems and not limited to the ira but to loyalists as well . "
" at the end of the day there can be no place for paramilitaries in modern society . "
mr haass said he believed an auditor for the ceasefires could have a positive input to public debate and had the potential to do " more good than harm " .

it is expected the name of the auditor will be made known next week .

secretary of state john reid said : " of course the whole question of violence and law and order featured heavily . "
he said the paramilitary ceasefires were a matter for him , but there was no reason as much information as possible should be made available to the public .

a state department spokesman said washington fully supported georgia 's territorial integrity and opposed russian intentions .
the warning came after russian president vladimir putin alerted the united nations that moscow would take necessary measures to defend itself if georgia failed to deal with chechen rebels on its territory .
mr putin 's comments follow weeks of mounting tension between the two countries over the activities of pro-chechen rebels along the russian-georgian border .
the georgian president , eduard shevardnadze , called mr putin 's statement hasty and suggested talks with moscow .
help rejected in a letter to the security council , mr putin said georgia had rejected numerous offers of russian help to wipe out the rebels holed up in the pankisi gorge .
he said georgia 's own military operations had failed to achieve tangible results , and he has told his armed forces to draw up plans themselves .
observers said moscow 's message was to washington as much as to georgia .
for the past four months american troops have been stationed in georgia , helping the country 's army to tackle chechen militants - but with limited results .
but state department spokesman philip reeker said the us took " strong exception to statements by president putin threatening action against chechen targets on georgian territory " .
" we strongly support georgia 's territorial integrity and oppose any unilateral military action in georgia , " mr reeker said .
iraqi linkage the bbc 's steven kingstone says the timing of the russian warning is very delicate .
some observers believe it is moscow 's last-ditch attempt to stop washington from attacking iraq , where russia has sizeable economic interests .
as president george w bush ponders a possible pre-emptive strike against baghdad , mr putin might have been hoping for more leeway from washington , our correspondent says .
as it is , the americans will now have to work that bit harder to win russian backing for diplomatic and perhaps military action against iraq .
tension russia has been fighting an intermittent war in the rebel republic of chechnya since 1994 .
moscow has accused georgia of allowing chechen rebels to use the lawless gorge as a base for their fight against russian armed forces .
georgia says the situation in pankisi is under control after its interior ministry sent over 1,000 troops into the region to flush out the separatists .
it says russia has already carried out raids on the area , killing one person and injuring several .
moscow denies any involvement in the attacks .

observers said moscow 's message was to washington as much as to georgia .
for the past four months american troops have been stationed in georgia , helping the country 's army to tackle chechen militants - but with limited results .
but state department spokesman philip reeker said the us took " strong exception to statements by president putin threatening action against chechen targets on georgian territory " .
" we strongly support georgia 's territorial integrity and oppose any unilateral military action in georgia , " mr reeker said .
iraqi linkage the bbc 's steven kingstone says the timing of the russian warning is very delicate .
some observers believe it is moscow 's last-ditch attempt to stop washington from attacking iraq , where russia has sizeable economic interests .
as president george w bush ponders a possible pre-emptive strike against baghdad , mr putin might have been hoping for more leeway from washington , our correspondent says .
as it is , the americans will now have to work that bit harder to win russian backing for diplomatic and perhaps military action against iraq .
tension russia has been fighting an intermittent war in the rebel republic of chechnya since 1994 .
moscow has accused georgia of allowing chechen rebels to use the lawless gorge as a base for their fight against russian armed forces .
georgia says the situation in pankisi is under control after its interior ministry sent over 1,000 troops into the region to flush out the separatists .
it says russia has already carried out raids on the area , killing one person and injuring several .
moscow denies any involvement in the attacks . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's chloe arnold " russia says that georgia is turning a blind eye to the rebels " the bbc 's nikolai gorshkov " it 's more political posturing than anything else " russia analyst , oksana antonenko " clearly russia wants more action but putin 's warning is just a warning " see also : 12 sep 02 -pipe- europe putin ups georgia strike warnings 12 sep 02 -pipe- europe why russia threatens georgia over pankisi 11 sep 02 -pipe- europe putin warns of ' self-defence ' strikes 13 sep 02 -pipe- europe russian press on iraq and georgia 12 sep 02 -pipe- media reports press ups stakes on pankisi gorge 10 sep 02 -pipe- europe us army steps up georgian training 06 sep 02 -pipe- europe georgia and russia plan pankisi search 02 sep 02 -pipe- europe georgia says gorge ' under control ' 25 aug 02 -pipe- europe analysis : georgia 's stand-off with russia 05 aug 02 -pipe- europe the problem with the pankisi 13 sep 02 -pipe- europe russian military threat worries georgians internet links : russian government georgian parliament the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top europe stories now : prominent kosovo suspect held turkey ups stakes on us troops ' new europe ' backs eu on iraq omagh detectives make arrest beckham forgives ferguson blair keeps euro options open waiter jailed for underage sex democratic test for armenia links to more europe stories are at the foot of the page .

however , scientists have urged caution , as the drug has also been linked with more than a doubling in the risk of blood-clotting complications especially after surgery or long periods of immobility .
they say women who take the drug might be wise to take low-dose aspirin before long flights or major surgery to minimise the risk of blood clots .
it is vital for women at high risk of breast cancer that we establish firmly the benefits of taking tamoxifen for preventing the disease versus the potential risks sir paul nurse tamoxifen is already widely prescribed for women who have been diagnosed or treated for breast cancer , and is widely accepted as drastically reducing the rate of recurrence .
but evidence is mounting that it is also effective at preventing the disease in the first place .
professor jack cuzick from cancer research uk , who led the new study , said : " all along the line we have kept the volunteers in the trial fully informed of developments .
" that is why we felt it was right to report the preliminary findings ahead of publication . "
he said the possible side effect was explained to all women before they joined the trial and they were recommended to take a break from medication prior to certain operations .
balance of risks professor cuzick said it was important that women with breast cancer who are taking tamoxifen continue to do so because the benefits far outweighed the potential side effects .
the international breast cancer intervention study involved around 7,000 women from the uk , australia , new zealand and europe .
the women were aged between 35 and 70 years and were at an increased risk of breast cancer because they had a family history of the disease or had a benign lesion associated with an increased risk .
the study found the frequency of breast cancer was reduced by more than 30 % among women given the drug .
sir paul nurse , chief executive of cancer research uk , said : " cancer research uk will continue to fund the ibis trial to its conclusion .
" it is vital for women at high risk of breast cancer that we establish firmly the benefits of taking tamoxifen for preventing the disease versus the potential risks . "
tamoxifen works by neutralising the action of the female hormone oestrogen which stimulates breast tumour growth .

mr bonn 's resignation was accepted by the french government , france telecom 's largest shareholder , at a crisis meeting on thursday evening , a statement said .
the four-hour meeting heard that france telecom , which has a 75bn euro debt mountain , operated at a net loss of 12.2bn euros for the first half of the year .
" the large size of these losses led me to offer my resignation , " said mr bon , who has been president since 1995 .
the french government , which owns 55.5 % of the firm , said it would offer the firm capital support to prevent it falling into financial distress .
mobilcom withdrawal thursday 's meeting also backed plans to halt further funding to german mobile phone venture mobilcom .
" i suggested to the board of directors of france telecom , which agreed , to put an end to our financial support to mobilcom as well as our ambitions in mobile -lsb- phones -rsb- in germany , " mr bon said .
the decision raises doubts over the future of mobilcom , which is itself suffering a cash squeeze , and has said it would be forced to file for bankruptcy if france telecom withdrew support .
union chiefs said 5,000 jobs were under threat , and german chancellor gerhard schroeder , facing elections on 22 september , is reported to be lobbying paris to ensure the unit does not collapse .
france telecom 's first half loss included provisions of 11.1bn euro , mainly relating to mobilcom .
france telecom 's underlying earnings rose by 13.2 % to 6.9bn euros .
successor plans mr bon has been being blamed for france telecom 's disastrous recent underperformance , including a record loss in 2001 .

but it had earlier seemed that he had nonetheless secured the support of french finance minister francis mer , and with it backing from the government .
the finance ministry said that a replacement head would be appointed at a board meeting scheduled for a date within " the next few weeks " .
observers have seen thierry breton , chief executive of electronics firm thomson multimedia as a likely successor for the president 's role .
money worries a key element in france telecom 's future strategy will be securing a new form of financing .
previously , most discussion has revolved around state support , and rumours swirled earlier in the year that the company would be renationalised .
the change of government , from the previous socialists to a new free-market coalition , has made that option unlikely , and mr mer has been viewed as wary of providing money directly to the company .
instead , there is now talk of an issue of new shares , possibly as much as 15bn-euros-worth - a deal that would more than double france telecom 's market capitalisation .
if , as seems likely , the stock market proves unwelcoming to such a large offer , bonds could also be used to raise money , reports said .

the labour backbencher has suggested that proposals to give top-rated hospitals more freedom will create a two-tier health service .
mr dobson , who quit the cabinet to run for london mayor in 2000 , accused the government of trying to seize " tory territory " . "
it will create a two-tier nhs and widen the gap between the best performing hospitals and the rest " frank dobson mp his comments , made in a speech to labour party members in bristol , are the most stinging yet against his successor alan milburn .
mr milburn announced plans earlier this year to give the top-rated nhs hospitals to opt-out of government policies and to set their own financial and clinical priorities .
only those trusts which have achieved three stars in department of health league tables can apply to become what are called foundation hospitals .
the first of these are expected to come on stream next year .
two-tier service but mr dobson has hit out at the policy .
he told the bristol meeting on thursday evening the move was " a step backwards " and would not benefit patients .
" practically everyone involved in the nhs , apart from the government , fears it will create a two-tier nhs and widen the gap between the best performing hospitals and the rest , " he said .
" the hospitals most in need of improvements will be worse off .
the better hospitals would get better still .
inequality will grow . "
mr dobson said the policies smacked of " third way theorising " in a critical reference to prime minister tony blair 's political philosophy .
he added : " the object apparently is to seize the tory territory . "
policy re-think urged mr dobson urged the government to abandon its plans to create foundation hospitals .
" i hope the government will ignore the siren voices of the tories and the think tanks and listen to the people who actually to the work in the nhs .
" nobody wants to improve the nhs more than they do and they know in their bones that foundation hospitals may be a reform but wo n't be an improvement . "
speaking to the bbc on friday , mr dobson defended his speech .
" the tories introduced a system of competition - hospital against hospital - in the health service , " he said .
" it was bad for the health service .
it was politically disastrous for them and i believe that -lsb- the foundation hospital policy -rsb- is doing the self-same thing . "
ministers say foundation status will reward those trusts that are performing well and will act as an incentive to those in need of improvement .
they also believe it will enable hospitals to be more responsive to the needs of their local communities .

palestinian security officials said at least 25 armoured vehicles , supported by helicopters and bulldozers , rolled into the palestinian-ruled area near the border with egypt .
one of the helicopters fired a missile , and several metal workshops and 20 houses were badly damaged , palestinian witnesses said .
a gunman from the al-aqsa martyrs ' brigade - linked to yasser arafat 's fatah movement - was killed and six other palestinians were injured in a fierce gun battle , palestinian doctors said .
the israeli army said forces had withdrawn after arresting several suspected militants and blowing up six workshops used to manufacture rockets and mortars .
the army said the troops had been attacked with small arms , grenades and at least one rocket .
khalid abdullah , 34 , said his house had been destroyed in the operation .
" i took my five children and my wife and we spent all night in the street , " he told the associated press news agency .
the raid came the morning after a rocket was fired at an israeli village about four kilometres -lrb- two miles -rrb- from the edge of the gaza strip .
' bethlehem first ' hours earlier , about 10 israeli army tanks entered the west bank town of tulkarem , witnesses said .
the town is one of six palestinian population centres which have been under israeli military control since a spate of palestinian suicide attacks in mid-june .
under a recent deal , israel agreed to scale down their military presence in gaza and bethlehem .
in return , the palestinian security forces were to do more to rein in the militants .
israel has only withdrawn forces from bethlehem so far .
it has staged three raids on gazan towns and refugee camps this week , pointing to continued palestinian attacks on israeli army positions , settlers and villages in or near the gaza strip .
arafat 's crisis the incursions come a few days after the resignation of palestinian leader yasser arafat 's cabinet , just before the parliament was set to pass a vote of no confidence .
the palestinian leader must now present a new cabinet to parliament within two weeks .
bbc correspondent peter biles says that the palestinian leadership wants to portray the parliamentary rebuff to mr arafat as evidence of a new era of democracy for the palestinians .
but palestinian critics and israel say the resignation is a severe blow to mr arafat .
on wednesday , mr arafat set parliamentary and presidential elections for 20 january next year - the first since 1996 .
our correspondent says it is hard to see how there can be open democratic elections in just four months , given the military restrictions still imposed on palestinians .
but they add the announcement of a date for the election could be used to try to push israel to allow more freedom in palestinian areas leading up to the vote .

palestinian security officials said at least 25 armoured vehicles , supported by helicopters and bulldozers , rolled into the palestinian-ruled area near the border with egypt .
one of the helicopters fired a missile , and several metal workshops and 20 houses were badly damaged , palestinian witnesses said .
a gunman from the al-aqsa martyrs ' brigade - linked to yasser arafat 's fatah movement - was killed and six other palestinians were injured in a fierce gun battle , palestinian doctors said .
critics say military restrictions in west bank towns hamper democratic elections the israeli army said forces had withdrawn after arresting several suspected militants and blowing up six workshops used to manufacture rockets and mortars .
the army said the troops had been attacked with small arms , grenades and at least one rocket .
khalid abdullah , 34 , said his house had been destroyed in the operation .
" i took my five children and my wife and we spent all night in the street , " he told the associated press news agency .
the raid came the morning after a rocket was fired at an israeli village about four kilometres -lrb- two miles -rrb- from the edge of the gaza strip .
' bethlehem first ' hours earlier , about 10 israeli army tanks entered the west bank town of tulkarem , witnesses said .
the town is one of six palestinian population centres which have been under israeli military control since a spate of palestinian suicide attacks in mid-june .
under a recent deal , israel agreed to scale down their military presence in gaza and bethlehem .
in return , the palestinian security forces were to do more to rein in the militants .
israel has only withdrawn forces from bethlehem so far .
it has staged three raids on gazan towns and refugee camps this week , pointing to continued palestinian attacks on israeli army positions , settlers and villages in or near the gaza strip .
arafat 's crisis the incursions come a few days after the resignation of palestinian leader yasser arafat 's cabinet , just before the parliament was set to pass a vote of no confidence .

technology consultant bill thompson is pleased that unwanted e-mail is back on the political agenda , but he disagrees with the proposals to stop spam .
derek wyatt , the labour mp for sittingbourne and sheppey , is a very nice man .
i can say that with confidence having met him first about eight years ago when he was running a cable television company and seemed to have a genuine interest in what the net could offer broadcasters .
sadly , at the time , it was not very much at all , and our plans to work together did not progress .
he was elected in 1997 along with many other labour candidates who had not really expected to make it into parliament , and since then he has shown a continuing and sincere interest in computers and the internet .
as an mp he has been one of the people pushing the government to make better use of the net , and although he sometimes goes over the top , it is been good to have someone committed in the house of commons making sure the issues do not go away .
fighting porn derek 's latest campaign is one i have a lot of sympathy with .
he is fed up with the amount of pornographic e-mail that is sent to him and to the other members of his family .
wyatt : campaign against spam porn has become one of the most common forms of spam - unwanted , unsolicited commercial e-mail sent in its millions to unsuspecting net users .
and many parents are getting increasingly concerned that it is ending up in children 's mailboxes .
one e-mail filtering company , brightmail , found that one third of the spam they intercepted on one day in august was pornographic .
i will not let my daughter have a hotmail account precisely because of this .
she has a private e-mail address that has -lrb- so far -rrb- stayed off the spam lists , and a public address that actually comes to me so i can filter it for her .
click here to tell us what you would like bill to write about it is good to see mr wyatt taking up this issue , but his proposed solution does not seem very workable .
he wants to amend the communications bill to make internet service providers responsible for the content they send over their network .
this sounds appealing but ignores the practical reality that the network providers do not and should not read the content of the messages they send , just as the royal mail does not read our letters .
global spam the fact is that uk-based isps are not the source of the spam and not the people to look to for an effective solution .
enough gullible americans want to get rich quick or increase their sexual potency to make sending billions of e-mails a worthwhile business expense .
most of the spam i get seems to come from outside this country , because it is very hard to create national borders on today 's internet .
european legislation on commercial e-mail only applies to companies based in europe who are concerned with operating legally and few of the serious spammers fall into this category .
in practice the people who are sending the spam have a real interest in getting around any legal or technical restrictions because , as i have pointed out before spam appears to work .
enough gullible americans want to get rich quick , lose weight or increase their sexual potency to make sending billions of e-mails a worthwhile business expense .
at least over here we are willing to think about using the law to solve the problem .
over in the united states there is still a widespread fear of any sort of legislation .
e-mail vigilantes the sort of solutions the us favour are things like the spamcop blacklist , where any computer that is accused of sending spam is blocked from any e-mail access in future by a consortium of isps .
children could be exposed to porn e-mails this sort of vigilante justice may appeal to those raised on the myth of the us wild west but it is almost certainly illegal even under us law , breaks all the principles of natural justice and does not even seem to be working : the volume of spam is hardly decreasing , is it ?
other systems are more cooperative .
after i wrote about spam , russ thomas sent me details of a program called spamnet that works with the outlook mail program .
spamnet uses an online community that watches out for spam , so that when an unwanted e-mail appears in my inbox i can mark it as spam and let the community know .
once a certain number of notifications are received then everyone else gets sent the details of that message and it is blocked .
this works because spam is sent out to millions of people over a short period of time , and it does not give one person or system administrator the power to cancel other people 's accounts or block their internet use .
call for action there is however something that could be done at a network level .
we could establish legal liability for leaving your network open to spammers one of the key ways that spam gets into the system is through poorly configured networks .
companies allow their e-mail servers to be hijacked by the spammers .
web servers are badly managed and let spammers use their facilities to spend fake e-mail .
internet service providers do not manage their networks properly and allow spammers to pretend to be other people -lrb- this is called spoofing -rrb- .
as an alternative to derek wyatt 's approach , where isps are held liable for the content of messages , we could establish legal liability for leaving your network open to spammers .
this would mean that companies could be sued for damages by those who were deluged with unwanted email as a result of poor security .
if this were done then the incentive for every company with an internet connection to lock it down and make it safe would increase significantly .
this in turn would make it harder for spammers to hide their identity , so that isps could find them and kick them off their networks .
perhaps then the cost of sending spam would increase to the point where it simply stopped being worthwhile .
can spam ever be beaten ?
i opened a hotmail account the other day and was immediately sent some spam inviting me to a three-day free trial .
i innocently opened it not knowing what the contents would be .
i was horrified to be offered a free trial of porn involving teenagers .
the language used in the title implied serious sexual violence against young girls .
this is paedophilia and should be stopped .
it makes me very angry to think that this kind of spamming will continue because certain sick individuals are willing to pay for images of sexual abuse against teens .
jo , uk i must agree that i would love to see the removal of all spam e-mail .
i hate it !
i think though that there is very little we can do to rid ourselves of it .
much the same as junk mail comes through the post , e-mail is the best way to advertise your service .
its not just porn either .
financial services , viruses , fake diploma services , casino 's all end up in my junk folder .
all i want is a sensible filter that actually works so i can filter out the rubbish .
if you do happen to click on something and open it there seems to be very few that have a " remove me from the mailing list " option .
that should be part of all mail systems .
trouble is a decent standard of behaviour does n't exist on the internet .
until it does we will see more spam blocking up the good works of intelegent , well meaning network providers .
what a shame !
dave , kent , uk the above proposals are good as far as they go , but spammers will still find their way around .
it is very easy to set up e-mail accounts with aol and so on , under a false name .
all spammers need to do is to create an account , send out their messages and then close it .
the damage is done and no return is possible .
to comply with us law , us-based spammers add a link to a remove page , that never works , and you ca n't complain by replying to the original e-mail because the address is never found .
control needs to be exerted over the compilation of mailing lists .
how you 'd do that i really ca n't imagine .
is it possible ?
ian pearse , england i hate spam with a passion .
i get up to 40 e-mails a days and approximately 20 will be spam , the time it takes to sort them is a nuisance as well as taking up precious bandwidth while downloading them -lrb- they usually containing some graphics or animation -rrb- .
i think penalties for sending spam should be very harsh indeed .
sam , uk ca n't it be made illegal for isps to pass on an e-mail with a forged " from " address .
that would eliminate 99 % of the spam that i get .
pete b , thatcham , uk i ca n't see any reason why spamnet could n't be applied on an isp server level , with all spam messages being deleted on the server -lrb- or rejected -rrb- automatically .
nathan hobbs , luton , uk i look forward to the day when something is done to discourage those who send send out spam .
in the interim , could n't those who run web based e-mail services , such as hotmail , set up a system similar to spamnet ?
anything to reduce the spam i receive would be welcome .
ian , england i like the responsibility idea proposed here , but doubt it would work : most of the spam i receive comes from either companies in other countries -lrb- china and singapore mainly -rrb- or through valid but shortlived hotmail or yahoo mail accounts .
