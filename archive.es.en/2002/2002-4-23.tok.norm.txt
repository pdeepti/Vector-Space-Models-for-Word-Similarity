his comments contrasted with a post-budget statement last week from former bcc chief executive david lennan , who said that businesses should not have to contribute towards nhs costs because they do not use nhs services .
mr lennan was ousted from his post late last week .

bbc news -pipe- uk politics -pipe- blair : france will reject extremism high graphics -pipe- bbc sport > > front page -pipe- world -pipe- uk -pipe- uk politics -pipe- business -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- health -pipe- education -pipe- entertainment -pipe- talking point -pipe- audiovideo -pipe- uk politics contents : interviews -pipe- bbc news online : uk politics tuesday , 23 april , 2002 , 05:13 gmt 06:13 uk blair : france will reject extremism mr blair will speak to mr chirac on monday tony blair has said he trusts the people of france to " reject extremism of any kind " following the shock success of far-right politician jean-marie le pen in the first round of the country 's presidential election .
the prime minister is to speak to french leaders jacques chirac and lionel jospin by phone later on monday in the wake of the poll 's unexpected outcome . "
the politics of le pen are a menace to the european model of social justice and ethnic tolerance " robin cook he was " very sad " at the elimination from the contest of socialist prime minister mr jospin , who is now retiring from politics , describing him as " an honest and decent man " , his official spokesman said .
in the most stunning election result in european politics in years , mr le pen won enough votes to take on incumbent president jacques chirac in the run-off on 5 may .
the success of mr le pen , who virtually opposes immigration and has faced numerous allegations of racism and anti-semitism as leader of the national front , sent shockwaves through his country .
an estimated 10,000 people gathered in paris early on monday to protest .
police used tear gas to control the more violent demonstrators , who threw metal barriers and smashed restaurant windows .
mr blair 's spokesman said on monday : " it is not for us to interfere in the french election - that is for the french people alone , but we trust the french people to reject extremism of any kind . "
british parallels meanwhile labour party chairman charles clarke said : " it must be a matter of concern that extremists have got a candidate in the final round . "
but he argued that it was unlikely the result would affect the electoral success of the british national party in council elections in england next month .
" there are particular circumstances in each country which have to be taken into full account before we can draw comparisons of that type , " said mr clarke at a labour press conference in london .
however , he stressed : " we do take the threat of the bnp seriously .
we think it is a highly localised threat in the case of a small number of authorities , but in the cases where it is a threat , we are taking it extremely seriously . "
tory leader iain duncan smith said the result was a " very worrying development " .
" i am not one to dabble in french politics but i do wish mr chirac the very best of luck . "
european leaders in brussels would react " with shock and horror " to the outcome , said european commissioner neil kinnock .
the level of support expressed for the extreme right-winger " throws a great dirty rock into the european political pool " , the former british labour party leader said .
' overwhelming ' donald anderson , labour chairman of the commons foreign affairs select committee , speaking on bbc radio 4 's today programme , expressed shock and disappointment at the result , but insisted that mr chirac will win the second round on 5 may by " an overwhelming majority " .
" when we come to the legislative elections on june 16 , it is very possible that the french people , shocked at what they have done , will return the left and cohabitation will continue , " he said .
menzies campbell , the liberal democrats ' foreign affairs spokesman , said : " le pen 's success casts a shadow over france and the european union .
" if he becomes president , he would undermine the values of tolerance and respect for human rights , which lie at the heart of the union . "
later , commons leader robin cook , who is president of the party of european socialists , said the second round of voting would leave no room for people to abstain .
" the politics of le pen are a menace to the european model of social justice and ethnic tolerance , " said mr cook .
