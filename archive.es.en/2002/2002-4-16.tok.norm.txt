" good " cholesterol - or high density lipoproteins -lrb- hdl -rrb- - helps to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by transporting unhealthy fats to the liver where they are broken down .
medication may not always be the most relevant treatment for reducing risks of coronary heart disease belinda linden levels of good cholesterol were raised by 34 % among people who were given the new drug in just four weeks .
the drug also helped to cut levels of " bad " cholesterol in some patients .
" bad " cholesterol - low density lipoproteins -lrb- ldl -rrb- - contribute to furring of the arteries .
it can be effectively controlled by the use of statin drugs .
the new drug , called a cetp inhibitor , works by blocking the action of a protein which lowers levels of " good " cholesterol in the body .
asian people tend to have a high level of " good " cholesterol because they carry a defective version of this protein .
researcher dr john kastelein , from the academic medical center in amsterdam , the netherlands , said the only side effect of the drug was some mild stomach problems .
he said : " although these results hold promise , further studies are needed to investigate whether the increase in hdl cholesterol translates into a reduction in coronary artery disease risk . "
dr kastelein told bbc news online that a 30 % increase in " good " cholesterol could cut the risk of cardiovascular disease by as much as 40 % .
he predicted that a drug could be widely available in five years .
nice in theory belinda linden , head of medical information at the british heart foundation , told bbc news online that a drug that raised " good " cholesterol and lowering " bad " cholesterol should theoretically reduce the risk of coronary heart disease .
however , she echoed the researchers ' caution , and said the benefits could only be fully ascertained by further research .
she said : " medication may not always be the most relevant treatment for reducing risks of coronary heart disease .
" people can lower ldl cholesterol and maintain or improve hdl levels by reducing their saturated fat intake and doing brisk physical activity . "
the research is published in circulation : journal of the american heart association .
