a doctor from southampton general hospital has been studying the phenomenon and this morning , breakfast spoke to him and one of his patients , who had a near death experience .
" i was walking down a tunnel , " explained patrick tierney , who nearly died when he had a heart attack 11 years ago .
" at the end , there was a dark hole on the left and a bright light on the right .
" naturally , i went towards the bright light .
i remember a picket fence and colours that i have never seen before in my life ... it could have been a garden - i 'm not sure . "
during his experience , patrick saw his parents , who 'd recently died - and his mother in law .
" i wanted to go up to them and give them a hug but my father gave me a look which said ' no ' - so i came back here instead . "
according to dr sam parnia , patrick 's experiences are not uncommon .
" these seem to occur in around 10 per cent of patients , " he told breakfast .
what makes near death experiences so interesting is that they occur when the brain has been so starved of oxygen that it should not be functioning at all .
dr parnia has been studying all aspects of near death experience .
so far , he 's found no connection between the phenomenon and any drugs or oxygen used for resuscitation , or the levels of carbon dioxide in the body .
patrick regards the experience as a rehearsal for the real thing .
" i am a roman catholic , " he says . " i believe in heaven and hell .
this was a dry run . "

on the first day of term , i was at a london secondary school .
two year groups had been told to stay at home .
why ?
because seven of the school 's 36 teachers had still not been fully vetted by the criminal records bureau .
no joke i met one of the teachers .
she was having to work in isolation in the science staffroom .
outside one wag had stuck up a notice warning : " beware dangerous teachers " .
but it was n't really very funny .
by the rules , she was not allowed to be in a classroom , even under supervision .
oddly enough , my television crew and i -lrb- three men in a girls ' school -rrb- were allowed greater freedom .
no discretion she was an experienced teacher who , until july , had been working at an independent school .
although there had been no break in her career she needed full vetting for her new job because her previous school had not gone through the full procedures .
the school 's head teacher was quite willing to use her discretion , relying on references and other information , to permit her new teachers to start work .
but she was not allowed to .
the girls stayed at home , the teachers tried to keep busy with lesson planning .
avoidable was all the disruption that schools throughout england and wales faced this week really necessary ?
and who is to blame ?
the answer to the first question is easy : no , the disruption was avoidable .
the answer to the second requires the judgement of solomon .
the reason it was avoidable was that almost as soon as the criminal records bureau took over the new system of vetting back in march it became clear that the scale of the task had been vastly under-estimated .
there was also the unanticipated problem that most applicants preferred to apply in writing rather than by telephone .
this meant errors took much longer to rectify .
whatever the causes , the backlog was substantial by may .
rules changed that was when the department for education and skills wrote to the home office -lrb- which is responsible for the criminal records bureau -rrb- to express its concern . "
although it lacked clarity , this compromise position was sensible " the education secretary , estelle morris , saw her former boss , david blunkett , now the home secretary , to discuss it .
as it became clear the backlog would not be cleared quickly , the government - in guidance which had the clarity of mud - left head teachers and supply agencies with the impression that , while these problems were sorted out , teachers could begin in the classroom without the final police records check .
although it lacked clarity , this compromise position was sensible and , if ministers had held their nerve , it would have avoided the disruption that marked the start of term .
and then ...
the compromise position still required all the checks that had been in place before march .
teachers still had to be checked against the government 's list 99 , which contains names of those considered unsuitable to work with children .
schools also had to take up references and testimonials .
they also had to check with local police records , although teachers could begin work before these check -lrb- which could take months -rrb- were completed .

on the first day of term , i was at a london secondary school .
two year groups had been told to stay at home .
why ?
because seven of the school 's 36 teachers had still not been fully vetted by the criminal records bureau .
no joke i met one of the teachers .
she was having to work in isolation in the science staffroom .
outside one wag had stuck up a notice warning : " beware dangerous teachers " .
but it was n't really very funny .
by the rules , she was not allowed to be in a classroom , even under supervision .
oddly enough , my television crew and i -lrb- three men in a girls ' school -rrb- were allowed greater freedom .
no discretion she was an experienced teacher who , until july , had been working at an independent school .
although there had been no break in her career she needed full vetting for her new job because her previous school had not gone through the full procedures .
the school 's head teacher was quite willing to use her discretion , relying on references and other information , to permit her new teachers to start work .
but she was not allowed to .
the girls stayed at home , the teachers tried to keep busy with lesson planning .
avoidable was all the disruption that schools throughout england and wales faced this week really necessary ?
and who is to blame ?
the answer to the first question is easy : no , the disruption was avoidable .
the answer to the second requires the judgement of solomon .
the reason it was avoidable was that almost as soon as the criminal records bureau took over the new system of vetting back in march it became clear that the scale of the task had been vastly under-estimated .
there was also the unanticipated problem that most applicants preferred to apply in writing rather than by telephone .
this meant errors took much longer to rectify .
whatever the causes , the backlog was substantial by may .
rules changed that was when the department for education and skills wrote to the home office -lrb- which is responsible for the criminal records bureau -rrb- to express its concern .
although it lacked clarity , this compromise position was sensible the education secretary , estelle morris , saw her former boss , david blunkett , now the home secretary , to discuss it .
as it became clear the backlog would not be cleared quickly , the government - in guidance which had the clarity of mud - left head teachers and supply agencies with the impression that , while these problems were sorted out , teachers could begin in the classroom without the final police records check .
although it lacked clarity , this compromise position was sensible and , if ministers had held their nerve , it would have avoided the disruption that marked the start of term .
and then ...
the compromise position still required all the checks that had been in place before march .
teachers still had to be checked against the government 's list 99 , which contains names of those considered unsuitable to work with children .
schools also had to take up references and testimonials .
they also had to check with local police records , although teachers could begin work before these check -lrb- which could take months -rrb- were completed .
but then came the terrible events in soham .
the media and the public went into a panic reaction about child safety .
the government - ever watchful of the public - tightened up its guidance .
rules changed again now only teachers who had been through the full , enhanced checks could teach .
the final , red warning signs were there in short , a list 99 check , references and checks with previous schools or training colleges were no longer enough .
all police files had to be checked by the bureau .
