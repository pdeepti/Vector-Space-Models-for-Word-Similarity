for the first time ever , football-crazed germany can only watch all the world cup games on pay tv .
not only that : the matches take place at times not quite conducive to watching television . it 's 8:30 in the morning in germany .
time for a cup of coffee and the first match of the day .
the world cup this time around has certainly had an impact on viewing habits .
for one , the competition has never taken place in asia before .
germans were used to nightly games from the united states , latin or south america .
the evening 's leisure activities were taken care of : football , beer and ball magic .
this time , the three kick-offs – at 8:30 , 11:30 and 13:30 german time – find people either at breakfast , work , or – if they 're really lucky – in their lunch break .
also , in the past , all of society could take part in cheering their team on .
everyone watched all the games on the public television broadcasters ard and zdf .
no one was excluded .
paying the price this time , however , fans are forced to pay a high price to see the matches .
the football federation fifa sold the world cup television transmission rights to german-based kirchmedia for 850 million euro .
although the company has in the meantime declared bankruptcy , its financially-strapped pay tv division , premiere , shows all of the games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pay tv station premiere premiere says it has registered a leap in new subscribers since shortly before the world cup began .

the company says it reaches up to three million viewers daily with images from japan and south korea .
" the world cup has most definitely had a positive impact on premiere , " a spokesman told dw-world .
he added that it does n't have to worry about a crash after the final goal is scored .
" all of our new customers have signed contracts for 12 or 24 months . "
but analysts estimate premiere 's losses at around 3.2 billion euro .
and an annual subscription to premiere starts at 60 euro a year .
so these new subscribers just are n't enough , says dr. uwe hasebrink , director of the hans bredow institute for media research at the university of hamburg .
" they would need millions of new subscribers to alleviate their debts and those 2 500 a day are not going to make the difference , " he told dw-world .

in a controversial deal last year , public television broadcasters ard and zdf paid kirchmedia 115 million euro to show 24 of the 64 world cup games .

over half of germans are unhappy about the fact that they can only see some of the games on free tv .
in a poll taken by television guide tv today , 34 percent said the evening summaries were not adequate .
especially men wanted to be able to follow more games live : 63 percent compared to 48 percent of women .

for the first time ever , football-crazed germany can only watch all the world cup games on pay tv .
not only that : the matches take place at times not quite conducive to watching television . it 's 8:30 in the morning in germany .
time for a cup of coffee and the first match of the day .
the world cup this time around has certainly had an impact on viewing habits .
for one , the competition has never taken place in asia before .
germans were used to nightly games from the united states , latin or south america .
the evening 's leisure activities were taken care of : football , beer and ball magic .
this time , the three kick-offs – at 8:30 , 11:30 and 13:30 german time – find people either at breakfast , work , or – if they 're really lucky – in their lunch break .
also , in the past , all of society could take part in cheering their team on .
everyone watched all the games on the public television broadcasters ard and zdf .
no one was excluded .
paying the price this time , however , fans are forced to pay a high price to see the matches .
the football federation fifa sold the world cup television transmission rights to german-based kirchmedia for 850 million euro .
although the company has in the meantime declared bankruptcy , its financially-strapped pay tv division , premiere , shows all of the games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pay tv station premiere premiere says it has registered a leap in new subscribers since shortly before the world cup began .
on average , the broadcaster has won 2 500 new customers per day .
the company says it reaches up to three million viewers daily with images from japan and south korea .
" the world cup has most definitely had a positive impact on premiere , " a spokesman told dw-world .
he added that it does n't have to worry about a crash after the final goal is scored .
" all of our new customers have signed contracts for 12 or 24 months . "
but analysts estimate premiere 's losses at around 3.2 billion euro .
and an annual subscription to premiere starts at 60 euro a year .
so these new subscribers just are n't enough , says dr. uwe hasebrink , director of the hans bredow institute for media research at the university of hamburg .
" they would need millions of new subscribers to alleviate their debts and those 2 500 a day are not going to make the difference , " he told dw-world .
we want more !
in a controversial deal last year , public television broadcasters ard and zdf paid kirchmedia 115 million euro to show 24 of the 64 world cup games .
only the private station sat1 can show brief summaries , an honor it paid kirchmedia 10 million euro for .
over half of germans are unhappy about the fact that they can only see some of the games on free tv .
in a poll taken by television guide tv today , 34 percent said the evening summaries were not adequate .
especially men wanted to be able to follow more games live : 63 percent compared to 48 percent of women .

the evening 's leisure activities were taken care of : football , beer and ball magic .
this time , the three kick-offs – at 8:30 , 11:30 and 13:30 german time – find people either at breakfast , work , or – if they 're really lucky – in their lunch break .

for the first time ever , football-crazed germany can only watch all the world cup games on pay tv .
not only that : the matches take place at times not quite conducive to watching television . it 's 8:30 in the morning in germany .
time for a cup of coffee and the first match of the day .
the world cup this time around has certainly had an impact on viewing habits .
for one , the competition has never taken place in asia before .
germans were used to nightly games from the united states , latin or south america .
the evening 's leisure activities were taken care of : football , beer and ball magic .
this time , the three kick-offs – at 8:30 , 11:30 and 13:30 german time – find people either at breakfast , work , or – if they 're really lucky – in their lunch break .
also , in the past , all of society could take part in cheering their team on .
everyone watched all the games on the public television broadcasters ard and zdf .
no one was excluded .
paying the price this time , however , fans are forced to pay a high price to see the matches .
the football federation fifa sold the world cup television transmission rights to german-based kirchmedia for 850 million euro .
although the company has in the meantime declared bankruptcy , its financially-strapped pay tv division , premiere , shows all of the games .

he added that it does n't have to worry about a crash after the final goal is scored .
" all of our new customers have signed contracts for 12 or 24 months . "
but analysts estimate premiere 's losses at around 3.2 billion euro .
and an annual subscription to premiere starts at 60 euro a year .
so these new subscribers just are n't enough , says dr. uwe hasebrink , director of the hans bredow institute for media research at the university of hamburg .
" they would need millions of new subscribers to alleviate their debts and those 2 500 a day are not going to make the difference , " he told dw-world .

in a controversial deal last year , public television broadcasters ard and zdf paid kirchmedia 115 million euro to show 24 of the 64 world cup games .
only the private station sat1 can show brief summaries , an honor it paid kirchmedia 10 million euro for .
over half of germans are unhappy about the fact that they can only see some of the games on free tv .
in a poll taken by television guide tv today , 34 percent said the evening summaries were not adequate .
especially men wanted to be able to follow more games live : 63 percent compared to 48 percent of women .

bae was reported over the weekend to be considering a takeover offer for trw , a move which could spark a bidding war with rival us defence firm nortrhop grumman .
trw shareholders are already weighing up a bid worth $ 6.7bn -lrb- £ 4.6bn -rrb- from northrop grumman , with a decision due by friday .
bae said on monday that trw 's decision to put itself up for sale " may offer an opportunity to extend further bae systems defence activities in north america . "
" the company has therefore established a dialogue with trw , " it added .
security concerns according to media reports , bae is currently scrutinising trw 's accounts , and is likely to make a formal takeover offer this week .
bae was also reported to have held talks with the pentagon in order to gauge whether or not the us authorities would object to the takeover on national security grounds .
while washington has traditionally resisted foreign takeovers of us defence firms , it is thought that officials may make an exception in the case bae systems , which already has extensive operations in the us .
bae 's us division , one of ten major suppliers of defence equipment to the us military , has annual sales of $ 3.7bn , and employs 22,000 people .
a successful takeover of trw would boost bae 's position in the us market for defence-based electronics and information systems .
bae has already made substantial acquisitions in the us , buying up lockheed martin control systems and lockheed martin 's aerospace electronics division two years ago .
shareholders ' decision trw has been up for sale since receiving a hostile takeover bid from northrop grumman earlier this year .
if trw shareholders reject the takeover offers currently on the table , the company is thought likely to pursue an alternative strategy of breaking itself up .
trw has already asked regulators for clearance to float its car parts division on the new york stock exchange .

the independent television commission -lrb- itc -rrb- received 19 complaints after a quip during the bafta tv awards in april .
tarrant had said there was a new reality tv series in which the 12 contestants were scousers , and viewers would tune in to see who stole the video first .
the itc dismissed the complaints , saying it was a variation on an old joke and not meant to damage the reputation of merseyside .
' not unkind ' tarrant , also host of who wants to be a millionaire ? , was booed by some people at the awards ceremony , which he hosted .
he was reported to have phoned a merseyside radio station to apologise afterwards .
the sunday mirror newspaper reported that tarrant said : " of course the joke was n't intended to be unkind about liverpool .
" i have had some of the best nights of my life there and my little boy is a number one liverpool football fan . "
but his comments were described as " outrageous stereotyping " .

the itc has also rejected a string of complaints about a green party election broadcast .
the slot featured images of a frog being boiled and a drowning baby , prompting complaints about bad taste .
but the itc said the images - which were simulated - were powerful but not gratuitous and designed to represent issues of concern to the party .
it decided that the broadcast did not breach any guidelines .

we are seeing an eight-month long film festival , selfridges 's bollywood makeover , andrew lloyd webber 's musical and channel 4 's season of bollywood programming dubbed the indian summer .
none of this would have been possible without the whole-hearted support of hindi film industry .
" bollywood has finally realised how important hype is for success , " says taran adarsh , editor of indian film journal trade guide .
hrithik roshan starred in both yaadein and kabhi khushi kabhie gham " look at spiderman - hyping it six months before the release made it open to high box office takings even in asia . "
behind this willingness to promote itself far and wide , lies the grim story of an industry undergoing its worst ever financial crisis .
" bollywood is in deep financial trouble as a string of films have bombed at the box-office - many of them big budget and high profile , " says adarsh .
" most producers have not been able to even recover the basic costs . "
in such a situation , bollywood stars and producers have had to come down from their ivory towers and market themselves and their films , aggressively - both in india and overseas .
indeed , since the early 90s , the overseas market has been a sort of buffer zone .
many films that flopped in india were big success stories in the uk .
like subhash ghai 's taal and yaadein , which failed miserably on home turf but were well received here .
the overseas market is hugely important because of the low valuation of the rupee dr rachel dwyer in fact , the overseas market has become so important that many indian films feature expatriate families and are shot in various european locations .
ninety per cent of last year 's hit kabhi khushi kabhie gham was filmed in london .
dr rachel dwyer has written several books and teaches south asian cinema in london .
she says : " the overseas market is hugely important because of the low valuation of the rupee .
" a cinema ticket at an upmarket cinema in an indian metropolis is unlikely to cost more than £ 2 .
top producers have charged £ 15 in the uk . "
the hindi film industry is the most prolific in the world producing over 800 films each year - compared with hollywood 's 100 .
underworld funding but despite an annual turnover of around £ 500m , bollywood has always had cash-flow problems .
it did not have an industry status until very recently , which meant that banks and other financial institutions would not finance films .

we are seeing an eight-month long film festival , selfridges 's bollywood makeover , andrew lloyd webber 's musical and channel 4 's season of bollywood programming dubbed the indian summer .
none of this would have been possible without the whole-hearted support of hindi film industry .
" bollywood has finally realised how important hype is for success , " says taran adarsh , editor of indian film journal trade guide .
" look at spiderman - hyping it six months before the release made it open to high box office takings even in asia . "
behind this willingness to promote itself far and wide , lies the grim story of an industry undergoing its worst ever financial crisis .
" bollywood is in deep financial trouble as a string of films have bombed at the box-office - many of them big budget and high profile , " says adarsh .
" most producers have not been able to even recover the basic costs . "
in such a situation , bollywood stars and producers have had to come down from their ivory towers and market themselves and their films , aggressively - both in india and overseas .
indeed , since the early 90s , the overseas market has been a sort of buffer zone .
many films that flopped in india were big success stories in the uk .
like subhash ghai 's taal and yaadein , which failed miserably on home turf but were well received here . "
the overseas market is hugely important because of the low valuation of the rupee " dr rachel dwyer in fact , the overseas market has become so important that many indian films feature expatriate families and are shot in various european locations .
ninety per cent of last year 's hit kabhi khushi kabhie gham was filmed in london .
dr rachel dwyer has written several books and teaches south asian cinema in london .
she says : " the overseas market is hugely important because of the low valuation of the rupee .
" a cinema ticket at an upmarket cinema in an indian metropolis is unlikely to cost more than £ 2 .
top producers have charged £ 15 in the uk . "
the hindi film industry is the most prolific in the world producing over 800 films each year - compared with hollywood 's 100 .
underworld funding but despite an annual turnover of around £ 500m , bollywood has always had cash-flow problems .
it did not have an industry status until very recently , which meant that banks and other financial institutions would not finance films .
part of the problem can be traced to the breakdown of the studio system of the 1950s and 60s , where everyone from actors to technicians was paid a monthly salary .

david morris , 40 , from craig cefn parc denies battering to death mandy power , her two daughters and her elderly mother at their clydach home three years ago .
his trial at swansea crown court is now entering its ninth week and the prosecution has put its case to the jury .
on friday , a forensic scientist told jurors a bloody handprint found at the murder scene was an " excellent " match with that of mr morris , who denies the murders .
the crime on 27 june , 1999 , shocked the swansea valley community .
divorcee mrs power , 34 , was beaten to death with an iron bar along with her two daughters katie , 10 , and emily , eight , and her invalid mother doris dawson , 80 , the court has heard .
murder ' massacre ' mrs dawson was killed in her bed and her body set on fire , while the remaining three victims were probably killed as witnesses ; their skulls were crushed , the prosecution claimed .
the scene was described as that of a " massacre " and an " orgy of savagery " by the prosecution .
they claim scrap metal dealer mr morris carried out the savage attack at the kelvin road house after mrs power refused his sexual advances .
her former lover and ex-police officer alison lewis , from pontardawe , was a suspect earlier in the investigation but she was never charged .
it was said the pair were in a relationship at the time of the murder .
victim 's relations but a fireman who was familiar with the defendant told the court mr morris and mrs power were seeing each other until that time .
the court has heard mrs power became " promiscuous " and a " sexual adventurer " , indulging in lesbian relationships following the break-up of her marriage .
father-of-two mr morris told police he had a sexual relationship with the victim in the weeks before her death .
the prosecution has claimed ms morris had a tendency for violence and was " forensically aware " so that he planted false leads and started a fire which almost destroyed evidence .
a key piece of that evidence is a gold chain found at the murder scene .
the defendant initially denied to police the item was his but before the trial , admitted it probably was .
the prosecution has accused him of lying .

ruth christoffersen , from newport , is flying to the european parliament to call for action - the first time she has used an airplane since her daughter emma , 28 , died two years ago .
dvt victim emma christoffersen mrs christoffersen is a leading member of a pressure group seeking to persuade air operators to conduct research into dvt and to improve conditions for passengers in the meantime .
last month , the world health organisation agreed to a £ 1.2m study into the condition , which has repeatedly been linked to air travel , but without clear scientific proof .
but in a boost to the campaign , sven goran erikson 's england team were persuaded to take precautionary measures before their flight to the far east for the world cup finals .
the death of emma christoffersen in october 2000 - just hours after arriving at heathrow from australia - led to widespread publicity over other fatal dvt cases .
now mrs christoffersen wants passengers to be given proper information while research is carried out , giving them the right to make an informed choice about flying .
she will meet on tuesday with labour mep arlene mccarthy and representatives from the aviation health institute to help press their case at the european parliament in strasbourg .
" i am getting on a plane to take emma 's case forward and i never thought i would do it , " she said .
" i am flying from heathrow and i know i will do it because emma died . "
medical history dvt campaigner john smith , who chairs an all-party parliamentary group set up to investigate the causes of the condition , said he was pleased progress was being made .
the research programme will aim to identify which travellers are most at risk from dvt , which has been dubbed ' economy class syndrome ' .
factors such as past history of thrombosis , use of oral contraceptives and genetic links are among the areas to be studied .
the study will also look at the effects of alcohol consumption , leg exercises and compression stockings , as well as low cabin pressure and oxygen levels on flights .
doctors believe cramped conditions are a factor the research also intends to offer guidance to travellers .
the european commission is expected to provide additional funding , with preliminary results available within a year .
more than 40 long haul airline passengers are known to have died from dvt clots .
among them are ms christoffersen , susan mavir-ross , from llay in wrexham , thomas lamb , from cardiff , and policeman john thomas from cowbridge , south wales .
medical research has shown that clots develop in blood vessels deep in the legs when circulation slows .

there is a carnival atmosphere outside the stadium the interest in the match against the united states in daegu has forced many employers to give their workers the afternoon off .
there is also concern that the game could incite anti-american protests , if the south koreans fail to repeat the success of their first game against poland .
president kim dae-jung has cancelled his scheduled visit to the game for security reasons .
' orderly ' cheers the newspapers in south korea are printing little else apart from football .
kim dae-jung is staying away from the game some fans will have queued for two days at the stadium in daegu to try and buy tickets throughout the country factories and offices were expected to come to a stop to watch the game .
interest in football has risen to fanatical levels after south korea 's first victory at a world cup in five attempts against poland last tuesday .
but there is increasing concern that the patriotism may get out of hand for the game against the united states .
at his meeting with a group of fans called the red devils ahead of the game , president kim dae-jung urged that the cheers for the home side should be " wholesome and orderly " .
he emphasized that the match should not be politically exploited and that supporters should avoid displays of anti-american sentiment .
demonstrators used footballs to target the us embassy in seoul but some civic and student activists plan to do exactly that , by staging anti-american rallies .
police were planning to deploy around 6,000 officers in the area of the united states embassy in seoul .
with one of the most popular giant screens only 300 metres away , there are fears that if south korea loses there could be demonstrations .

more than 1,000 pupils from eight schools in wrexham will board the vehicles - imported from the united states - on their first official school run .
the scheme is the first of its kind in wales and was introduced after concerns were raised over the standard of service provided .
built across the atlantic , the blue bird buses have already been introduced for pupils in west yorkshire , staffordshire and surrey .
students at the further education yale college in wrexham are also getting on board in what is said to be the uk 's biggest roll-out of the vehicles to date .
the town 's local authority has contracted train and bus operator first to run the scheme .
but welsh safety campaigners say the vehicles lack a number of vital features and are not as safe as the company claims .
safety complaint pat harris , founder of the belt up school kids -lrb- busk -rrb- group , complained : " the safety of these yellow buses has been compromised to save money .
" parents should ask their transport provider how 60 children are going to get out of this yellow bus if it does roll onto its side .
" the windows in the yellow bus do not meet the legal requirements of an emergency exit in the uk . "
wrexham buses ysgol bryn offa bryn alyn the groves darland school ysgol castell alun maelor school ysgol morgan llwyd but first - a leading transport provider in the uk with 23 % market share and a major player in the us - insists the new door-to-school system will improve child safety .
the company claims the " yellow bus is a symbol of safety and security " .
' safest form ' company chief executive moir lockhead said spoke of " clearly identifiable benefits to home-to-school transport " offered by her new fleet and hinted at further announcements to come .
the firm said education and transport ministers had given first the green light for its vehicles .
its website claims : " safety is of paramount importance in everything we do .
" we believe that the yellow school bus offers the safest , most reliable way to transport children to and from school . "
under the new system , drivers of the buses will be in telephone contact with a control room in wrexham .
parents will be able to contact the control room and check whether or not their child will be travelling on the bus .
war-time origin first have said the concept means the school day begins from the moment the student boards the bus , and ends when the student leaves the bus upon arrival home .
in a report in 2000 , the us school bus information council claimed children using a yellow bus were 87 times safer than those who were driven by parents , walked or used a bicycle .

a remix version of the song is released on monday and has built up strong appeal thanks to its use on an advert and in a recent movie .
the beatles have matched presley 's record for 25 years but the dutch dj who helped create the new presley single has been forced to change his name to satisfy the king 's estate .
dutch remixer tom holkenborg has dropped his normal alias , junkie xl , to become just jxl because elvis 's relatives were unhappy about the reference to drugs .
whatever the label credits , the new record is seen as likely to give elvis a new number one and change chart history .
for decades elvis and the beatles have tied on 17 uk number ones each - but this could now change .
if the king does get to number one then he will be back in the guiness book of records as the artist with the most number ones .

elvis rose to fame in 1956 the estate , which protects and promotes elvis ' image and music surprised many by giving the all-clear for the song to be remixed .
