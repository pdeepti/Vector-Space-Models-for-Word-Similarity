unseasonably heavy rains have wreaked havoc across much of europe this summer , ruining many people 's holiday plans .
but europe 's farmers have also been caught in the downpour , and are facing a disastrous harvest . the bad weather hitting europe has taken a toll not only on the businesses that profit from tourism , but also on farmers - especially those in germany and italy .
farmers in northeastern italy are bracing for more rains after the worst hailstorm in recent memory ravaged wine grapes , tobacco crops and olive groves .
meanwhile , their counterparts around rome have lost their entire crop of peaches .
german farmers are also left facing fields under water and a wet harvest .
according to the german farmers ' association dbv , though , it 's still too early to estimate the extent of the damage .
" we can only say that when we see what could be harvested after all and what crops could be sold , " a dbv spokesman told dw-world .
higher costs the storms have particularly hit grain farms in the southern state of bavaria .
but lower saxony , schleswig-holstein and mecklenburg-western pomerania have also taken losses , mainly in fruit - such as apple orchards - and vegetables .
wolfgang arens of the farmers ' association of lower saxony estimates the damage for that region alone to total more than 100 million euro -lrb- $ 97.7 million -rrb- .
farmers faced higher costs for cleaning and drying those grains they could harvest , arens told reporters .
" as it is , 30 percent of our wheat intended for the bread market can only be sold as animal feed now . "
his counterpart in mecklenburg-western pomerania , torsten weidmann , reports that many farmers ca n't even set foot onto their fields .
" at the beginning of august , we saw more rain in one day than we did in an entire month on average , " he says .
weidmann expects the state 's grain farmers to post 20 to 30 percent less proceeds than in the previous year .
not " an existential threat " " it is certainly a severe burden for farmers in the affected regions , " the dbv spokesman said .
but , he added , it did not involve " an existential threat " .
very few farms based their output solely on grains , but also diversified with livestock or vegetables , for example .
" of course , it 's a burden when they ca n't harvest their fields , but hardly any farmer will go bankrupt because of it , " he said .
often , stocks from previous years when there was a good harvest have been put aside to compensate for such a situation .
the spokesman pointed out that farmers do not just plan on an annual basis .
" they know how dependent their livelihood is on the weather and calculate this risk . "
for this reason , most german farms offer mixed agriculture and livestock , so they can generally cope with a situation such as this year 's summer storms , he added .
no need to overreact the association spokesman admitted that there were individual cases in austria and bavaria , where farmers faced a 100 percent loss .
" if their field is under water , the crops are ruined and will not bring any proceeds , " he said .
" but across the board , it 's somewhat relative , so i would n't say it is a general trend . "
the farmers ' association is therefore reserved in what steps to take next .
the spokesman would not confirm whether dbv will ask for financial support from the federal government .
" we do n't want to overreact , " the spokesman said .
" we first have to determine what action is even necessary and it 's just too early to do so .

the pre-trial hearing of the man accused of murdering dutch politician pim fortuyn got underway on friday in amsterdam .
the evidence against animal-rights activist volkert van der graaf is overwhelming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steijn franken , the lawyer defending the 33-year-old environmental activist volkert van der graaf , is not going to have an easy time of it . his client was arrested minutes after the may 6 murder of pim fortuyn -lrb- photo -rrb- carrying a loaded gun speckled with the politician ’ s blood .
van der graaf ’ s clothes also carried traces of fortuyn ’ s dna and latex gloves he was wearing showed particle traces from a recently fired gun . it was the most detailed presentation of evidence by public prosecutors since the stunning may 6 murder of the popular and controversial dutch politican . security at the court room was tight .
police with sniffer dogs patrolled the amsterdam district court building as television cameras beamed the proceedings live to the nation which has been gripped by the event . defender franken said he was deeply concerned about the blinding media spotlight shining on the case .
he complained that his client is being treated by the police and the media as if he were already convicted . “ nobody seems to doubt anymore than volkert committed the murder of pim fortuyn , ” he said .
“ volkert , like anyone else , is not guilty until proven guilty . ” van der graaf has refused to give a statement to investigators .
he has been on a hunger strike for four weeks , living on water and fruit juice in protest of the 24-hour camera surveillance in his cell .

no trial date has been set . investigating officials are now focusing on what the defendant did in the three days before the shooting . a search of van der graaf ’ s home computer already revealed he had spent hours on the internet in the weeks before the shooting gathering information about fortuyn and his movements . investigators found a map of the media park in hilversum where fortuyn was shot along with a map of the politician ’ s home in rotterdam and a list of other members of fortuyn ’ s party in the suspect 's car . the evidence , prosecutor plooy said , “ leads to the conclusion that it was the suspect himself who shot fortuyn from close range , and no one else . ” police also found chemicals , laboratory equipment and a timer in van der graaf ’ s home in the residential area of harderwijk , 35 miles east of amsterdam .
explosives experts determined the material could be used to made an explosive or firebomb . a nation shocked the fortuyn murder deeply shocked this nation of nearly 16 million which hadn ’ t seen the slaying of a political figure in 400 years .
the shooting came just nine days before national elections in which fortuyn ’ s party , even without its charismatic leader , came in second place . fortuyn courted controversy during his political career by calling for a halt to immigration , branding islam a “ backward ” religion and saying he was destined to be the netherlands ’ first openly gay prime minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although many dutch people disagreed with his views , the nation experienced an unprecendented public outpouring of grief following his murder when 15,000 mourners filed past his home in rotterdam to pay their respects -lrb- photo -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch politician pim fortuyn shot dead the right-wing populist politician pim fortuyn has been shot and killed outside a media center in hilversum , holland .

with donatos , the company famed for its golden arches is planning to bring its first chain to germany that does n't include the mcdonald 's name .
that could spell good news for pizza lovers in munich and frankfurt . with an oversaturated market for big macs in germany and increasing competition from burger king , mcdonalds wants to secure growth in the country by opening a new pizza restaurant chain .
donatos , which has more than 200 franchises across the united states , will do battle in a german market currently dominated by pizza hut , which boasts 80 restaurants and 12,600 employees .
up to 200 restaurants planned the first restaurant is slated to open between the middle and end of october in munich .
a second store is planned for frankfurt before the end of the year , and the company is planning to open as many as 200 stores within three years if the concept proves successful during a pilot run .
donatos will serve its trademark crustless pizzas as well as heated submarine sandwiches .
each restaurant will also include walkup counters , drive thrus and delivery service .
the move represents two firsts for the hamburger giant : it 's the first time it has opened up a restaurant that does n't carry the mcdonald 's brand in germany , and it is the first time it has tested the donatos pizza concept abroad .

unseasonably heavy rains have wreaked havoc across much of europe this summer , ruining many people 's holiday plans .
but europe 's farmers have also been caught in the downpour , and are facing a disastrous harvest . the bad weather hitting europe has taken a toll not only on the businesses that profit from tourism , but also on farmers - especially those in germany and italy .
farmers in northeastern italy are bracing for more rains after the worst hailstorm in recent memory ravaged wine grapes , tobacco crops and olive groves .
meanwhile , their counterparts around rome have lost their entire crop of peaches .
german farmers are also left facing fields under water and a wet harvest .
according to the german farmers ' association dbv , though , it 's still too early to estimate the extent of the damage .
" we can only say that when we see what could be harvested after all and what crops could be sold , " a dbv spokesman told dw-world .
higher costs the storms have particularly hit grain farms in the southern state of bavaria .
but lower saxony , schleswig-holstein and mecklenburg-western pomerania have also taken losses , mainly in fruit - such as apple orchards - and vegetables .
wolfgang arens of the farmers ' association of lower saxony estimates the damage for that region alone to total more than 100 million euro -lrb- $ 97.7 million -rrb- .
farmers faced higher costs for cleaning and drying those grains they could harvest , arens told reporters .
" as it is , 30 percent of our wheat intended for the bread market can only be sold as animal feed now . "
his counterpart in mecklenburg-western pomerania , torsten weidmann , reports that many farmers ca n't even set foot onto their fields .
" at the beginning of august , we saw more rain in one day than we did in an entire month on average , " he says .
weidmann expects the state 's grain farmers to post 20 to 30 percent less proceeds than in the previous year .
not " an existential threat " " it is certainly a severe burden for farmers in the affected regions , " the dbv spokesman said .
but , he added , it did not involve " an existential threat " .
very few farms based their output solely on grains , but also diversified with livestock or vegetables , for example .
" of course , it 's a burden when they ca n't harvest their fields , but hardly any farmer will go bankrupt because of it , " he said .
often , stocks from previous years when there was a good harvest have been put aside to compensate for such a situation .
the spokesman pointed out that farmers do not just plan on an annual basis .
" they know how dependent their livelihood is on the weather and calculate this risk . "
for this reason , most german farms offer mixed agriculture and livestock , so they can generally cope with a situation such as this year 's summer storms , he added .
no need to overreact the association spokesman admitted that there were individual cases in austria and bavaria , where farmers faced a 100 percent loss .
" if their field is under water , the crops are ruined and will not bring any proceeds , " he said .
" but across the board , it 's somewhat relative , so i would n't say it is a general trend . "
the farmers ' association is therefore reserved in what steps to take next .
the spokesman would not confirm whether dbv will ask for financial support from the federal government .
" we do n't want to overreact , " the spokesman said .
" we first have to determine what action is even necessary and it 's just too early to do so .

with donatos , the company famed for its golden arches is planning to bring its first chain to germany that does n't include the mcdonald 's name .
that could spell good news for pizza lovers in munich and frankfurt . with an oversaturated market for big macs in germany and increasing competition from burger king , mcdonalds wants to secure growth in the country by opening a new pizza restaurant chain .
donatos , which has more than 200 franchises across the united states , will do battle in a german market currently dominated by pizza hut , which boasts 80 restaurants and 12,600 employees .
up to 200 restaurants planned the first restaurant is slated to open between the middle and end of october in munich .
a second store is planned for frankfurt before the end of the year , and the company is planning to open as many as 200 stores within three years if the concept proves successful during a pilot run .
donatos will serve its trademark crustless pizzas as well as heated submarine sandwiches .
each restaurant will also include walkup counters , drive thrus and delivery service .

that could spell good news for pizza lovers in munich and frankfurt . with an oversaturated market for big macs in germany and increasing competition from burger king , mcdonalds wants to secure growth in the country by opening a new pizza restaurant chain .
donatos , which has more than 200 franchises across the united states , will do battle in a german market currently dominated by pizza hut , which boasts 80 restaurants and 12,600 employees .
up to 200 restaurants planned the first restaurant is slated to open between the middle and end of october in munich .
a second store is planned for frankfurt before the end of the year , and the company is planning to open as many as 200 stores within three years if the concept proves successful during a pilot run .
donatos will serve its trademark crustless pizzas as well as heated submarine sandwiches .
each restaurant will also include walkup counters , drive thrus and delivery service .

unseasonably heavy rains have wreaked havoc across much of europe this summer , ruining many people 's holiday plans .
but europe 's farmers have also been caught in the downpour , and are facing a disastrous harvest . the bad weather hitting europe has taken a toll not only on the businesses that profit from tourism , but also on farmers - especially those in germany and italy .
farmers in northeastern italy are bracing for more rains after the worst hailstorm in recent memory ravaged wine grapes , tobacco crops and olive groves .
meanwhile , their counterparts around rome have lost their entire crop of peaches .
german farmers are also left facing fields under water and a wet harvest .
according to the german farmers ' association dbv , though , it 's still too early to estimate the extent of the damage .
" we can only say that when we see what could be harvested after all and what crops could be sold , " a dbv spokesman told dw-world .
higher costs the storms have particularly hit grain farms in the southern state of bavaria .
but lower saxony , schleswig-holstein and mecklenburg-western pomerania have also taken losses , mainly in fruit - such as apple orchards - and vegetables .
wolfgang arens of the farmers ' association of lower saxony estimates the damage for that region alone to total more than 100 million euro -lrb- $ 97.7 million -rrb- .
farmers faced higher costs for cleaning and drying those grains they could harvest , arens told reporters .
" as it is , 30 percent of our wheat intended for the bread market can only be sold as animal feed now . "
his counterpart in mecklenburg-western pomerania , torsten weidmann , reports that many farmers ca n't even set foot onto their fields .
" at the beginning of august , we saw more rain in one day than we did in an entire month on average , " he says .
weidmann expects the state 's grain farmers to post 20 to 30 percent less proceeds than in the previous year .
not " an existential threat " " it is certainly a severe burden for farmers in the affected regions , " the dbv spokesman said .
but , he added , it did not involve " an existential threat " .
very few farms based their output solely on grains , but also diversified with livestock or vegetables , for example .
" of course , it 's a burden when they ca n't harvest their fields , but hardly any farmer will go bankrupt because of it , " he said .
often , stocks from previous years when there was a good harvest have been put aside to compensate for such a situation .
the spokesman pointed out that farmers do not just plan on an annual basis .
" they know how dependent their livelihood is on the weather and calculate this risk . "
for this reason , most german farms offer mixed agriculture and livestock , so they can generally cope with a situation such as this year 's summer storms , he added .
no need to overreact the association spokesman admitted that there were individual cases in austria and bavaria , where farmers faced a 100 percent loss .
" if their field is under water , the crops are ruined and will not bring any proceeds , " he said .
" but across the board , it 's somewhat relative , so i would n't say it is a general trend . "
the farmers ' association is therefore reserved in what steps to take next .
the spokesman would not confirm whether dbv will ask for financial support from the federal government .

unseasonably heavy rains have wreaked havoc across much of europe this summer , ruining many people 's holiday plans .
but europe 's farmers have also been caught in the downpour , and are facing a disastrous harvest . the bad weather hitting europe has taken a toll not only on the businesses that profit from tourism , but also on farmers - especially those in germany and italy .
farmers in northeastern italy are bracing for more rains after the worst hailstorm in recent memory ravaged wine grapes , tobacco crops and olive groves .
meanwhile , their counterparts around rome have lost their entire crop of peaches .
german farmers are also left facing fields under water and a wet harvest .
according to the german farmers ' association dbv , though , it 's still too early to estimate the extent of the damage .
" we can only say that when we see what could be harvested after all and what crops could be sold , " a dbv spokesman told dw-world .
higher costs the storms have particularly hit grain farms in the southern state of bavaria .
but lower saxony , schleswig-holstein and mecklenburg-western pomerania have also taken losses , mainly in fruit - such as apple orchards - and vegetables .
wolfgang arens of the farmers ' association of lower saxony estimates the damage for that region alone to total more than 100 million euro -lrb- $ 97.7 million -rrb- .
farmers faced higher costs for cleaning and drying those grains they could harvest , arens told reporters .
" as it is , 30 percent of our wheat intended for the bread market can only be sold as animal feed now . "
his counterpart in mecklenburg-western pomerania , torsten weidmann , reports that many farmers ca n't even set foot onto their fields .
" at the beginning of august , we saw more rain in one day than we did in an entire month on average , " he says .
weidmann expects the state 's grain farmers to post 20 to 30 percent less proceeds than in the previous year .
not " an existential threat " " it is certainly a severe burden for farmers in the affected regions , " the dbv spokesman said .
but , he added , it did not involve " an existential threat " .
very few farms based their output solely on grains , but also diversified with livestock or vegetables , for example .
" of course , it 's a burden when they ca n't harvest their fields , but hardly any farmer will go bankrupt because of it , " he said .
often , stocks from previous years when there was a good harvest have been put aside to compensate for such a situation .
the spokesman pointed out that farmers do not just plan on an annual basis .
" they know how dependent their livelihood is on the weather and calculate this risk . "
for this reason , most german farms offer mixed agriculture and livestock , so they can generally cope with a situation such as this year 's summer storms , he added .
no need to overreact the association spokesman admitted that there were individual cases in austria and bavaria , where farmers faced a 100 percent loss .
" if their field is under water , the crops are ruined and will not bring any proceeds , " he said .
" but across the board , it 's somewhat relative , so i would n't say it is a general trend . "
the farmers ' association is therefore reserved in what steps to take next .
the spokesman would not confirm whether dbv will ask for financial support from the federal government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dealing with a rising disaster rescuing dresden 's cultural treasures wanted : loads of clean energy environment becomes a political football in germany deadly storms lash europe current affairs -pipe- 12.08.2002 storms hit european farmers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad weather in europe has ruined many a farmer 's crop this year .
unseasonably heavy rains have wreaked havoc across much of europe this summer , ruining many people 's holiday plans .
but europe 's farmers have also been caught in the downpour , and are facing a disastrous harvest . the bad weather hitting europe has taken a toll not only on the businesses that profit from tourism , but also on farmers - especially those in germany and italy .
farmers in northeastern italy are bracing for more rains after the worst hailstorm in recent memory ravaged wine grapes , tobacco crops and olive groves .
meanwhile , their counterparts around rome have lost their entire crop of peaches .
german farmers are also left facing fields under water and a wet harvest .
according to the german farmers ' association dbv , though , it 's still too early to estimate the extent of the damage .
" we can only say that when we see what could be harvested after all and what crops could be sold , " a dbv spokesman told dw-world .
higher costs the storms have particularly hit grain farms in the southern state of bavaria .
but lower saxony , schleswig-holstein and mecklenburg-western pomerania have also taken losses , mainly in fruit - such as apple orchards - and vegetables .
wolfgang arens of the farmers ' association of lower saxony estimates the damage for that region alone to total more than 100 million euro -lrb- $ 97.7 million -rrb- .
farmers faced higher costs for cleaning and drying those grains they could harvest , arens told reporters .
" as it is , 30 percent of our wheat intended for the bread market can only be sold as animal feed now . "
his counterpart in mecklenburg-western pomerania , torsten weidmann , reports that many farmers ca n't even set foot onto their fields .
" at the beginning of august , we saw more rain in one day than we did in an entire month on average , " he says .
weidmann expects the state 's grain farmers to post 20 to 30 percent less proceeds than in the previous year .
not " an existential threat " " it is certainly a severe burden for farmers in the affected regions , " the dbv spokesman said .
but , he added , it did not involve " an existential threat " .
very few farms based their output solely on grains , but also diversified with livestock or vegetables , for example .
" of course , it 's a burden when they ca n't harvest their fields , but hardly any farmer will go bankrupt because of it , " he said .
often , stocks from previous years when there was a good harvest have been put aside to compensate for such a situation .
the spokesman pointed out that farmers do not just plan on an annual basis .
" they know how dependent their livelihood is on the weather and calculate this risk . "
for this reason , most german farms offer mixed agriculture and livestock , so they can generally cope with a situation such as this year 's summer storms , he added .
no need to overreact the association spokesman admitted that there were individual cases in austria and bavaria , where farmers faced a 100 percent loss .
" if their field is under water , the crops are ruined and will not bring any proceeds , " he said .
" but across the board , it 's somewhat relative , so i would n't say it is a general trend . "
the farmers ' association is therefore reserved in what steps to take next .
the spokesman would not confirm whether dbv will ask for financial support from the federal government .
" we do n't want to overreact , " the spokesman said .
" we first have to determine what action is even necessary and it 's just too early to do so .

with donatos , the company famed for its golden arches is planning to bring its first chain to germany that does n't include the mcdonald 's name .
that could spell good news for pizza lovers in munich and frankfurt . with an oversaturated market for big macs in germany and increasing competition from burger king , mcdonalds wants to secure growth in the country by opening a new pizza restaurant chain .
donatos , which has more than 200 franchises across the united states , will do battle in a german market currently dominated by pizza hut , which boasts 80 restaurants and 12,600 employees .
up to 200 restaurants planned the first restaurant is slated to open between the middle and end of october in munich .
a second store is planned for frankfurt before the end of the year , and the company is planning to open as many as 200 stores within three years if the concept proves successful during a pilot run .
donatos will serve its trademark crustless pizzas as well as heated submarine sandwiches .
each restaurant will also include walkup counters , drive thrus and delivery service .
the move represents two firsts for the hamburger giant : it 's the first time it has opened up a restaurant that does n't carry the mcdonald 's brand in germany , and it is the first time it has tested the donatos pizza concept abroad .
a happy meal-free environment but a few words of warning : you may be disappointed if you visit a donatos looking for ronald mcdonald , golden arches , happy meals or any of the other familiar hallmarks of germany 's 1,152 mcdonald 's restaurants .
" with donatos , we want to create an entirely new market that does n't show any relationship to the traditional mcdonalds market , " a company spokesman told reporters .
the company is seeking to diversify its offerings in germany and europe in the wake of bovine spongiform encephalopathy -lrb- bse -rrb- and other food scares that have turned customers away from fast food in recent years .
last year , mcdonald 's profits in germany fell for the first time in 30 years .
mcdonald 's first acquired the cleveland , ohio , based chain from founder jim grote in 1999 .

the pre-trial hearing of the man accused of murdering dutch politician pim fortuyn got underway on friday in amsterdam .
the evidence against animal-rights activist volkert van der graaf is overwhelming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steijn franken , the lawyer defending the 33-year-old environmental activist volkert van der graaf , is not going to have an easy time of it . his client was arrested minutes after the may 6 murder of pim fortuyn -lrb- photo -rrb- carrying a loaded gun speckled with the politician ’ s blood .
van der graaf ’ s clothes also carried traces of fortuyn ’ s dna and latex gloves he was wearing showed particle traces from a recently fired gun . it was the most detailed presentation of evidence by public prosecutors since the stunning may 6 murder of the popular and controversial dutch politican . security at the court room was tight .
police with sniffer dogs patrolled the amsterdam district court building as television cameras beamed the proceedings live to the nation which has been gripped by the event . defender franken said he was deeply concerned about the blinding media spotlight shining on the case .

with donatos , the company famed for its golden arches is planning to bring its first chain to germany that does n't include the mcdonald 's name .
that could spell good news for pizza lovers in munich and frankfurt . with an oversaturated market for big macs in germany and increasing competition from burger king , mcdonalds wants to secure growth in the country by opening a new pizza restaurant chain .
donatos , which has more than 200 franchises across the united states , will do battle in a german market currently dominated by pizza hut , which boasts 80 restaurants and 12,600 employees .
up to 200 restaurants planned the first restaurant is slated to open between the middle and end of october in munich .
a second store is planned for frankfurt before the end of the year , and the company is planning to open as many as 200 stores within three years if the concept proves successful during a pilot run .
donatos will serve its trademark crustless pizzas as well as heated submarine sandwiches .
each restaurant will also include walkup counters , drive thrus and delivery service .
the move represents two firsts for the hamburger giant : it 's the first time it has opened up a restaurant that does n't carry the mcdonald 's brand in germany , and it is the first time it has tested the donatos pizza concept abroad .
a happy meal-free environment but a few words of warning : you may be disappointed if you visit a donatos looking for ronald mcdonald , golden arches , happy meals or any of the other familiar hallmarks of germany 's 1,152 mcdonald 's restaurants .
" with donatos , we want to create an entirely new market that does n't show any relationship to the traditional mcdonalds market , " a company spokesman told reporters .
the company is seeking to diversify its offerings in germany and europe in the wake of bovine spongiform encephalopathy -lrb- bse -rrb- and other food scares that have turned customers away from fast food in recent years .
last year , mcdonald 's profits in germany fell for the first time in 30 years .
mcdonald 's first acquired the cleveland , ohio , based chain from founder jim grote in 1999 .
the company took a chain of 143 and expanded it to more than 202 donatos outposts across the country .
the company has also said is also considering bringing other non-mcdonald 's chains to germany .
in the united states , the company operates the british-based sandwich chain pret-a-manger , chipotle mexican grill and boston market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links donatos home page mcdonalds home page features links to german site 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

unseasonably heavy rains have wreaked havoc across much of europe this summer , ruining many people 's holiday plans .
but europe 's farmers have also been caught in the downpour , and are facing a disastrous harvest . the bad weather hitting europe has taken a toll not only on the businesses that profit from tourism , but also on farmers - especially those in germany and italy .
farmers in northeastern italy are bracing for more rains after the worst hailstorm in recent memory ravaged wine grapes , tobacco crops and olive groves .
meanwhile , their counterparts around rome have lost their entire crop of peaches .
german farmers are also left facing fields under water and a wet harvest .
according to the german farmers ' association dbv , though , it 's still too early to estimate the extent of the damage .
" we can only say that when we see what could be harvested after all and what crops could be sold , " a dbv spokesman told dw-world .
higher costs the storms have particularly hit grain farms in the southern state of bavaria .
but lower saxony , schleswig-holstein and mecklenburg-western pomerania have also taken losses , mainly in fruit - such as apple orchards - and vegetables .
wolfgang arens of the farmers ' association of lower saxony estimates the damage for that region alone to total more than 100 million euro -lrb- $ 97.7 million -rrb- .
farmers faced higher costs for cleaning and drying those grains they could harvest , arens told reporters .
" as it is , 30 percent of our wheat intended for the bread market can only be sold as animal feed now . "
his counterpart in mecklenburg-western pomerania , torsten weidmann , reports that many farmers ca n't even set foot onto their fields .
" at the beginning of august , we saw more rain in one day than we did in an entire month on average , " he says .
weidmann expects the state 's grain farmers to post 20 to 30 percent less proceeds than in the previous year .
not " an existential threat " " it is certainly a severe burden for farmers in the affected regions , " the dbv spokesman said .
but , he added , it did not involve " an existential threat " .
very few farms based their output solely on grains , but also diversified with livestock or vegetables , for example .
" of course , it 's a burden when they ca n't harvest their fields , but hardly any farmer will go bankrupt because of it , " he said .
often , stocks from previous years when there was a good harvest have been put aside to compensate for such a situation .
the spokesman pointed out that farmers do not just plan on an annual basis .
" they know how dependent their livelihood is on the weather and calculate this risk . "
for this reason , most german farms offer mixed agriculture and livestock , so they can generally cope with a situation such as this year 's summer storms , he added .
no need to overreact the association spokesman admitted that there were individual cases in austria and bavaria , where farmers faced a 100 percent loss .
" if their field is under water , the crops are ruined and will not bring any proceeds , " he said .
" but across the board , it 's somewhat relative , so i would n't say it is a general trend . "
the farmers ' association is therefore reserved in what steps to take next .
the spokesman would not confirm whether dbv will ask for financial support from the federal government .
" we do n't want to overreact , " the spokesman said .
" we first have to determine what action is even necessary and it 's just too early to do so .

with donatos , the company famed for its golden arches is planning to bring its first chain to germany that does n't include the mcdonald 's name .
that could spell good news for pizza lovers in munich and frankfurt . with an oversaturated market for big macs in germany and increasing competition from burger king , mcdonalds wants to secure growth in the country by opening a new pizza restaurant chain .
donatos , which has more than 200 franchises across the united states , will do battle in a german market currently dominated by pizza hut , which boasts 80 restaurants and 12,600 employees .
up to 200 restaurants planned the first restaurant is slated to open between the middle and end of october in munich .
a second store is planned for frankfurt before the end of the year , and the company is planning to open as many as 200 stores within three years if the concept proves successful during a pilot run .
donatos will serve its trademark crustless pizzas as well as heated submarine sandwiches .
each restaurant will also include walkup counters , drive thrus and delivery service .
the move represents two firsts for the hamburger giant : it 's the first time it has opened up a restaurant that does n't carry the mcdonald 's brand in germany , and it is the first time it has tested the donatos pizza concept abroad .
a happy meal-free environment but a few words of warning : you may be disappointed if you visit a donatos looking for ronald mcdonald , golden arches , happy meals or any of the other familiar hallmarks of germany 's 1,152 mcdonald 's restaurants .
" with donatos , we want to create an entirely new market that does n't show any relationship to the traditional mcdonalds market , " a company spokesman told reporters .
the company is seeking to diversify its offerings in germany and europe in the wake of bovine spongiform encephalopathy -lrb- bse -rrb- and other food scares that have turned customers away from fast food in recent years .
last year , mcdonald 's profits in germany fell for the first time in 30 years .
mcdonald 's first acquired the cleveland , ohio , based chain from founder jim grote in 1999 .
the company took a chain of 143 and expanded it to more than 202 donatos outposts across the country .
the company has also said is also considering bringing other non-mcdonald 's chains to germany .
in the united states , the company operates the british-based sandwich chain pret-a-manger , chipotle mexican grill and boston market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links donatos home page mcdonalds home page features links to german site 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dealing with a rising disaster rescuing dresden 's cultural treasures wanted : loads of clean energy environment becomes a political football in germany deadly storms lash europe current affairs -pipe- 12.08.2002 storms hit european farmers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad weather in europe has ruined many a farmer 's crop this year .
unseasonably heavy rains have wreaked havoc across much of europe this summer , ruining many people 's holiday plans .
but europe 's farmers have also been caught in the downpour , and are facing a disastrous harvest . the bad weather hitting europe has taken a toll not only on the businesses that profit from tourism , but also on farmers - especially those in germany and italy .
farmers in northeastern italy are bracing for more rains after the worst hailstorm in recent memory ravaged wine grapes , tobacco crops and olive groves .
meanwhile , their counterparts around rome have lost their entire crop of peaches .
german farmers are also left facing fields under water and a wet harvest .
according to the german farmers ' association dbv , though , it 's still too early to estimate the extent of the damage .
" we can only say that when we see what could be harvested after all and what crops could be sold , " a dbv spokesman told dw-world .
higher costs the storms have particularly hit grain farms in the southern state of bavaria .
but lower saxony , schleswig-holstein and mecklenburg-western pomerania have also taken losses , mainly in fruit - such as apple orchards - and vegetables .
wolfgang arens of the farmers ' association of lower saxony estimates the damage for that region alone to total more than 100 million euro -lrb- $ 97.7 million -rrb- .
farmers faced higher costs for cleaning and drying those grains they could harvest , arens told reporters .
" as it is , 30 percent of our wheat intended for the bread market can only be sold as animal feed now . "
his counterpart in mecklenburg-western pomerania , torsten weidmann , reports that many farmers ca n't even set foot onto their fields .
" at the beginning of august , we saw more rain in one day than we did in an entire month on average , " he says .
weidmann expects the state 's grain farmers to post 20 to 30 percent less proceeds than in the previous year .
not " an existential threat " " it is certainly a severe burden for farmers in the affected regions , " the dbv spokesman said .
but , he added , it did not involve " an existential threat " .
very few farms based their output solely on grains , but also diversified with livestock or vegetables , for example .
" of course , it 's a burden when they ca n't harvest their fields , but hardly any farmer will go bankrupt because of it , " he said .
often , stocks from previous years when there was a good harvest have been put aside to compensate for such a situation .

unseasonably heavy rains have wreaked havoc across much of europe this summer , ruining many people 's holiday plans .
but europe 's farmers have also been caught in the downpour , and are facing a disastrous harvest . the bad weather hitting europe has taken a toll not only on the businesses that profit from tourism , but also on farmers - especially those in germany and italy .
farmers in northeastern italy are bracing for more rains after the worst hailstorm in recent memory ravaged wine grapes , tobacco crops and olive groves .
meanwhile , their counterparts around rome have lost their entire crop of peaches .
german farmers are also left facing fields under water and a wet harvest .
according to the german farmers ' association dbv , though , it 's still too early to estimate the extent of the damage .
" we can only say that when we see what could be harvested after all and what crops could be sold , " a dbv spokesman told dw-world .
higher costs the storms have particularly hit grain farms in the southern state of bavaria .
but lower saxony , schleswig-holstein and mecklenburg-western pomerania have also taken losses , mainly in fruit - such as apple orchards - and vegetables .
wolfgang arens of the farmers ' association of lower saxony estimates the damage for that region alone to total more than 100 million euro -lrb- $ 97.7 million -rrb- .
farmers faced higher costs for cleaning and drying those grains they could harvest , arens told reporters .
" as it is , 30 percent of our wheat intended for the bread market can only be sold as animal feed now . "
his counterpart in mecklenburg-western pomerania , torsten weidmann , reports that many farmers ca n't even set foot onto their fields .
" at the beginning of august , we saw more rain in one day than we did in an entire month on average , " he says .
weidmann expects the state 's grain farmers to post 20 to 30 percent less proceeds than in the previous year .
not " an existential threat " " it is certainly a severe burden for farmers in the affected regions , " the dbv spokesman said .
but , he added , it did not involve " an existential threat " .
very few farms based their output solely on grains , but also diversified with livestock or vegetables , for example .
" of course , it 's a burden when they ca n't harvest their fields , but hardly any farmer will go bankrupt because of it , " he said .
often , stocks from previous years when there was a good harvest have been put aside to compensate for such a situation .
the spokesman pointed out that farmers do not just plan on an annual basis .

with donatos , the company famed for its golden arches is planning to bring its first chain to germany that does n't include the mcdonald 's name .
that could spell good news for pizza lovers in munich and frankfurt . with an oversaturated market for big macs in germany and increasing competition from burger king , mcdonalds wants to secure growth in the country by opening a new pizza restaurant chain .
donatos , which has more than 200 franchises across the united states , will do battle in a german market currently dominated by pizza hut , which boasts 80 restaurants and 12,600 employees .
up to 200 restaurants planned the first restaurant is slated to open between the middle and end of october in munich .
a second store is planned for frankfurt before the end of the year , and the company is planning to open as many as 200 stores within three years if the concept proves successful during a pilot run .
donatos will serve its trademark crustless pizzas as well as heated submarine sandwiches .
each restaurant will also include walkup counters , drive thrus and delivery service .
the move represents two firsts for the hamburger giant : it 's the first time it has opened up a restaurant that does n't carry the mcdonald 's brand in germany , and it is the first time it has tested the donatos pizza concept abroad .
a happy meal-free environment but a few words of warning : you may be disappointed if you visit a donatos looking for ronald mcdonald , golden arches , happy meals or any of the other familiar hallmarks of germany 's 1,152 mcdonald 's restaurants .
" with donatos , we want to create an entirely new market that does n't show any relationship to the traditional mcdonalds market , " a company spokesman told reporters .
the company is seeking to diversify its offerings in germany and europe in the wake of bovine spongiform encephalopathy -lrb- bse -rrb- and other food scares that have turned customers away from fast food in recent years .
last year , mcdonald 's profits in germany fell for the first time in 30 years .
mcdonald 's first acquired the cleveland , ohio , based chain from founder jim grote in 1999 .
the company took a chain of 143 and expanded it to more than 202 donatos outposts across the country .

with donatos , the company famed for its golden arches is planning to bring its first chain to germany that does n't include the mcdonald 's name .
that could spell good news for pizza lovers in munich and frankfurt . with an oversaturated market for big macs in germany and increasing competition from burger king , mcdonalds wants to secure growth in the country by opening a new pizza restaurant chain .
donatos , which has more than 200 franchises across the united states , will do battle in a german market currently dominated by pizza hut , which boasts 80 restaurants and 12,600 employees .
up to 200 restaurants planned the first restaurant is slated to open between the middle and end of october in munich .
a second store is planned for frankfurt before the end of the year , and the company is planning to open as many as 200 stores within three years if the concept proves successful during a pilot run .
donatos will serve its trademark crustless pizzas as well as heated submarine sandwiches .
each restaurant will also include walkup counters , drive thrus and delivery service .
the move represents two firsts for the hamburger giant : it 's the first time it has opened up a restaurant that does n't carry the mcdonald 's brand in germany , and it is the first time it has tested the donatos pizza concept abroad .
a happy meal-free environment but a few words of warning : you may be disappointed if you visit a donatos looking for ronald mcdonald , golden arches , happy meals or any of the other familiar hallmarks of germany 's 1,152 mcdonald 's restaurants .

unseasonably heavy rains have wreaked havoc across much of europe this summer , ruining many people 's holiday plans .
but europe 's farmers have also been caught in the downpour , and are facing a disastrous harvest . the bad weather hitting europe has taken a toll not only on the businesses that profit from tourism , but also on farmers - especially those in germany and italy .
farmers in northeastern italy are bracing for more rains after the worst hailstorm in recent memory ravaged wine grapes , tobacco crops and olive groves .
meanwhile , their counterparts around rome have lost their entire crop of peaches .
german farmers are also left facing fields under water and a wet harvest .
according to the german farmers ' association dbv , though , it 's still too early to estimate the extent of the damage .
" we can only say that when we see what could be harvested after all and what crops could be sold , " a dbv spokesman told dw-world .
higher costs the storms have particularly hit grain farms in the southern state of bavaria .
but lower saxony , schleswig-holstein and mecklenburg-western pomerania have also taken losses , mainly in fruit - such as apple orchards - and vegetables .
wolfgang arens of the farmers ' association of lower saxony estimates the damage for that region alone to total more than 100 million euro -lrb- $ 97.7 million -rrb- .
farmers faced higher costs for cleaning and drying those grains they could harvest , arens told reporters .
" as it is , 30 percent of our wheat intended for the bread market can only be sold as animal feed now . "
his counterpart in mecklenburg-western pomerania , torsten weidmann , reports that many farmers ca n't even set foot onto their fields .
" at the beginning of august , we saw more rain in one day than we did in an entire month on average , " he says .
weidmann expects the state 's grain farmers to post 20 to 30 percent less proceeds than in the previous year .
not " an existential threat " " it is certainly a severe burden for farmers in the affected regions , " the dbv spokesman said .
but , he added , it did not involve " an existential threat " .
very few farms based their output solely on grains , but also diversified with livestock or vegetables , for example .
" of course , it 's a burden when they ca n't harvest their fields , but hardly any farmer will go bankrupt because of it , " he said .
often , stocks from previous years when there was a good harvest have been put aside to compensate for such a situation .
the spokesman pointed out that farmers do not just plan on an annual basis .
" they know how dependent their livelihood is on the weather and calculate this risk . "
for this reason , most german farms offer mixed agriculture and livestock , so they can generally cope with a situation such as this year 's summer storms , he added .
no need to overreact the association spokesman admitted that there were individual cases in austria and bavaria , where farmers faced a 100 percent loss .
" if their field is under water , the crops are ruined and will not bring any proceeds , " he said .
" but across the board , it 's somewhat relative , so i would n't say it is a general trend . "
the farmers ' association is therefore reserved in what steps to take next .
the spokesman would not confirm whether dbv will ask for financial support from the federal government .
" we do n't want to overreact , " the spokesman said .
" we first have to determine what action is even necessary and it 's just too early to do so .

the pre-trial hearing of the man accused of murdering dutch politician pim fortuyn got underway on friday in amsterdam .
the evidence against animal-rights activist volkert van der graaf is overwhelming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steijn franken , the lawyer defending the 33-year-old environmental activist volkert van der graaf , is not going to have an easy time of it . his client was arrested minutes after the may 6 murder of pim fortuyn -lrb- photo -rrb- carrying a loaded gun speckled with the politician ’ s blood .
van der graaf ’ s clothes also carried traces of fortuyn ’ s dna and latex gloves he was wearing showed particle traces from a recently fired gun . it was the most detailed presentation of evidence by public prosecutors since the stunning may 6 murder of the popular and controversial dutch politican . security at the court room was tight .
police with sniffer dogs patrolled the amsterdam district court building as television cameras beamed the proceedings live to the nation which has been gripped by the event . defender franken said he was deeply concerned about the blinding media spotlight shining on the case .
he complained that his client is being treated by the police and the media as if he were already convicted . “ nobody seems to doubt anymore than volkert committed the murder of pim fortuyn , ” he said .
“ volkert , like anyone else , is not guilty until proven guilty . ” van der graaf has refused to give a statement to investigators .
he has been on a hunger strike for four weeks , living on water and fruit juice in protest of the 24-hour camera surveillance in his cell .

unseasonably heavy rains have wreaked havoc across much of europe this summer , ruining many people 's holiday plans .
but europe 's farmers have also been caught in the downpour , and are facing a disastrous harvest . the bad weather hitting europe has taken a toll not only on the businesses that profit from tourism , but also on farmers - especially those in germany and italy .
farmers in northeastern italy are bracing for more rains after the worst hailstorm in recent memory ravaged wine grapes , tobacco crops and olive groves .
meanwhile , their counterparts around rome have lost their entire crop of peaches .
german farmers are also left facing fields under water and a wet harvest .
according to the german farmers ' association dbv , though , it 's still too early to estimate the extent of the damage .
" we can only say that when we see what could be harvested after all and what crops could be sold , " a dbv spokesman told dw-world .
higher costs the storms have particularly hit grain farms in the southern state of bavaria .
but lower saxony , schleswig-holstein and mecklenburg-western pomerania have also taken losses , mainly in fruit - such as apple orchards - and vegetables .
wolfgang arens of the farmers ' association of lower saxony estimates the damage for that region alone to total more than 100 million euro -lrb- $ 97.7 million -rrb- .
farmers faced higher costs for cleaning and drying those grains they could harvest , arens told reporters .
" as it is , 30 percent of our wheat intended for the bread market can only be sold as animal feed now . "
his counterpart in mecklenburg-western pomerania , torsten weidmann , reports that many farmers ca n't even set foot onto their fields .
" at the beginning of august , we saw more rain in one day than we did in an entire month on average , " he says .
weidmann expects the state 's grain farmers to post 20 to 30 percent less proceeds than in the previous year .
not " an existential threat " " it is certainly a severe burden for farmers in the affected regions , " the dbv spokesman said .
but , he added , it did not involve " an existential threat " .
very few farms based their output solely on grains , but also diversified with livestock or vegetables , for example .
" of course , it 's a burden when they ca n't harvest their fields , but hardly any farmer will go bankrupt because of it , " he said .
often , stocks from previous years when there was a good harvest have been put aside to compensate for such a situation .
the spokesman pointed out that farmers do not just plan on an annual basis .
" they know how dependent their livelihood is on the weather and calculate this risk . "
for this reason , most german farms offer mixed agriculture and livestock , so they can generally cope with a situation such as this year 's summer storms , he added .
no need to overreact the association spokesman admitted that there were individual cases in austria and bavaria , where farmers faced a 100 percent loss .
" if their field is under water , the crops are ruined and will not bring any proceeds , " he said .
" but across the board , it 's somewhat relative , so i would n't say it is a general trend . "
the farmers ' association is therefore reserved in what steps to take next .
the spokesman would not confirm whether dbv will ask for financial support from the federal government .

unseasonably heavy rains have wreaked havoc across much of europe this summer , ruining many people 's holiday plans .
but europe 's farmers have also been caught in the downpour , and are facing a disastrous harvest . the bad weather hitting europe has taken a toll not only on the businesses that profit from tourism , but also on farmers - especially those in germany and italy .
farmers in northeastern italy are bracing for more rains after the worst hailstorm in recent memory ravaged wine grapes , tobacco crops and olive groves .
meanwhile , their counterparts around rome have lost their entire crop of peaches .
german farmers are also left facing fields under water and a wet harvest .
according to the german farmers ' association dbv , though , it 's still too early to estimate the extent of the damage .
" we can only say that when we see what could be harvested after all and what crops could be sold , " a dbv spokesman told dw-world .
higher costs the storms have particularly hit grain farms in the southern state of bavaria .
but lower saxony , schleswig-holstein and mecklenburg-western pomerania have also taken losses , mainly in fruit - such as apple orchards - and vegetables .
wolfgang arens of the farmers ' association of lower saxony estimates the damage for that region alone to total more than 100 million euro -lrb- $ 97.7 million -rrb- .
farmers faced higher costs for cleaning and drying those grains they could harvest , arens told reporters .
" as it is , 30 percent of our wheat intended for the bread market can only be sold as animal feed now . "
his counterpart in mecklenburg-western pomerania , torsten weidmann , reports that many farmers ca n't even set foot onto their fields .
" at the beginning of august , we saw more rain in one day than we did in an entire month on average , " he says .
weidmann expects the state 's grain farmers to post 20 to 30 percent less proceeds than in the previous year .
not " an existential threat " " it is certainly a severe burden for farmers in the affected regions , " the dbv spokesman said .
but , he added , it did not involve " an existential threat " .
very few farms based their output solely on grains , but also diversified with livestock or vegetables , for example .
" of course , it 's a burden when they ca n't harvest their fields , but hardly any farmer will go bankrupt because of it , " he said .
often , stocks from previous years when there was a good harvest have been put aside to compensate for such a situation .
the spokesman pointed out that farmers do not just plan on an annual basis .
" they know how dependent their livelihood is on the weather and calculate this risk . "
for this reason , most german farms offer mixed agriculture and livestock , so they can generally cope with a situation such as this year 's summer storms , he added .
no need to overreact the association spokesman admitted that there were individual cases in austria and bavaria , where farmers faced a 100 percent loss .

police with sniffer dogs patrolled the amsterdam district court building as television cameras beamed the proceedings live to the nation which has been gripped by the event . defender franken said he was deeply concerned about the blinding media spotlight shining on the case .
he complained that his client is being treated by the police and the media as if he were already convicted . “ nobody seems to doubt anymore than volkert committed the murder of pim fortuyn , ” he said .
“ volkert , like anyone else , is not guilty until proven guilty . ” van der graaf has refused to give a statement to investigators .

unseasonably heavy rains have wreaked havoc across much of europe this summer , ruining many people 's holiday plans .
but europe 's farmers have also been caught in the downpour , and are facing a disastrous harvest . the bad weather hitting europe has taken a toll not only on the businesses that profit from tourism , but also on farmers - especially those in germany and italy .
farmers in northeastern italy are bracing for more rains after the worst hailstorm in recent memory ravaged wine grapes , tobacco crops and olive groves .
meanwhile , their counterparts around rome have lost their entire crop of peaches .
german farmers are also left facing fields under water and a wet harvest .
according to the german farmers ' association dbv , though , it 's still too early to estimate the extent of the damage .
" we can only say that when we see what could be harvested after all and what crops could be sold , " a dbv spokesman told dw-world .
higher costs the storms have particularly hit grain farms in the southern state of bavaria .
but lower saxony , schleswig-holstein and mecklenburg-western pomerania have also taken losses , mainly in fruit - such as apple orchards - and vegetables .
wolfgang arens of the farmers ' association of lower saxony estimates the damage for that region alone to total more than 100 million euro -lrb- $ 97.7 million -rrb- .
farmers faced higher costs for cleaning and drying those grains they could harvest , arens told reporters .
" as it is , 30 percent of our wheat intended for the bread market can only be sold as animal feed now . "
his counterpart in mecklenburg-western pomerania , torsten weidmann , reports that many farmers ca n't even set foot onto their fields .
" at the beginning of august , we saw more rain in one day than we did in an entire month on average , " he says .
weidmann expects the state 's grain farmers to post 20 to 30 percent less proceeds than in the previous year .
not " an existential threat " " it is certainly a severe burden for farmers in the affected regions , " the dbv spokesman said .
but , he added , it did not involve " an existential threat " .
very few farms based their output solely on grains , but also diversified with livestock or vegetables , for example .
" of course , it 's a burden when they ca n't harvest their fields , but hardly any farmer will go bankrupt because of it , " he said .
often , stocks from previous years when there was a good harvest have been put aside to compensate for such a situation .
the spokesman pointed out that farmers do not just plan on an annual basis .
" they know how dependent their livelihood is on the weather and calculate this risk . "
for this reason , most german farms offer mixed agriculture and livestock , so they can generally cope with a situation such as this year 's summer storms , he added .
no need to overreact the association spokesman admitted that there were individual cases in austria and bavaria , where farmers faced a 100 percent loss .
" if their field is under water , the crops are ruined and will not bring any proceeds , " he said .
" but across the board , it 's somewhat relative , so i would n't say it is a general trend . "
the farmers ' association is therefore reserved in what steps to take next .
the spokesman would not confirm whether dbv will ask for financial support from the federal government .
" we do n't want to overreact , " the spokesman said .
" we first have to determine what action is even necessary and it 's just too early to do so .

with donatos , the company famed for its golden arches is planning to bring its first chain to germany that does n't include the mcdonald 's name .
that could spell good news for pizza lovers in munich and frankfurt . with an oversaturated market for big macs in germany and increasing competition from burger king , mcdonalds wants to secure growth in the country by opening a new pizza restaurant chain .
donatos , which has more than 200 franchises across the united states , will do battle in a german market currently dominated by pizza hut , which boasts 80 restaurants and 12,600 employees .
up to 200 restaurants planned the first restaurant is slated to open between the middle and end of october in munich .
a second store is planned for frankfurt before the end of the year , and the company is planning to open as many as 200 stores within three years if the concept proves successful during a pilot run .
donatos will serve its trademark crustless pizzas as well as heated submarine sandwiches .
each restaurant will also include walkup counters , drive thrus and delivery service .
the move represents two firsts for the hamburger giant : it 's the first time it has opened up a restaurant that does n't carry the mcdonald 's brand in germany , and it is the first time it has tested the donatos pizza concept abroad .
a happy meal-free environment but a few words of warning : you may be disappointed if you visit a donatos looking for ronald mcdonald , golden arches , happy meals or any of the other familiar hallmarks of germany 's 1,152 mcdonald 's restaurants .
" with donatos , we want to create an entirely new market that does n't show any relationship to the traditional mcdonalds market , " a company spokesman told reporters .
the company is seeking to diversify its offerings in germany and europe in the wake of bovine spongiform encephalopathy -lrb- bse -rrb- and other food scares that have turned customers away from fast food in recent years .
last year , mcdonald 's profits in germany fell for the first time in 30 years .
mcdonald 's first acquired the cleveland , ohio , based chain from founder jim grote in 1999 .
the company took a chain of 143 and expanded it to more than 202 donatos outposts across the country .
the company has also said is also considering bringing other non-mcdonald 's chains to germany .
in the united states , the company operates the british-based sandwich chain pret-a-manger , chipotle mexican grill and boston market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links donatos home page mcdonalds home page features links to german site 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

unseasonably heavy rains have wreaked havoc across much of europe this summer , ruining many people 's holiday plans .
but europe 's farmers have also been caught in the downpour , and are facing a disastrous harvest . the bad weather hitting europe has taken a toll not only on the businesses that profit from tourism , but also on farmers - especially those in germany and italy .
farmers in northeastern italy are bracing for more rains after the worst hailstorm in recent memory ravaged wine grapes , tobacco crops and olive groves .
meanwhile , their counterparts around rome have lost their entire crop of peaches .
german farmers are also left facing fields under water and a wet harvest .
according to the german farmers ' association dbv , though , it 's still too early to estimate the extent of the damage .
" we can only say that when we see what could be harvested after all and what crops could be sold , " a dbv spokesman told dw-world .
higher costs the storms have particularly hit grain farms in the southern state of bavaria .
but lower saxony , schleswig-holstein and mecklenburg-western pomerania have also taken losses , mainly in fruit - such as apple orchards - and vegetables .
wolfgang arens of the farmers ' association of lower saxony estimates the damage for that region alone to total more than 100 million euro -lrb- $ 97.7 million -rrb- .
farmers faced higher costs for cleaning and drying those grains they could harvest , arens told reporters .
" as it is , 30 percent of our wheat intended for the bread market can only be sold as animal feed now . "
his counterpart in mecklenburg-western pomerania , torsten weidmann , reports that many farmers ca n't even set foot onto their fields .
" at the beginning of august , we saw more rain in one day than we did in an entire month on average , " he says .
weidmann expects the state 's grain farmers to post 20 to 30 percent less proceeds than in the previous year .
not " an existential threat " " it is certainly a severe burden for farmers in the affected regions , " the dbv spokesman said .
but , he added , it did not involve " an existential threat " .
very few farms based their output solely on grains , but also diversified with livestock or vegetables , for example .
" of course , it 's a burden when they ca n't harvest their fields , but hardly any farmer will go bankrupt because of it , " he said .
often , stocks from previous years when there was a good harvest have been put aside to compensate for such a situation .
the spokesman pointed out that farmers do not just plan on an annual basis .
" they know how dependent their livelihood is on the weather and calculate this risk . "
for this reason , most german farms offer mixed agriculture and livestock , so they can generally cope with a situation such as this year 's summer storms , he added .
no need to overreact the association spokesman admitted that there were individual cases in austria and bavaria , where farmers faced a 100 percent loss .
" if their field is under water , the crops are ruined and will not bring any proceeds , " he said .
" but across the board , it 's somewhat relative , so i would n't say it is a general trend . "
the farmers ' association is therefore reserved in what steps to take next .
the spokesman would not confirm whether dbv will ask for financial support from the federal government .
" we do n't want to overreact , " the spokesman said .
" we first have to determine what action is even necessary and it 's just too early to do so .

up to 200 restaurants planned the first restaurant is slated to open between the middle and end of october in munich .
a second store is planned for frankfurt before the end of the year , and the company is planning to open as many as 200 stores within three years if the concept proves successful during a pilot run .
donatos will serve its trademark crustless pizzas as well as heated submarine sandwiches .
each restaurant will also include walkup counters , drive thrus and delivery service .
the move represents two firsts for the hamburger giant : it 's the first time it has opened up a restaurant that does n't carry the mcdonald 's brand in germany , and it is the first time it has tested the donatos pizza concept abroad .
a happy meal-free environment but a few words of warning : you may be disappointed if you visit a donatos looking for ronald mcdonald , golden arches , happy meals or any of the other familiar hallmarks of germany 's 1,152 mcdonald 's restaurants .
" with donatos , we want to create an entirely new market that does n't show any relationship to the traditional mcdonalds market , " a company spokesman told reporters .
the company is seeking to diversify its offerings in germany and europe in the wake of bovine spongiform encephalopathy -lrb- bse -rrb- and other food scares that have turned customers away from fast food in recent years .
last year , mcdonald 's profits in germany fell for the first time in 30 years .
mcdonald 's first acquired the cleveland , ohio , based chain from founder jim grote in 1999 .
the company took a chain of 143 and expanded it to more than 202 donatos outposts across the country .
the company has also said is also considering bringing other non-mcdonald 's chains to germany .
in the united states , the company operates the british-based sandwich chain pret-a-manger , chipotle mexican grill and boston market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links donatos home page mcdonalds home page features links to german site 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

“ volkert , like anyone else , is not guilty until proven guilty . ” van der graaf has refused to give a statement to investigators .

explosives experts determined the material could be used to made an explosive or firebomb . a nation shocked the fortuyn murder deeply shocked this nation of nearly 16 million which hadn ’ t seen the slaying of a political figure in 400 years .
the shooting came just nine days before national elections in which fortuyn ’ s party , even without its charismatic leader , came in second place . fortuyn courted controversy during his political career by calling for a halt to immigration , branding islam a “ backward ” religion and saying he was destined to be the netherlands ’ first openly gay prime minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although many dutch people disagreed with his views , the nation experienced an unprecendented public outpouring of grief following his murder when 15,000 mourners filed past his home in rotterdam to pay their respects -lrb- photo -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch politician pim fortuyn shot dead the right-wing populist politician pim fortuyn has been shot and killed outside a media center in hilversum , holland .

with donatos , the company famed for its golden arches is planning to bring its first chain to germany that does n't include the mcdonald 's name .
that could spell good news for pizza lovers in munich and frankfurt . with an oversaturated market for big macs in germany and increasing competition from burger king , mcdonalds wants to secure growth in the country by opening a new pizza restaurant chain .
donatos , which has more than 200 franchises across the united states , will do battle in a german market currently dominated by pizza hut , which boasts 80 restaurants and 12,600 employees .
up to 200 restaurants planned the first restaurant is slated to open between the middle and end of october in munich .
a second store is planned for frankfurt before the end of the year , and the company is planning to open as many as 200 stores within three years if the concept proves successful during a pilot run .
donatos will serve its trademark crustless pizzas as well as heated submarine sandwiches .
each restaurant will also include walkup counters , drive thrus and delivery service .
the move represents two firsts for the hamburger giant : it 's the first time it has opened up a restaurant that does n't carry the mcdonald 's brand in germany , and it is the first time it has tested the donatos pizza concept abroad .
a happy meal-free environment but a few words of warning : you may be disappointed if you visit a donatos looking for ronald mcdonald , golden arches , happy meals or any of the other familiar hallmarks of germany 's 1,152 mcdonald 's restaurants .
" with donatos , we want to create an entirely new market that does n't show any relationship to the traditional mcdonalds market , " a company spokesman told reporters .

unseasonably heavy rains have wreaked havoc across much of europe this summer , ruining many people 's holiday plans .
but europe 's farmers have also been caught in the downpour , and are facing a disastrous harvest . the bad weather hitting europe has taken a toll not only on the businesses that profit from tourism , but also on farmers - especially those in germany and italy .
farmers in northeastern italy are bracing for more rains after the worst hailstorm in recent memory ravaged wine grapes , tobacco crops and olive groves .
meanwhile , their counterparts around rome have lost their entire crop of peaches .
german farmers are also left facing fields under water and a wet harvest .
according to the german farmers ' association dbv , though , it 's still too early to estimate the extent of the damage .
" we can only say that when we see what could be harvested after all and what crops could be sold , " a dbv spokesman told dw-world .
higher costs the storms have particularly hit grain farms in the southern state of bavaria .
but lower saxony , schleswig-holstein and mecklenburg-western pomerania have also taken losses , mainly in fruit - such as apple orchards - and vegetables .
wolfgang arens of the farmers ' association of lower saxony estimates the damage for that region alone to total more than 100 million euro -lrb- $ 97.7 million -rrb- .
farmers faced higher costs for cleaning and drying those grains they could harvest , arens told reporters .
" as it is , 30 percent of our wheat intended for the bread market can only be sold as animal feed now . "
his counterpart in mecklenburg-western pomerania , torsten weidmann , reports that many farmers ca n't even set foot onto their fields .
" at the beginning of august , we saw more rain in one day than we did in an entire month on average , " he says .
weidmann expects the state 's grain farmers to post 20 to 30 percent less proceeds than in the previous year .
not " an existential threat " " it is certainly a severe burden for farmers in the affected regions , " the dbv spokesman said .
but , he added , it did not involve " an existential threat " .
very few farms based their output solely on grains , but also diversified with livestock or vegetables , for example .
" of course , it 's a burden when they ca n't harvest their fields , but hardly any farmer will go bankrupt because of it , " he said .
often , stocks from previous years when there was a good harvest have been put aside to compensate for such a situation .
the spokesman pointed out that farmers do not just plan on an annual basis .
" they know how dependent their livelihood is on the weather and calculate this risk . "
for this reason , most german farms offer mixed agriculture and livestock , so they can generally cope with a situation such as this year 's summer storms , he added .
no need to overreact the association spokesman admitted that there were individual cases in austria and bavaria , where farmers faced a 100 percent loss .
" if their field is under water , the crops are ruined and will not bring any proceeds , " he said .
" but across the board , it 's somewhat relative , so i would n't say it is a general trend . "
the farmers ' association is therefore reserved in what steps to take next .
the spokesman would not confirm whether dbv will ask for financial support from the federal government .
" we do n't want to overreact , " the spokesman said .

unseasonably heavy rains have wreaked havoc across much of europe this summer , ruining many people 's holiday plans .
but europe 's farmers have also been caught in the downpour , and are facing a disastrous harvest . the bad weather hitting europe has taken a toll not only on the businesses that profit from tourism , but also on farmers - especially those in germany and italy .
farmers in northeastern italy are bracing for more rains after the worst hailstorm in recent memory ravaged wine grapes , tobacco crops and olive groves .
meanwhile , their counterparts around rome have lost their entire crop of peaches .
german farmers are also left facing fields under water and a wet harvest .
according to the german farmers ' association dbv , though , it 's still too early to estimate the extent of the damage .
" we can only say that when we see what could be harvested after all and what crops could be sold , " a dbv spokesman told dw-world .
higher costs the storms have particularly hit grain farms in the southern state of bavaria .
but lower saxony , schleswig-holstein and mecklenburg-western pomerania have also taken losses , mainly in fruit - such as apple orchards - and vegetables .
wolfgang arens of the farmers ' association of lower saxony estimates the damage for that region alone to total more than 100 million euro -lrb- $ 97.7 million -rrb- .
farmers faced higher costs for cleaning and drying those grains they could harvest , arens told reporters .
" as it is , 30 percent of our wheat intended for the bread market can only be sold as animal feed now . "
his counterpart in mecklenburg-western pomerania , torsten weidmann , reports that many farmers ca n't even set foot onto their fields .
" at the beginning of august , we saw more rain in one day than we did in an entire month on average , " he says .
weidmann expects the state 's grain farmers to post 20 to 30 percent less proceeds than in the previous year .
not " an existential threat " " it is certainly a severe burden for farmers in the affected regions , " the dbv spokesman said .
but , he added , it did not involve " an existential threat " .
very few farms based their output solely on grains , but also diversified with livestock or vegetables , for example .
" of course , it 's a burden when they ca n't harvest their fields , but hardly any farmer will go bankrupt because of it , " he said .
often , stocks from previous years when there was a good harvest have been put aside to compensate for such a situation .
the spokesman pointed out that farmers do not just plan on an annual basis .
" they know how dependent their livelihood is on the weather and calculate this risk . "
for this reason , most german farms offer mixed agriculture and livestock , so they can generally cope with a situation such as this year 's summer storms , he added .
no need to overreact the association spokesman admitted that there were individual cases in austria and bavaria , where farmers faced a 100 percent loss .
" if their field is under water , the crops are ruined and will not bring any proceeds , " he said .
" but across the board , it 's somewhat relative , so i would n't say it is a general trend . "
the farmers ' association is therefore reserved in what steps to take next .
the spokesman would not confirm whether dbv will ask for financial support from the federal government .
" we do n't want to overreact , " the spokesman said .
" we first have to determine what action is even necessary and it 's just too early to do so .

the pre-trial hearing of the man accused of murdering dutch politician pim fortuyn got underway on friday in amsterdam .
the evidence against animal-rights activist volkert van der graaf is overwhelming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steijn franken , the lawyer defending the 33-year-old environmental activist volkert van der graaf , is not going to have an easy time of it . his client was arrested minutes after the may 6 murder of pim fortuyn -lrb- photo -rrb- carrying a loaded gun speckled with the politician ’ s blood .

police with sniffer dogs patrolled the amsterdam district court building as television cameras beamed the proceedings live to the nation which has been gripped by the event . defender franken said he was deeply concerned about the blinding media spotlight shining on the case .
he complained that his client is being treated by the police and the media as if he were already convicted . “ nobody seems to doubt anymore than volkert committed the murder of pim fortuyn , ” he said .
“ volkert , like anyone else , is not guilty until proven guilty . ” van der graaf has refused to give a statement to investigators .

unseasonably heavy rains have wreaked havoc across much of europe this summer , ruining many people 's holiday plans .
but europe 's farmers have also been caught in the downpour , and are facing a disastrous harvest . the bad weather hitting europe has taken a toll not only on the businesses that profit from tourism , but also on farmers - especially those in germany and italy .
farmers in northeastern italy are bracing for more rains after the worst hailstorm in recent memory ravaged wine grapes , tobacco crops and olive groves .
meanwhile , their counterparts around rome have lost their entire crop of peaches .
german farmers are also left facing fields under water and a wet harvest .
according to the german farmers ' association dbv , though , it 's still too early to estimate the extent of the damage .
" we can only say that when we see what could be harvested after all and what crops could be sold , " a dbv spokesman told dw-world .
higher costs the storms have particularly hit grain farms in the southern state of bavaria .
but lower saxony , schleswig-holstein and mecklenburg-western pomerania have also taken losses , mainly in fruit - such as apple orchards - and vegetables .
wolfgang arens of the farmers ' association of lower saxony estimates the damage for that region alone to total more than 100 million euro -lrb- $ 97.7 million -rrb- .
farmers faced higher costs for cleaning and drying those grains they could harvest , arens told reporters .
" as it is , 30 percent of our wheat intended for the bread market can only be sold as animal feed now . "
his counterpart in mecklenburg-western pomerania , torsten weidmann , reports that many farmers ca n't even set foot onto their fields .
" at the beginning of august , we saw more rain in one day than we did in an entire month on average , " he says .
weidmann expects the state 's grain farmers to post 20 to 30 percent less proceeds than in the previous year .
not " an existential threat " " it is certainly a severe burden for farmers in the affected regions , " the dbv spokesman said .
but , he added , it did not involve " an existential threat " .
very few farms based their output solely on grains , but also diversified with livestock or vegetables , for example .
" of course , it 's a burden when they ca n't harvest their fields , but hardly any farmer will go bankrupt because of it , " he said .
often , stocks from previous years when there was a good harvest have been put aside to compensate for such a situation .
the spokesman pointed out that farmers do not just plan on an annual basis .
" they know how dependent their livelihood is on the weather and calculate this risk . "
for this reason , most german farms offer mixed agriculture and livestock , so they can generally cope with a situation such as this year 's summer storms , he added .
no need to overreact the association spokesman admitted that there were individual cases in austria and bavaria , where farmers faced a 100 percent loss .
" if their field is under water , the crops are ruined and will not bring any proceeds , " he said .
" but across the board , it 's somewhat relative , so i would n't say it is a general trend . "
the farmers ' association is therefore reserved in what steps to take next .
the spokesman would not confirm whether dbv will ask for financial support from the federal government .
" we do n't want to overreact , " the spokesman said .

from this morning , police will be able to issue on the spot fines in three experimental areas .
the new police powers are meant to work like parking tickets .
they 're part of a crack down on anti-social behaviour , such as being drunk and disorderly .
will on the spot fines work ?
or do they put too much power in the hands of the bobbies on the beat ?
click here to e-mail us with your views we talked to the police , civil liberties groups and a restaurateur , who 's at the sharp end of public order offences .
" the sort of offences we 'll be looking at range from being drunk and disorderly to wasting police time and abusive or threatening behaviour , " chief inspector james andranov told breakfast .
the police in the west midlands , where one of the pilot schemes will run , are hoping that fixed fines will be used for offences at the more minor end of the scale .
they envisage arresting suspects who are causing trouble and issuing fixed penalty fines when they 're in custody , to avoid the paperwork involved in taking minor offenders to court .
but the proposals are causing alarm among civil liberties campaigners .
" i think it 's a real concern to give the police the ability to be judge and jury in these cases , " mark littlewood from liberty told us .
he predicts particular problems with ethnic minority offenders .
but , the new plans were welcomed by restaurateur dalawar chaudhury : " when we have problems , the police come and discipline someone and send them away .
" then they repeat the offence time after time .. this is probably the only deterrent , if it hurts in their pocket . "
details officers will be able to issue £ 40 and £ 80 fixed penalties for offences such as using threatening behaviour , being drunk and disorderly and making hoax 999 calls .
the scheme will apply in the west midlands , essex and croydon in south london .
north wales will begin the pilot in september if the one-year trials are successful , it could be rolled out nationwide .
it is part of the government 's drive to get tough on crime but critics say it will be impossible to use effectively .
clogged courts offenders will be able to pay the fines by post .
if they deny the charge , they can elect to go to court for a full trial .
the move is designed to stop police cells and the courts being clogged with petty offenders who receive only a " slap on the wrist " from magistrates . "
it 's hardly likely to produce a compliant response " simon hughes liberal democrats however there are concerns among some rank-and-file officers that fining people on the street will lead to confrontation .
they are also worried that offenders without identification will simply give a false name and address .
liberal democrat home affairs spokesman simon hughes said the fines would not work in the " real world " .
" there 's all the difference in the world between having a ticket for parking on a yellow line - objective , no argument - and going up to somebody on a friday night and saying ' you are causing nuisance behaviour ' .
" that 's very subjective and hardly likely to produce a compliant response . "
hoax calls the kinds of offences which will be covered with a £ 40 fine are : being drunk and disorderly or drunk in the highway throwing stones at trains , trespassing on a railway throwing fireworks drinking in a restricted area wilful obstruction of the highway buying alcohol for children fines of £ 80 will apply to offenders who use threatening behaviour or words causing alarm or distress , waste police time or make hoax emergency calls . "
it will provide police with an additional tool to tackle nuisance crimes " home office the association of chief police officers and the pilot police forces have strongly backed the plan , according to the home office .
a home office spokeswoman said the fines would give police " greater flexibility " to tackle low-level crime " swiftly and simply " .
" it will provide police with an additional tool to tackle nuisance crimes and intimidating behaviour which blights the lives of so many people , " she said .
" it will reduce the amount of police time spent on paperwork and courts ' time in dealing with prosecutions and yet provides a punishment for the offender . "

president of the farmers union of wales bob parry has claimed that , despite the uk government 's partial relaxation of the 20-day standstill rule on livestock movements , the industry is still unable to make a full recovery . "
maintaining the standstill rule will drive cash-strapped farmers and auctioneers out of business " fuw leader bob parry the last confirmed outbreak of the disease in wales was on a farm at llangenny , near crickhowell , on 12 august , 2001 .
in all , there were 118 confirmed cases in wales - 78 in powys , 20 in monmouthshire , 13 on anglesey , three around newport , two at caerphilly , and one each in neath / port talbot and rhondda cynon taff .
mr parry said even though rules governing movement of stock had been relaxed , the restrictions remained a major obstacle to the industry 's efforts to get back to normal .
" 2001 will undoubtedly go down as the worst year in farming , but it is now being compounded by the government 's intransigence over the 20-day standstill rule , " mr parry said .
" maintaining the 20-day standstill rule will drive cash-strapped farmers and auctioneers out of business . "
the 20-day rule - freezing livestock movements on a farm for three weeks when a new animal is brought in - has been partially relaxed .
now , breeding animals will be exempt from the rules .
farmers had hoped for a full relaxation of the regulations ahead of the busy autumn livestock season .
mr parry said farming families struggled throughout 2001 with average farm incomes hovering just above £ 4,000 a year .
they also witnessed the wholesale slaughter of millions of animals as the authorities attempted to halt the spread of the disease .
slaughtered there were 2,030 confirmed outbreaks of the disease in the uk between 20 february and 30 september last year .
an estimated 6.1m animals were slaughtered - around 4.1m for disease control and 2m for animal welfare reasons .
in wales 335,184 animals were slaughtered - 294,130 sheep , 34,992 cattle , 5,941 pigs and 121 goats .
direct losses for uk agriculture and rural tourism were estimated to be between £ 2.2 and £ 2.5bn , but mr parry said he believed indirect costs pushed that figure up to £ 8bn .
" lessons still need to be learned from the mistakes that occurred during 2001 , and it is scandalous that the government refused to hold a full and open public inquiry , " he said .
" the three government inquiries carried out virtually behind closed doors did not go far enough .
" what was the point of an inquiry if it did n't have the legal powers to force key witnesses to give evidence ?
" i believe a full public inquiry would have been the only realistic way of getting at the truth , however difficult or embarrassing for individuals that truth may have been . "
mr parry said farmers had concluded that following the crisis , the welsh assembly should handle any future crisis in wales - not whitehall officials .
" the way forward for farming in wales is to have the assembly deal exclusively with the industry , " he said .

members of the llanmiloe community association in carmarthenshire have pledged their support for a proposed £ 4.5m ragworm farm .
we do n't want to become a retirement or tourist village - we want a prosperous community with jobs villager wendy wright members of carmarthenshire council have discussed the application for a 300-pond development on marshy land near the coastal area of pendine .
if the plans - recommended for approval by council officers - are given the go-ahead , as many as 150 jobs could be created .
the association has organised a petition backing the development and has planned a public meeting for monday night to rally further support .
the moves are a counter-attack to reservations raised by conservationists who fear there could be a detrimental impact on the environment .
the final decision will be made at county hall some fear the project could increase pollution and reduce the natural habitat for protected species in the area .
dragon baits limited , based in port talbot , south wales , wants to create ponds to rear ragworms at a 160-acre site near military ranges .
but opposers claimed the area - adjacent to a site of special scientific interest -lrb- sssi -rrb- - would be adversely affected by the scheme .
they said they feared the ponds could pollute beaches in pendine and the estuary , affecting cockle beds in carmarthen bay .
live bait the land adjoins an old weapons testing range , which once employed about 800 people until the 1960s .
the company behind the scheme has already developed an aquaculture enterprise at baglan to supply the fishing industry with live bait .
ragworms are used as bait by millions of sea anglers .
they also provide a highly nutritious feed used for fish and shrimp brood stocks in aquaculture .
shrimp and prawns the company believes the baglan site offers limited scope for expansion .
the proposed facility at pendine would be to rear young ragworms on a far greater scale - allowing the firm to expand into the shrimp and prawn feed sector .
councillors on the planning committee have been recommended to approve the scheme despite objections from a number of groups .
the royal society for protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- , the countryside council for wales and local community councils have raised concerns over the plans .
but wendy wright , secretary of the group of residents supporting the plan , said most people welcomed the prospect of a new industry and the jobs it would bring .
" at the moment , our children have to leave the area to find work , " she said .
" we do n't want to become a retirement or tourist village - we want a prosperous community with jobs that will ensure a future for our children to live and work in the community they were born into . "
ms wright described many of those who objected to the plans as " incomers who have bought or built retirement and holiday homes " in the area .
she added : " they can not be allowed to dictate the future of our children . "

a wristwatch containing miniature global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- technology has just gone on sale .
the gps personal locator developed by silicon valley company wherify wireless uses advances in satellite tracking and wireless technologies to allow parents to find their child within a minute .
the hope is that a device like this one could act as either a deterrent to potential kidnappers , or at least aid police investigating a missing child case .
panic button the gps personal locator allows parents to track a child 's location and movements via the internet .
" let 's say you have a seven-year-old who walks to school alone and they felt in danger .
they could push one button on the watch and lock the device , " said wherify president timothy neher .
the watch is designed to appeal to children " it will enable a consumer to locate this device , initially in the us , within 60 seconds or less , " he told the bbc programme go digital .
designed around a wristwatch , the locator has a built-in pager and panic button for alerting the police .
the device uses the same gps technology that helps lost drivers or sailors find their way .
' cool factor ' the device is aimed at children between the ages of four and 12 .
" kids think this watch is cool , " said mr neher .
" it 's their first communication device , it 's a watch , it 's a pager , its a locator .
there 's a cool factor from what we are hearing from the children . "
i do n't think we are selling the fear , i think we are giving parents peace of mind timothy neher , wherify wireless parents can use the internet or phone to quickly identify their children 's location within feet in about a minute .
they are also able to constantly track a child 24 hours a day either by logging onto a computer and viewing aerial maps , or by calling wherify 's location centre .
" if i had my five-year-old in downtown new york city at christmas time , i want to just lock this on them and then when we are done shopping take it off , " said mr neher .
in the us , a child is reported missing every 42 seconds , according to official statistics .
but mr neher denied his company are trading on parents ' fears .
" i do n't think we are selling the fear , i think we are giving parents peace of mind , " he said .
innovative uses all this technology does not come cheap .
wherify 's gps personal locator for children has just gone on sale at a price of us $ 399.99 , plus a monthly service charge of $ 25 .
device aimed at children between four and 12 it is currently only available in the us although the company are developing a gsm model which could be used in the uk .
originally gps receiver modules were large and bulky .
but today the modules can be as small as a thumbnail .

a wristwatch containing miniature global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- technology has just gone on sale .
the gps personal locator developed by silicon valley company wherify wireless uses advances in satellite tracking and wireless technologies to allow parents to find their child within a minute .
the hope is that a device like this one could act as either a deterrent to potential kidnappers , or at least aid police investigating a missing child case .
panic button the gps personal locator allows parents to track a child 's location and movements via the internet .
" let 's say you have a seven-year-old who walks to school alone and they felt in danger .
they could push one button on the watch and lock the device , " said wherify president timothy neher .
" it will enable a consumer to locate this device , initially in the us , within 60 seconds or less , " he told the bbc programme go digital .
designed around a wristwatch , the locator has a built-in pager and panic button for alerting the police .
the device uses the same gps technology that helps lost drivers or sailors find their way .
' cool factor ' the device is aimed at children between the ages of four and 12 .
" kids think this watch is cool , " said mr neher .
" it 's their first communication device , it 's a watch , it 's a pager , its a locator .
there 's a cool factor from what we are hearing from the children . "
" i do n't think we are selling the fear , i think we are giving parents peace of mind " timothy neher , wherify wireless parents can use the internet or phone to quickly identify their children 's location within feet in about a minute .
they are also able to constantly track a child 24 hours a day either by logging onto a computer and viewing aerial maps , or by calling wherify 's location centre .
" if i had my five-year-old in downtown new york city at christmas time , i want to just lock this on them and then when we are done shopping take it off , " said mr neher .
in the us , a child is reported missing every 42 seconds , according to official statistics .
but mr neher denied his company are trading on parents ' fears .
" i do n't think we are selling the fear , i think we are giving parents peace of mind , " he said .
innovative uses all this technology does not come cheap .
wherify 's gps personal locator for children has just gone on sale at a price of us $ 399.99 , plus a monthly service charge of $ 25 .
it is currently only available in the us although the company are developing a gsm model which could be used in the uk .
originally gps receiver modules were large and bulky .
but today the modules can be as small as a thumbnail .
as gps units shrink in size , more innovative uses of the technology will develop , say experts .
golf courses are already outfitting carts with gps to help players measure distances between shots , car manufacturers are offering in-dash navigation and farmers are using the technology for precision mapping of crop yields .

the event had been hit by the foot-and-mouth crisis last year along with problems over funding , but the 19th annual festival attracted top name performers and large audiences .
festival organiser andy eagle said he was convinced that the festival had maintained its reputation as one of the foremost jazz events in the world .
" we have attracted some of the best performers this year , such as mccoy tyner , antonio forcione and richard bona , who was making his only uk appearance here at the festival , " he said .
it is estimated more than 50,000 people visited the market town during the festival .
police reported no major disorder problems in the mid wales town , following incidents in recent years , with 46 arrests .
the international-renowned chicago-based blues guitarist , buddy guy , kicked off the event on thursday night with a packed performance in the usk marquee .
other highlights at brecon included performances from courtney pine , scott hamilton and the mingus big band .
welsh assembly first minister rhodri morgan , a keen jazz fan , performed the opening honours at captain 's walk bandstand off the town 's main square at 1830 bst on friday .
in addition to concerts by more modern artists , the festival also provides an opportunity for traditional jazz lovers to see a variety of impromptu street performances .
festival chairman jill body said : " we believe we have something to suit every taste . "
the jazz event costs £ 450,000 to stage , but ticket sales raise just over half of that .
the remainder of its income is made through souvenir sales during the festival 's four days .
the festival was one of very few events in mid wales that carried on last year despite severe restrictions as a result of the foot-and-mouth outbreak .
it brings an estimated £ 1m to the area 's economy , which is the equivalent of 23 full-time jobs .
in 2001 , organisers signed a three-year sponsorship deal with bbc giving the corporation exclusive rights to transmit tv and radio coverage of the festival .
last year , it opened a day earlier than usual to host a performance by irish rock star van morrison .
for jazz lovers who come from all over the world , it is becoming one of the most important dates in their diary .

diageo might export its brands to norway via third parties the firm , the world 's largest spirits company , has been handed a six month ban over promoting an alcopop in breach of norwegian law .
but norwegian quaffers of diageo drinks such j & b whisky , smirnoff vodka and baileys will still be able to enjoy their favourite tipple in the run-up to christmas .
with diageo itself , rather than its products , banned , the firm believes it will be able to maintain trade by selling to norway via third parties .
the firm 's guinness stout is already sold to norway through this means .
gate crashers the ban followed a series of trade events where diageo 's smirnoff black ice alcopop was promoted to trade officials .
while trade promotions are legal , events which give access to the general public are not .
diageo 's problem was that people other than industry officials managed to get in to the events .
the fact that outsiders got hold of free promotion material and were allowed to party away at the events made the promotions illegal .
in norway , spirits , wines and strong beers can only be bought in the vinmonopolet , or wine monopoly , state owned specialist outlets . watch / listen on this story norwegian health official gunnellin beorneboo " it 's prohibited to advertise for alcohol " see also : 08 aug 02 -pipe- business norway to rule on board room girl power 24 jul 02 -pipe- scotland drinks firm backs euro 2008 bid 21 feb 02 -pipe- business diageo drinks sales soar internet links : diageo vinmonopolet the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top business stories now : hacker breaches credit card security job losses escalate at reuters new sec chief pledges tough line oil prices push higher rwanda denies drc plundering overseas sales drive wal-mart congo 's finance minister resigns blair keeps euro options open links to more business stories are at the foot of the page .

thirteen-year-old alamdar baktiari and his brother montazar , 12 , applied to the family court in adelaide to be released from the woomera detention centre and allowed to live with their father . "
i would not want these boys to suffer any more than they need to " justice rodney burr the two attracted worldwide attention when they walked into the british consulate-general in melbourne asking for asylum last month after being part of a mass break-out from the controversial camp in the south australia desert .
they were rejected and sent back to woomera hours before their father - who reached australia separately and was given a temporary protection visa - arrived to see them .
their father , ali baktiari , is now supporting their application to live with him in sydney while all their claims for refugee status are processed .
he was present in the court in adelaide as family court justice rodney burr described a psychologist 's report on the health of the two boys as " disturbing " .
mr justice burr told the court : " the factual circumstances of the matter are disturbing as to the evidence presented .
" on the information before the court it is alarming and i would personally consider the matter an urgent one .
" i would not want these boys to suffer any more than they need to . "
' no threat ' the baktiari family claims to be from the hazara minority in afghanistan which was persecuted under taleban rule .
but the australian government has said it has evidence that the family is from pakistan .
it added that if the family were hazaras , they were no longer under threat from the taleban which has been ousted from power in afghanistan .
the lawyer representing immigration minister philip ruddock , geoffrey kennett , argued the family court did not have the power to determine whether or not the boys should be released .
the judge agreed that the issue of the court 's powers in the case had to be resolved but he said the case was so urgent that he wanted to be able to consider both issues at a single hearing .

friday 16 august , 1400 local time -lrb- 1200gmt -rrb- good afternoon .
well , as expected yesterday was scare tactics .
nothing happened , no visits .
information received this morning that a few big shots arrived yesterday and told the settlers they had better not disturb me .
i have just had a phone call from the officer in charge , concession police station , and he his coming to see me .
will keep you posted .
thursday 15 august , 2200 local time -lrb- 2000gmt -rrb- good evening , a bit late , as i had to go and collect my papers in harare today , that is my notice of withdrawal from the courts which means that i am legally allowed to stay on my farm and farm it , but who gets the settlers off is the big question ?
a bit of a scare this morning , i received information that the settlers were going to come and try and evict me today and was advised to stay in harare , but returned at 4.30 pm .
all quiet .
my staff left the security fence at 5.30 pm and i have been waiting , but nothing .
i think this is their scare tactics , but am a bit concerned after what i hear happened in bindura which is not far , only about 50 km away .
i do n't know what is going to happen , that is the worst part , i am getting a bit despondent at this stage and think that we are wasting our time .
just wish we could be paid out and start again .
well am going to try and get to bed .
speak to you to-morrow wednesday 14 august , 2130 local time -lrb- 1930gmt -rrb- i have just received a phone call from lawyers in harare stating that we won our case today .
this means that i am legally allowed to occupy my farm and allowed to farm .
ludicrous that i have to go to court to get permission to occupy my own farm .
the problem is that i will probably receive another section 5 and 8 -lrb- eviction orders -rrb- .
but that will now give another four and half months , but it is just a delaying tactic and the settlers are not prepared to listen to this as they state they are the law .
tomorrow i will pick up the necessary documentation and deliver it to the police and da -lrb- district administrator -rrb- and see what difference it makes .
wednesday 14 august , 1430 local time -lrb- 1230gmt -rrb- good afternoon , went to the da -lrb- district administrator -rrb- this morning for my meeting and gave him my letter explaining why i had not left my farm .
nothing done about it , he accepted it but i fear he has to take it higher up , he can not make a decision .
so we wait in anticipation to see what is the next development .
otherwise all quite on my farm , i hope it remains this way .
tuesday 13 august , 1000 local time -lrb- 0900gmt -rrb- good morning , well no good news on the speech except that the president did say that no farmer will go without land and one farmer one farm , so i look forward to my meeting tomorrow with the district administrator .
i do n't know if we are going to have trouble today or not .
one thing i would like to say , is that while commercial farmers are said to have the best land , it is because we treat our land with agriculture lime regularly and keep our ph 's up to the recommended rate and not just grow crop year after year , hence my rotation crop of katambora grass and tobacco .
when the settlers came here in april 2001 , the first thing they did was to burn all the land including katambora grass that was due for reaping and worth many thousands of us $ .
consequently , they reaped no crops off my farm this last year and we received 24 inches of rain and my dams were full by november and are still full now .
you can not farm without fertiliser !
monday 12 august , 0900 local time -lrb- 0700gmt -rrb- good morning , a peaceful night no problems .
we are waiting in anticipation for the president 's speech this morning and hope that we are not going to have a repeat of last year .
i am still adamant if they want my farm , i must be paid compensation before i move .
speak to you later .
sunday 11 aug , 1000 local time well sunday morning , all nice and peaceful , except that my borehole motor was stolen yesterday , which is worth about 150,000 zimbabwe dollars -lrb- us $ 2,800 -rrb- .
i understand the settlers were involved , which means that insurance wo n't pay out .
this just adds to my trouble as i will not have any water now .
i have reported the theft to the police , but doubt anything will come of it .
i have just had a visit from the district administrator who asked why i was still in my house .
i told him i had no house to go to and that i had no money for rent .
i also said i had a letter from my lawyer stating that all the section 8s -lrb- eviction orders -rrb- were null and void , and also that i only had one very small farm .
he instructed me to put it in writing and deliver it to him as soon as possible .
a very amicable meeting .
things are looking up .
will speak to you later .
saturday 10 aug , 1300 local time i was called to a meeting by the settlers at my farm at midday .
the meeting discussed an incident on tuesday night and the letter that i wrote to them about damage to my vehicle .
they wanted a list that i had received in regards to the settlers on my farm .
then a zanu-pf vehicle arrived with approximately six people .
they told me that i had no right to address a meeting and was not meant to be there .
they told to me to go and get the list and not come back .
i have given them the list of names and my statement to the police as i do n't think they are aware of what happened on tuesday night .
at the moment i am staying in my house and have locked the security gates and have the keys .
the meeting is going on at the moment .
i am expecting some journalists but i do n't think it will be a good idea if they arrive .
hope to speak to you later .
friday 9 aug , 1930 local time i delivered my letter from my lawyers to the member in charge at concession police station .
he accepted it and stated that many farmers had given him these letters .
whether this means that we wo n't be visited i do n't know .
we will have to wait and see .
i went to see the lawyers of zanu-pf this afternoon to get a form to see what it was about .
no lawyer was available to see me and all forms had run out .
the secretary phoned the lawyer and asked whether i had a section 8 -lrb- eviction order -rrb- .
i confirmed this .
she said that the lawyers had met with the lands commission and vice president joseph msika .
she told me to come back on wednesday .
i asked what about my being arrested tomorrow .
she just repeated : " come back on wednesday . "
interesting situation , we will have to wait and see .
the police came to my farm and saw the settlers and were informed they were have having a meeting tomorrow .
no arrests have been made as of yet .
i informed the police i was prepared to drop all charges if the settlers were instructed by the police to leave me alone and not hassle me and let the law take its course .
am going to stay in my house and watch the cricket -lrb- if it stops raining -rrb- and the all blacks being beaten by south africa on saturday .
friday 9 aug , 1200 local time still quiet .
i 'm just going to take the court order declaring my eviction null and void to the local police station .
let 's see what they have to say ...
friday 9 aug , 0020 local time as of now we are over the deadline by 20 mins ! ! !
all things are quiet .
no army or police have been seen . "
i am not prepared to walk away and leave what i have worked 38 years for " i received my court order this afternoon stating that my section 8 -lrb- eviction order -rrb- was null and void .
so i have that and will hand it to any officials who come and see me tomorrow .
as far as i am concerned i am the legal occupier of my farm as the court says , but whether the people on the ground will accept this we will have to see .
if the police come , i will show them the court order .
but if they arrest me and put me in jail , i will go .
have heard of a meeting this afternoon by lawyers of the ruling party , zanu-pf , who have made some offer to farmers at the 11th hour .
i will be picking up one of these forms tomorrow and taking it to my lawyers to find out what it is about .
i had a meeting with the officer in charge at concession police station this morning and handed my statement and was under the impression that the settlers that attacked me on tuesday night were going to be arrested , but so far no one has been arrested .
thursday 8 aug , 1700 local time we are expecting a lot of trouble this weekend .
it 's a holiday weekend - four days .
i am feeling nervous but there is nothing else i can do .
if the government paid compensation , i would take the money and go .
but right now , i have no money to go anywhere .
my wife has gone to stay with my daughter in england and will be there for three months .
i insisted that she go as it would be stupid for us both to be in trouble .
i was born in zimbabwe on 11 november 1944 and have been farming since 1964 .
in 1981 i bought a small dairy farm in chipinge .
in 1985 i bought glendevon farm in concession .
it is a tobacco farm and since i had always farmed tobacco , i was very pleased about buying it .
it had belonged to my father-in-law , who bought it as a virgin farm in 1948 and built it up from nothing .
he did not inherit or steal it , he bought it .
i bought it from him after it was valued at $ 160,000 , which i raised by selling my chipinge farm .
i repeat - i did not inherit it .
i have a sale sheet to prove it .
my wife was born on this farm in 1950 .
her great-grandfather was a pioneer to this country in 1896 , so my grandchildren are 6th-generation zimbabweans .
change our only problem is that we are white .
three generations of my family are buried in my garden .
in the 1999/2000 season , my farm produced 153,400 kg of tobacco and 720 tonnes of maize and grossed around us $ 350,000 .
i am not prepared to walk away and leave what i have worked 38 years for .
on 27 april 2001 , i received my first section 5 which notified me that my farm was listed and was being acquired by government .
i appealed to the courts because the government says it will acquire farms whose owners have several properties , are absentee landlords or foreigners , which are not productive , or which are next to communal areas .
on 29 june 2001 , i received my 2nd section 5 .
i objected on the same grounds .
meanwhile in april , my farm was resettled and pegged and approximately 35 families moved on and took all the land .
i was stopped farming .
i now have around 160 squatters on my farm .
the farm has not produced any crops whatsoever except for about 2,000 kg of tobacco .
to produce this , they pinched my gum trees and used my barns and my electricity to cure it .
we have not received any income since may / june 2001 .
but we are refusing to leave with nothing .
on 5 july 2002 i received my section 7 order -lrb- giving 45 days to vacate the property -rrb- .
again , i have appealed and it is currently with the courts .
threats on 6 august 2002 , i was returning to my farm at 2115. and was confronted by about 70 persons who i have established were settlers from my farm .
they had put a log over the road by my security gate in front of my house .
when i stopped , they advanced towards me and were all armed with axes , sticks and iron rods .
they did not say anything but as i reversed to get away , they started hurtling rocks , axes and pieces of metal at my truck .
if i had stopped i would most certainly have been killed .
i feared for my life and managed to get to the police station .
two hours later , the police came back with me to my farm and i managed to get into my house and the police defused the situation .
i was warned by the settlers in front of the police that i would be in serious trouble if i did not leave my house by 10 august .
no one has been arrested for the crime .

thirteen-year-old alamdar baktiari and his brother montazar , 12 , applied to the family court in adelaide to be released from the woomera detention centre and allowed to live with their father .
i would not want these boys to suffer any more than they need to justice rodney burr the two attracted worldwide attention when they walked into the british consulate-general in melbourne asking for asylum last month after being part of a mass break-out from the controversial camp in the south australia desert .
they were rejected and sent back to woomera hours before their father - who reached australia separately and was given a temporary protection visa - arrived to see them .
their father , ali baktiari , is now supporting their application to live with him in sydney while all their claims for refugee status are processed .
he was present in the court in adelaide as family court justice rodney burr described a psychologist 's report on the health of the two boys as " disturbing " .
mr justice burr told the court : " the factual circumstances of the matter are disturbing as to the evidence presented .
" on the information before the court it is alarming and i would personally consider the matter an urgent one .
" i would not want these boys to suffer any more than they need to . "
' no threat ' the baktiari family claims to be from the hazara minority in afghanistan which was persecuted under taleban rule .
but the australian government has said it has evidence that the family is from pakistan .
it added that if the family were hazaras , they were no longer under threat from the taleban which has been ousted from power in afghanistan .
the lawyer representing immigration minister philip ruddock , geoffrey kennett , argued the family court did not have the power to determine whether or not the boys should be released .
the judge agreed that the issue of the court 's powers in the case had to be resolved but he said the case was so urgent that he wanted to be able to consider both issues at a single hearing .

friday 16 august , 1400 local time -lrb- 1200gmt -rrb- good afternoon .
well , as expected yesterday was scare tactics .
nothing happened , no visits .
information received this morning that a few big shots arrived yesterday and told the settlers they had better not disturb me .
i have just had a phone call from the officer in charge , concession police station , and he his coming to see me .
will keep you posted .
thursday 15 august , 2200 local time -lrb- 2000gmt -rrb- good evening , a bit late , as i had to go and collect my papers in harare today , that is my notice of withdrawal from the courts which means that i am legally allowed to stay on my farm and farm it , but who gets the settlers off is the big question ?
a bit of a scare this morning , i received information that the settlers were going to come and try and evict me today and was advised to stay in harare , but returned at 4.30 pm .
land reform is mugabe 's main policy all quiet .
my staff left the security fence at 5.30 pm and i have been waiting , but nothing .
i think this is their scare tactics , but am a bit concerned after what i hear happened in bindura which is not far , only about 50 km away .
i do n't know what is going to happen , that is the worst part , i am getting a bit despondent at this stage and think that we are wasting our time .
just wish we could be paid out and start again .
well am going to try and get to bed .
speak to you to-morrow wednesday 14 august , 2130 local time -lrb- 1930gmt -rrb- i have just received a phone call from lawyers in harare stating that we won our case today .
this means that i am legally allowed to occupy my farm and allowed to farm .
ludicrous that i have to go to court to get permission to occupy my own farm .
the problem is that i will probably receive another section 5 and 8 -lrb- eviction orders -rrb- .
but that will now give another four and half months , but it is just a delaying tactic and the settlers are not prepared to listen to this as they state they are the law .
tomorrow i will pick up the necessary documentation and deliver it to the police and da -lrb- district administrator -rrb- and see what difference it makes .
wednesday 14 august , 1430 local time -lrb- 1230gmt -rrb- good afternoon , went to the da -lrb- district administrator -rrb- this morning for my meeting and gave him my letter explaining why i had not left my farm .
nothing done about it , he accepted it but i fear he has to take it higher up , he can not make a decision .
so we wait in anticipation to see what is the next development .
otherwise all quite on my farm , i hope it remains this way .
tuesday 13 august , 1000 local time -lrb- 0900gmt -rrb- good morning , well no good news on the speech except that the president did say that no farmer will go without land and one farmer one farm , so i look forward to my meeting tomorrow with the district administrator .
i do n't know if we are going to have trouble today or not .
one thing i would like to say , is that while commercial farmers are said to have the best land , it is because we treat our land with agriculture lime regularly and keep our ph 's up to the recommended rate and not just grow crop year after year , hence my rotation crop of katambora grass and tobacco .
when the settlers came here in april 2001 , the first thing they did was to burn all the land including katambora grass that was due for reaping and worth many thousands of us $ .
consequently , they reaped no crops off my farm this last year and we received 24 inches of rain and my dams were full by november and are still full now .
you can not farm without fertiliser !
monday 12 august , 0900 local time -lrb- 0700gmt -rrb- good morning , a peaceful night no problems .
we are waiting in anticipation for the president 's speech this morning and hope that we are not going to have a repeat of last year .
i am still adamant if they want my farm , i must be paid compensation before i move .
speak to you later .
sunday 11 aug , 1000 local time well sunday morning , all nice and peaceful , except that my borehole motor was stolen yesterday , which is worth about 150,000 zimbabwe dollars -lrb- us $ 2,800 -rrb- .
i understand the settlers were involved , which means that insurance wo n't pay out .
this just adds to my trouble as i will not have any water now .
i have reported the theft to the police , but doubt anything will come of it .
i have just had a visit from the district administrator who asked why i was still in my house .
i told him i had no house to go to and that i had no money for rent .
i also said i had a letter from my lawyer stating that all the section 8s -lrb- eviction orders -rrb- were null and void , and also that i only had one very small farm .
he instructed me to put it in writing and deliver it to him as soon as possible .
a very amicable meeting .
things are looking up .
will speak to you later .

i have given them the list of names and my statement to the police as i do n't think they are aware of what happened on tuesday night .
at the moment i am staying in my house and have locked the security gates and have the keys .
the meeting is going on at the moment .
i am expecting some journalists but i do n't think it will be a good idea if they arrive .
hope to speak to you later .
friday 9 aug , 1930 local time i delivered my letter from my lawyers to the member in charge at concession police station .
he accepted it and stated that many farmers had given him these letters .
whether this means that we wo n't be visited i do n't know .
we will have to wait and see .
i went to see the lawyers of zanu-pf this afternoon to get a form to see what it was about .
no lawyer was available to see me and all forms had run out .
zanu-pf supporters arrived at a meeting at mr shand 's farm the secretary phoned the lawyer and asked whether i had a section 8 -lrb- eviction order -rrb- .
i confirmed this .

the mobile graceland tour will give visitors the chance to see elvis 's us army jacket , some of his stage outfits and a letter from president richard m nixon .
other highlights include costumes elvis wore in the film viva las vegas and a comb which he used in the 1950s to shape his famous hair .
the tour begins in memphis , tennessee , this week , before moving on to philadelphia , cleveland , chicago , st louis , las vegas , new orleans , atlantic city and reno , nevada .
" we have more artefacts than we have the space or time to display at graceland , " said jennifer burgess , director of marketing for elvis presley enterprises .
" it grew out of the desire to share the elvis experience with all those people who ca n't make it to memphis for one reason or another . "
graceland attracts more than 650,000 visitors a year .
meanwhile , organisers of elvis week said they expect up to 75,000 devotees to gather in memphis to pay tribute .
many are expected to appear at the graceland mansion , where the rock and roll star died on 16 august 1977 of a heart attack , aged 42 .
they will be able to file past his grave in the garden of his white-columned home on the outskirts of memphis .
the city will see nine days ' celebration of his life , beginning with a parade , videos of his performances , renditions of his music by impersonators and reminiscences by his friends .
sun studio , where presley recorded his first songs as a teenager , will hold a party in the street in his honour .
his former wife priscilla presley and daughter lisa marie are expected to attend a concert on friday .
the star has been hugely successful around the globe both before and after his death .
earlier this month priscilla presley unveiled plans to turn her romance with him into a musical .
presley recently topped the uk charts for a record 18th time with a version of his track a little less conversation .
the track , remixed by dutch dj junkie xl , was presley 's first number one single since way down , which hit the top shortly after his death in 1977 .
