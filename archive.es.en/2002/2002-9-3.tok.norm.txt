the company saw the tracks of some of its main lines near dresden get washed away , train stations flooded and the collapse of crucial bridges , including one on a high-speed rail line connecting northern and southern germany .
appearing at the chancellery in berlin on wednesday , deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn issued a preliminary estimate of over one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in flood damages .
" according to our cautious first estimates , we believe we have suffered revenue losses and damages of 1.025 billion euro , " mehdorn said .
he stressed that this would not be the final damage sum .
a laundry list of damages more than 400 kilometers of deutsche bahn tracks are currently unusable , and 94 bridges and 200 train stations have been badly damaged .
early estimates suggest that the service outages alone will lead to a 90 million euro -lrb- $ 88 million -rrb- drop in revenue from passenger and freight services .
mehdorn said it would take two and a half years before deutsche bahn service could return to its pre-flood level in the region .
the federal government has already agreed to provide deutsche bahn with 650 million euro -lrb- $ 638 million -rrb- to rebuild its network and repair damaged train stations .
more than half the money had already been earmarked for transportation infrastructure development projects in the eastern states that were formerly part of east germany .
deutsche bahn said its first reconstruction priorities would be lines in the leipzig-dresden-chemnitz triangle .
a line connecting dresden with prague will also be rebuilt as quickly as possible .
mehdorn said there are currently no plans to cancel any proposed deutsche bahn projects – including the planned transrapid train line between dortmund and düsseldorf .
new priorities , however , could lead to delays , he warned .
a job-saving deal as part of a four-point " immediate aid " program , the government also reached an agreement with deutsche bahn and the transnet union that the company would not lay off any employees between now and 2006 as a result of the flooding .
until this week 's agreement , talks between the employees ' union and bahn had reached an impasse .
mehdorn said deutsche bahn will reintroduce regular long-distance train service in the state of saxony-anhalt on thursday and is working on a plan to reintroduce long-distance trains in saxony as quickly as possible .
agricultural damage estimated at 267 million euro separately , german consumer protection and agricultural minister renate künast announced the government would release 141 million euro -lrb- $ 138 million -rrb- between now and the end of the year in immediate aid to farmers struck by the flooding .
künast said the government is estimating an initial 267 million euro -lrb- $ 262 million -rrb- in damages to farms .

11 : one year later fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany current affairs -pipe- 03.09.2002 terrorism fears a no show in german elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the american embassy in berlin after september 11 almost a year after the sept .
11 attacks , terrorism has vanished from the political agenda in germany .
experts say time and other issues have pushed the topic from voters ' minds . in the months following sept .
11 , germans couldn ’ t get enough tough talk on terrorism . the realization that the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon were most likely planned in hamburg , sent shockwaves through the country and , as a result , through the political establishment as well . the government was quick to react : interior minister otto schily prepared two “ security packages ” that expanded the reach and financing of germany ’ s law enforcement and got them past the legislature within a quick few months . germans rewarded their government ’ s tough talk on terrorism with high approval ratings and observers wondered at the speed and solidarity with which berlin was operating . now , just weeks before the attacks ’ anniversary , terrorism has all but escaped from the voters ’ minds , and , as a result , the political agenda .
in the midst of a hard-fought election campaign , germany ’ s recent floods , the high unemployment rate and slumping economy have grabbed the headlines , pushing aside concern over the spread of islamic fundamentalism and terror cells in the country . the reasons , say experts , have to do with both the time lapse since sept .
11 and the zero tolerance image chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has presented since then .
the speed with which the government moved to pass anti-terrorism measures and assure germans their country was safe was enough to allay fears relatively quickly , said jochen hippler , political scientist at the university of duisberg . quick enough to calm fears “ in a sense , the internal security situation , at least unofficially , has never been deemed so dangerous , “ said hippler .
“ it would have been different if the government had been more loose in its words and actions . ” there is also little difference in the way both schröder ’ s social democratic party and his challenger , edmund stoiber and his christian democratic and christian social union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- bloc , approach the anti-terrorism fight . the cdu / csu and spd look at foreign policy and domestic security in the same context .
the union bloc argues that instability on german soil is often connected to instablity caused by a country ’ s foreign policy .
the red-green coalition says that many of the union ’ s suggestions , such as increased cooperation between immigration and police authorities , have already been put into place . even schily ’ s challenger in the union bloc , hard-line bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , grudgingly admires the former green party member ’ s tough stance on domestic security .
“ schily and i went to the same school , ” beckstein has told reporters in the past . as a result , campaign managers on both sides , eager to play up differences between the cdu / csu and spd , have pushed more divisive issues further up the agenda . law enforcement wants terrorism back on the agenda the absence of terrorism in today ’ s political agenda has made it difficult for at least one interested bloc : the country ’ s law enforcement lobby .
since interest in domestic security died down , police lobbyist rüdiger holecek has had a difficult time bringing complaints of underfunding and staffing to the government ’ s attention . holecek , of the country ’ s police union , says that the government ’ s domestic security plan has overstretched an already overburdened police force .
more officers have been recruited into the country ’ s federal domestic security agency , the verfassungschutz , without enough money being left over for adequate replacements . “ we ’ re suffering as a result of this inattention , ” holecek told dw-world . the group , which represents the interests of more than 190 000 officers in germany , plans to call attention to itself during a press conference on sept .
11 .
at the conference the union will present a handbook on terrorist activity in germany .
holecek is hoping people will take notice . “ we want to prevent this topic from sinking out of view of the political , ” establishment , he said . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.09.2002 lots of touchés , but no clear winner in german debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both failed to score many goals in germany 's first televised chancellor debate there was no clear winner in germany 's first televised debate between chancellor candidates on sunday night .
but stoiber and schröder succeeded in piquing interest in what had until now been a sleepy election . going into sunday night 's debate against edmund stoiber , gerhard schröder already had a huge disadvantage – as the four-year chancellor of germany , he found himself in a defensive position .
it was a fundamental weakness that challenger stoiber , the premier of bavaria , put to his advantage in a series of forceful attacks against the chancellor covering the most important issues of the election , making the anticipated event feel like a political soccer match .
the most contentious exchanges revolved around spiraling unemployment , a stagnant economy , tax reforms , immigration and germany 's stance on a possible iraq invasion – all dominant issues in the media during the days and weeks leading up to the first debate .
the keyword of the night seemed to be " failure , " of which both candidates repeatedly accused the other of on each key issue .
the debate , which is being called a " duel " here , was broadcast by the private television stations rtl and sat.1.
schröder taken to task for soaring unemployment in one of the most aggressive salvos of the evening , stoiber blamed germany 's high unemployment level of over four million on the current red-green government , led by schröder 's social democrats and the greens .
he said schröder had failed in his promise to reduce unemployment levels to fewer than 3.5 million people .
he criticized schröder for his plan to delay a tax cut scheduled for 2003 in order to fund the rebuilding of communities ravaged this summer by the biggest floods in a hundred years .
he said the government made a " mistake " by instituting tax reforms that did nothing to help what he described as the " most important " part of the german economy : small- to middle-sized businesses .
" we ca n't forget that the center of gravity of our labor market is dependent on the ...
german market .
we have only a relatively small share of exports to america .
other countries , like england , france , sweden , finland and spain have the same international ties , but they do n't have the dramatically growing number of unemployed or such a weak economic growth rate . "
schröder conceded he was disappointed by germany 's unemployment rate , but fought back by saying it was the result of the global economic downturn and not a homemade problem as stoiber had suggested .
as for the delayed tax cut , he said , " i 'm convinced that the people of this country understand that today 's damage ca n't be compensated for with debts that our children and grandchildren will then have to pay . "
how full is the ship ?
addressing immigration , stoiber said he thought it was " wrong for germany to have a law that provides for more immigration . "
he said that every year germany takes in 500,000 to 600,000 new immigrants - the equivalent of cities like dortmund or nuremburg .
he said the new immigration law would increase that number by 100,000 to 150,000 .
" we are n't even finished assimilating the foreigner children who are already here .
we need to do a lot more .
for that reason we should n't increase immigration , " he said .
schröder defended his government 's new law , passed in march , saying it both limited immigration in areas where it is n't needed while at the same time opening doors for highly skilled workers who are needed in the technology sector .
while stoiber 's numbers were correct , he said , he had omitted the annual outflow of several hundred thousand – refugees of countries once torn by civil war , for example .
when you add those figures in , he said , the increase is more like 100,000 people .
stoiber : schröder 's iraq position " irresponsible " schröder also found himself on the defensive on the subject of a possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
recently , schröder has alluded that the u.s. was planning to engage in " military adventurism , " and said that germany would not participate , even under a united nations mandate .
on sunday night , however , schröder sought to draw a line between his stances on u.n. efforts to get weapons inspectors back inside baghdad and the u.s. ' desire to topple saddam hussein 's regime .
" in light of the situation in the middle east , and considering the fact that we have n't conquered the taliban and are far from having rebuilt afghanistan , a military intervention in iraq is wrong , and for that reason , under my leadership , germany will not help in that effort , " the chancellor said .
stoiber , meanwhile , called schröder 's public statements on the issue , and his stance , " irresponsible . "
he specifically criticized schröder for saying the country must go the " german way , " a phrase he said had historically charged connotations - at least in the ears of the international community .
he also said schröder 's public statements and policy reduced some of the international pressure on hussein .
" with saddam hussein , you have a war criminal as head of government , a head of state who possesses weapons of mass destruction and has even used them against his own people and those in neighboring iran .
we need to do everything we can , make every diplomatic effort , apply as much political pressure " as is needed to get un inspectors back inside iraq , stoiber said .
he said the chancellor should n't be ruling out every " theoretical option . "
stalemate so who won ?
the jury ca n't seem to make up its mind .
immediately after the debate , the editor in chief of the newsweekly " der spiegel , " stefan aust , said he " did n't get the impression he -lrb- schröder -rrb- was the media chancellor .

aust even accused him of putting his german television audience to sleep .
but polls taken of viewers sunday night were all over the board .
a forsa institute poll for sat.1 put schröder ahead .
another , by pollster wahlen for public broadcaster zdf had stoiber ahead by two points .
but another , by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard put schröder far ahead of his bavarian challenger .
in editorials published in the monday editions , many major regional newspapers shied away from declaring a victor .
the mass-circulation " bild " described german voters as the victors for even taking an interest in the debate .
the " berliner zeitung , " meanwhile , described it as a duel that had neither a conqueror nor someone who had been conquered .
indeed , if a television debate were analogous to soccer , you might say that stoiber controlled the ball for much of the game – e.g. he steered the issues and went in with the most attacks – but neither candidate , it seemed , scored many goals . and that 's too bad considering that in germany 's first ever television debate there was no provision for penalty shots . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery read everything you need to know about the politicians , parties and hot-button issues , along with a dummy 's guide to the german political system , as germans head for the polls for national elections on september 22 .

as far as actually financing the repair of the damages went , heated arguments and acrimonious debates were the order of the day .
opening the debate , german chancellor gerhard schröder said that the floods had caused the worst damage in germany since the second world war .

western countries are promoting “ public-private partnerships ” at the earth summit in johannesburg as a path to sustainable development .
environmentalists are skeptical , saying it puts big business before people . led by the united states , western countries showcased partnerships on thursday between governments , private industry and other groups as a practical way of furthering economic development and saving the environment . they say such partnerships are ways for business and governments to pool their resources and harness the funds and the know-how to accomplish more than either could on its own . un organizers say they have received 218 proposed partnerships , in areas ranging from health care to renewable energy projects that could go a long way in helping meet summit goals of halving global poverty by 2015 while slowing environmental degradation . congo project a multi-nation project to expand efforts to save forests in central africa ’ s congo basin was announced on thursday .
germany , the us , japan and indonesia are among the countries that want to provide an additional $ 53 million dollars over four years to a partnership between the paper industry active in the region and the local population .
the plan aims to develop protected forest areas and cut down on illegal logging . but many environmentalists are wary of relying on private business to save the planet .
they say partnerships may let companies cash in on providing essential services like water and electricity , while allowing governments to shirk their traditional responsibilities . “ if a government doesn ’ t do its regulation homework , it could be more than happy to let a private company come in and take over things , ” jörg kusche with greenpeace in germany told dw-world .
“ but then there would be no transparency or accountability .
we don ’ t think that ’ s the right direction . ” he and other environmental activists have expressed concern that public-private partnerships will be used by big business as an exercise in “ greenwash ” – putting a cloak of environmental responsibility around a company that could mask activities that could actually be damaging to the environment or people in development countries . martin kaiser , international environmental expert for greenpeace who is in johannesburg , criticised the congo plan after it was announced saying it appeared to have been developed largely by the paper industry with only minimal input from indigenous groups threatened by the congo forests ’ destruction . “ there ’ s already a lot of criticism about these initiatives .
a lot seem to be one-sided in favor of industry , ” he told dw-world . in un parlance , these public-private agreements are called “ type 2 ” initiatives .
the idea is that these voluntary programs can be decided on and launched quickly by the parties involved as opposed to being endorsed by the “ type 1 ” process , which requires the approval of an international forum and can be bureaucratic and time-consuming . “ we think it would be more sensible if these were a completion of type 1 initiatives and a part of binding agreements instead of just voluntary ones , whose outcome is anything but certain , ” kusche said . practical steps but the americans at the summit see such agreements as practical steps towards sustainable development .
public funds used in partnerships , according to us thinking , can leverage private investment .
assistant secretary of state john turner said the us plans on commiting $ 970 million over the next three years to water projects , but expects to mobilize more than $ 1.6 billion through partnerships . the us agency for international development presented a $ 90 million proposal to fight hunger in africa by teaming up with regional trade groups and industry partners . paula dobriansky , a us undersecretary of state for global affairs , dismissed skepticism on the part of some activists . “ i have found a great deal of enthusiasm … all want to see us really have some action here , ” she said . european union officials were also talking up several of their proposed projects on thursday , including agreements in energy and water management .

the pact calls for reducing catches to sustainable levels . a deal was struck late tuesday night in johannesburg , aiming to replenish the world ’ s overfished waters by 2015 and head off a looming fisheries crisis .
it ’ s the first concrete target date set at this summit where 200 nations have gathered to come up with an action plan to reduce world poverty without destroying the environment .
environmentalists , who have been highly critical of the summit for its reluctance to set definite targets for reform , welcomed the fisheries plan , calling it a welcome advance . “ it ’ s pleasing that they have reached agreement on oceans , ” sian pullen of the environmental group wwf told reuters .
“ we would have liked it to be more progressive but it ’ s good compared to some of the other issues which may be going backwards . ”
catching fewer fish the plan calls for reducing fish catches to levels where the maximum sustainable yield can be taken indefinitely .
it gives governments a deadline of 2015 to restore fish stocks to sustainable levels .
that could entail enacting temporary fishing bans in some areas or setting up permanent no-fishing zones to preserve breeding grounds .
according to the united nations , more than 25 percent of the world ’ s commercially important fish stocks are overexploited and 50 percent are being fished to full capacity .
after pressure from the us , delegates agreed add a clause stating that fish levels should be replenished “ where possible . ”
the americans argued some stocks , such as cod on the grand banks of canada ’ s eastern seaboard , are thought to have already been fished beyond recovery .
enforcement questions while the agreement has buoyed delegates ’ spirits , some environmentalists question whether the agreement can be enforeced against pirate trawlers .
for example , the fish stocks off of mozambique , south africa ’ s neighbor , have been reduced by more than 70 percent in the last decade , thanks largely to fleets of chinese and tanzanian fishermen who invade mozambican waters and dynamite all species .
they come to the waters off the island nation because they have exhausted the stocks in their own waters .
“ -lrb- the agreement -rrb- does recognize the need for enforcement but it doesn ’ t say how it ’ s going to be done .
it ’ s a major issue and not one that ’ s been adequately addressed , ” said the wwf ’ s sian pullen .
like the other parts of the action plan that heads of state are due to approve when they come to the summit finale next week , the fisheries agreement is not legally binding .
proponents hope however that it will form a moral basis for action and keep governments under pressure from the public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes radical reforms on fishing a disputed plan to reform eu fishing would remove thousands of fishing vessels from european seas in an attempt to save threatened fish stocks and create a sustainable industry .
but mediterranean countries cry foul .

endangered habitats , fisheries , pollution by ships are some of the topics on the agenda .

western countries are promoting “ public-private partnerships ” at the earth summit in johannesburg as a path to sustainable development .
environmentalists are skeptical , saying it puts big business before people . led by the united states , western countries showcased partnerships on thursday between governments , private industry and other groups as a practical way of furthering economic development and saving the environment . they say such partnerships are ways for business and governments to pool their resources and harness the funds and the know-how to accomplish more than either could on its own . un organizers say they have received 218 proposed partnerships , in areas ranging from health care to renewable energy projects that could go a long way in helping meet summit goals of halving global poverty by 2015 while slowing environmental degradation . congo project a multi-nation project to expand efforts to save forests in central africa ’ s congo basin was announced on thursday .
germany , the us , japan and indonesia are among the countries that want to provide an additional $ 53 million dollars over four years to a partnership between the paper industry active in the region and the local population .
the plan aims to develop protected forest areas and cut down on illegal logging . but many environmentalists are wary of relying on private business to save the planet .
they say partnerships may let companies cash in on providing essential services like water and electricity , while allowing governments to shirk their traditional responsibilities . “ if a government doesn ’ t do its regulation homework , it could be more than happy to let a private company come in and take over things , ” jörg kusche with greenpeace in germany told dw-world .
“ but then there would be no transparency or accountability .
we don ’ t think that ’ s the right direction . ” he and other environmental activists have expressed concern that public-private partnerships will be used by big business as an exercise in “ greenwash ” – putting a cloak of environmental responsibility around a company that could mask activities that could actually be damaging to the environment or people in development countries . martin kaiser , international environmental expert for greenpeace who is in johannesburg , criticised the congo plan after it was announced saying it appeared to have been developed largely by the paper industry with only minimal input from indigenous groups threatened by the congo forests ’ destruction . “ there ’ s already a lot of criticism about these initiatives .
a lot seem to be one-sided in favor of industry , ” he told dw-world . in un parlance , these public-private agreements are called “ type 2 ” initiatives .
the idea is that these voluntary programs can be decided on and launched quickly by the parties involved as opposed to being endorsed by the “ type 1 ” process , which requires the approval of an international forum and can be bureaucratic and time-consuming . “ we think it would be more sensible if these were a completion of type 1 initiatives and a part of binding agreements instead of just voluntary ones , whose outcome is anything but certain , ” kusche said . practical steps but the americans at the summit see such agreements as practical steps towards sustainable development .
public funds used in partnerships , according to us thinking , can leverage private investment .
assistant secretary of state john turner said the us plans on commiting $ 970 million over the next three years to water projects , but expects to mobilize more than $ 1.6 billion through partnerships . the us agency for international development presented a $ 90 million proposal to fight hunger in africa by teaming up with regional trade groups and industry partners . paula dobriansky , a us undersecretary of state for global affairs , dismissed skepticism on the part of some activists . “ i have found a great deal of enthusiasm … all want to see us really have some action here , ” she said . european union officials were also talking up several of their proposed projects on thursday , including agreements in energy and water management .
but they were more circumspect than their translatlantic partners about the extent to which public-private partnerships can solve all the world ’ s problems . in a statement , danish environment minister hans christian schmidt , who is representing the eu in johannesburg , cautioned against upsetting the balance between the public and private part of the equation . “ partnerships are a complement to -lrb- government -rrb- commitments , ” he said , “ not a substitute for them . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de on the green road from rio to johannesburg the un summit in johannesburg next week has been dubbed " rio + 10 " or " earth summit 2 " .

according to the united nations , more than 25 percent of the world ’ s commercially important fish stocks are overexploited and 50 percent are being fished to full capacity .

the americans argued some stocks , such as cod on the grand banks of canada ’ s eastern seaboard , are thought to have already been fished beyond recovery .

but stoiber and schröder succeeded in piquing interest in what had until now been a sleepy election . going into sunday night 's debate against edmund stoiber , gerhard schröder already had a huge disadvantage – as the four-year chancellor of germany , he found himself in a defensive position .
it was a fundamental weakness that challenger stoiber , the premier of bavaria , put to his advantage in a series of forceful attacks against the chancellor covering the most important issues of the election , making the anticipated event feel like a political soccer match .
the most contentious exchanges revolved around spiraling unemployment , a stagnant economy , tax reforms , immigration and germany 's stance on a possible iraq invasion – all dominant issues in the media during the days and weeks leading up to the first debate .
the keyword of the night seemed to be " failure , " of which both candidates repeatedly accused the other of on each key issue .
the debate , which is being called a " duel " here , was broadcast by the private television stations rtl and sat.1.
schröder taken to task for soaring unemployment in one of the most aggressive salvos of the evening , stoiber blamed germany 's high unemployment level of over four million on the current red-green government , led by schröder 's social democrats and the greens .
he said schröder had failed in his promise to reduce unemployment levels to fewer than 3.5 million people .
he criticized schröder for his plan to delay a tax cut scheduled for 2003 in order to fund the rebuilding of communities ravaged this summer by the biggest floods in a hundred years .
he said the government made a " mistake " by instituting tax reforms that did nothing to help what he described as the " most important " part of the german economy : small- to middle-sized businesses .
" we ca n't forget that the center of gravity of our labor market is dependent on the ...
german market .
we have only a relatively small share of exports to america .
other countries , like england , france , sweden , finland and spain have the same international ties , but they do n't have the dramatically growing number of unemployed or such a weak economic growth rate . "
schröder conceded he was disappointed by germany 's unemployment rate , but fought back by saying it was the result of the global economic downturn and not a homemade problem as stoiber had suggested .
as for the delayed tax cut , he said , " i 'm convinced that the people of this country understand that today 's damage ca n't be compensated for with debts that our children and grandchildren will then have to pay . "
how full is the ship ?
addressing immigration , stoiber said he thought it was " wrong for germany to have a law that provides for more immigration . "
he said that every year germany takes in 500,000 to 600,000 new immigrants - the equivalent of cities like dortmund or nuremburg .
he said the new immigration law would increase that number by 100,000 to 150,000 .
" we are n't even finished assimilating the foreigner children who are already here .
we need to do a lot more .
for that reason we should n't increase immigration , " he said .
schröder defended his government 's new law , passed in march , saying it both limited immigration in areas where it is n't needed while at the same time opening doors for highly skilled workers who are needed in the technology sector .
while stoiber 's numbers were correct , he said , he had omitted the annual outflow of several hundred thousand – refugees of countries once torn by civil war , for example .
when you add those figures in , he said , the increase is more like 100,000 people .
stoiber : schröder 's iraq position " irresponsible " schröder also found himself on the defensive on the subject of a possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
recently , schröder has alluded that the u.s. was planning to engage in " military adventurism , " and said that germany would not participate , even under a united nations mandate .
on sunday night , however , schröder sought to draw a line between his stances on u.n. efforts to get weapons inspectors back inside baghdad and the u.s. ' desire to topple saddam hussein 's regime .
" in light of the situation in the middle east , and considering the fact that we have n't conquered the taliban and are far from having rebuilt afghanistan , a military intervention in iraq is wrong , and for that reason , under my leadership , germany will not help in that effort , " the chancellor said .
stoiber , meanwhile , called schröder 's public statements on the issue , and his stance , " irresponsible . "
he specifically criticized schröder for saying the country must go the " german way , " a phrase he said had historically charged connotations - at least in the ears of the international community .
he also said schröder 's public statements and policy reduced some of the international pressure on hussein .
" with saddam hussein , you have a war criminal as head of government , a head of state who possesses weapons of mass destruction and has even used them against his own people and those in neighboring iran .
we need to do everything we can , make every diplomatic effort , apply as much political pressure " as is needed to get un inspectors back inside iraq , stoiber said .
he said the chancellor should n't be ruling out every " theoretical option . "
stalemate so who won ?
the jury ca n't seem to make up its mind .
immediately after the debate , the editor in chief of the newsweekly " der spiegel , " stefan aust , said he " did n't get the impression he -lrb- schröder -rrb- was the media chancellor .
he could have done better . "
aust even accused him of putting his german television audience to sleep .
but polls taken of viewers sunday night were all over the board .
a forsa institute poll for sat.1 put schröder ahead .
another , by pollster wahlen for public broadcaster zdf had stoiber ahead by two points .
but another , by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard put schröder far ahead of his bavarian challenger .
in editorials published in the monday editions , many major regional newspapers shied away from declaring a victor .
the mass-circulation " bild " described german voters as the victors for even taking an interest in the debate .
the " berliner zeitung , " meanwhile , described it as a duel that had neither a conqueror nor someone who had been conquered .
indeed , if a television debate were analogous to soccer , you might say that stoiber controlled the ball for much of the game – e.g. he steered the issues and went in with the most attacks – but neither candidate , it seemed , scored many goals . and that 's too bad considering that in germany 's first ever television debate there was no provision for penalty shots . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery read everything you need to know about the politicians , parties and hot-button issues , along with a dummy 's guide to the german political system , as germans head for the polls for national elections on september 22 .

11 terrorist in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm announces charges morrocan born mounir el motassadeq will face at least 3,116 counts of accessory to murder for his alleged role in helping mohammed atta 's hamburg cell plan the sept .
11 terror attack . close to a year after the terror attacks of sept .
11 , the federal prosecutors office in germany announced it filed criminal charges this week against a hamburg man suspected of aiding in the planning and financing of the attacks .
the charges are the first against a german member of the terror cell responsible for the attacks .
on thursday , federal prosecutor kay nehm said the suspect , morrocan citizen mounir el motassadeq , was charged on wednesday as an accessory to murder in the killings of at least 3,116 people in new york and washington and for membership in a terrorist organization .
prosecutors believe the 28-year-old student was deeply involved in the hamburg terror cell led by mohammed atta that carried out the deadly attacks .
the case has brought many previously unknown facts about the sept .
11 attacks to light .
investigators here now believe the terrorist cell had begun planning a major attack as far back as oct .
1999 , and that the world trade center first emerged as a possible target in april or may 2000 .
at the time , nehm said , hijacker marwan al shehhi told a hamburg librarian of his intentions .
" there will be thousands of dead , you will all think of me , " he reportedly said .
nehm said he also uttered the words " world trade center . "
a member " right up to the end " authorities arrested electrical engineering student el motassadeq in nov .
2001 , and he has been held in investigative custody since then in a jail in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
nehm said motassadeq had maintained intensive contacts with the terror cell for several years and also lived in the same neighborhood as the terrorists with his wife and child .
nehm said he believes motassadeq " remained part of the assassination preparations right up to the end . "
motassadeq played a definitive role in the financing of the hamburg terror cell 's activities , the indictement stated . he held power of attorney over , as well as an automated teller card for , a bank account that had originally been opened by al shehhi , one of the terrorists who died in the airplane attacks .
prosecutor nehm said the terrorists used the hamburg bank account to pay for pilot training for said bahaji and zakariya essabar in the united states .
al qaeda terrorists also allegedly used the account to pay their expenses while living in the u.s. both are still on the run from authorities .
nehm described motassadeq as a " governor in hamburg " for the terror cell during the time atta and others were in taking classes in u.s. flight schools .
additionally , nehm said , motassadeq 's signature appeared on a testament written by atta that surfaced after the deadly attacks were carried out .
training in afghanistan between may and august 2000 , prosecutors said , motassadeq spent time in an al qaeda terror training camp located near kandahar in afghanistan .
" in addition to ideological and military traning , such visits were also used by leaders of the international network to discuss and agree on details of attacks and the logistical support needed to carry them out , " nehm said .
meanwhile , prosecutors say they have learned little from statements made by motassadeq following his arrest , with chief prosecutor nehm describing his statements as " meaningless . "
in december , motassadeq denied any involvement in the attacks ' planning as well as membership in al qaeda .
an attorney representing motassadeq on thursday described the 90-page indictment against him as " sparse . "
a trial against motassadeq , however , is still on schedule to commence in october .
the birth of a terror cell in his press conference on thursday , nehm also rehashed detailed conclusions drawn by investigators about the origins of the hamburg terror cell and its members .
the group , comprised initially of seven students , came together in hamburg during the early 1990s .
cell leader atta , second wtc pilot al shehhi and third pilot ziad jarrah were all part of the group .
" all of the members of this cell shared the same religious convictions , an islamic lifestyle , a feeling of being out of place in unfamiliar cultural surroundings , " nehm said .
" at the center of this stood the hatred of the world 's jews and the u.s. "
nehm said el motassadeq had served as a logistician for the terror cell along with three other men who are still being sought by authorities , including ramsi binalshibh , bahaji and essabar .
neither bahaji nor essabar were able to participate in the attacks because immigration officials rejected their visa applications to travel to the u.s. the group 's mission , according to nehm , was " the militant rejection of western society and its values and the defense of the muslim world against non-muslims , including through terrorist acts , was the basis of the group 's activities .

11 terrorist in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm announces charges morrocan born mounir el motassadeq will face at least 3,116 counts of accessory to murder for his alleged role in helping mohammed atta 's hamburg cell plan the sept .
11 terror attack . close to a year after the terror attacks of sept .
11 , the federal prosecutors office in germany announced it filed criminal charges this week against a hamburg man suspected of aiding in the planning and financing of the attacks .
the charges are the first against a german member of the terror cell responsible for the attacks .
on thursday , federal prosecutor kay nehm said the suspect , morrocan citizen mounir el motassadeq , was charged on wednesday as an accessory to murder in the killings of at least 3,116 people in new york and washington and for membership in a terrorist organization .
prosecutors believe the 28-year-old student was deeply involved in the hamburg terror cell led by mohammed atta that carried out the deadly attacks .
the case has brought many previously unknown facts about the sept .
11 attacks to light .
investigators here now believe the terrorist cell had begun planning a major attack as far back as oct .
1999 , and that the world trade center first emerged as a possible target in april or may 2000 .
at the time , nehm said , hijacker marwan al shehhi told a hamburg librarian of his intentions .
" there will be thousands of dead , you will all think of me , " he reportedly said .
nehm said he also uttered the words " world trade center . "
a member " right up to the end " authorities arrested electrical engineering student el motassadeq in nov .
2001 , and he has been held in investigative custody since then in a jail in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
nehm said motassadeq had maintained intensive contacts with the terror cell for several years and also lived in the same neighborhood as the terrorists with his wife and child .
nehm said he believes motassadeq " remained part of the assassination preparations right up to the end . "
motassadeq played a definitive role in the financing of the hamburg terror cell 's activities , the indictement stated . he held power of attorney over , as well as an automated teller card for , a bank account that had originally been opened by al shehhi , one of the terrorists who died in the airplane attacks .
prosecutor nehm said the terrorists used the hamburg bank account to pay for pilot training for said bahaji and zakariya essabar in the united states .
al qaeda terrorists also allegedly used the account to pay their expenses while living in the u.s. both are still on the run from authorities .
nehm described motassadeq as a " governor in hamburg " for the terror cell during the time atta and others were in taking classes in u.s. flight schools .
additionally , nehm said , motassadeq 's signature appeared on a testament written by atta that surfaced after the deadly attacks were carried out .
training in afghanistan between may and august 2000 , prosecutors said , motassadeq spent time in an al qaeda terror training camp located near kandahar in afghanistan .
" in addition to ideological and military traning , such visits were also used by leaders of the international network to discuss and agree on details of attacks and the logistical support needed to carry them out , " nehm said .
meanwhile , prosecutors say they have learned little from statements made by motassadeq following his arrest , with chief prosecutor nehm describing his statements as " meaningless . "
in december , motassadeq denied any involvement in the attacks ' planning as well as membership in al qaeda .
an attorney representing motassadeq on thursday described the 90-page indictment against him as " sparse . "
a trial against motassadeq , however , is still on schedule to commence in october .
the birth of a terror cell in his press conference on thursday , nehm also rehashed detailed conclusions drawn by investigators about the origins of the hamburg terror cell and its members .
the group , comprised initially of seven students , came together in hamburg during the early 1990s .
cell leader atta , second wtc pilot al shehhi and third pilot ziad jarrah were all part of the group .
" all of the members of this cell shared the same religious convictions , an islamic lifestyle , a feeling of being out of place in unfamiliar cultural surroundings , " nehm said .
" at the center of this stood the hatred of the world 's jews and the u.s. "
nehm said el motassadeq had served as a logistician for the terror cell along with three other men who are still being sought by authorities , including ramsi binalshibh , bahaji and essabar .
neither bahaji nor essabar were able to participate in the attacks because immigration officials rejected their visa applications to travel to the u.s. the group 's mission , according to nehm , was " the militant rejection of western society and its values and the defense of the muslim world against non-muslims , including through terrorist acts , was the basis of the group 's activities .

but stoiber and schröder succeeded in piquing interest in what had until now been a sleepy election . going into sunday night 's debate against edmund stoiber , gerhard schröder already had a huge disadvantage – as the four-year chancellor of germany , he found himself in a defensive position .
it was a fundamental weakness that challenger stoiber , the premier of bavaria , put to his advantage in a series of forceful attacks against the chancellor covering the most important issues of the election , making the anticipated event feel like a political soccer match .
the most contentious exchanges revolved around spiraling unemployment , a stagnant economy , tax reforms , immigration and germany 's stance on a possible iraq invasion – all dominant issues in the media during the days and weeks leading up to the first debate .
the keyword of the night seemed to be " failure , " of which both candidates repeatedly accused the other of on each key issue .
the debate , which is being called a " duel " here , was broadcast by the private television stations rtl and sat.1.
schröder taken to task for soaring unemployment in one of the most aggressive salvos of the evening , stoiber blamed germany 's high unemployment level of over four million on the current red-green government , led by schröder 's social democrats and the greens .
he said schröder had failed in his promise to reduce unemployment levels to fewer than 3.5 million people .
he criticized schröder for his plan to delay a tax cut scheduled for 2003 in order to fund the rebuilding of communities ravaged this summer by the biggest floods in a hundred years .
he said the government made a " mistake " by instituting tax reforms that did nothing to help what he described as the " most important " part of the german economy : small- to middle-sized businesses .
" we ca n't forget that the center of gravity of our labor market is dependent on the ...
german market .
we have only a relatively small share of exports to america .
other countries , like england , france , sweden , finland and spain have the same international ties , but they do n't have the dramatically growing number of unemployed or such a weak economic growth rate . "
schröder conceded he was disappointed by germany 's unemployment rate , but fought back by saying it was the result of the global economic downturn and not a homemade problem as stoiber had suggested .
as for the delayed tax cut , he said , " i 'm convinced that the people of this country understand that today 's damage ca n't be compensated for with debts that our children and grandchildren will then have to pay . "
how full is the ship ?
addressing immigration , stoiber said he thought it was " wrong for germany to have a law that provides for more immigration . "
he said that every year germany takes in 500,000 to 600,000 new immigrants - the equivalent of cities like dortmund or nuremburg .
he said the new immigration law would increase that number by 100,000 to 150,000 .
" we are n't even finished assimilating the foreigner children who are already here .
we need to do a lot more .
for that reason we should n't increase immigration , " he said .
schröder defended his government 's new law , passed in march , saying it both limited immigration in areas where it is n't needed while at the same time opening doors for highly skilled workers who are needed in the technology sector .
while stoiber 's numbers were correct , he said , he had omitted the annual outflow of several hundred thousand – refugees of countries once torn by civil war , for example .
when you add those figures in , he said , the increase is more like 100,000 people .
stoiber : schröder 's iraq position " irresponsible " schröder also found himself on the defensive on the subject of a possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
recently , schröder has alluded that the u.s. was planning to engage in " military adventurism , " and said that germany would not participate , even under a united nations mandate .
on sunday night , however , schröder sought to draw a line between his stances on u.n. efforts to get weapons inspectors back inside baghdad and the u.s. ' desire to topple saddam hussein 's regime .
" in light of the situation in the middle east , and considering the fact that we have n't conquered the taliban and are far from having rebuilt afghanistan , a military intervention in iraq is wrong , and for that reason , under my leadership , germany will not help in that effort , " the chancellor said .
stoiber , meanwhile , called schröder 's public statements on the issue , and his stance , " irresponsible . "
he specifically criticized schröder for saying the country must go the " german way , " a phrase he said had historically charged connotations - at least in the ears of the international community .
he also said schröder 's public statements and policy reduced some of the international pressure on hussein .
" with saddam hussein , you have a war criminal as head of government , a head of state who possesses weapons of mass destruction and has even used them against his own people and those in neighboring iran .
we need to do everything we can , make every diplomatic effort , apply as much political pressure " as is needed to get un inspectors back inside iraq , stoiber said .
he said the chancellor should n't be ruling out every " theoretical option . "
stalemate so who won ?
the jury ca n't seem to make up its mind .
immediately after the debate , the editor in chief of the newsweekly " der spiegel , " stefan aust , said he " did n't get the impression he -lrb- schröder -rrb- was the media chancellor .
he could have done better . "
aust even accused him of putting his german television audience to sleep .
but polls taken of viewers sunday night were all over the board .
a forsa institute poll for sat.1 put schröder ahead .
another , by pollster wahlen for public broadcaster zdf had stoiber ahead by two points .
but another , by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard put schröder far ahead of his bavarian challenger .
in editorials published in the monday editions , many major regional newspapers shied away from declaring a victor .
the mass-circulation " bild " described german voters as the victors for even taking an interest in the debate .
the " berliner zeitung , " meanwhile , described it as a duel that had neither a conqueror nor someone who had been conquered .
indeed , if a television debate were analogous to soccer , you might say that stoiber controlled the ball for much of the game – e.g. he steered the issues and went in with the most attacks – but neither candidate , it seemed , scored many goals . and that 's too bad considering that in germany 's first ever television debate there was no provision for penalty shots . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery read everything you need to know about the politicians , parties and hot-button issues , along with a dummy 's guide to the german political system , as germans head for the polls for national elections on september 22 .

the company saw the tracks of some of its main lines near dresden get washed away , train stations flooded and the collapse of crucial bridges , including one on a high-speed rail line connecting northern and southern germany .
appearing at the chancellery in berlin on wednesday , deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn issued a preliminary estimate of over one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in flood damages .
" according to our cautious first estimates , we believe we have suffered revenue losses and damages of 1.025 billion euro , " mehdorn said .
he stressed that this would not be the final damage sum .
a laundry list of damages more than 400 kilometers of deutsche bahn tracks are currently unusable , and 94 bridges and 200 train stations have been badly damaged .
early estimates suggest that the service outages alone will lead to a 90 million euro -lrb- $ 88 million -rrb- drop in revenue from passenger and freight services .
mehdorn said it would take two and a half years before deutsche bahn service could return to its pre-flood level in the region .
the federal government has already agreed to provide deutsche bahn with 650 million euro -lrb- $ 638 million -rrb- to rebuild its network and repair damaged train stations .
more than half the money had already been earmarked for transportation infrastructure development projects in the eastern states that were formerly part of east germany .
deutsche bahn said its first reconstruction priorities would be lines in the leipzig-dresden-chemnitz triangle .
a line connecting dresden with prague will also be rebuilt as quickly as possible .
mehdorn said there are currently no plans to cancel any proposed deutsche bahn projects – including the planned transrapid train line between dortmund and düsseldorf .
new priorities , however , could lead to delays , he warned .
a job-saving deal as part of a four-point " immediate aid " program , the government also reached an agreement with deutsche bahn and the transnet union that the company would not lay off any employees between now and 2006 as a result of the flooding .
until this week 's agreement , talks between the employees ' union and bahn had reached an impasse .
mehdorn said deutsche bahn will reintroduce regular long-distance train service in the state of saxony-anhalt on thursday and is working on a plan to reintroduce long-distance trains in saxony as quickly as possible .
agricultural damage estimated at 267 million euro separately , german consumer protection and agricultural minister renate künast announced the government would release 141 million euro -lrb- $ 138 million -rrb- between now and the end of the year in immediate aid to farmers struck by the flooding .

for years , the agency has put members of extremist organizations , often leaders , on its payroll in an effort to get a better grasp of the activities of these groups .
in recent years , it has used information culled from informants to build its federal constitutional court case to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
however , subsequent revelations about the relationship between the agency and its informants have jeopardized the npd ban petition and led critics to ask whether it has gone over the line in nurturing such relationships .
" this bullet is for you " the latest twist involves mirko h. , a neo-nazi from the state of saxony who has been working as an informant for the office of the protection of the constitution since the mid-1990s .
it has been alleged that during his time on the agency 's payroll , he also produced thousands of copies of a cd by the band white aryan rebels called " notes of hate , " containing nazi lyrics that are banned in germany .
the song " this bullet is for you " includes a death threat against the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , michel friedman , and other german politicians .
the album , chilling in its unabashed xenophobia , also includes calls for the killing of mo asumang , a popular german erotic television star of ghanian ancestry .
the second informant implicated in the scandal is toni s. , a neo-nazi from the eastern german city of cottbus who worked for the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of brandenburg .
toni s. is currently in investigative police custody as his relationship with the white aryan rebels is probed .
the dresden public prosecutors ' office , meanwhile , has filed a criminal case against mirko h. for his role in the production and distribution of the cd .
what did the government know , and when ?
a report in the current issue of " focus , " a national newsweekly , alleged that the office of the protection of the constitution was aware of mirko h. 's involvement in the creation of the cd and still continued to work with him without stopping its production .
the newsweekly reported he earned more than 105,000 euro from the hate-filled lp .
the article also accused the federal interior ministry of withhold from the secret service committee of parliament the information that mirko h. had been convicted of illegal weapons possession and incitement in 2001 .
the interior ministry has denied the charge .
still , that does n't make it easier for the celebrities threatened in " notes of hate , " to sleep at night .
" i 'm shaken and feel less secure by the idea that security authorities have become a part of the threat , " michel friedman told the berlin newspaper " tagesspiegel , " in its wednesday edition .
" this ca n't be accepted by the government . "
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union are calling for immediate answers from the interior ministry and the government .
" in the face of the dramatic events in this informant scandal , we expect that the interior minister will provide answers , " the deputy head of the union bloc 's parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , told the " berliner zeitung " newspaper .
" he has to tell us what he knew about the informant , what the interior ministry knew , who carries the political responsibility and what conclusions should be drawn . "
criticism from within concern is also growing inside the government .
christian ströbele , a green member of parliament , told the same paper he believed the situation must be clarified before the sept .
22 federal elections .
ströbele said he believed the latest incident was just " one more example of the questionable methods of the office for the protection of the constitution . "
where do you draw the line , he asked , between activities right-wing extremists have developed themselves and those that have been inspired and financed by the office for the protection of the constitution ?
" you have to ask yourself whether some -lrb- authorities from the office -rrb- are doing more to endanger our constitution than to protect it , " ströbele said .
a growing informant scandal the neo-nazi cd scandal is only the latest gaffe for the office of the protection of the constitution in its use of extremist informants who are still active .
the constitutional court temporarily suspended the government 's case to ban the npd in january after it learned a key member of the right-wing extremist party 's leadership had at one point served as an informant for the domestic intelligence agency 's investigation , which laid the foundations for the ban petition .
the court learned that part of the government 's case had been gleaned from wolfgang frenz , an npd official and witness for the defense who had worked as an informant for the north rhine-westphalia state office for the protection of the constitution .
days later , it learned that udo holtmann , head of the npd 's state chapter in north rhine-westphalia , had also aided in the government 's case .
the government has said it must rely on unidentified informants in such cases because it is their best hope to gain intelligence on the groups .
on thursday , the practice will be put under the microscope of the bundestag , where more than a handful of politicians have already said they will question the government practice . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new problems for case against far-right party ?

for years , the agency has put members of extremist organizations , often leaders , on its payroll in an effort to get a better grasp of the activities of these groups .
in recent years , it has used information culled from informants to build its federal constitutional court case to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
however , subsequent revelations about the relationship between the agency and its informants have jeopardized the npd ban petition and led critics to ask whether it has gone over the line in nurturing such relationships .
" this bullet is for you " the latest twist involves mirko h. , a neo-nazi from the state of saxony who has been working as an informant for the office of the protection of the constitution since the mid-1990s .
it has been alleged that during his time on the agency 's payroll , he also produced thousands of copies of a cd by the band white aryan rebels called " notes of hate , " containing nazi lyrics that are banned in germany .
the song " this bullet is for you " includes a death threat against the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , michel friedman , and other german politicians .
the album , chilling in its unabashed xenophobia , also includes calls for the killing of mo asumang , a popular german erotic television star of ghanian ancestry .
the second informant implicated in the scandal is toni s. , a neo-nazi from the eastern german city of cottbus who worked for the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of brandenburg .
toni s. is currently in investigative police custody as his relationship with the white aryan rebels is probed .
the dresden public prosecutors ' office , meanwhile , has filed a criminal case against mirko h. for his role in the production and distribution of the cd .
what did the government know , and when ?
a report in the current issue of " focus , " a national newsweekly , alleged that the office of the protection of the constitution was aware of mirko h. 's involvement in the creation of the cd and still continued to work with him without stopping its production .
the newsweekly reported he earned more than 105,000 euro from the hate-filled lp .
the article also accused the federal interior ministry of withhold from the secret service committee of parliament the information that mirko h. had been convicted of illegal weapons possession and incitement in 2001 .
the interior ministry has denied the charge .
still , that does n't make it easier for the celebrities threatened in " notes of hate , " to sleep at night .
" i 'm shaken and feel less secure by the idea that security authorities have become a part of the threat , " michel friedman told the berlin newspaper " tagesspiegel , " in its wednesday edition .
" this ca n't be accepted by the government . "
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union are calling for immediate answers from the interior ministry and the government .
" in the face of the dramatic events in this informant scandal , we expect that the interior minister will provide answers , " the deputy head of the union bloc 's parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , told the " berliner zeitung " newspaper .
" he has to tell us what he knew about the informant , what the interior ministry knew , who carries the political responsibility and what conclusions should be drawn . "
criticism from within concern is also growing inside the government .
christian ströbele , a green member of parliament , told the same paper he believed the situation must be clarified before the sept .
22 federal elections .
ströbele said he believed the latest incident was just " one more example of the questionable methods of the office for the protection of the constitution . "
where do you draw the line , he asked , between activities right-wing extremists have developed themselves and those that have been inspired and financed by the office for the protection of the constitution ?
" you have to ask yourself whether some -lrb- authorities from the office -rrb- are doing more to endanger our constitution than to protect it , " ströbele said .
a growing informant scandal the neo-nazi cd scandal is only the latest gaffe for the office of the protection of the constitution in its use of extremist informants who are still active .
the constitutional court temporarily suspended the government 's case to ban the npd in january after it learned a key member of the right-wing extremist party 's leadership had at one point served as an informant for the domestic intelligence agency 's investigation , which laid the foundations for the ban petition .
the court learned that part of the government 's case had been gleaned from wolfgang frenz , an npd official and witness for the defense who had worked as an informant for the north rhine-westphalia state office for the protection of the constitution .
days later , it learned that udo holtmann , head of the npd 's state chapter in north rhine-westphalia , had also aided in the government 's case .
the government has said it must rely on unidentified informants in such cases because it is their best hope to gain intelligence on the groups .

for years , the agency has put members of extremist organizations , often leaders , on its payroll in an effort to get a better grasp of the activities of these groups .
in recent years , it has used information culled from informants to build its federal constitutional court case to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
however , subsequent revelations about the relationship between the agency and its informants have jeopardized the npd ban petition and led critics to ask whether it has gone over the line in nurturing such relationships .
" this bullet is for you " the latest twist involves mirko h. , a neo-nazi from the state of saxony who has been working as an informant for the office of the protection of the constitution since the mid-1990s .
it has been alleged that during his time on the agency 's payroll , he also produced thousands of copies of a cd by the band white aryan rebels called " notes of hate , " containing nazi lyrics that are banned in germany .
the song " this bullet is for you " includes a death threat against the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , michel friedman , and other german politicians .
the album , chilling in its unabashed xenophobia , also includes calls for the killing of mo asumang , a popular german erotic television star of ghanian ancestry .
the second informant implicated in the scandal is toni s. , a neo-nazi from the eastern german city of cottbus who worked for the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of brandenburg .
toni s. is currently in investigative police custody as his relationship with the white aryan rebels is probed .
the dresden public prosecutors ' office , meanwhile , has filed a criminal case against mirko h. for his role in the production and distribution of the cd .
what did the government know , and when ?
a report in the current issue of " focus , " a national newsweekly , alleged that the office of the protection of the constitution was aware of mirko h. 's involvement in the creation of the cd and still continued to work with him without stopping its production .
the newsweekly reported he earned more than 105,000 euro from the hate-filled lp .
the article also accused the federal interior ministry of withhold from the secret service committee of parliament the information that mirko h. had been convicted of illegal weapons possession and incitement in 2001 .
the interior ministry has denied the charge .
still , that does n't make it easier for the celebrities threatened in " notes of hate , " to sleep at night .
" i 'm shaken and feel less secure by the idea that security authorities have become a part of the threat , " michel friedman told the berlin newspaper " tagesspiegel , " in its wednesday edition .
" this ca n't be accepted by the government . "
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union are calling for immediate answers from the interior ministry and the government .
" in the face of the dramatic events in this informant scandal , we expect that the interior minister will provide answers , " the deputy head of the union bloc 's parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , told the " berliner zeitung " newspaper .
" he has to tell us what he knew about the informant , what the interior ministry knew , who carries the political responsibility and what conclusions should be drawn . "
criticism from within concern is also growing inside the government .
christian ströbele , a green member of parliament , told the same paper he believed the situation must be clarified before the sept .
22 federal elections .
ströbele said he believed the latest incident was just " one more example of the questionable methods of the office for the protection of the constitution . "
where do you draw the line , he asked , between activities right-wing extremists have developed themselves and those that have been inspired and financed by the office for the protection of the constitution ?
" you have to ask yourself whether some -lrb- authorities from the office -rrb- are doing more to endanger our constitution than to protect it , " ströbele said .
a growing informant scandal the neo-nazi cd scandal is only the latest gaffe for the office of the protection of the constitution in its use of extremist informants who are still active .
the constitutional court temporarily suspended the government 's case to ban the npd in january after it learned a key member of the right-wing extremist party 's leadership had at one point served as an informant for the domestic intelligence agency 's investigation , which laid the foundations for the ban petition .
the court learned that part of the government 's case had been gleaned from wolfgang frenz , an npd official and witness for the defense who had worked as an informant for the north rhine-westphalia state office for the protection of the constitution .
days later , it learned that udo holtmann , head of the npd 's state chapter in north rhine-westphalia , had also aided in the government 's case .
the government has said it must rely on unidentified informants in such cases because it is their best hope to gain intelligence on the groups .
on thursday , the practice will be put under the microscope of the bundestag , where more than a handful of politicians have already said they will question the government practice . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new problems for case against far-right party ?
germany 's state interior ministers have informally reached an agreement to shield the identities of informants in the government 's case to ban the right-wing extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .

but stoiber and schröder succeeded in piquing interest in what had until now been a sleepy election . going into sunday night 's debate against edmund stoiber , gerhard schröder already had a huge disadvantage – as the four-year chancellor of germany , he found himself in a defensive position .
it was a fundamental weakness that challenger stoiber , the premier of bavaria , put to his advantage in a series of forceful attacks against the chancellor covering the most important issues of the election , making the anticipated event feel like a political soccer match .
the most contentious exchanges revolved around spiraling unemployment , a stagnant economy , tax reforms , immigration and germany 's stance on a possible iraq invasion – all dominant issues in the media during the days and weeks leading up to the first debate .
the keyword of the night seemed to be " failure , " of which both candidates repeatedly accused the other of on each key issue .
the debate , which is being called a " duel " here , was broadcast by the private television stations rtl and sat.1.
schröder taken to task for soaring unemployment in one of the most aggressive salvos of the evening , stoiber blamed germany 's high unemployment level of over four million on the current red-green government , led by schröder 's social democrats and the greens .
he said schröder had failed in his promise to reduce unemployment levels to fewer than 3.5 million people .
he criticized schröder for his plan to delay a tax cut scheduled for 2003 in order to fund the rebuilding of communities ravaged this summer by the biggest floods in a hundred years .
he said the government made a " mistake " by instituting tax reforms that did nothing to help what he described as the " most important " part of the german economy : small- to middle-sized businesses .
" we ca n't forget that the center of gravity of our labor market is dependent on the ...
german market .
we have only a relatively small share of exports to america .
other countries , like england , france , sweden , finland and spain have the same international ties , but they do n't have the dramatically growing number of unemployed or such a weak economic growth rate . "
schröder conceded he was disappointed by germany 's unemployment rate , but fought back by saying it was the result of the global economic downturn and not a homemade problem as stoiber had suggested .
as for the delayed tax cut , he said , " i 'm convinced that the people of this country understand that today 's damage ca n't be compensated for with debts that our children and grandchildren will then have to pay . "
how full is the ship ?
addressing immigration , stoiber said he thought it was " wrong for germany to have a law that provides for more immigration . "
he said that every year germany takes in 500,000 to 600,000 new immigrants - the equivalent of cities like dortmund or nuremburg .
he said the new immigration law would increase that number by 100,000 to 150,000 .
" we are n't even finished assimilating the foreigner children who are already here .
we need to do a lot more .
for that reason we should n't increase immigration , " he said .
schröder defended his government 's new law , passed in march , saying it both limited immigration in areas where it is n't needed while at the same time opening doors for highly skilled workers who are needed in the technology sector .
while stoiber 's numbers were correct , he said , he had omitted the annual outflow of several hundred thousand – refugees of countries once torn by civil war , for example .
when you add those figures in , he said , the increase is more like 100,000 people .
stoiber : schröder 's iraq position " irresponsible " schröder also found himself on the defensive on the subject of a possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
recently , schröder has alluded that the u.s. was planning to engage in " military adventurism , " and said that germany would not participate , even under a united nations mandate .
on sunday night , however , schröder sought to draw a line between his stances on u.n. efforts to get weapons inspectors back inside baghdad and the u.s. ' desire to topple saddam hussein 's regime .
" in light of the situation in the middle east , and considering the fact that we have n't conquered the taliban and are far from having rebuilt afghanistan , a military intervention in iraq is wrong , and for that reason , under my leadership , germany will not help in that effort , " the chancellor said .
stoiber , meanwhile , called schröder 's public statements on the issue , and his stance , " irresponsible . "
he specifically criticized schröder for saying the country must go the " german way , " a phrase he said had historically charged connotations - at least in the ears of the international community .
he also said schröder 's public statements and policy reduced some of the international pressure on hussein .
" with saddam hussein , you have a war criminal as head of government , a head of state who possesses weapons of mass destruction and has even used them against his own people and those in neighboring iran .
we need to do everything we can , make every diplomatic effort , apply as much political pressure " as is needed to get un inspectors back inside iraq , stoiber said .
he said the chancellor should n't be ruling out every " theoretical option . "
stalemate so who won ?
the jury ca n't seem to make up its mind .
immediately after the debate , the editor in chief of the newsweekly " der spiegel , " stefan aust , said he " did n't get the impression he -lrb- schröder -rrb- was the media chancellor .
he could have done better . "
aust even accused him of putting his german television audience to sleep .
but polls taken of viewers sunday night were all over the board .
a forsa institute poll for sat.1 put schröder ahead .
another , by pollster wahlen for public broadcaster zdf had stoiber ahead by two points .
but another , by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard put schröder far ahead of his bavarian challenger .
in editorials published in the monday editions , many major regional newspapers shied away from declaring a victor .
the mass-circulation " bild " described german voters as the victors for even taking an interest in the debate .
the " berliner zeitung , " meanwhile , described it as a duel that had neither a conqueror nor someone who had been conquered .
indeed , if a television debate were analogous to soccer , you might say that stoiber controlled the ball for much of the game – e.g. he steered the issues and went in with the most attacks – but neither candidate , it seemed , scored many goals . and that 's too bad considering that in germany 's first ever television debate there was no provision for penalty shots . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery read everything you need to know about the politicians , parties and hot-button issues , along with a dummy 's guide to the german political system , as germans head for the polls for national elections on september 22 .

11 attacks , terrorism has vanished from the political agenda in germany .
experts say time and other issues have pushed the topic from voters ' minds . in the months following sept .
11 , germans couldn ’ t get enough tough talk on terrorism . the realization that the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon were most likely planned in hamburg , sent shockwaves through the country and , as a result , through the political establishment as well . the government was quick to react : interior minister otto schily prepared two “ security packages ” that expanded the reach and financing of germany ’ s law enforcement and got them past the legislature within a quick few months . germans rewarded their government ’ s tough talk on terrorism with high approval ratings and observers wondered at the speed and solidarity with which berlin was operating . now , just weeks before the attacks ’ anniversary , terrorism has all but escaped from the voters ’ minds , and , as a result , the political agenda .
in the midst of a hard-fought election campaign , germany ’ s recent floods , the high unemployment rate and slumping economy have grabbed the headlines , pushing aside concern over the spread of islamic fundamentalism and terror cells in the country . the reasons , say experts , have to do with both the time lapse since sept .
11 and the zero tolerance image chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has presented since then .
the speed with which the government moved to pass anti-terrorism measures and assure germans their country was safe was enough to allay fears relatively quickly , said jochen hippler , political scientist at the university of duisberg . quick enough to calm fears “ in a sense , the internal security situation , at least unofficially , has never been deemed so dangerous , “ said hippler .
“ it would have been different if the government had been more loose in its words and actions . ” there is also little difference in the way both schröder ’ s social democratic party and his challenger , edmund stoiber and his christian democratic and christian social union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- bloc , approach the anti-terrorism fight . the cdu / csu and spd look at foreign policy and domestic security in the same context .
the union bloc argues that instability on german soil is often connected to instablity caused by a country ’ s foreign policy .
the red-green coalition says that many of the union ’ s suggestions , such as increased cooperation between immigration and police authorities , have already been put into place . even schily ’ s challenger in the union bloc , hard-line bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , grudgingly admires the former green party member ’ s tough stance on domestic security .
“ schily and i went to the same school , ” beckstein has told reporters in the past . as a result , campaign managers on both sides , eager to play up differences between the cdu / csu and spd , have pushed more divisive issues further up the agenda . law enforcement wants terrorism back on the agenda the absence of terrorism in today ’ s political agenda has made it difficult for at least one interested bloc : the country ’ s law enforcement lobby .
since interest in domestic security died down , police lobbyist rüdiger holecek has had a difficult time bringing complaints of underfunding and staffing to the government ’ s attention . holecek , of the country ’ s police union , says that the government ’ s domestic security plan has overstretched an already overburdened police force .
more officers have been recruited into the country ’ s federal domestic security agency , the verfassungschutz , without enough money being left over for adequate replacements . “ we ’ re suffering as a result of this inattention , ” holecek told dw-world . the group , which represents the interests of more than 190 000 officers in germany , plans to call attention to itself during a press conference on sept .

at the conference the union will present a handbook on terrorist activity in germany .

11 terrorist in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm announces charges morrocan born mounir el motassadeq will face at least 3,116 counts of accessory to murder for his alleged role in helping mohammed atta 's hamburg cell plan the sept .
11 terror attack . close to a year after the terror attacks of sept .
11 , the federal prosecutors office in germany announced it filed criminal charges this week against a hamburg man suspected of aiding in the planning and financing of the attacks .
the charges are the first against a german member of the terror cell responsible for the attacks .
on thursday , federal prosecutor kay nehm said the suspect , morrocan citizen mounir el motassadeq , was charged on wednesday as an accessory to murder in the killings of at least 3,116 people in new york and washington and for membership in a terrorist organization .
prosecutors believe the 28-year-old student was deeply involved in the hamburg terror cell led by mohammed atta that carried out the deadly attacks .
the case has brought many previously unknown facts about the sept .
11 attacks to light .
investigators here now believe the terrorist cell had begun planning a major attack as far back as oct .
1999 , and that the world trade center first emerged as a possible target in april or may 2000 .
at the time , nehm said , hijacker marwan al shehhi told a hamburg librarian of his intentions .
" there will be thousands of dead , you will all think of me , " he reportedly said .
nehm said he also uttered the words " world trade center . "
a member " right up to the end " authorities arrested electrical engineering student el motassadeq in nov .
2001 , and he has been held in investigative custody since then in a jail in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
nehm said motassadeq had maintained intensive contacts with the terror cell for several years and also lived in the same neighborhood as the terrorists with his wife and child .
nehm said he believes motassadeq " remained part of the assassination preparations right up to the end . "
motassadeq played a definitive role in the financing of the hamburg terror cell 's activities , the indictement stated . he held power of attorney over , as well as an automated teller card for , a bank account that had originally been opened by al shehhi , one of the terrorists who died in the airplane attacks .
prosecutor nehm said the terrorists used the hamburg bank account to pay for pilot training for said bahaji and zakariya essabar in the united states .
al qaeda terrorists also allegedly used the account to pay their expenses while living in the u.s. both are still on the run from authorities .
nehm described motassadeq as a " governor in hamburg " for the terror cell during the time atta and others were in taking classes in u.s. flight schools .
additionally , nehm said , motassadeq 's signature appeared on a testament written by atta that surfaced after the deadly attacks were carried out .
training in afghanistan between may and august 2000 , prosecutors said , motassadeq spent time in an al qaeda terror training camp located near kandahar in afghanistan .
" in addition to ideological and military traning , such visits were also used by leaders of the international network to discuss and agree on details of attacks and the logistical support needed to carry them out , " nehm said .
meanwhile , prosecutors say they have learned little from statements made by motassadeq following his arrest , with chief prosecutor nehm describing his statements as " meaningless . "
in december , motassadeq denied any involvement in the attacks ' planning as well as membership in al qaeda .
an attorney representing motassadeq on thursday described the 90-page indictment against him as " sparse . "
a trial against motassadeq , however , is still on schedule to commence in october .
the birth of a terror cell in his press conference on thursday , nehm also rehashed detailed conclusions drawn by investigators about the origins of the hamburg terror cell and its members .
the group , comprised initially of seven students , came together in hamburg during the early 1990s .
cell leader atta , second wtc pilot al shehhi and third pilot ziad jarrah were all part of the group .
" all of the members of this cell shared the same religious convictions , an islamic lifestyle , a feeling of being out of place in unfamiliar cultural surroundings , " nehm said .
" at the center of this stood the hatred of the world 's jews and the u.s. "
nehm said el motassadeq had served as a logistician for the terror cell along with three other men who are still being sought by authorities , including ramsi binalshibh , bahaji and essabar .
neither bahaji nor essabar were able to participate in the attacks because immigration officials rejected their visa applications to travel to the u.s. the group 's mission , according to nehm , was " the militant rejection of western society and its values and the defense of the muslim world against non-muslims , including through terrorist acts , was the basis of the group 's activities .

11 terrorist in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm announces charges morrocan born mounir el motassadeq will face at least 3,116 counts of accessory to murder for his alleged role in helping mohammed atta 's hamburg cell plan the sept .
11 terror attack . close to a year after the terror attacks of sept .
11 , the federal prosecutors office in germany announced it filed criminal charges this week against a hamburg man suspected of aiding in the planning and financing of the attacks .
the charges are the first against a german member of the terror cell responsible for the attacks .
on thursday , federal prosecutor kay nehm said the suspect , morrocan citizen mounir el motassadeq , was charged on wednesday as an accessory to murder in the killings of at least 3,116 people in new york and washington and for membership in a terrorist organization .
prosecutors believe the 28-year-old student was deeply involved in the hamburg terror cell led by mohammed atta that carried out the deadly attacks .
the case has brought many previously unknown facts about the sept .
11 attacks to light .
investigators here now believe the terrorist cell had begun planning a major attack as far back as oct .
1999 , and that the world trade center first emerged as a possible target in april or may 2000 .
at the time , nehm said , hijacker marwan al shehhi told a hamburg librarian of his intentions .
" there will be thousands of dead , you will all think of me , " he reportedly said .
nehm said he also uttered the words " world trade center . "
a member " right up to the end " authorities arrested electrical engineering student el motassadeq in nov .
2001 , and he has been held in investigative custody since then in a jail in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
nehm said motassadeq had maintained intensive contacts with the terror cell for several years and also lived in the same neighborhood as the terrorists with his wife and child .
nehm said he believes motassadeq " remained part of the assassination preparations right up to the end . "
motassadeq played a definitive role in the financing of the hamburg terror cell 's activities , the indictement stated . he held power of attorney over , as well as an automated teller card for , a bank account that had originally been opened by al shehhi , one of the terrorists who died in the airplane attacks .
prosecutor nehm said the terrorists used the hamburg bank account to pay for pilot training for said bahaji and zakariya essabar in the united states .
al qaeda terrorists also allegedly used the account to pay their expenses while living in the u.s. both are still on the run from authorities .
nehm described motassadeq as a " governor in hamburg " for the terror cell during the time atta and others were in taking classes in u.s. flight schools .

western countries are promoting “ public-private partnerships ” at the earth summit in johannesburg as a path to sustainable development .
environmentalists are skeptical , saying it puts big business before people . led by the united states , western countries showcased partnerships on thursday between governments , private industry and other groups as a practical way of furthering economic development and saving the environment . they say such partnerships are ways for business and governments to pool their resources and harness the funds and the know-how to accomplish more than either could on its own . un organizers say they have received 218 proposed partnerships , in areas ranging from health care to renewable energy projects that could go a long way in helping meet summit goals of halving global poverty by 2015 while slowing environmental degradation . congo project a multi-nation project to expand efforts to save forests in central africa ’ s congo basin was announced on thursday .
germany , the us , japan and indonesia are among the countries that want to provide an additional $ 53 million dollars over four years to a partnership between the paper industry active in the region and the local population .
the plan aims to develop protected forest areas and cut down on illegal logging . but many environmentalists are wary of relying on private business to save the planet .
they say partnerships may let companies cash in on providing essential services like water and electricity , while allowing governments to shirk their traditional responsibilities . “ if a government doesn ’ t do its regulation homework , it could be more than happy to let a private company come in and take over things , ” jörg kusche with greenpeace in germany told dw-world .
“ but then there would be no transparency or accountability .
we don ’ t think that ’ s the right direction . ” he and other environmental activists have expressed concern that public-private partnerships will be used by big business as an exercise in “ greenwash ” – putting a cloak of environmental responsibility around a company that could mask activities that could actually be damaging to the environment or people in development countries . martin kaiser , international environmental expert for greenpeace who is in johannesburg , criticised the congo plan after it was announced saying it appeared to have been developed largely by the paper industry with only minimal input from indigenous groups threatened by the congo forests ’ destruction . “ there ’ s already a lot of criticism about these initiatives .
a lot seem to be one-sided in favor of industry , ” he told dw-world . in un parlance , these public-private agreements are called “ type 2 ” initiatives .
the idea is that these voluntary programs can be decided on and launched quickly by the parties involved as opposed to being endorsed by the “ type 1 ” process , which requires the approval of an international forum and can be bureaucratic and time-consuming . “ we think it would be more sensible if these were a completion of type 1 initiatives and a part of binding agreements instead of just voluntary ones , whose outcome is anything but certain , ” kusche said . practical steps but the americans at the summit see such agreements as practical steps towards sustainable development .
public funds used in partnerships , according to us thinking , can leverage private investment .
assistant secretary of state john turner said the us plans on commiting $ 970 million over the next three years to water projects , but expects to mobilize more than $ 1.6 billion through partnerships . the us agency for international development presented a $ 90 million proposal to fight hunger in africa by teaming up with regional trade groups and industry partners . paula dobriansky , a us undersecretary of state for global affairs , dismissed skepticism on the part of some activists . “ i have found a great deal of enthusiasm … all want to see us really have some action here , ” she said . european union officials were also talking up several of their proposed projects on thursday , including agreements in energy and water management .
but they were more circumspect than their translatlantic partners about the extent to which public-private partnerships can solve all the world ’ s problems . in a statement , danish environment minister hans christian schmidt , who is representing the eu in johannesburg , cautioned against upsetting the balance between the public and private part of the equation . “ partnerships are a complement to -lrb- government -rrb- commitments , ” he said , “ not a substitute for them . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de on the green road from rio to johannesburg the un summit in johannesburg next week has been dubbed " rio + 10 " or " earth summit 2 " .

environmentalists are skeptical , saying it puts big business before people . led by the united states , western countries showcased partnerships on thursday between governments , private industry and other groups as a practical way of furthering economic development and saving the environment . they say such partnerships are ways for business and governments to pool their resources and harness the funds and the know-how to accomplish more than either could on its own . un organizers say they have received 218 proposed partnerships , in areas ranging from health care to renewable energy projects that could go a long way in helping meet summit goals of halving global poverty by 2015 while slowing environmental degradation . congo project a multi-nation project to expand efforts to save forests in central africa ’ s congo basin was announced on thursday .
germany , the us , japan and indonesia are among the countries that want to provide an additional $ 53 million dollars over four years to a partnership between the paper industry active in the region and the local population .
the plan aims to develop protected forest areas and cut down on illegal logging . but many environmentalists are wary of relying on private business to save the planet .
they say partnerships may let companies cash in on providing essential services like water and electricity , while allowing governments to shirk their traditional responsibilities . “ if a government doesn ’ t do its regulation homework , it could be more than happy to let a private company come in and take over things , ” jörg kusche with greenpeace in germany told dw-world .
“ but then there would be no transparency or accountability .
we don ’ t think that ’ s the right direction . ” he and other environmental activists have expressed concern that public-private partnerships will be used by big business as an exercise in “ greenwash ” – putting a cloak of environmental responsibility around a company that could mask activities that could actually be damaging to the environment or people in development countries . martin kaiser , international environmental expert for greenpeace who is in johannesburg , criticised the congo plan after it was announced saying it appeared to have been developed largely by the paper industry with only minimal input from indigenous groups threatened by the congo forests ’ destruction . “ there ’ s already a lot of criticism about these initiatives .
a lot seem to be one-sided in favor of industry , ” he told dw-world . in un parlance , these public-private agreements are called “ type 2 ” initiatives .
the idea is that these voluntary programs can be decided on and launched quickly by the parties involved as opposed to being endorsed by the “ type 1 ” process , which requires the approval of an international forum and can be bureaucratic and time-consuming . “ we think it would be more sensible if these were a completion of type 1 initiatives and a part of binding agreements instead of just voluntary ones , whose outcome is anything but certain , ” kusche said . practical steps but the americans at the summit see such agreements as practical steps towards sustainable development .
public funds used in partnerships , according to us thinking , can leverage private investment .
assistant secretary of state john turner said the us plans on commiting $ 970 million over the next three years to water projects , but expects to mobilize more than $ 1.6 billion through partnerships . the us agency for international development presented a $ 90 million proposal to fight hunger in africa by teaming up with regional trade groups and industry partners . paula dobriansky , a us undersecretary of state for global affairs , dismissed skepticism on the part of some activists . “ i have found a great deal of enthusiasm … all want to see us really have some action here , ” she said . european union officials were also talking up several of their proposed projects on thursday , including agreements in energy and water management .
but they were more circumspect than their translatlantic partners about the extent to which public-private partnerships can solve all the world ’ s problems . in a statement , danish environment minister hans christian schmidt , who is representing the eu in johannesburg , cautioned against upsetting the balance between the public and private part of the equation . “ partnerships are a complement to -lrb- government -rrb- commitments , ” he said , “ not a substitute for them . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de on the green road from rio to johannesburg the un summit in johannesburg next week has been dubbed " rio + 10 " or " earth summit 2 " .

11 terrorist in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm announces charges morrocan born mounir el motassadeq will face at least 3,116 counts of accessory to murder for his alleged role in helping mohammed atta 's hamburg cell plan the sept .
11 terror attack . close to a year after the terror attacks of sept .
11 , the federal prosecutors office in germany announced it filed criminal charges this week against a hamburg man suspected of aiding in the planning and financing of the attacks .
the charges are the first against a german member of the terror cell responsible for the attacks .
on thursday , federal prosecutor kay nehm said the suspect , morrocan citizen mounir el motassadeq , was charged on wednesday as an accessory to murder in the killings of at least 3,116 people in new york and washington and for membership in a terrorist organization .
prosecutors believe the 28-year-old student was deeply involved in the hamburg terror cell led by mohammed atta that carried out the deadly attacks .
the case has brought many previously unknown facts about the sept .
11 attacks to light .
investigators here now believe the terrorist cell had begun planning a major attack as far back as oct .
1999 , and that the world trade center first emerged as a possible target in april or may 2000 .
at the time , nehm said , hijacker marwan al shehhi told a hamburg librarian of his intentions .
" there will be thousands of dead , you will all think of me , " he reportedly said .
nehm said he also uttered the words " world trade center . "
a member " right up to the end " authorities arrested electrical engineering student el motassadeq in nov .
2001 , and he has been held in investigative custody since then in a jail in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
nehm said motassadeq had maintained intensive contacts with the terror cell for several years and also lived in the same neighborhood as the terrorists with his wife and child .
nehm said he believes motassadeq " remained part of the assassination preparations right up to the end . "
motassadeq played a definitive role in the financing of the hamburg terror cell 's activities , the indictement stated . he held power of attorney over , as well as an automated teller card for , a bank account that had originally been opened by al shehhi , one of the terrorists who died in the airplane attacks .
prosecutor nehm said the terrorists used the hamburg bank account to pay for pilot training for said bahaji and zakariya essabar in the united states .
al qaeda terrorists also allegedly used the account to pay their expenses while living in the u.s. both are still on the run from authorities .
nehm described motassadeq as a " governor in hamburg " for the terror cell during the time atta and others were in taking classes in u.s. flight schools .
additionally , nehm said , motassadeq 's signature appeared on a testament written by atta that surfaced after the deadly attacks were carried out .
training in afghanistan between may and august 2000 , prosecutors said , motassadeq spent time in an al qaeda terror training camp located near kandahar in afghanistan .
" in addition to ideological and military traning , such visits were also used by leaders of the international network to discuss and agree on details of attacks and the logistical support needed to carry them out , " nehm said .
meanwhile , prosecutors say they have learned little from statements made by motassadeq following his arrest , with chief prosecutor nehm describing his statements as " meaningless . "
in december , motassadeq denied any involvement in the attacks ' planning as well as membership in al qaeda .
an attorney representing motassadeq on thursday described the 90-page indictment against him as " sparse . "
a trial against motassadeq , however , is still on schedule to commence in october .
the birth of a terror cell in his press conference on thursday , nehm also rehashed detailed conclusions drawn by investigators about the origins of the hamburg terror cell and its members .
the group , comprised initially of seven students , came together in hamburg during the early 1990s .
cell leader atta , second wtc pilot al shehhi and third pilot ziad jarrah were all part of the group .
" all of the members of this cell shared the same religious convictions , an islamic lifestyle , a feeling of being out of place in unfamiliar cultural surroundings , " nehm said .
" at the center of this stood the hatred of the world 's jews and the u.s. "
nehm said el motassadeq had served as a logistician for the terror cell along with three other men who are still being sought by authorities , including ramsi binalshibh , bahaji and essabar .
neither bahaji nor essabar were able to participate in the attacks because immigration officials rejected their visa applications to travel to the u.s. the group 's mission , according to nehm , was " the militant rejection of western society and its values and the defense of the muslim world against non-muslims , including through terrorist acts , was the basis of the group 's activities .

as far as actually financing the repair of the damages went , heated arguments and acrimonious debates were the order of the day .
opening the debate , german chancellor gerhard schröder said that the floods had caused the worst damage in germany since the second world war .
he thanked the scores of voluntary and professional helpers who had laboured to pile sandbags and help people to safety .
" not just a catastrophic flood , but also an unbelievable wave of solidarity has swept through germany " , he said .
stoiber on the offensive opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- sharply criticised the government ’ s plan to finance a large chunk of the 10 billion euro -lrb- dollar -rrb- flood relief package by postponing next year 's scheduled tax reform and increasing the corporation tax .
he said that the opposition union bloc had chosen not to block the government 's plans to avoid " fighting on the backs of the victims " .
but he emphasised that he thinks the government 's strategy is wrong .
" high taxes will cripple economic performance , stem growth , destroy jobs " , he said .
the opposition is pushing instead to use the profits of germany 's central bank to finance flood repairs .
" higher interest rates are a lesser evil compared to higher taxes " , stoiber said .
pulling out his main weapon against schröder in the current election campaign , stoiber added that that recent floods were germany 's second national catastrophe of the summer , the first being the country 's four million unemployed .
social democrats deride opposition proposal but chancellor schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- vehemently opposes using central bank profits .
schröder has called it " socially imbalanced " and accused the opposition of wanting to burden future generations with more debt .
german foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party said that higher debts would hurt the country 's competitiveness .
free democrats want to go third way the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- joined the union parties in opposing the planned hike in corporation taxes .
fdp leader guido westerwelle accused the government of worsening the flood catastrophe through another " catastrophe " of higher taxes .
but the union bloc 's financing suggestion did n't meet with the liberals ' approval either .
the money instead should come from diverting funds and saving in other areas , westerwelle said .
pds wants money from military projects parliamentary floor leader of the party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- , roland claus , called upon the government to cancel planned weapons projects such as the military transporter a400 m in order to finance repairs .
if schröder says he doesn ’ t want a military adventure in iraq , " then he can do without a military adventure gadget " , he said .
will the relief package suffice ?
despite the barbed debates , georg milbrandt , the premier of one of the most affected states , saxony , took comfort in the fact that that the relief package could be coming soon .
but he was skeptical about whether 10 billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in direct financial assistance approved earlier this week would be enough .
for saxony alone , the premier estimated damage costs could run as high as 15 billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- .
the draft flood relief legislation should go through both chambers of parliament before the september 22 federal elections . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flood relief on its way the german cabinet has approved the draft law for helping the country 's flood victims .

western countries are promoting “ public-private partnerships ” at the earth summit in johannesburg as a path to sustainable development .
environmentalists are skeptical , saying it puts big business before people . led by the united states , western countries showcased partnerships on thursday between governments , private industry and other groups as a practical way of furthering economic development and saving the environment . they say such partnerships are ways for business and governments to pool their resources and harness the funds and the know-how to accomplish more than either could on its own . un organizers say they have received 218 proposed partnerships , in areas ranging from health care to renewable energy projects that could go a long way in helping meet summit goals of halving global poverty by 2015 while slowing environmental degradation . congo project a multi-nation project to expand efforts to save forests in central africa ’ s congo basin was announced on thursday .
germany , the us , japan and indonesia are among the countries that want to provide an additional $ 53 million dollars over four years to a partnership between the paper industry active in the region and the local population .
the plan aims to develop protected forest areas and cut down on illegal logging . but many environmentalists are wary of relying on private business to save the planet .
they say partnerships may let companies cash in on providing essential services like water and electricity , while allowing governments to shirk their traditional responsibilities . “ if a government doesn ’ t do its regulation homework , it could be more than happy to let a private company come in and take over things , ” jörg kusche with greenpeace in germany told dw-world .
“ but then there would be no transparency or accountability .
we don ’ t think that ’ s the right direction . ” he and other environmental activists have expressed concern that public-private partnerships will be used by big business as an exercise in “ greenwash ” – putting a cloak of environmental responsibility around a company that could mask activities that could actually be damaging to the environment or people in development countries . martin kaiser , international environmental expert for greenpeace who is in johannesburg , criticised the congo plan after it was announced saying it appeared to have been developed largely by the paper industry with only minimal input from indigenous groups threatened by the congo forests ’ destruction . “ there ’ s already a lot of criticism about these initiatives .
a lot seem to be one-sided in favor of industry , ” he told dw-world . in un parlance , these public-private agreements are called “ type 2 ” initiatives .
the idea is that these voluntary programs can be decided on and launched quickly by the parties involved as opposed to being endorsed by the “ type 1 ” process , which requires the approval of an international forum and can be bureaucratic and time-consuming . “ we think it would be more sensible if these were a completion of type 1 initiatives and a part of binding agreements instead of just voluntary ones , whose outcome is anything but certain , ” kusche said . practical steps but the americans at the summit see such agreements as practical steps towards sustainable development .
public funds used in partnerships , according to us thinking , can leverage private investment .
assistant secretary of state john turner said the us plans on commiting $ 970 million over the next three years to water projects , but expects to mobilize more than $ 1.6 billion through partnerships . the us agency for international development presented a $ 90 million proposal to fight hunger in africa by teaming up with regional trade groups and industry partners . paula dobriansky , a us undersecretary of state for global affairs , dismissed skepticism on the part of some activists . “ i have found a great deal of enthusiasm … all want to see us really have some action here , ” she said . european union officials were also talking up several of their proposed projects on thursday , including agreements in energy and water management .
but they were more circumspect than their translatlantic partners about the extent to which public-private partnerships can solve all the world ’ s problems . in a statement , danish environment minister hans christian schmidt , who is representing the eu in johannesburg , cautioned against upsetting the balance between the public and private part of the equation . “ partnerships are a complement to -lrb- government -rrb- commitments , ” he said , “ not a substitute for them . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de on the green road from rio to johannesburg the un summit in johannesburg next week has been dubbed " rio + 10 " or " earth summit 2 " .

11 terrorist in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm announces charges morrocan born mounir el motassadeq will face at least 3,116 counts of accessory to murder for his alleged role in helping mohammed atta 's hamburg cell plan the sept .
11 terror attack . close to a year after the terror attacks of sept .
11 , the federal prosecutors office in germany announced it filed criminal charges this week against a hamburg man suspected of aiding in the planning and financing of the attacks .
the charges are the first against a german member of the terror cell responsible for the attacks .
on thursday , federal prosecutor kay nehm said the suspect , morrocan citizen mounir el motassadeq , was charged on wednesday as an accessory to murder in the killings of at least 3,116 people in new york and washington and for membership in a terrorist organization .
prosecutors believe the 28-year-old student was deeply involved in the hamburg terror cell led by mohammed atta that carried out the deadly attacks .
the case has brought many previously unknown facts about the sept .
11 attacks to light .
investigators here now believe the terrorist cell had begun planning a major attack as far back as oct .
1999 , and that the world trade center first emerged as a possible target in april or may 2000 .
at the time , nehm said , hijacker marwan al shehhi told a hamburg librarian of his intentions .
" there will be thousands of dead , you will all think of me , " he reportedly said .
nehm said he also uttered the words " world trade center . "
a member " right up to the end " authorities arrested electrical engineering student el motassadeq in nov .
2001 , and he has been held in investigative custody since then in a jail in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
nehm said motassadeq had maintained intensive contacts with the terror cell for several years and also lived in the same neighborhood as the terrorists with his wife and child .
nehm said he believes motassadeq " remained part of the assassination preparations right up to the end . "
motassadeq played a definitive role in the financing of the hamburg terror cell 's activities , the indictement stated . he held power of attorney over , as well as an automated teller card for , a bank account that had originally been opened by al shehhi , one of the terrorists who died in the airplane attacks .
prosecutor nehm said the terrorists used the hamburg bank account to pay for pilot training for said bahaji and zakariya essabar in the united states .
al qaeda terrorists also allegedly used the account to pay their expenses while living in the u.s. both are still on the run from authorities .
nehm described motassadeq as a " governor in hamburg " for the terror cell during the time atta and others were in taking classes in u.s. flight schools .
additionally , nehm said , motassadeq 's signature appeared on a testament written by atta that surfaced after the deadly attacks were carried out .
training in afghanistan between may and august 2000 , prosecutors said , motassadeq spent time in an al qaeda terror training camp located near kandahar in afghanistan .
" in addition to ideological and military traning , such visits were also used by leaders of the international network to discuss and agree on details of attacks and the logistical support needed to carry them out , " nehm said .
meanwhile , prosecutors say they have learned little from statements made by motassadeq following his arrest , with chief prosecutor nehm describing his statements as " meaningless . "
in december , motassadeq denied any involvement in the attacks ' planning as well as membership in al qaeda .
an attorney representing motassadeq on thursday described the 90-page indictment against him as " sparse . "
a trial against motassadeq , however , is still on schedule to commence in october .
the birth of a terror cell in his press conference on thursday , nehm also rehashed detailed conclusions drawn by investigators about the origins of the hamburg terror cell and its members .
the group , comprised initially of seven students , came together in hamburg during the early 1990s .
cell leader atta , second wtc pilot al shehhi and third pilot ziad jarrah were all part of the group .

as far as actually financing the repair of the damages went , heated arguments and acrimonious debates were the order of the day .
opening the debate , german chancellor gerhard schröder said that the floods had caused the worst damage in germany since the second world war .
he thanked the scores of voluntary and professional helpers who had laboured to pile sandbags and help people to safety .
" not just a catastrophic flood , but also an unbelievable wave of solidarity has swept through germany " , he said .
stoiber on the offensive opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- sharply criticised the government ’ s plan to finance a large chunk of the 10 billion euro -lrb- dollar -rrb- flood relief package by postponing next year 's scheduled tax reform and increasing the corporation tax .
he said that the opposition union bloc had chosen not to block the government 's plans to avoid " fighting on the backs of the victims " .
but he emphasised that he thinks the government 's strategy is wrong .
" high taxes will cripple economic performance , stem growth , destroy jobs " , he said .
the opposition is pushing instead to use the profits of germany 's central bank to finance flood repairs .
" higher interest rates are a lesser evil compared to higher taxes " , stoiber said .
pulling out his main weapon against schröder in the current election campaign , stoiber added that that recent floods were germany 's second national catastrophe of the summer , the first being the country 's four million unemployed .
social democrats deride opposition proposal but chancellor schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- vehemently opposes using central bank profits .
schröder has called it " socially imbalanced " and accused the opposition of wanting to burden future generations with more debt .
german foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party said that higher debts would hurt the country 's competitiveness .
free democrats want to go third way the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- joined the union parties in opposing the planned hike in corporation taxes .
fdp leader guido westerwelle accused the government of worsening the flood catastrophe through another " catastrophe " of higher taxes .
but the union bloc 's financing suggestion did n't meet with the liberals ' approval either .
the money instead should come from diverting funds and saving in other areas , westerwelle said .
pds wants money from military projects parliamentary floor leader of the party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- , roland claus , called upon the government to cancel planned weapons projects such as the military transporter a400 m in order to finance repairs .
if schröder says he doesn ’ t want a military adventure in iraq , " then he can do without a military adventure gadget " , he said .
will the relief package suffice ?
despite the barbed debates , georg milbrandt , the premier of one of the most affected states , saxony , took comfort in the fact that that the relief package could be coming soon .
but he was skeptical about whether 10 billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in direct financial assistance approved earlier this week would be enough .
for saxony alone , the premier estimated damage costs could run as high as 15 billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- .
the draft flood relief legislation should go through both chambers of parliament before the september 22 federal elections . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flood relief on its way the german cabinet has approved the draft law for helping the country 's flood victims .

western countries are promoting “ public-private partnerships ” at the earth summit in johannesburg as a path to sustainable development .
environmentalists are skeptical , saying it puts big business before people . led by the united states , western countries showcased partnerships on thursday between governments , private industry and other groups as a practical way of furthering economic development and saving the environment . they say such partnerships are ways for business and governments to pool their resources and harness the funds and the know-how to accomplish more than either could on its own . un organizers say they have received 218 proposed partnerships , in areas ranging from health care to renewable energy projects that could go a long way in helping meet summit goals of halving global poverty by 2015 while slowing environmental degradation . congo project a multi-nation project to expand efforts to save forests in central africa ’ s congo basin was announced on thursday .
germany , the us , japan and indonesia are among the countries that want to provide an additional $ 53 million dollars over four years to a partnership between the paper industry active in the region and the local population .
the plan aims to develop protected forest areas and cut down on illegal logging . but many environmentalists are wary of relying on private business to save the planet .
they say partnerships may let companies cash in on providing essential services like water and electricity , while allowing governments to shirk their traditional responsibilities . “ if a government doesn ’ t do its regulation homework , it could be more than happy to let a private company come in and take over things , ” jörg kusche with greenpeace in germany told dw-world .
“ but then there would be no transparency or accountability .
we don ’ t think that ’ s the right direction . ” he and other environmental activists have expressed concern that public-private partnerships will be used by big business as an exercise in “ greenwash ” – putting a cloak of environmental responsibility around a company that could mask activities that could actually be damaging to the environment or people in development countries . martin kaiser , international environmental expert for greenpeace who is in johannesburg , criticised the congo plan after it was announced saying it appeared to have been developed largely by the paper industry with only minimal input from indigenous groups threatened by the congo forests ’ destruction . “ there ’ s already a lot of criticism about these initiatives .
a lot seem to be one-sided in favor of industry , ” he told dw-world . in un parlance , these public-private agreements are called “ type 2 ” initiatives .
the idea is that these voluntary programs can be decided on and launched quickly by the parties involved as opposed to being endorsed by the “ type 1 ” process , which requires the approval of an international forum and can be bureaucratic and time-consuming . “ we think it would be more sensible if these were a completion of type 1 initiatives and a part of binding agreements instead of just voluntary ones , whose outcome is anything but certain , ” kusche said . practical steps but the americans at the summit see such agreements as practical steps towards sustainable development .
public funds used in partnerships , according to us thinking , can leverage private investment .
assistant secretary of state john turner said the us plans on commiting $ 970 million over the next three years to water projects , but expects to mobilize more than $ 1.6 billion through partnerships . the us agency for international development presented a $ 90 million proposal to fight hunger in africa by teaming up with regional trade groups and industry partners . paula dobriansky , a us undersecretary of state for global affairs , dismissed skepticism on the part of some activists . “ i have found a great deal of enthusiasm … all want to see us really have some action here , ” she said . european union officials were also talking up several of their proposed projects on thursday , including agreements in energy and water management .
but they were more circumspect than their translatlantic partners about the extent to which public-private partnerships can solve all the world ’ s problems . in a statement , danish environment minister hans christian schmidt , who is representing the eu in johannesburg , cautioned against upsetting the balance between the public and private part of the equation . “ partnerships are a complement to -lrb- government -rrb- commitments , ” he said , “ not a substitute for them . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de on the green road from rio to johannesburg the un summit in johannesburg next week has been dubbed " rio + 10 " or " earth summit 2 " .

as far as actually financing the repair of the damages went , heated arguments and acrimonious debates were the order of the day .
opening the debate , german chancellor gerhard schröder said that the floods had caused the worst damage in germany since the second world war .
he thanked the scores of voluntary and professional helpers who had laboured to pile sandbags and help people to safety .
" not just a catastrophic flood , but also an unbelievable wave of solidarity has swept through germany " , he said .
stoiber on the offensive opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- sharply criticised the government ’ s plan to finance a large chunk of the 10 billion euro -lrb- dollar -rrb- flood relief package by postponing next year 's scheduled tax reform and increasing the corporation tax .
he said that the opposition union bloc had chosen not to block the government 's plans to avoid " fighting on the backs of the victims " .
but he emphasised that he thinks the government 's strategy is wrong .
" high taxes will cripple economic performance , stem growth , destroy jobs " , he said .
the opposition is pushing instead to use the profits of germany 's central bank to finance flood repairs .
" higher interest rates are a lesser evil compared to higher taxes " , stoiber said .
pulling out his main weapon against schröder in the current election campaign , stoiber added that that recent floods were germany 's second national catastrophe of the summer , the first being the country 's four million unemployed .
social democrats deride opposition proposal but chancellor schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- vehemently opposes using central bank profits .
schröder has called it " socially imbalanced " and accused the opposition of wanting to burden future generations with more debt .
german foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party said that higher debts would hurt the country 's competitiveness .
free democrats want to go third way the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- joined the union parties in opposing the planned hike in corporation taxes .
fdp leader guido westerwelle accused the government of worsening the flood catastrophe through another " catastrophe " of higher taxes .
but the union bloc 's financing suggestion did n't meet with the liberals ' approval either .
the money instead should come from diverting funds and saving in other areas , westerwelle said .
pds wants money from military projects parliamentary floor leader of the party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- , roland claus , called upon the government to cancel planned weapons projects such as the military transporter a400 m in order to finance repairs .
if schröder says he doesn ’ t want a military adventure in iraq , " then he can do without a military adventure gadget " , he said .
will the relief package suffice ?
despite the barbed debates , georg milbrandt , the premier of one of the most affected states , saxony , took comfort in the fact that that the relief package could be coming soon .
but he was skeptical about whether 10 billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in direct financial assistance approved earlier this week would be enough .

“ it ’ s … about the future of our children , ” he told delegates at the united nations summit on sustainable development in south africa , which will wind up this wednesday .
“ that ’ s why this conference should encourage the states who have not yet ratified the kyoto protocol , to do that as quickly as possible so that it can come into effect next year . ” kyoto protocol a sticking point at summit the protocol , agreed on in 1997 , calls on its signatories to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from their 1990 stand by 5.2 percent by 2012 . the usa and australia , among other nations , have so far refused to sign it .
the protocol , therefore , is now relying on the russian parliament ’ s ratification before it can take effect . the protocol remains one of the unresolved disputes as the conference winds its way down .
after last week ’ s delegations , the first governmental ministers started arriving in johannesburg over the weekend to smooth out differences on disputes over renewable energies and access to water before the arrival of schröder and other heads of state on monday . as at the inaugural earth summit in rio de janeiro in 1992 , government leaders will affix their signature to a 70-page action plan at the conclusion of the summit .
the agreement will aim to provide a blueprint on global environmental and developmental policy over the next decade . solar , wind power still an obstacle around 95 percent of the plan has been agreed on , according to reports from the summit , but the remaining 5 percent contains a host of controversial topics – chief among them a quota on renewable energy . germany , along with the european union and a clutch of other nations , wants renewable energies , such as wind and solar power to comprise 15 percent of the world ’ s energy use by 2010 - 2 percent more than it is now . the united states and smaller , oil-producing nations are against setting such a timetable . environmental organizations are saying the plan isn ’ t aggressive enough . schröder used his speech to praise his country 's commitment to renewable energy and urge the rest of the conference to follow germany 's lead . “ with the efficient use of energy and the massive expansion of the renewable energy sector , we will have pointed the way to the future , ” schröder told conference participants , among them united nations general secretary kofi annan and south african president thabo mbeki . he said the german government would spend 100 million euro a year over the next five years to work with developing countries on increasing their use of renewable energy .
he also said his country would take part in a global network of energy agencies agreed on sunday and invited conference participants to an international renewable energy conference in germany . drinking water a crucial step in fighting poverty echoing his development and aid minister , heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who attended the conference earlier , schröder called for a more effective battle against poverty .
the eu member states , he said , will raise their public aid budget from the current 26 billion euro to 35 billion euro in 2006 .
providing clean drinking water to populations in developing countries will also form a central plank of the fight against poverty .
earlier german environmental minister jürgen trittin told dw-tv that the reduction of poverty will " only be possible with access to the basic requirement of life : water . "

11 terrorist in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm announces charges morrocan born mounir el motassadeq will face at least 3,116 counts of accessory to murder for his alleged role in helping mohammed atta 's hamburg cell plan the sept .
11 terror attack . close to a year after the terror attacks of sept .
11 , the federal prosecutors office in germany announced it filed criminal charges this week against a hamburg man suspected of aiding in the planning and financing of the attacks .
the charges are the first against a german member of the terror cell responsible for the attacks .
on thursday , federal prosecutor kay nehm said the suspect , morrocan citizen mounir el motassadeq , was charged on wednesday as an accessory to murder in the killings of at least 3,116 people in new york and washington and for membership in a terrorist organization .
prosecutors believe the 28-year-old student was deeply involved in the hamburg terror cell led by mohammed atta that carried out the deadly attacks .
the case has brought many previously unknown facts about the sept .
11 attacks to light .
investigators here now believe the terrorist cell had begun planning a major attack as far back as oct .
1999 , and that the world trade center first emerged as a possible target in april or may 2000 .
at the time , nehm said , hijacker marwan al shehhi told a hamburg librarian of his intentions .
" there will be thousands of dead , you will all think of me , " he reportedly said .
nehm said he also uttered the words " world trade center . "
a member " right up to the end " authorities arrested electrical engineering student el motassadeq in nov .
2001 , and he has been held in investigative custody since then in a jail in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
nehm said motassadeq had maintained intensive contacts with the terror cell for several years and also lived in the same neighborhood as the terrorists with his wife and child .
nehm said he believes motassadeq " remained part of the assassination preparations right up to the end . "
motassadeq played a definitive role in the financing of the hamburg terror cell 's activities , the indictement stated . he held power of attorney over , as well as an automated teller card for , a bank account that had originally been opened by al shehhi , one of the terrorists who died in the airplane attacks .
prosecutor nehm said the terrorists used the hamburg bank account to pay for pilot training for said bahaji and zakariya essabar in the united states .
al qaeda terrorists also allegedly used the account to pay their expenses while living in the u.s. both are still on the run from authorities .
nehm described motassadeq as a " governor in hamburg " for the terror cell during the time atta and others were in taking classes in u.s. flight schools .
additionally , nehm said , motassadeq 's signature appeared on a testament written by atta that surfaced after the deadly attacks were carried out .
training in afghanistan between may and august 2000 , prosecutors said , motassadeq spent time in an al qaeda terror training camp located near kandahar in afghanistan .
" in addition to ideological and military traning , such visits were also used by leaders of the international network to discuss and agree on details of attacks and the logistical support needed to carry them out , " nehm said .
meanwhile , prosecutors say they have learned little from statements made by motassadeq following his arrest , with chief prosecutor nehm describing his statements as " meaningless . "
in december , motassadeq denied any involvement in the attacks ' planning as well as membership in al qaeda .
an attorney representing motassadeq on thursday described the 90-page indictment against him as " sparse . "
a trial against motassadeq , however , is still on schedule to commence in october .
the birth of a terror cell in his press conference on thursday , nehm also rehashed detailed conclusions drawn by investigators about the origins of the hamburg terror cell and its members .
the group , comprised initially of seven students , came together in hamburg during the early 1990s .
cell leader atta , second wtc pilot al shehhi and third pilot ziad jarrah were all part of the group .
" all of the members of this cell shared the same religious convictions , an islamic lifestyle , a feeling of being out of place in unfamiliar cultural surroundings , " nehm said .
" at the center of this stood the hatred of the world 's jews and the u.s. "
nehm said el motassadeq had served as a logistician for the terror cell along with three other men who are still being sought by authorities , including ramsi binalshibh , bahaji and essabar .
neither bahaji nor essabar were able to participate in the attacks because immigration officials rejected their visa applications to travel to the u.s. the group 's mission , according to nehm , was " the militant rejection of western society and its values and the defense of the muslim world against non-muslims , including through terrorist acts , was the basis of the group 's activities .

11 terrorist in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm announces charges morrocan born mounir el motassadeq will face at least 3,116 counts of accessory to murder for his alleged role in helping mohammed atta 's hamburg cell plan the sept .
11 terror attack . close to a year after the terror attacks of sept .
11 , the federal prosecutors office in germany announced it filed criminal charges this week against a hamburg man suspected of aiding in the planning and financing of the attacks .
the charges are the first against a german member of the terror cell responsible for the attacks .
on thursday , federal prosecutor kay nehm said the suspect , morrocan citizen mounir el motassadeq , was charged on wednesday as an accessory to murder in the killings of at least 3,116 people in new york and washington and for membership in a terrorist organization .
prosecutors believe the 28-year-old student was deeply involved in the hamburg terror cell led by mohammed atta that carried out the deadly attacks .
the case has brought many previously unknown facts about the sept .
11 attacks to light .
investigators here now believe the terrorist cell had begun planning a major attack as far back as oct .
1999 , and that the world trade center first emerged as a possible target in april or may 2000 .
at the time , nehm said , hijacker marwan al shehhi told a hamburg librarian of his intentions .
" there will be thousands of dead , you will all think of me , " he reportedly said .
nehm said he also uttered the words " world trade center . "
a member " right up to the end " authorities arrested electrical engineering student el motassadeq in nov .
2001 , and he has been held in investigative custody since then in a jail in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
nehm said motassadeq had maintained intensive contacts with the terror cell for several years and also lived in the same neighborhood as the terrorists with his wife and child .
nehm said he believes motassadeq " remained part of the assassination preparations right up to the end . "
motassadeq played a definitive role in the financing of the hamburg terror cell 's activities , the indictement stated . he held power of attorney over , as well as an automated teller card for , a bank account that had originally been opened by al shehhi , one of the terrorists who died in the airplane attacks .
prosecutor nehm said the terrorists used the hamburg bank account to pay for pilot training for said bahaji and zakariya essabar in the united states .
al qaeda terrorists also allegedly used the account to pay their expenses while living in the u.s. both are still on the run from authorities .
nehm described motassadeq as a " governor in hamburg " for the terror cell during the time atta and others were in taking classes in u.s. flight schools .
additionally , nehm said , motassadeq 's signature appeared on a testament written by atta that surfaced after the deadly attacks were carried out .
training in afghanistan between may and august 2000 , prosecutors said , motassadeq spent time in an al qaeda terror training camp located near kandahar in afghanistan .
" in addition to ideological and military traning , such visits were also used by leaders of the international network to discuss and agree on details of attacks and the logistical support needed to carry them out , " nehm said .
meanwhile , prosecutors say they have learned little from statements made by motassadeq following his arrest , with chief prosecutor nehm describing his statements as " meaningless . "
in december , motassadeq denied any involvement in the attacks ' planning as well as membership in al qaeda .
an attorney representing motassadeq on thursday described the 90-page indictment against him as " sparse . "
a trial against motassadeq , however , is still on schedule to commence in october .
the birth of a terror cell in his press conference on thursday , nehm also rehashed detailed conclusions drawn by investigators about the origins of the hamburg terror cell and its members .
the group , comprised initially of seven students , came together in hamburg during the early 1990s .
cell leader atta , second wtc pilot al shehhi and third pilot ziad jarrah were all part of the group .
" all of the members of this cell shared the same religious convictions , an islamic lifestyle , a feeling of being out of place in unfamiliar cultural surroundings , " nehm said .
" at the center of this stood the hatred of the world 's jews and the u.s. "
nehm said el motassadeq had served as a logistician for the terror cell along with three other men who are still being sought by authorities , including ramsi binalshibh , bahaji and essabar .
neither bahaji nor essabar were able to participate in the attacks because immigration officials rejected their visa applications to travel to the u.s. the group 's mission , according to nehm , was " the militant rejection of western society and its values and the defense of the muslim world against non-muslims , including through terrorist acts , was the basis of the group 's activities .

western countries are promoting “ public-private partnerships ” at the earth summit in johannesburg as a path to sustainable development .
environmentalists are skeptical , saying it puts big business before people . led by the united states , western countries showcased partnerships on thursday between governments , private industry and other groups as a practical way of furthering economic development and saving the environment . they say such partnerships are ways for business and governments to pool their resources and harness the funds and the know-how to accomplish more than either could on its own . un organizers say they have received 218 proposed partnerships , in areas ranging from health care to renewable energy projects that could go a long way in helping meet summit goals of halving global poverty by 2015 while slowing environmental degradation . congo project a multi-nation project to expand efforts to save forests in central africa ’ s congo basin was announced on thursday .
germany , the us , japan and indonesia are among the countries that want to provide an additional $ 53 million dollars over four years to a partnership between the paper industry active in the region and the local population .
the plan aims to develop protected forest areas and cut down on illegal logging . but many environmentalists are wary of relying on private business to save the planet .
they say partnerships may let companies cash in on providing essential services like water and electricity , while allowing governments to shirk their traditional responsibilities . “ if a government doesn ’ t do its regulation homework , it could be more than happy to let a private company come in and take over things , ” jörg kusche with greenpeace in germany told dw-world .
“ but then there would be no transparency or accountability .
we don ’ t think that ’ s the right direction . ” he and other environmental activists have expressed concern that public-private partnerships will be used by big business as an exercise in “ greenwash ” – putting a cloak of environmental responsibility around a company that could mask activities that could actually be damaging to the environment or people in development countries . martin kaiser , international environmental expert for greenpeace who is in johannesburg , criticised the congo plan after it was announced saying it appeared to have been developed largely by the paper industry with only minimal input from indigenous groups threatened by the congo forests ’ destruction . “ there ’ s already a lot of criticism about these initiatives .
a lot seem to be one-sided in favor of industry , ” he told dw-world . in un parlance , these public-private agreements are called “ type 2 ” initiatives .
the idea is that these voluntary programs can be decided on and launched quickly by the parties involved as opposed to being endorsed by the “ type 1 ” process , which requires the approval of an international forum and can be bureaucratic and time-consuming . “ we think it would be more sensible if these were a completion of type 1 initiatives and a part of binding agreements instead of just voluntary ones , whose outcome is anything but certain , ” kusche said . practical steps but the americans at the summit see such agreements as practical steps towards sustainable development .
public funds used in partnerships , according to us thinking , can leverage private investment .
assistant secretary of state john turner said the us plans on commiting $ 970 million over the next three years to water projects , but expects to mobilize more than $ 1.6 billion through partnerships . the us agency for international development presented a $ 90 million proposal to fight hunger in africa by teaming up with regional trade groups and industry partners . paula dobriansky , a us undersecretary of state for global affairs , dismissed skepticism on the part of some activists . “ i have found a great deal of enthusiasm … all want to see us really have some action here , ” she said . european union officials were also talking up several of their proposed projects on thursday , including agreements in energy and water management .
but they were more circumspect than their translatlantic partners about the extent to which public-private partnerships can solve all the world ’ s problems . in a statement , danish environment minister hans christian schmidt , who is representing the eu in johannesburg , cautioned against upsetting the balance between the public and private part of the equation . “ partnerships are a complement to -lrb- government -rrb- commitments , ” he said , “ not a substitute for them . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de on the green road from rio to johannesburg the un summit in johannesburg next week has been dubbed " rio + 10 " or " earth summit 2 " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.09.2002 bitter wrangling in debate on flood clean-up funds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how are we going to pay for this ? - a destroyed house in eastern germany germany ’ s governing and opposition parties were at loggerheads over the financing of the billion-euro injection in flood-affected areas at a special debate in the lower house of parliament . the only thing that the government and the opposition could agree upon on thursday ’ s special session on flood relief in the lower house of parliament was that flood victims need to be helped as soon as possible .
as far as actually financing the repair of the damages went , heated arguments and acrimonious debates were the order of the day .
opening the debate , german chancellor gerhard schröder said that the floods had caused the worst damage in germany since the second world war .
he thanked the scores of voluntary and professional helpers who had laboured to pile sandbags and help people to safety .
" not just a catastrophic flood , but also an unbelievable wave of solidarity has swept through germany " , he said .
stoiber on the offensive opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- sharply criticised the government ’ s plan to finance a large chunk of the 10 billion euro -lrb- dollar -rrb- flood relief package by postponing next year 's scheduled tax reform and increasing the corporation tax .
he said that the opposition union bloc had chosen not to block the government 's plans to avoid " fighting on the backs of the victims " .
but he emphasised that he thinks the government 's strategy is wrong .
" high taxes will cripple economic performance , stem growth , destroy jobs " , he said .
the opposition is pushing instead to use the profits of germany 's central bank to finance flood repairs .
" higher interest rates are a lesser evil compared to higher taxes " , stoiber said .
pulling out his main weapon against schröder in the current election campaign , stoiber added that that recent floods were germany 's second national catastrophe of the summer , the first being the country 's four million unemployed .
social democrats deride opposition proposal but chancellor schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- vehemently opposes using central bank profits .
schröder has called it " socially imbalanced " and accused the opposition of wanting to burden future generations with more debt .
german foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party said that higher debts would hurt the country 's competitiveness .
free democrats want to go third way the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- joined the union parties in opposing the planned hike in corporation taxes .
fdp leader guido westerwelle accused the government of worsening the flood catastrophe through another " catastrophe " of higher taxes .
but the union bloc 's financing suggestion did n't meet with the liberals ' approval either .
the money instead should come from diverting funds and saving in other areas , westerwelle said .
pds wants money from military projects parliamentary floor leader of the party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- , roland claus , called upon the government to cancel planned weapons projects such as the military transporter a400 m in order to finance repairs .
if schröder says he doesn ’ t want a military adventure in iraq , " then he can do without a military adventure gadget " , he said .
will the relief package suffice ?
despite the barbed debates , georg milbrandt , the premier of one of the most affected states , saxony , took comfort in the fact that that the relief package could be coming soon .
but he was skeptical about whether 10 billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in direct financial assistance approved earlier this week would be enough .

as far as actually financing the repair of the damages went , heated arguments and acrimonious debates were the order of the day .
opening the debate , german chancellor gerhard schröder said that the floods had caused the worst damage in germany since the second world war .
he thanked the scores of voluntary and professional helpers who had laboured to pile sandbags and help people to safety .
" not just a catastrophic flood , but also an unbelievable wave of solidarity has swept through germany " , he said .
stoiber on the offensive opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- sharply criticised the government ’ s plan to finance a large chunk of the 10 billion euro -lrb- dollar -rrb- flood relief package by postponing next year 's scheduled tax reform and increasing the corporation tax .
he said that the opposition union bloc had chosen not to block the government 's plans to avoid " fighting on the backs of the victims " .
but he emphasised that he thinks the government 's strategy is wrong .
" high taxes will cripple economic performance , stem growth , destroy jobs " , he said .
the opposition is pushing instead to use the profits of germany 's central bank to finance flood repairs .
" higher interest rates are a lesser evil compared to higher taxes " , stoiber said .
pulling out his main weapon against schröder in the current election campaign , stoiber added that that recent floods were germany 's second national catastrophe of the summer , the first being the country 's four million unemployed .
social democrats deride opposition proposal but chancellor schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- vehemently opposes using central bank profits .
schröder has called it " socially imbalanced " and accused the opposition of wanting to burden future generations with more debt .
german foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party said that higher debts would hurt the country 's competitiveness .
free democrats want to go third way the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- joined the union parties in opposing the planned hike in corporation taxes .
fdp leader guido westerwelle accused the government of worsening the flood catastrophe through another " catastrophe " of higher taxes .
but the union bloc 's financing suggestion did n't meet with the liberals ' approval either .
the money instead should come from diverting funds and saving in other areas , westerwelle said .
pds wants money from military projects parliamentary floor leader of the party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- , roland claus , called upon the government to cancel planned weapons projects such as the military transporter a400 m in order to finance repairs .
if schröder says he doesn ’ t want a military adventure in iraq , " then he can do without a military adventure gadget " , he said .
will the relief package suffice ?
despite the barbed debates , georg milbrandt , the premier of one of the most affected states , saxony , took comfort in the fact that that the relief package could be coming soon .
but he was skeptical about whether 10 billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in direct financial assistance approved earlier this week would be enough .

but stoiber and schröder succeeded in piquing interest in what had until now been a sleepy election . going into sunday night 's debate against edmund stoiber , gerhard schröder already had a huge disadvantage – as the four-year chancellor of germany , he found himself in a defensive position .
it was a fundamental weakness that challenger stoiber , the premier of bavaria , put to his advantage in a series of forceful attacks against the chancellor covering the most important issues of the election , making the anticipated event feel like a political soccer match .
the most contentious exchanges revolved around spiraling unemployment , a stagnant economy , tax reforms , immigration and germany 's stance on a possible iraq invasion – all dominant issues in the media during the days and weeks leading up to the first debate .
the keyword of the night seemed to be " failure , " of which both candidates repeatedly accused the other of on each key issue .
the debate , which is being called a " duel " here , was broadcast by the private television stations rtl and sat.1.
schröder taken to task for soaring unemployment in one of the most aggressive salvos of the evening , stoiber blamed germany 's high unemployment level of over four million on the current red-green government , led by schröder 's social democrats and the greens .
he said schröder had failed in his promise to reduce unemployment levels to fewer than 3.5 million people .
he criticized schröder for his plan to delay a tax cut scheduled for 2003 in order to fund the rebuilding of communities ravaged this summer by the biggest floods in a hundred years .
he said the government made a " mistake " by instituting tax reforms that did nothing to help what he described as the " most important " part of the german economy : small- to middle-sized businesses .
" we ca n't forget that the center of gravity of our labor market is dependent on the ...
german market .
we have only a relatively small share of exports to america .
other countries , like england , france , sweden , finland and spain have the same international ties , but they do n't have the dramatically growing number of unemployed or such a weak economic growth rate . "
schröder conceded he was disappointed by germany 's unemployment rate , but fought back by saying it was the result of the global economic downturn and not a homemade problem as stoiber had suggested .
as for the delayed tax cut , he said , " i 'm convinced that the people of this country understand that today 's damage ca n't be compensated for with debts that our children and grandchildren will then have to pay . "
how full is the ship ?
addressing immigration , stoiber said he thought it was " wrong for germany to have a law that provides for more immigration . "
he said that every year germany takes in 500,000 to 600,000 new immigrants - the equivalent of cities like dortmund or nuremburg .
he said the new immigration law would increase that number by 100,000 to 150,000 .
" we are n't even finished assimilating the foreigner children who are already here .
we need to do a lot more .
for that reason we should n't increase immigration , " he said .
schröder defended his government 's new law , passed in march , saying it both limited immigration in areas where it is n't needed while at the same time opening doors for highly skilled workers who are needed in the technology sector .
while stoiber 's numbers were correct , he said , he had omitted the annual outflow of several hundred thousand – refugees of countries once torn by civil war , for example .
when you add those figures in , he said , the increase is more like 100,000 people .
stoiber : schröder 's iraq position " irresponsible " schröder also found himself on the defensive on the subject of a possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
recently , schröder has alluded that the u.s. was planning to engage in " military adventurism , " and said that germany would not participate , even under a united nations mandate .
on sunday night , however , schröder sought to draw a line between his stances on u.n. efforts to get weapons inspectors back inside baghdad and the u.s. ' desire to topple saddam hussein 's regime .
" in light of the situation in the middle east , and considering the fact that we have n't conquered the taliban and are far from having rebuilt afghanistan , a military intervention in iraq is wrong , and for that reason , under my leadership , germany will not help in that effort , " the chancellor said .
stoiber , meanwhile , called schröder 's public statements on the issue , and his stance , " irresponsible . "
he specifically criticized schröder for saying the country must go the " german way , " a phrase he said had historically charged connotations - at least in the ears of the international community .
he also said schröder 's public statements and policy reduced some of the international pressure on hussein .
" with saddam hussein , you have a war criminal as head of government , a head of state who possesses weapons of mass destruction and has even used them against his own people and those in neighboring iran .
we need to do everything we can , make every diplomatic effort , apply as much political pressure " as is needed to get un inspectors back inside iraq , stoiber said .
he said the chancellor should n't be ruling out every " theoretical option . "
stalemate so who won ?
the jury ca n't seem to make up its mind .
immediately after the debate , the editor in chief of the newsweekly " der spiegel , " stefan aust , said he " did n't get the impression he -lrb- schröder -rrb- was the media chancellor .
he could have done better . "
aust even accused him of putting his german television audience to sleep .
but polls taken of viewers sunday night were all over the board .
a forsa institute poll for sat.1 put schröder ahead .
another , by pollster wahlen for public broadcaster zdf had stoiber ahead by two points .

but stoiber and schröder succeeded in piquing interest in what had until now been a sleepy election . going into sunday night 's debate against edmund stoiber , gerhard schröder already had a huge disadvantage – as the four-year chancellor of germany , he found himself in a defensive position .
it was a fundamental weakness that challenger stoiber , the premier of bavaria , put to his advantage in a series of forceful attacks against the chancellor covering the most important issues of the election , making the anticipated event feel like a political soccer match .
the most contentious exchanges revolved around spiraling unemployment , a stagnant economy , tax reforms , immigration and germany 's stance on a possible iraq invasion – all dominant issues in the media during the days and weeks leading up to the first debate .
the keyword of the night seemed to be " failure , " of which both candidates repeatedly accused the other of on each key issue .
the debate , which is being called a " duel " here , was broadcast by the private television stations rtl and sat.1.
schröder taken to task for soaring unemployment in one of the most aggressive salvos of the evening , stoiber blamed germany 's high unemployment level of over four million on the current red-green government , led by schröder 's social democrats and the greens .
he said schröder had failed in his promise to reduce unemployment levels to fewer than 3.5 million people .
he criticized schröder for his plan to delay a tax cut scheduled for 2003 in order to fund the rebuilding of communities ravaged this summer by the biggest floods in a hundred years .
he said the government made a " mistake " by instituting tax reforms that did nothing to help what he described as the " most important " part of the german economy : small- to middle-sized businesses .
" we ca n't forget that the center of gravity of our labor market is dependent on the ...
german market .
we have only a relatively small share of exports to america .
other countries , like england , france , sweden , finland and spain have the same international ties , but they do n't have the dramatically growing number of unemployed or such a weak economic growth rate . "
schröder conceded he was disappointed by germany 's unemployment rate , but fought back by saying it was the result of the global economic downturn and not a homemade problem as stoiber had suggested .
as for the delayed tax cut , he said , " i 'm convinced that the people of this country understand that today 's damage ca n't be compensated for with debts that our children and grandchildren will then have to pay . "
how full is the ship ?
addressing immigration , stoiber said he thought it was " wrong for germany to have a law that provides for more immigration . "
he said that every year germany takes in 500,000 to 600,000 new immigrants - the equivalent of cities like dortmund or nuremburg .
he said the new immigration law would increase that number by 100,000 to 150,000 .
" we are n't even finished assimilating the foreigner children who are already here .
we need to do a lot more .
for that reason we should n't increase immigration , " he said .
schröder defended his government 's new law , passed in march , saying it both limited immigration in areas where it is n't needed while at the same time opening doors for highly skilled workers who are needed in the technology sector .
while stoiber 's numbers were correct , he said , he had omitted the annual outflow of several hundred thousand – refugees of countries once torn by civil war , for example .
when you add those figures in , he said , the increase is more like 100,000 people .
stoiber : schröder 's iraq position " irresponsible " schröder also found himself on the defensive on the subject of a possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
recently , schröder has alluded that the u.s. was planning to engage in " military adventurism , " and said that germany would not participate , even under a united nations mandate .
on sunday night , however , schröder sought to draw a line between his stances on u.n. efforts to get weapons inspectors back inside baghdad and the u.s. ' desire to topple saddam hussein 's regime .
" in light of the situation in the middle east , and considering the fact that we have n't conquered the taliban and are far from having rebuilt afghanistan , a military intervention in iraq is wrong , and for that reason , under my leadership , germany will not help in that effort , " the chancellor said .
stoiber , meanwhile , called schröder 's public statements on the issue , and his stance , " irresponsible . "
he specifically criticized schröder for saying the country must go the " german way , " a phrase he said had historically charged connotations - at least in the ears of the international community .
he also said schröder 's public statements and policy reduced some of the international pressure on hussein .
" with saddam hussein , you have a war criminal as head of government , a head of state who possesses weapons of mass destruction and has even used them against his own people and those in neighboring iran .
we need to do everything we can , make every diplomatic effort , apply as much political pressure " as is needed to get un inspectors back inside iraq , stoiber said .
he said the chancellor should n't be ruling out every " theoretical option . "
stalemate so who won ?
the jury ca n't seem to make up its mind .
immediately after the debate , the editor in chief of the newsweekly " der spiegel , " stefan aust , said he " did n't get the impression he -lrb- schröder -rrb- was the media chancellor .
he could have done better . "
aust even accused him of putting his german television audience to sleep .
but polls taken of viewers sunday night were all over the board .
a forsa institute poll for sat.1 put schröder ahead .
another , by pollster wahlen for public broadcaster zdf had stoiber ahead by two points .
but another , by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard put schröder far ahead of his bavarian challenger .
in editorials published in the monday editions , many major regional newspapers shied away from declaring a victor .
the mass-circulation " bild " described german voters as the victors for even taking an interest in the debate .
the " berliner zeitung , " meanwhile , described it as a duel that had neither a conqueror nor someone who had been conquered .
indeed , if a television debate were analogous to soccer , you might say that stoiber controlled the ball for much of the game – e.g. he steered the issues and went in with the most attacks – but neither candidate , it seemed , scored many goals . and that 's too bad considering that in germany 's first ever television debate there was no provision for penalty shots . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery read everything you need to know about the politicians , parties and hot-button issues , along with a dummy 's guide to the german political system , as germans head for the polls for national elections on september 22 . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but stoiber and schröder succeeded in piquing interest in what had until now been a sleepy election . going into sunday night 's debate against edmund stoiber , gerhard schröder already had a huge disadvantage – as the four-year chancellor of germany , he found himself in a defensive position .
it was a fundamental weakness that challenger stoiber , the premier of bavaria , put to his advantage in a series of forceful attacks against the chancellor covering the most important issues of the election , making the anticipated event feel like a political soccer match .
the most contentious exchanges revolved around spiraling unemployment , a stagnant economy , tax reforms , immigration and germany 's stance on a possible iraq invasion – all dominant issues in the media during the days and weeks leading up to the first debate .
the keyword of the night seemed to be " failure , " of which both candidates repeatedly accused the other of on each key issue .
the debate , which is being called a " duel " here , was broadcast by the private television stations rtl and sat.1.
schröder taken to task for soaring unemployment in one of the most aggressive salvos of the evening , stoiber blamed germany 's high unemployment level of over four million on the current red-green government , led by schröder 's social democrats and the greens .
he said schröder had failed in his promise to reduce unemployment levels to fewer than 3.5 million people .
he criticized schröder for his plan to delay a tax cut scheduled for 2003 in order to fund the rebuilding of communities ravaged this summer by the biggest floods in a hundred years .
he said the government made a " mistake " by instituting tax reforms that did nothing to help what he described as the " most important " part of the german economy : small- to middle-sized businesses .
" we ca n't forget that the center of gravity of our labor market is dependent on the ...
german market .
we have only a relatively small share of exports to america .
other countries , like england , france , sweden , finland and spain have the same international ties , but they do n't have the dramatically growing number of unemployed or such a weak economic growth rate . "
schröder conceded he was disappointed by germany 's unemployment rate , but fought back by saying it was the result of the global economic downturn and not a homemade problem as stoiber had suggested .
as for the delayed tax cut , he said , " i 'm convinced that the people of this country understand that today 's damage ca n't be compensated for with debts that our children and grandchildren will then have to pay . "
how full is the ship ?
addressing immigration , stoiber said he thought it was " wrong for germany to have a law that provides for more immigration . "
he said that every year germany takes in 500,000 to 600,000 new immigrants - the equivalent of cities like dortmund or nuremburg .
he said the new immigration law would increase that number by 100,000 to 150,000 .
" we are n't even finished assimilating the foreigner children who are already here .
we need to do a lot more .
for that reason we should n't increase immigration , " he said .
schröder defended his government 's new law , passed in march , saying it both limited immigration in areas where it is n't needed while at the same time opening doors for highly skilled workers who are needed in the technology sector .
while stoiber 's numbers were correct , he said , he had omitted the annual outflow of several hundred thousand – refugees of countries once torn by civil war , for example .
when you add those figures in , he said , the increase is more like 100,000 people .
stoiber : schröder 's iraq position " irresponsible " schröder also found himself on the defensive on the subject of a possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
recently , schröder has alluded that the u.s. was planning to engage in " military adventurism , " and said that germany would not participate , even under a united nations mandate .
on sunday night , however , schröder sought to draw a line between his stances on u.n. efforts to get weapons inspectors back inside baghdad and the u.s. ' desire to topple saddam hussein 's regime .
" in light of the situation in the middle east , and considering the fact that we have n't conquered the taliban and are far from having rebuilt afghanistan , a military intervention in iraq is wrong , and for that reason , under my leadership , germany will not help in that effort , " the chancellor said .
stoiber , meanwhile , called schröder 's public statements on the issue , and his stance , " irresponsible . "
he specifically criticized schröder for saying the country must go the " german way , " a phrase he said had historically charged connotations - at least in the ears of the international community .
he also said schröder 's public statements and policy reduced some of the international pressure on hussein .
" with saddam hussein , you have a war criminal as head of government , a head of state who possesses weapons of mass destruction and has even used them against his own people and those in neighboring iran .
we need to do everything we can , make every diplomatic effort , apply as much political pressure " as is needed to get un inspectors back inside iraq , stoiber said .

the company saw the tracks of some of its main lines near dresden get washed away , train stations flooded and the collapse of crucial bridges , including one on a high-speed rail line connecting northern and southern germany .
appearing at the chancellery in berlin on wednesday , deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn issued a preliminary estimate of over one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in flood damages .
" according to our cautious first estimates , we believe we have suffered revenue losses and damages of 1.025 billion euro , " mehdorn said .
he stressed that this would not be the final damage sum .
a laundry list of damages more than 400 kilometers of deutsche bahn tracks are currently unusable , and 94 bridges and 200 train stations have been badly damaged .
early estimates suggest that the service outages alone will lead to a 90 million euro -lrb- $ 88 million -rrb- drop in revenue from passenger and freight services .
mehdorn said it would take two and a half years before deutsche bahn service could return to its pre-flood level in the region .
the federal government has already agreed to provide deutsche bahn with 650 million euro -lrb- $ 638 million -rrb- to rebuild its network and repair damaged train stations .
more than half the money had already been earmarked for transportation infrastructure development projects in the eastern states that were formerly part of east germany .
deutsche bahn said its first reconstruction priorities would be lines in the leipzig-dresden-chemnitz triangle .

mehdorn said there are currently no plans to cancel any proposed deutsche bahn projects – including the planned transrapid train line between dortmund and düsseldorf .
new priorities , however , could lead to delays , he warned .
a job-saving deal as part of a four-point " immediate aid " program , the government also reached an agreement with deutsche bahn and the transnet union that the company would not lay off any employees between now and 2006 as a result of the flooding .
until this week 's agreement , talks between the employees ' union and bahn had reached an impasse .
mehdorn said deutsche bahn will reintroduce regular long-distance train service in the state of saxony-anhalt on thursday and is working on a plan to reintroduce long-distance trains in saxony as quickly as possible .

the company saw the tracks of some of its main lines near dresden get washed away , train stations flooded and the collapse of crucial bridges , including one on a high-speed rail line connecting northern and southern germany .
appearing at the chancellery in berlin on wednesday , deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn issued a preliminary estimate of over one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in flood damages .
" according to our cautious first estimates , we believe we have suffered revenue losses and damages of 1.025 billion euro , " mehdorn said .
he stressed that this would not be the final damage sum .
a laundry list of damages more than 400 kilometers of deutsche bahn tracks are currently unusable , and 94 bridges and 200 train stations have been badly damaged .
early estimates suggest that the service outages alone will lead to a 90 million euro -lrb- $ 88 million -rrb- drop in revenue from passenger and freight services .
mehdorn said it would take two and a half years before deutsche bahn service could return to its pre-flood level in the region .
the federal government has already agreed to provide deutsche bahn with 650 million euro -lrb- $ 638 million -rrb- to rebuild its network and repair damaged train stations .
more than half the money had already been earmarked for transportation infrastructure development projects in the eastern states that were formerly part of east germany .
deutsche bahn said its first reconstruction priorities would be lines in the leipzig-dresden-chemnitz triangle .
a line connecting dresden with prague will also be rebuilt as quickly as possible .
mehdorn said there are currently no plans to cancel any proposed deutsche bahn projects – including the planned transrapid train line between dortmund and düsseldorf .
new priorities , however , could lead to delays , he warned .
a job-saving deal as part of a four-point " immediate aid " program , the government also reached an agreement with deutsche bahn and the transnet union that the company would not lay off any employees between now and 2006 as a result of the flooding .

11 attacks , terrorism has vanished from the political agenda in germany .
experts say time and other issues have pushed the topic from voters ' minds . in the months following sept .
11 , germans couldn ’ t get enough tough talk on terrorism . the realization that the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon were most likely planned in hamburg , sent shockwaves through the country and , as a result , through the political establishment as well . the government was quick to react : interior minister otto schily prepared two “ security packages ” that expanded the reach and financing of germany ’ s law enforcement and got them past the legislature within a quick few months . germans rewarded their government ’ s tough talk on terrorism with high approval ratings and observers wondered at the speed and solidarity with which berlin was operating . now , just weeks before the attacks ’ anniversary , terrorism has all but escaped from the voters ’ minds , and , as a result , the political agenda .
in the midst of a hard-fought election campaign , germany ’ s recent floods , the high unemployment rate and slumping economy have grabbed the headlines , pushing aside concern over the spread of islamic fundamentalism and terror cells in the country . the reasons , say experts , have to do with both the time lapse since sept .
11 and the zero tolerance image chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has presented since then .
the speed with which the government moved to pass anti-terrorism measures and assure germans their country was safe was enough to allay fears relatively quickly , said jochen hippler , political scientist at the university of duisberg . quick enough to calm fears “ in a sense , the internal security situation , at least unofficially , has never been deemed so dangerous , “ said hippler .
“ it would have been different if the government had been more loose in its words and actions . ” there is also little difference in the way both schröder ’ s social democratic party and his challenger , edmund stoiber and his christian democratic and christian social union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- bloc , approach the anti-terrorism fight . the cdu / csu and spd look at foreign policy and domestic security in the same context .
the union bloc argues that instability on german soil is often connected to instablity caused by a country ’ s foreign policy .
the red-green coalition says that many of the union ’ s suggestions , such as increased cooperation between immigration and police authorities , have already been put into place . even schily ’ s challenger in the union bloc , hard-line bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , grudgingly admires the former green party member ’ s tough stance on domestic security .
“ schily and i went to the same school , ” beckstein has told reporters in the past . as a result , campaign managers on both sides , eager to play up differences between the cdu / csu and spd , have pushed more divisive issues further up the agenda . law enforcement wants terrorism back on the agenda the absence of terrorism in today ’ s political agenda has made it difficult for at least one interested bloc : the country ’ s law enforcement lobby .
since interest in domestic security died down , police lobbyist rüdiger holecek has had a difficult time bringing complaints of underfunding and staffing to the government ’ s attention . holecek , of the country ’ s police union , says that the government ’ s domestic security plan has overstretched an already overburdened police force .
more officers have been recruited into the country ’ s federal domestic security agency , the verfassungschutz , without enough money being left over for adequate replacements . “ we ’ re suffering as a result of this inattention , ” holecek told dw-world . the group , which represents the interests of more than 190 000 officers in germany , plans to call attention to itself during a press conference on sept .

experts say time and other issues have pushed the topic from voters ' minds . in the months following sept .
11 , germans couldn ’ t get enough tough talk on terrorism . the realization that the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon were most likely planned in hamburg , sent shockwaves through the country and , as a result , through the political establishment as well . the government was quick to react : interior minister otto schily prepared two “ security packages ” that expanded the reach and financing of germany ’ s law enforcement and got them past the legislature within a quick few months . germans rewarded their government ’ s tough talk on terrorism with high approval ratings and observers wondered at the speed and solidarity with which berlin was operating . now , just weeks before the attacks ’ anniversary , terrorism has all but escaped from the voters ’ minds , and , as a result , the political agenda .
in the midst of a hard-fought election campaign , germany ’ s recent floods , the high unemployment rate and slumping economy have grabbed the headlines , pushing aside concern over the spread of islamic fundamentalism and terror cells in the country . the reasons , say experts , have to do with both the time lapse since sept .
11 and the zero tolerance image chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has presented since then .
the speed with which the government moved to pass anti-terrorism measures and assure germans their country was safe was enough to allay fears relatively quickly , said jochen hippler , political scientist at the university of duisberg . quick enough to calm fears “ in a sense , the internal security situation , at least unofficially , has never been deemed so dangerous , “ said hippler .
“ it would have been different if the government had been more loose in its words and actions . ” there is also little difference in the way both schröder ’ s social democratic party and his challenger , edmund stoiber and his christian democratic and christian social union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- bloc , approach the anti-terrorism fight . the cdu / csu and spd look at foreign policy and domestic security in the same context .
the union bloc argues that instability on german soil is often connected to instablity caused by a country ’ s foreign policy .
the red-green coalition says that many of the union ’ s suggestions , such as increased cooperation between immigration and police authorities , have already been put into place . even schily ’ s challenger in the union bloc , hard-line bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , grudgingly admires the former green party member ’ s tough stance on domestic security .
“ schily and i went to the same school , ” beckstein has told reporters in the past . as a result , campaign managers on both sides , eager to play up differences between the cdu / csu and spd , have pushed more divisive issues further up the agenda . law enforcement wants terrorism back on the agenda the absence of terrorism in today ’ s political agenda has made it difficult for at least one interested bloc : the country ’ s law enforcement lobby .
since interest in domestic security died down , police lobbyist rüdiger holecek has had a difficult time bringing complaints of underfunding and staffing to the government ’ s attention . holecek , of the country ’ s police union , says that the government ’ s domestic security plan has overstretched an already overburdened police force .
more officers have been recruited into the country ’ s federal domestic security agency , the verfassungschutz , without enough money being left over for adequate replacements . “ we ’ re suffering as a result of this inattention , ” holecek told dw-world . the group , which represents the interests of more than 190 000 officers in germany , plans to call attention to itself during a press conference on sept .
11 .
at the conference the union will present a handbook on terrorist activity in germany .
holecek is hoping people will take notice . “ we want to prevent this topic from sinking out of view of the political , ” establishment , he said . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the pact calls for reducing catches to sustainable levels . a deal was struck late tuesday night in johannesburg , aiming to replenish the world ’ s overfished waters by 2015 and head off a looming fisheries crisis .
it ’ s the first concrete target date set at this summit where 200 nations have gathered to come up with an action plan to reduce world poverty without destroying the environment .
environmentalists , who have been highly critical of the summit for its reluctance to set definite targets for reform , welcomed the fisheries plan , calling it a welcome advance . “ it ’ s pleasing that they have reached agreement on oceans , ” sian pullen of the environmental group wwf told reuters .
“ we would have liked it to be more progressive but it ’ s good compared to some of the other issues which may be going backwards . ”
catching fewer fish the plan calls for reducing fish catches to levels where the maximum sustainable yield can be taken indefinitely .
it gives governments a deadline of 2015 to restore fish stocks to sustainable levels .
that could entail enacting temporary fishing bans in some areas or setting up permanent no-fishing zones to preserve breeding grounds .
according to the united nations , more than 25 percent of the world ’ s commercially important fish stocks are overexploited and 50 percent are being fished to full capacity .
after pressure from the us , delegates agreed add a clause stating that fish levels should be replenished “ where possible . ”
the americans argued some stocks , such as cod on the grand banks of canada ’ s eastern seaboard , are thought to have already been fished beyond recovery .
enforcement questions while the agreement has buoyed delegates ’ spirits , some environmentalists question whether the agreement can be enforeced against pirate trawlers .
for example , the fish stocks off of mozambique , south africa ’ s neighbor , have been reduced by more than 70 percent in the last decade , thanks largely to fleets of chinese and tanzanian fishermen who invade mozambican waters and dynamite all species .
they come to the waters off the island nation because they have exhausted the stocks in their own waters .
“ -lrb- the agreement -rrb- does recognize the need for enforcement but it doesn ’ t say how it ’ s going to be done .
it ’ s a major issue and not one that ’ s been adequately addressed , ” said the wwf ’ s sian pullen .
like the other parts of the action plan that heads of state are due to approve when they come to the summit finale next week , the fisheries agreement is not legally binding .

for years , the agency has put members of extremist organizations , often leaders , on its payroll in an effort to get a better grasp of the activities of these groups .
in recent years , it has used information culled from informants to build its federal constitutional court case to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
however , subsequent revelations about the relationship between the agency and its informants have jeopardized the npd ban petition and led critics to ask whether it has gone over the line in nurturing such relationships .
" this bullet is for you " the latest twist involves mirko h. , a neo-nazi from the state of saxony who has been working as an informant for the office of the protection of the constitution since the mid-1990s .
it has been alleged that during his time on the agency 's payroll , he also produced thousands of copies of a cd by the band white aryan rebels called " notes of hate , " containing nazi lyrics that are banned in germany .
the song " this bullet is for you " includes a death threat against the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , michel friedman , and other german politicians .
the album , chilling in its unabashed xenophobia , also includes calls for the killing of mo asumang , a popular german erotic television star of ghanian ancestry .
the second informant implicated in the scandal is toni s. , a neo-nazi from the eastern german city of cottbus who worked for the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of brandenburg .
toni s. is currently in investigative police custody as his relationship with the white aryan rebels is probed .
the dresden public prosecutors ' office , meanwhile , has filed a criminal case against mirko h. for his role in the production and distribution of the cd .
what did the government know , and when ?
a report in the current issue of " focus , " a national newsweekly , alleged that the office of the protection of the constitution was aware of mirko h. 's involvement in the creation of the cd and still continued to work with him without stopping its production .
the newsweekly reported he earned more than 105,000 euro from the hate-filled lp .
the article also accused the federal interior ministry of withhold from the secret service committee of parliament the information that mirko h. had been convicted of illegal weapons possession and incitement in 2001 .
the interior ministry has denied the charge .
still , that does n't make it easier for the celebrities threatened in " notes of hate , " to sleep at night .
" i 'm shaken and feel less secure by the idea that security authorities have become a part of the threat , " michel friedman told the berlin newspaper " tagesspiegel , " in its wednesday edition .
" this ca n't be accepted by the government . "
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union are calling for immediate answers from the interior ministry and the government .
" in the face of the dramatic events in this informant scandal , we expect that the interior minister will provide answers , " the deputy head of the union bloc 's parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , told the " berliner zeitung " newspaper .
" he has to tell us what he knew about the informant , what the interior ministry knew , who carries the political responsibility and what conclusions should be drawn . "
criticism from within concern is also growing inside the government .
christian ströbele , a green member of parliament , told the same paper he believed the situation must be clarified before the sept .
22 federal elections .
ströbele said he believed the latest incident was just " one more example of the questionable methods of the office for the protection of the constitution . "
where do you draw the line , he asked , between activities right-wing extremists have developed themselves and those that have been inspired and financed by the office for the protection of the constitution ?
" you have to ask yourself whether some -lrb- authorities from the office -rrb- are doing more to endanger our constitution than to protect it , " ströbele said .
a growing informant scandal the neo-nazi cd scandal is only the latest gaffe for the office of the protection of the constitution in its use of extremist informants who are still active .
the constitutional court temporarily suspended the government 's case to ban the npd in january after it learned a key member of the right-wing extremist party 's leadership had at one point served as an informant for the domestic intelligence agency 's investigation , which laid the foundations for the ban petition .
the court learned that part of the government 's case had been gleaned from wolfgang frenz , an npd official and witness for the defense who had worked as an informant for the north rhine-westphalia state office for the protection of the constitution .
days later , it learned that udo holtmann , head of the npd 's state chapter in north rhine-westphalia , had also aided in the government 's case .
the government has said it must rely on unidentified informants in such cases because it is their best hope to gain intelligence on the groups .

" that is the way forward and the biodiversity and freshwater systems will suffer from climate change in the same way as people will , so the two are inextricably linked . "

for years , the agency has put members of extremist organizations , often leaders , on its payroll in an effort to get a better grasp of the activities of these groups .
in recent years , it has used information culled from informants to build its federal constitutional court case to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
however , subsequent revelations about the relationship between the agency and its informants have jeopardized the npd ban petition and led critics to ask whether it has gone over the line in nurturing such relationships .
" this bullet is for you " the latest twist involves mirko h. , a neo-nazi from the state of saxony who has been working as an informant for the office of the protection of the constitution since the mid-1990s .
it has been alleged that during his time on the agency 's payroll , he also produced thousands of copies of a cd by the band white aryan rebels called " notes of hate , " containing nazi lyrics that are banned in germany .
the song " this bullet is for you " includes a death threat against the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , michel friedman , and other german politicians .
the album , chilling in its unabashed xenophobia , also includes calls for the killing of mo asumang , a popular german erotic television star of ghanian ancestry .
the second informant implicated in the scandal is toni s. , a neo-nazi from the eastern german city of cottbus who worked for the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of brandenburg .
toni s. is currently in investigative police custody as his relationship with the white aryan rebels is probed .
the dresden public prosecutors ' office , meanwhile , has filed a criminal case against mirko h. for his role in the production and distribution of the cd .
what did the government know , and when ?
a report in the current issue of " focus , " a national newsweekly , alleged that the office of the protection of the constitution was aware of mirko h. 's involvement in the creation of the cd and still continued to work with him without stopping its production .
the newsweekly reported he earned more than 105,000 euro from the hate-filled lp .
the article also accused the federal interior ministry of withhold from the secret service committee of parliament the information that mirko h. had been convicted of illegal weapons possession and incitement in 2001 .
the interior ministry has denied the charge .
still , that does n't make it easier for the celebrities threatened in " notes of hate , " to sleep at night .
" i 'm shaken and feel less secure by the idea that security authorities have become a part of the threat , " michel friedman told the berlin newspaper " tagesspiegel , " in its wednesday edition .
" this ca n't be accepted by the government . "
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union are calling for immediate answers from the interior ministry and the government .
" in the face of the dramatic events in this informant scandal , we expect that the interior minister will provide answers , " the deputy head of the union bloc 's parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , told the " berliner zeitung " newspaper .
" he has to tell us what he knew about the informant , what the interior ministry knew , who carries the political responsibility and what conclusions should be drawn . "
criticism from within concern is also growing inside the government .
christian ströbele , a green member of parliament , told the same paper he believed the situation must be clarified before the sept .
22 federal elections .
ströbele said he believed the latest incident was just " one more example of the questionable methods of the office for the protection of the constitution . "
where do you draw the line , he asked , between activities right-wing extremists have developed themselves and those that have been inspired and financed by the office for the protection of the constitution ?
" you have to ask yourself whether some -lrb- authorities from the office -rrb- are doing more to endanger our constitution than to protect it , " ströbele said .
a growing informant scandal the neo-nazi cd scandal is only the latest gaffe for the office of the protection of the constitution in its use of extremist informants who are still active .
the constitutional court temporarily suspended the government 's case to ban the npd in january after it learned a key member of the right-wing extremist party 's leadership had at one point served as an informant for the domestic intelligence agency 's investigation , which laid the foundations for the ban petition .
the court learned that part of the government 's case had been gleaned from wolfgang frenz , an npd official and witness for the defense who had worked as an informant for the north rhine-westphalia state office for the protection of the constitution .
days later , it learned that udo holtmann , head of the npd 's state chapter in north rhine-westphalia , had also aided in the government 's case .
the government has said it must rely on unidentified informants in such cases because it is their best hope to gain intelligence on the groups .
on thursday , the practice will be put under the microscope of the bundestag , where more than a handful of politicians have already said they will question the government practice . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new problems for case against far-right party ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.09.2002 lots of touchés , but no clear winner in german debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both failed to score many goals in germany 's first televised chancellor debate there was no clear winner in germany 's first televised debate between chancellor candidates on sunday night .
but stoiber and schröder succeeded in piquing interest in what had until now been a sleepy election . going into sunday night 's debate against edmund stoiber , gerhard schröder already had a huge disadvantage – as the four-year chancellor of germany , he found himself in a defensive position .
it was a fundamental weakness that challenger stoiber , the premier of bavaria , put to his advantage in a series of forceful attacks against the chancellor covering the most important issues of the election , making the anticipated event feel like a political soccer match .
the most contentious exchanges revolved around spiraling unemployment , a stagnant economy , tax reforms , immigration and germany 's stance on a possible iraq invasion – all dominant issues in the media during the days and weeks leading up to the first debate .
the keyword of the night seemed to be " failure , " of which both candidates repeatedly accused the other of on each key issue .
the debate , which is being called a " duel " here , was broadcast by the private television stations rtl and sat.1.
schröder taken to task for soaring unemployment in one of the most aggressive salvos of the evening , stoiber blamed germany 's high unemployment level of over four million on the current red-green government , led by schröder 's social democrats and the greens .
he said schröder had failed in his promise to reduce unemployment levels to fewer than 3.5 million people .
he criticized schröder for his plan to delay a tax cut scheduled for 2003 in order to fund the rebuilding of communities ravaged this summer by the biggest floods in a hundred years .
he said the government made a " mistake " by instituting tax reforms that did nothing to help what he described as the " most important " part of the german economy : small- to middle-sized businesses .
" we ca n't forget that the center of gravity of our labor market is dependent on the ...
german market .
we have only a relatively small share of exports to america .
other countries , like england , france , sweden , finland and spain have the same international ties , but they do n't have the dramatically growing number of unemployed or such a weak economic growth rate . "
schröder conceded he was disappointed by germany 's unemployment rate , but fought back by saying it was the result of the global economic downturn and not a homemade problem as stoiber had suggested .
as for the delayed tax cut , he said , " i 'm convinced that the people of this country understand that today 's damage ca n't be compensated for with debts that our children and grandchildren will then have to pay . "
how full is the ship ?
addressing immigration , stoiber said he thought it was " wrong for germany to have a law that provides for more immigration . "
he said that every year germany takes in 500,000 to 600,000 new immigrants - the equivalent of cities like dortmund or nuremburg .
he said the new immigration law would increase that number by 100,000 to 150,000 .
" we are n't even finished assimilating the foreigner children who are already here .
we need to do a lot more .
for that reason we should n't increase immigration , " he said .
schröder defended his government 's new law , passed in march , saying it both limited immigration in areas where it is n't needed while at the same time opening doors for highly skilled workers who are needed in the technology sector .
while stoiber 's numbers were correct , he said , he had omitted the annual outflow of several hundred thousand – refugees of countries once torn by civil war , for example .
when you add those figures in , he said , the increase is more like 100,000 people .
stoiber : schröder 's iraq position " irresponsible " schröder also found himself on the defensive on the subject of a possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
recently , schröder has alluded that the u.s. was planning to engage in " military adventurism , " and said that germany would not participate , even under a united nations mandate .
on sunday night , however , schröder sought to draw a line between his stances on u.n. efforts to get weapons inspectors back inside baghdad and the u.s. ' desire to topple saddam hussein 's regime .
" in light of the situation in the middle east , and considering the fact that we have n't conquered the taliban and are far from having rebuilt afghanistan , a military intervention in iraq is wrong , and for that reason , under my leadership , germany will not help in that effort , " the chancellor said .
stoiber , meanwhile , called schröder 's public statements on the issue , and his stance , " irresponsible . "
he specifically criticized schröder for saying the country must go the " german way , " a phrase he said had historically charged connotations - at least in the ears of the international community .
he also said schröder 's public statements and policy reduced some of the international pressure on hussein .
" with saddam hussein , you have a war criminal as head of government , a head of state who possesses weapons of mass destruction and has even used them against his own people and those in neighboring iran .
we need to do everything we can , make every diplomatic effort , apply as much political pressure " as is needed to get un inspectors back inside iraq , stoiber said .
he said the chancellor should n't be ruling out every " theoretical option . "
stalemate so who won ?
the jury ca n't seem to make up its mind .
immediately after the debate , the editor in chief of the newsweekly " der spiegel , " stefan aust , said he " did n't get the impression he -lrb- schröder -rrb- was the media chancellor .
he could have done better . "
aust even accused him of putting his german television audience to sleep .
but polls taken of viewers sunday night were all over the board .
a forsa institute poll for sat.1 put schröder ahead .
another , by pollster wahlen for public broadcaster zdf had stoiber ahead by two points .
but another , by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard put schröder far ahead of his bavarian challenger .
in editorials published in the monday editions , many major regional newspapers shied away from declaring a victor .

but stoiber and schröder succeeded in piquing interest in what had until now been a sleepy election . going into sunday night 's debate against edmund stoiber , gerhard schröder already had a huge disadvantage – as the four-year chancellor of germany , he found himself in a defensive position .
it was a fundamental weakness that challenger stoiber , the premier of bavaria , put to his advantage in a series of forceful attacks against the chancellor covering the most important issues of the election , making the anticipated event feel like a political soccer match .
the most contentious exchanges revolved around spiraling unemployment , a stagnant economy , tax reforms , immigration and germany 's stance on a possible iraq invasion – all dominant issues in the media during the days and weeks leading up to the first debate .
the keyword of the night seemed to be " failure , " of which both candidates repeatedly accused the other of on each key issue .
the debate , which is being called a " duel " here , was broadcast by the private television stations rtl and sat.1.
schröder taken to task for soaring unemployment in one of the most aggressive salvos of the evening , stoiber blamed germany 's high unemployment level of over four million on the current red-green government , led by schröder 's social democrats and the greens .
he said schröder had failed in his promise to reduce unemployment levels to fewer than 3.5 million people .
he criticized schröder for his plan to delay a tax cut scheduled for 2003 in order to fund the rebuilding of communities ravaged this summer by the biggest floods in a hundred years .
he said the government made a " mistake " by instituting tax reforms that did nothing to help what he described as the " most important " part of the german economy : small- to middle-sized businesses .
" we ca n't forget that the center of gravity of our labor market is dependent on the ...
german market .
we have only a relatively small share of exports to america .
other countries , like england , france , sweden , finland and spain have the same international ties , but they do n't have the dramatically growing number of unemployed or such a weak economic growth rate . "
schröder conceded he was disappointed by germany 's unemployment rate , but fought back by saying it was the result of the global economic downturn and not a homemade problem as stoiber had suggested .
as for the delayed tax cut , he said , " i 'm convinced that the people of this country understand that today 's damage ca n't be compensated for with debts that our children and grandchildren will then have to pay . "
how full is the ship ?
addressing immigration , stoiber said he thought it was " wrong for germany to have a law that provides for more immigration . "
he said that every year germany takes in 500,000 to 600,000 new immigrants - the equivalent of cities like dortmund or nuremburg .
he said the new immigration law would increase that number by 100,000 to 150,000 .
" we are n't even finished assimilating the foreigner children who are already here .
we need to do a lot more .
for that reason we should n't increase immigration , " he said .
schröder defended his government 's new law , passed in march , saying it both limited immigration in areas where it is n't needed while at the same time opening doors for highly skilled workers who are needed in the technology sector .
while stoiber 's numbers were correct , he said , he had omitted the annual outflow of several hundred thousand – refugees of countries once torn by civil war , for example .
when you add those figures in , he said , the increase is more like 100,000 people .
stoiber : schröder 's iraq position " irresponsible " schröder also found himself on the defensive on the subject of a possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
recently , schröder has alluded that the u.s. was planning to engage in " military adventurism , " and said that germany would not participate , even under a united nations mandate .
on sunday night , however , schröder sought to draw a line between his stances on u.n. efforts to get weapons inspectors back inside baghdad and the u.s. ' desire to topple saddam hussein 's regime .
" in light of the situation in the middle east , and considering the fact that we have n't conquered the taliban and are far from having rebuilt afghanistan , a military intervention in iraq is wrong , and for that reason , under my leadership , germany will not help in that effort , " the chancellor said .
stoiber , meanwhile , called schröder 's public statements on the issue , and his stance , " irresponsible . "
he specifically criticized schröder for saying the country must go the " german way , " a phrase he said had historically charged connotations - at least in the ears of the international community .
he also said schröder 's public statements and policy reduced some of the international pressure on hussein .
" with saddam hussein , you have a war criminal as head of government , a head of state who possesses weapons of mass destruction and has even used them against his own people and those in neighboring iran .
we need to do everything we can , make every diplomatic effort , apply as much political pressure " as is needed to get un inspectors back inside iraq , stoiber said .
he said the chancellor should n't be ruling out every " theoretical option . "
stalemate so who won ?
the jury ca n't seem to make up its mind .
immediately after the debate , the editor in chief of the newsweekly " der spiegel , " stefan aust , said he " did n't get the impression he -lrb- schröder -rrb- was the media chancellor .
he could have done better . "
aust even accused him of putting his german television audience to sleep .
but polls taken of viewers sunday night were all over the board .
a forsa institute poll for sat.1 put schröder ahead .
another , by pollster wahlen for public broadcaster zdf had stoiber ahead by two points .
but another , by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard put schröder far ahead of his bavarian challenger .
in editorials published in the monday editions , many major regional newspapers shied away from declaring a victor .
the mass-circulation " bild " described german voters as the victors for even taking an interest in the debate .
the " berliner zeitung , " meanwhile , described it as a duel that had neither a conqueror nor someone who had been conquered .
indeed , if a television debate were analogous to soccer , you might say that stoiber controlled the ball for much of the game – e.g. he steered the issues and went in with the most attacks – but neither candidate , it seemed , scored many goals . and that 's too bad considering that in germany 's first ever television debate there was no provision for penalty shots . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery read everything you need to know about the politicians , parties and hot-button issues , along with a dummy 's guide to the german political system , as germans head for the polls for national elections on september 22 .

western countries are promoting “ public-private partnerships ” at the earth summit in johannesburg as a path to sustainable development .
environmentalists are skeptical , saying it puts big business before people . led by the united states , western countries showcased partnerships on thursday between governments , private industry and other groups as a practical way of furthering economic development and saving the environment . they say such partnerships are ways for business and governments to pool their resources and harness the funds and the know-how to accomplish more than either could on its own . un organizers say they have received 218 proposed partnerships , in areas ranging from health care to renewable energy projects that could go a long way in helping meet summit goals of halving global poverty by 2015 while slowing environmental degradation . congo project a multi-nation project to expand efforts to save forests in central africa ’ s congo basin was announced on thursday .
germany , the us , japan and indonesia are among the countries that want to provide an additional $ 53 million dollars over four years to a partnership between the paper industry active in the region and the local population .
the plan aims to develop protected forest areas and cut down on illegal logging . but many environmentalists are wary of relying on private business to save the planet .
they say partnerships may let companies cash in on providing essential services like water and electricity , while allowing governments to shirk their traditional responsibilities . “ if a government doesn ’ t do its regulation homework , it could be more than happy to let a private company come in and take over things , ” jörg kusche with greenpeace in germany told dw-world .
“ but then there would be no transparency or accountability .
we don ’ t think that ’ s the right direction . ” he and other environmental activists have expressed concern that public-private partnerships will be used by big business as an exercise in “ greenwash ” – putting a cloak of environmental responsibility around a company that could mask activities that could actually be damaging to the environment or people in development countries . martin kaiser , international environmental expert for greenpeace who is in johannesburg , criticised the congo plan after it was announced saying it appeared to have been developed largely by the paper industry with only minimal input from indigenous groups threatened by the congo forests ’ destruction . “ there ’ s already a lot of criticism about these initiatives .
a lot seem to be one-sided in favor of industry , ” he told dw-world . in un parlance , these public-private agreements are called “ type 2 ” initiatives .
the idea is that these voluntary programs can be decided on and launched quickly by the parties involved as opposed to being endorsed by the “ type 1 ” process , which requires the approval of an international forum and can be bureaucratic and time-consuming . “ we think it would be more sensible if these were a completion of type 1 initiatives and a part of binding agreements instead of just voluntary ones , whose outcome is anything but certain , ” kusche said . practical steps but the americans at the summit see such agreements as practical steps towards sustainable development .
public funds used in partnerships , according to us thinking , can leverage private investment .
assistant secretary of state john turner said the us plans on commiting $ 970 million over the next three years to water projects , but expects to mobilize more than $ 1.6 billion through partnerships . the us agency for international development presented a $ 90 million proposal to fight hunger in africa by teaming up with regional trade groups and industry partners . paula dobriansky , a us undersecretary of state for global affairs , dismissed skepticism on the part of some activists . “ i have found a great deal of enthusiasm … all want to see us really have some action here , ” she said . european union officials were also talking up several of their proposed projects on thursday , including agreements in energy and water management .
but they were more circumspect than their translatlantic partners about the extent to which public-private partnerships can solve all the world ’ s problems . in a statement , danish environment minister hans christian schmidt , who is representing the eu in johannesburg , cautioned against upsetting the balance between the public and private part of the equation . “ partnerships are a complement to -lrb- government -rrb- commitments , ” he said , “ not a substitute for them . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de on the green road from rio to johannesburg the un summit in johannesburg next week has been dubbed " rio + 10 " or " earth summit 2 " .

western countries are promoting “ public-private partnerships ” at the earth summit in johannesburg as a path to sustainable development .
environmentalists are skeptical , saying it puts big business before people . led by the united states , western countries showcased partnerships on thursday between governments , private industry and other groups as a practical way of furthering economic development and saving the environment . they say such partnerships are ways for business and governments to pool their resources and harness the funds and the know-how to accomplish more than either could on its own . un organizers say they have received 218 proposed partnerships , in areas ranging from health care to renewable energy projects that could go a long way in helping meet summit goals of halving global poverty by 2015 while slowing environmental degradation . congo project a multi-nation project to expand efforts to save forests in central africa ’ s congo basin was announced on thursday .
germany , the us , japan and indonesia are among the countries that want to provide an additional $ 53 million dollars over four years to a partnership between the paper industry active in the region and the local population .
the plan aims to develop protected forest areas and cut down on illegal logging . but many environmentalists are wary of relying on private business to save the planet .
they say partnerships may let companies cash in on providing essential services like water and electricity , while allowing governments to shirk their traditional responsibilities . “ if a government doesn ’ t do its regulation homework , it could be more than happy to let a private company come in and take over things , ” jörg kusche with greenpeace in germany told dw-world .

“ it ’ s … about the future of our children , ” he told delegates at the united nations summit on sustainable development in south africa , which will wind up this wednesday .
“ that ’ s why this conference should encourage the states who have not yet ratified the kyoto protocol , to do that as quickly as possible so that it can come into effect next year . ” kyoto protocol a sticking point at summit the protocol , agreed on in 1997 , calls on its signatories to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from their 1990 stand by 5.2 percent by 2012 . the usa and australia , among other nations , have so far refused to sign it .
the protocol , therefore , is now relying on the russian parliament ’ s ratification before it can take effect . the protocol remains one of the unresolved disputes as the conference winds its way down .
after last week ’ s delegations , the first governmental ministers started arriving in johannesburg over the weekend to smooth out differences on disputes over renewable energies and access to water before the arrival of schröder and other heads of state on monday . as at the inaugural earth summit in rio de janeiro in 1992 , government leaders will affix their signature to a 70-page action plan at the conclusion of the summit .
the agreement will aim to provide a blueprint on global environmental and developmental policy over the next decade . solar , wind power still an obstacle around 95 percent of the plan has been agreed on , according to reports from the summit , but the remaining 5 percent contains a host of controversial topics – chief among them a quota on renewable energy . germany , along with the european union and a clutch of other nations , wants renewable energies , such as wind and solar power to comprise 15 percent of the world ’ s energy use by 2010 - 2 percent more than it is now . the united states and smaller , oil-producing nations are against setting such a timetable . environmental organizations are saying the plan isn ’ t aggressive enough . schröder used his speech to praise his country 's commitment to renewable energy and urge the rest of the conference to follow germany 's lead . “ with the efficient use of energy and the massive expansion of the renewable energy sector , we will have pointed the way to the future , ” schröder told conference participants , among them united nations general secretary kofi annan and south african president thabo mbeki . he said the german government would spend 100 million euro a year over the next five years to work with developing countries on increasing their use of renewable energy .
he also said his country would take part in a global network of energy agencies agreed on sunday and invited conference participants to an international renewable energy conference in germany . drinking water a crucial step in fighting poverty echoing his development and aid minister , heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who attended the conference earlier , schröder called for a more effective battle against poverty .
the eu member states , he said , will raise their public aid budget from the current 26 billion euro to 35 billion euro in 2006 .
providing clean drinking water to populations in developing countries will also form a central plank of the fight against poverty .
earlier german environmental minister jürgen trittin told dw-tv that the reduction of poverty will " only be possible with access to the basic requirement of life : water . "

western countries are promoting “ public-private partnerships ” at the earth summit in johannesburg as a path to sustainable development .
environmentalists are skeptical , saying it puts big business before people . led by the united states , western countries showcased partnerships on thursday between governments , private industry and other groups as a practical way of furthering economic development and saving the environment . they say such partnerships are ways for business and governments to pool their resources and harness the funds and the know-how to accomplish more than either could on its own . un organizers say they have received 218 proposed partnerships , in areas ranging from health care to renewable energy projects that could go a long way in helping meet summit goals of halving global poverty by 2015 while slowing environmental degradation . congo project a multi-nation project to expand efforts to save forests in central africa ’ s congo basin was announced on thursday .
germany , the us , japan and indonesia are among the countries that want to provide an additional $ 53 million dollars over four years to a partnership between the paper industry active in the region and the local population .
the plan aims to develop protected forest areas and cut down on illegal logging . but many environmentalists are wary of relying on private business to save the planet .
they say partnerships may let companies cash in on providing essential services like water and electricity , while allowing governments to shirk their traditional responsibilities . “ if a government doesn ’ t do its regulation homework , it could be more than happy to let a private company come in and take over things , ” jörg kusche with greenpeace in germany told dw-world .
“ but then there would be no transparency or accountability .
we don ’ t think that ’ s the right direction . ” he and other environmental activists have expressed concern that public-private partnerships will be used by big business as an exercise in “ greenwash ” – putting a cloak of environmental responsibility around a company that could mask activities that could actually be damaging to the environment or people in development countries . martin kaiser , international environmental expert for greenpeace who is in johannesburg , criticised the congo plan after it was announced saying it appeared to have been developed largely by the paper industry with only minimal input from indigenous groups threatened by the congo forests ’ destruction . “ there ’ s already a lot of criticism about these initiatives .
a lot seem to be one-sided in favor of industry , ” he told dw-world . in un parlance , these public-private agreements are called “ type 2 ” initiatives .
the idea is that these voluntary programs can be decided on and launched quickly by the parties involved as opposed to being endorsed by the “ type 1 ” process , which requires the approval of an international forum and can be bureaucratic and time-consuming . “ we think it would be more sensible if these were a completion of type 1 initiatives and a part of binding agreements instead of just voluntary ones , whose outcome is anything but certain , ” kusche said . practical steps but the americans at the summit see such agreements as practical steps towards sustainable development .
public funds used in partnerships , according to us thinking , can leverage private investment .
assistant secretary of state john turner said the us plans on commiting $ 970 million over the next three years to water projects , but expects to mobilize more than $ 1.6 billion through partnerships . the us agency for international development presented a $ 90 million proposal to fight hunger in africa by teaming up with regional trade groups and industry partners . paula dobriansky , a us undersecretary of state for global affairs , dismissed skepticism on the part of some activists . “ i have found a great deal of enthusiasm … all want to see us really have some action here , ” she said . european union officials were also talking up several of their proposed projects on thursday , including agreements in energy and water management .
but they were more circumspect than their translatlantic partners about the extent to which public-private partnerships can solve all the world ’ s problems . in a statement , danish environment minister hans christian schmidt , who is representing the eu in johannesburg , cautioned against upsetting the balance between the public and private part of the equation . “ partnerships are a complement to -lrb- government -rrb- commitments , ” he said , “ not a substitute for them . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de on the green road from rio to johannesburg the un summit in johannesburg next week has been dubbed " rio + 10 " or " earth summit 2 " .

11 terrorist in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm announces charges morrocan born mounir el motassadeq will face at least 3,116 counts of accessory to murder for his alleged role in helping mohammed atta 's hamburg cell plan the sept .
11 terror attack . close to a year after the terror attacks of sept .
11 , the federal prosecutors office in germany announced it filed criminal charges this week against a hamburg man suspected of aiding in the planning and financing of the attacks .
the charges are the first against a german member of the terror cell responsible for the attacks .
on thursday , federal prosecutor kay nehm said the suspect , morrocan citizen mounir el motassadeq , was charged on wednesday as an accessory to murder in the killings of at least 3,116 people in new york and washington and for membership in a terrorist organization .
prosecutors believe the 28-year-old student was deeply involved in the hamburg terror cell led by mohammed atta that carried out the deadly attacks .
the case has brought many previously unknown facts about the sept .
11 attacks to light .
investigators here now believe the terrorist cell had begun planning a major attack as far back as oct .
1999 , and that the world trade center first emerged as a possible target in april or may 2000 .
at the time , nehm said , hijacker marwan al shehhi told a hamburg librarian of his intentions .
" there will be thousands of dead , you will all think of me , " he reportedly said .
nehm said he also uttered the words " world trade center . "
a member " right up to the end " authorities arrested electrical engineering student el motassadeq in nov .
2001 , and he has been held in investigative custody since then in a jail in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
nehm said motassadeq had maintained intensive contacts with the terror cell for several years and also lived in the same neighborhood as the terrorists with his wife and child .
nehm said he believes motassadeq " remained part of the assassination preparations right up to the end . "
motassadeq played a definitive role in the financing of the hamburg terror cell 's activities , the indictement stated . he held power of attorney over , as well as an automated teller card for , a bank account that had originally been opened by al shehhi , one of the terrorists who died in the airplane attacks .

al qaeda terrorists also allegedly used the account to pay their expenses while living in the u.s. both are still on the run from authorities .
nehm described motassadeq as a " governor in hamburg " for the terror cell during the time atta and others were in taking classes in u.s. flight schools .
additionally , nehm said , motassadeq 's signature appeared on a testament written by atta that surfaced after the deadly attacks were carried out .

as far as actually financing the repair of the damages went , heated arguments and acrimonious debates were the order of the day .
opening the debate , german chancellor gerhard schröder said that the floods had caused the worst damage in germany since the second world war .
he thanked the scores of voluntary and professional helpers who had laboured to pile sandbags and help people to safety .
" not just a catastrophic flood , but also an unbelievable wave of solidarity has swept through germany " , he said .

he said that the opposition union bloc had chosen not to block the government 's plans to avoid " fighting on the backs of the victims " .
but he emphasised that he thinks the government 's strategy is wrong .
" high taxes will cripple economic performance , stem growth , destroy jobs " , he said .
the opposition is pushing instead to use the profits of germany 's central bank to finance flood repairs .
" higher interest rates are a lesser evil compared to higher taxes " , stoiber said .

free democrats want to go third way the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- joined the union parties in opposing the planned hike in corporation taxes .
fdp leader guido westerwelle accused the government of worsening the flood catastrophe through another " catastrophe " of higher taxes .
but the union bloc 's financing suggestion did n't meet with the liberals ' approval either .
the money instead should come from diverting funds and saving in other areas , westerwelle said .
pds wants money from military projects parliamentary floor leader of the party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- , roland claus , called upon the government to cancel planned weapons projects such as the military transporter a400 m in order to finance repairs .

will the relief package suffice ?
despite the barbed debates , georg milbrandt , the premier of one of the most affected states , saxony , took comfort in the fact that that the relief package could be coming soon .
but he was skeptical about whether 10 billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in direct financial assistance approved earlier this week would be enough .

the company saw the tracks of some of its main lines near dresden get washed away , train stations flooded and the collapse of crucial bridges , including one on a high-speed rail line connecting northern and southern germany .
appearing at the chancellery in berlin on wednesday , deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn issued a preliminary estimate of over one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in flood damages .
" according to our cautious first estimates , we believe we have suffered revenue losses and damages of 1.025 billion euro , " mehdorn said .
he stressed that this would not be the final damage sum .
a laundry list of damages more than 400 kilometers of deutsche bahn tracks are currently unusable , and 94 bridges and 200 train stations have been badly damaged .
early estimates suggest that the service outages alone will lead to a 90 million euro -lrb- $ 88 million -rrb- drop in revenue from passenger and freight services .
mehdorn said it would take two and a half years before deutsche bahn service could return to its pre-flood level in the region .
the federal government has already agreed to provide deutsche bahn with 650 million euro -lrb- $ 638 million -rrb- to rebuild its network and repair damaged train stations .
more than half the money had already been earmarked for transportation infrastructure development projects in the eastern states that were formerly part of east germany .
deutsche bahn said its first reconstruction priorities would be lines in the leipzig-dresden-chemnitz triangle .
a line connecting dresden with prague will also be rebuilt as quickly as possible .
mehdorn said there are currently no plans to cancel any proposed deutsche bahn projects – including the planned transrapid train line between dortmund and düsseldorf .
new priorities , however , could lead to delays , he warned .
a job-saving deal as part of a four-point " immediate aid " program , the government also reached an agreement with deutsche bahn and the transnet union that the company would not lay off any employees between now and 2006 as a result of the flooding .
until this week 's agreement , talks between the employees ' union and bahn had reached an impasse .
mehdorn said deutsche bahn will reintroduce regular long-distance train service in the state of saxony-anhalt on thursday and is working on a plan to reintroduce long-distance trains in saxony as quickly as possible .
agricultural damage estimated at 267 million euro separately , german consumer protection and agricultural minister renate künast announced the government would release 141 million euro -lrb- $ 138 million -rrb- between now and the end of the year in immediate aid to farmers struck by the flooding .

but stoiber and schröder succeeded in piquing interest in what had until now been a sleepy election . going into sunday night 's debate against edmund stoiber , gerhard schröder already had a huge disadvantage – as the four-year chancellor of germany , he found himself in a defensive position .
it was a fundamental weakness that challenger stoiber , the premier of bavaria , put to his advantage in a series of forceful attacks against the chancellor covering the most important issues of the election , making the anticipated event feel like a political soccer match .
the most contentious exchanges revolved around spiraling unemployment , a stagnant economy , tax reforms , immigration and germany 's stance on a possible iraq invasion – all dominant issues in the media during the days and weeks leading up to the first debate .
the keyword of the night seemed to be " failure , " of which both candidates repeatedly accused the other of on each key issue .
the debate , which is being called a " duel " here , was broadcast by the private television stations rtl and sat.1.
schröder taken to task for soaring unemployment in one of the most aggressive salvos of the evening , stoiber blamed germany 's high unemployment level of over four million on the current red-green government , led by schröder 's social democrats and the greens .
he said schröder had failed in his promise to reduce unemployment levels to fewer than 3.5 million people .
he criticized schröder for his plan to delay a tax cut scheduled for 2003 in order to fund the rebuilding of communities ravaged this summer by the biggest floods in a hundred years .
he said the government made a " mistake " by instituting tax reforms that did nothing to help what he described as the " most important " part of the german economy : small- to middle-sized businesses .
" we ca n't forget that the center of gravity of our labor market is dependent on the ...
german market .
we have only a relatively small share of exports to america .
other countries , like england , france , sweden , finland and spain have the same international ties , but they do n't have the dramatically growing number of unemployed or such a weak economic growth rate . "
schröder conceded he was disappointed by germany 's unemployment rate , but fought back by saying it was the result of the global economic downturn and not a homemade problem as stoiber had suggested .
as for the delayed tax cut , he said , " i 'm convinced that the people of this country understand that today 's damage ca n't be compensated for with debts that our children and grandchildren will then have to pay . "
how full is the ship ?
addressing immigration , stoiber said he thought it was " wrong for germany to have a law that provides for more immigration . "
he said that every year germany takes in 500,000 to 600,000 new immigrants - the equivalent of cities like dortmund or nuremburg .
he said the new immigration law would increase that number by 100,000 to 150,000 .
" we are n't even finished assimilating the foreigner children who are already here .
we need to do a lot more .
for that reason we should n't increase immigration , " he said .
schröder defended his government 's new law , passed in march , saying it both limited immigration in areas where it is n't needed while at the same time opening doors for highly skilled workers who are needed in the technology sector .
while stoiber 's numbers were correct , he said , he had omitted the annual outflow of several hundred thousand – refugees of countries once torn by civil war , for example .
when you add those figures in , he said , the increase is more like 100,000 people .
stoiber : schröder 's iraq position " irresponsible " schröder also found himself on the defensive on the subject of a possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
recently , schröder has alluded that the u.s. was planning to engage in " military adventurism , " and said that germany would not participate , even under a united nations mandate .
on sunday night , however , schröder sought to draw a line between his stances on u.n. efforts to get weapons inspectors back inside baghdad and the u.s. ' desire to topple saddam hussein 's regime .
" in light of the situation in the middle east , and considering the fact that we have n't conquered the taliban and are far from having rebuilt afghanistan , a military intervention in iraq is wrong , and for that reason , under my leadership , germany will not help in that effort , " the chancellor said .
stoiber , meanwhile , called schröder 's public statements on the issue , and his stance , " irresponsible . "
he specifically criticized schröder for saying the country must go the " german way , " a phrase he said had historically charged connotations - at least in the ears of the international community .
he also said schröder 's public statements and policy reduced some of the international pressure on hussein .
" with saddam hussein , you have a war criminal as head of government , a head of state who possesses weapons of mass destruction and has even used them against his own people and those in neighboring iran .
we need to do everything we can , make every diplomatic effort , apply as much political pressure " as is needed to get un inspectors back inside iraq , stoiber said .
he said the chancellor should n't be ruling out every " theoretical option . "
stalemate so who won ?
the jury ca n't seem to make up its mind .
immediately after the debate , the editor in chief of the newsweekly " der spiegel , " stefan aust , said he " did n't get the impression he -lrb- schröder -rrb- was the media chancellor .
he could have done better . "
aust even accused him of putting his german television audience to sleep .
but polls taken of viewers sunday night were all over the board .
a forsa institute poll for sat.1 put schröder ahead .
another , by pollster wahlen for public broadcaster zdf had stoiber ahead by two points .
but another , by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard put schröder far ahead of his bavarian challenger .
in editorials published in the monday editions , many major regional newspapers shied away from declaring a victor .
the mass-circulation " bild " described german voters as the victors for even taking an interest in the debate .
the " berliner zeitung , " meanwhile , described it as a duel that had neither a conqueror nor someone who had been conquered .
indeed , if a television debate were analogous to soccer , you might say that stoiber controlled the ball for much of the game – e.g. he steered the issues and went in with the most attacks – but neither candidate , it seemed , scored many goals . and that 's too bad considering that in germany 's first ever television debate there was no provision for penalty shots . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery read everything you need to know about the politicians , parties and hot-button issues , along with a dummy 's guide to the german political system , as germans head for the polls for national elections on september 22 .

but stoiber and schröder succeeded in piquing interest in what had until now been a sleepy election . going into sunday night 's debate against edmund stoiber , gerhard schröder already had a huge disadvantage – as the four-year chancellor of germany , he found himself in a defensive position .
it was a fundamental weakness that challenger stoiber , the premier of bavaria , put to his advantage in a series of forceful attacks against the chancellor covering the most important issues of the election , making the anticipated event feel like a political soccer match .
the most contentious exchanges revolved around spiraling unemployment , a stagnant economy , tax reforms , immigration and germany 's stance on a possible iraq invasion – all dominant issues in the media during the days and weeks leading up to the first debate .
the keyword of the night seemed to be " failure , " of which both candidates repeatedly accused the other of on each key issue .
the debate , which is being called a " duel " here , was broadcast by the private television stations rtl and sat.1.
schröder taken to task for soaring unemployment in one of the most aggressive salvos of the evening , stoiber blamed germany 's high unemployment level of over four million on the current red-green government , led by schröder 's social democrats and the greens .
he said schröder had failed in his promise to reduce unemployment levels to fewer than 3.5 million people .
he criticized schröder for his plan to delay a tax cut scheduled for 2003 in order to fund the rebuilding of communities ravaged this summer by the biggest floods in a hundred years .
he said the government made a " mistake " by instituting tax reforms that did nothing to help what he described as the " most important " part of the german economy : small- to middle-sized businesses .
" we ca n't forget that the center of gravity of our labor market is dependent on the ...
german market .
we have only a relatively small share of exports to america .
other countries , like england , france , sweden , finland and spain have the same international ties , but they do n't have the dramatically growing number of unemployed or such a weak economic growth rate . "
schröder conceded he was disappointed by germany 's unemployment rate , but fought back by saying it was the result of the global economic downturn and not a homemade problem as stoiber had suggested .
as for the delayed tax cut , he said , " i 'm convinced that the people of this country understand that today 's damage ca n't be compensated for with debts that our children and grandchildren will then have to pay . "
how full is the ship ?
addressing immigration , stoiber said he thought it was " wrong for germany to have a law that provides for more immigration . "
he said that every year germany takes in 500,000 to 600,000 new immigrants - the equivalent of cities like dortmund or nuremburg .
he said the new immigration law would increase that number by 100,000 to 150,000 .
" we are n't even finished assimilating the foreigner children who are already here .
we need to do a lot more .
for that reason we should n't increase immigration , " he said .
schröder defended his government 's new law , passed in march , saying it both limited immigration in areas where it is n't needed while at the same time opening doors for highly skilled workers who are needed in the technology sector .
while stoiber 's numbers were correct , he said , he had omitted the annual outflow of several hundred thousand – refugees of countries once torn by civil war , for example .
when you add those figures in , he said , the increase is more like 100,000 people .
stoiber : schröder 's iraq position " irresponsible " schröder also found himself on the defensive on the subject of a possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
recently , schröder has alluded that the u.s. was planning to engage in " military adventurism , " and said that germany would not participate , even under a united nations mandate .
on sunday night , however , schröder sought to draw a line between his stances on u.n. efforts to get weapons inspectors back inside baghdad and the u.s. ' desire to topple saddam hussein 's regime .
" in light of the situation in the middle east , and considering the fact that we have n't conquered the taliban and are far from having rebuilt afghanistan , a military intervention in iraq is wrong , and for that reason , under my leadership , germany will not help in that effort , " the chancellor said .
stoiber , meanwhile , called schröder 's public statements on the issue , and his stance , " irresponsible . "
he specifically criticized schröder for saying the country must go the " german way , " a phrase he said had historically charged connotations - at least in the ears of the international community .
he also said schröder 's public statements and policy reduced some of the international pressure on hussein .
" with saddam hussein , you have a war criminal as head of government , a head of state who possesses weapons of mass destruction and has even used them against his own people and those in neighboring iran .
we need to do everything we can , make every diplomatic effort , apply as much political pressure " as is needed to get un inspectors back inside iraq , stoiber said .
he said the chancellor should n't be ruling out every " theoretical option . "
stalemate so who won ?
the jury ca n't seem to make up its mind .
immediately after the debate , the editor in chief of the newsweekly " der spiegel , " stefan aust , said he " did n't get the impression he -lrb- schröder -rrb- was the media chancellor .
he could have done better . "
aust even accused him of putting his german television audience to sleep .
but polls taken of viewers sunday night were all over the board .
a forsa institute poll for sat.1 put schröder ahead .
another , by pollster wahlen for public broadcaster zdf had stoiber ahead by two points .

11 : one year later fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany current affairs -pipe- 03.09.2002 terrorism fears a no show in german elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the american embassy in berlin after september 11 almost a year after the sept .
11 attacks , terrorism has vanished from the political agenda in germany .
experts say time and other issues have pushed the topic from voters ' minds . in the months following sept .
11 , germans couldn ’ t get enough tough talk on terrorism . the realization that the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon were most likely planned in hamburg , sent shockwaves through the country and , as a result , through the political establishment as well . the government was quick to react : interior minister otto schily prepared two “ security packages ” that expanded the reach and financing of germany ’ s law enforcement and got them past the legislature within a quick few months . germans rewarded their government ’ s tough talk on terrorism with high approval ratings and observers wondered at the speed and solidarity with which berlin was operating . now , just weeks before the attacks ’ anniversary , terrorism has all but escaped from the voters ’ minds , and , as a result , the political agenda .
in the midst of a hard-fought election campaign , germany ’ s recent floods , the high unemployment rate and slumping economy have grabbed the headlines , pushing aside concern over the spread of islamic fundamentalism and terror cells in the country . the reasons , say experts , have to do with both the time lapse since sept .
11 and the zero tolerance image chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has presented since then .
the speed with which the government moved to pass anti-terrorism measures and assure germans their country was safe was enough to allay fears relatively quickly , said jochen hippler , political scientist at the university of duisberg . quick enough to calm fears “ in a sense , the internal security situation , at least unofficially , has never been deemed so dangerous , “ said hippler .
“ it would have been different if the government had been more loose in its words and actions . ” there is also little difference in the way both schröder ’ s social democratic party and his challenger , edmund stoiber and his christian democratic and christian social union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- bloc , approach the anti-terrorism fight . the cdu / csu and spd look at foreign policy and domestic security in the same context .

the company saw the tracks of some of its main lines near dresden get washed away , train stations flooded and the collapse of crucial bridges , including one on a high-speed rail line connecting northern and southern germany .
appearing at the chancellery in berlin on wednesday , deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn issued a preliminary estimate of over one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in flood damages .
" according to our cautious first estimates , we believe we have suffered revenue losses and damages of 1.025 billion euro , " mehdorn said .
he stressed that this would not be the final damage sum .
a laundry list of damages more than 400 kilometers of deutsche bahn tracks are currently unusable , and 94 bridges and 200 train stations have been badly damaged .
early estimates suggest that the service outages alone will lead to a 90 million euro -lrb- $ 88 million -rrb- drop in revenue from passenger and freight services .
mehdorn said it would take two and a half years before deutsche bahn service could return to its pre-flood level in the region .
the federal government has already agreed to provide deutsche bahn with 650 million euro -lrb- $ 638 million -rrb- to rebuild its network and repair damaged train stations .
more than half the money had already been earmarked for transportation infrastructure development projects in the eastern states that were formerly part of east germany .
deutsche bahn said its first reconstruction priorities would be lines in the leipzig-dresden-chemnitz triangle .
a line connecting dresden with prague will also be rebuilt as quickly as possible .
mehdorn said there are currently no plans to cancel any proposed deutsche bahn projects – including the planned transrapid train line between dortmund and düsseldorf .
new priorities , however , could lead to delays , he warned .
a job-saving deal as part of a four-point " immediate aid " program , the government also reached an agreement with deutsche bahn and the transnet union that the company would not lay off any employees between now and 2006 as a result of the flooding .
until this week 's agreement , talks between the employees ' union and bahn had reached an impasse .
mehdorn said deutsche bahn will reintroduce regular long-distance train service in the state of saxony-anhalt on thursday and is working on a plan to reintroduce long-distance trains in saxony as quickly as possible .
agricultural damage estimated at 267 million euro separately , german consumer protection and agricultural minister renate künast announced the government would release 141 million euro -lrb- $ 138 million -rrb- between now and the end of the year in immediate aid to farmers struck by the flooding .
künast said the government is estimating an initial 267 million euro -lrb- $ 262 million -rrb- in damages to farms .
but the government has not yet added damages to farm buildings to its estimate . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting deutsche bahn back on track after floods germany 's main railway company , deutsche bahn , estimates flood damage to the country 's railway network will reach " tens of billion euro " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.09.2002 government under fire for neo-nazi informants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : explosive combination : neo-nazi informants and hate music in the latest scandal involving the domestic intelligence agency 's use of informants , reports allege the government looked the other way as two extremist spooks produced a cd inciting the murder of prominent german jews . on thursday , the domestic affairs committee of the german parliament , the bundestag , will convene to debate the use of informants from right-wing extremist and neo-nazi groups by the federal office for the protection of the constitution , germany 's domestic intelligence agency .
for years , the agency has put members of extremist organizations , often leaders , on its payroll in an effort to get a better grasp of the activities of these groups .
in recent years , it has used information culled from informants to build its federal constitutional court case to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
however , subsequent revelations about the relationship between the agency and its informants have jeopardized the npd ban petition and led critics to ask whether it has gone over the line in nurturing such relationships .
" this bullet is for you " the latest twist involves mirko h. , a neo-nazi from the state of saxony who has been working as an informant for the office of the protection of the constitution since the mid-1990s .
it has been alleged that during his time on the agency 's payroll , he also produced thousands of copies of a cd by the band white aryan rebels called " notes of hate , " containing nazi lyrics that are banned in germany .
the song " this bullet is for you " includes a death threat against the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , michel friedman , and other german politicians .
the album , chilling in its unabashed xenophobia , also includes calls for the killing of mo asumang , a popular german erotic television star of ghanian ancestry .
the second informant implicated in the scandal is toni s. , a neo-nazi from the eastern german city of cottbus who worked for the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of brandenburg .
toni s. is currently in investigative police custody as his relationship with the white aryan rebels is probed .
the dresden public prosecutors ' office , meanwhile , has filed a criminal case against mirko h. for his role in the production and distribution of the cd .
what did the government know , and when ?
a report in the current issue of " focus , " a national newsweekly , alleged that the office of the protection of the constitution was aware of mirko h. 's involvement in the creation of the cd and still continued to work with him without stopping its production .
the newsweekly reported he earned more than 105,000 euro from the hate-filled lp .
the article also accused the federal interior ministry of withhold from the secret service committee of parliament the information that mirko h. had been convicted of illegal weapons possession and incitement in 2001 .

for years , the agency has put members of extremist organizations , often leaders , on its payroll in an effort to get a better grasp of the activities of these groups .
in recent years , it has used information culled from informants to build its federal constitutional court case to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
however , subsequent revelations about the relationship between the agency and its informants have jeopardized the npd ban petition and led critics to ask whether it has gone over the line in nurturing such relationships .
" this bullet is for you " the latest twist involves mirko h. , a neo-nazi from the state of saxony who has been working as an informant for the office of the protection of the constitution since the mid-1990s .
it has been alleged that during his time on the agency 's payroll , he also produced thousands of copies of a cd by the band white aryan rebels called " notes of hate , " containing nazi lyrics that are banned in germany .
the song " this bullet is for you " includes a death threat against the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , michel friedman , and other german politicians .
the album , chilling in its unabashed xenophobia , also includes calls for the killing of mo asumang , a popular german erotic television star of ghanian ancestry .
the second informant implicated in the scandal is toni s. , a neo-nazi from the eastern german city of cottbus who worked for the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of brandenburg .
toni s. is currently in investigative police custody as his relationship with the white aryan rebels is probed .
the dresden public prosecutors ' office , meanwhile , has filed a criminal case against mirko h. for his role in the production and distribution of the cd .
what did the government know , and when ?
a report in the current issue of " focus , " a national newsweekly , alleged that the office of the protection of the constitution was aware of mirko h. 's involvement in the creation of the cd and still continued to work with him without stopping its production .
the newsweekly reported he earned more than 105,000 euro from the hate-filled lp .
the article also accused the federal interior ministry of withhold from the secret service committee of parliament the information that mirko h. had been convicted of illegal weapons possession and incitement in 2001 .

for years , the agency has put members of extremist organizations , often leaders , on its payroll in an effort to get a better grasp of the activities of these groups .
in recent years , it has used information culled from informants to build its federal constitutional court case to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
however , subsequent revelations about the relationship between the agency and its informants have jeopardized the npd ban petition and led critics to ask whether it has gone over the line in nurturing such relationships .
" this bullet is for you " the latest twist involves mirko h. , a neo-nazi from the state of saxony who has been working as an informant for the office of the protection of the constitution since the mid-1990s .
it has been alleged that during his time on the agency 's payroll , he also produced thousands of copies of a cd by the band white aryan rebels called " notes of hate , " containing nazi lyrics that are banned in germany .
the song " this bullet is for you " includes a death threat against the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , michel friedman , and other german politicians .
the album , chilling in its unabashed xenophobia , also includes calls for the killing of mo asumang , a popular german erotic television star of ghanian ancestry .
the second informant implicated in the scandal is toni s. , a neo-nazi from the eastern german city of cottbus who worked for the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of brandenburg .
toni s. is currently in investigative police custody as his relationship with the white aryan rebels is probed .
the dresden public prosecutors ' office , meanwhile , has filed a criminal case against mirko h. for his role in the production and distribution of the cd .
what did the government know , and when ?
a report in the current issue of " focus , " a national newsweekly , alleged that the office of the protection of the constitution was aware of mirko h. 's involvement in the creation of the cd and still continued to work with him without stopping its production .
the newsweekly reported he earned more than 105,000 euro from the hate-filled lp .

it ’ s the first concrete target date set at this summit where 200 nations have gathered to come up with an action plan to reduce world poverty without destroying the environment .
environmentalists , who have been highly critical of the summit for its reluctance to set definite targets for reform , welcomed the fisheries plan , calling it a welcome advance . “ it ’ s pleasing that they have reached agreement on oceans , ” sian pullen of the environmental group wwf told reuters .
“ we would have liked it to be more progressive but it ’ s good compared to some of the other issues which may be going backwards . ”

that could entail enacting temporary fishing bans in some areas or setting up permanent no-fishing zones to preserve breeding grounds .
according to the united nations , more than 25 percent of the world ’ s commercially important fish stocks are overexploited and 50 percent are being fished to full capacity .
after pressure from the us , delegates agreed add a clause stating that fish levels should be replenished “ where possible . ”
the americans argued some stocks , such as cod on the grand banks of canada ’ s eastern seaboard , are thought to have already been fished beyond recovery .

the pact calls for reducing catches to sustainable levels . a deal was struck late tuesday night in johannesburg , aiming to replenish the world ’ s overfished waters by 2015 and head off a looming fisheries crisis .
it ’ s the first concrete target date set at this summit where 200 nations have gathered to come up with an action plan to reduce world poverty without destroying the environment .
environmentalists , who have been highly critical of the summit for its reluctance to set definite targets for reform , welcomed the fisheries plan , calling it a welcome advance . “ it ’ s pleasing that they have reached agreement on oceans , ” sian pullen of the environmental group wwf told reuters .
“ we would have liked it to be more progressive but it ’ s good compared to some of the other issues which may be going backwards . ”
catching fewer fish the plan calls for reducing fish catches to levels where the maximum sustainable yield can be taken indefinitely .
it gives governments a deadline of 2015 to restore fish stocks to sustainable levels .
that could entail enacting temporary fishing bans in some areas or setting up permanent no-fishing zones to preserve breeding grounds .
according to the united nations , more than 25 percent of the world ’ s commercially important fish stocks are overexploited and 50 percent are being fished to full capacity .
after pressure from the us , delegates agreed add a clause stating that fish levels should be replenished “ where possible . ”
the americans argued some stocks , such as cod on the grand banks of canada ’ s eastern seaboard , are thought to have already been fished beyond recovery .
enforcement questions while the agreement has buoyed delegates ’ spirits , some environmentalists question whether the agreement can be enforeced against pirate trawlers .

but stoiber and schröder succeeded in piquing interest in what had until now been a sleepy election . going into sunday night 's debate against edmund stoiber , gerhard schröder already had a huge disadvantage – as the four-year chancellor of germany , he found himself in a defensive position .
it was a fundamental weakness that challenger stoiber , the premier of bavaria , put to his advantage in a series of forceful attacks against the chancellor covering the most important issues of the election , making the anticipated event feel like a political soccer match .
the most contentious exchanges revolved around spiraling unemployment , a stagnant economy , tax reforms , immigration and germany 's stance on a possible iraq invasion – all dominant issues in the media during the days and weeks leading up to the first debate .
the keyword of the night seemed to be " failure , " of which both candidates repeatedly accused the other of on each key issue .
the debate , which is being called a " duel " here , was broadcast by the private television stations rtl and sat.1.
schröder taken to task for soaring unemployment in one of the most aggressive salvos of the evening , stoiber blamed germany 's high unemployment level of over four million on the current red-green government , led by schröder 's social democrats and the greens .
he said schröder had failed in his promise to reduce unemployment levels to fewer than 3.5 million people .
he criticized schröder for his plan to delay a tax cut scheduled for 2003 in order to fund the rebuilding of communities ravaged this summer by the biggest floods in a hundred years .
he said the government made a " mistake " by instituting tax reforms that did nothing to help what he described as the " most important " part of the german economy : small- to middle-sized businesses .
" we ca n't forget that the center of gravity of our labor market is dependent on the ...
german market .
we have only a relatively small share of exports to america .
other countries , like england , france , sweden , finland and spain have the same international ties , but they do n't have the dramatically growing number of unemployed or such a weak economic growth rate . "
schröder conceded he was disappointed by germany 's unemployment rate , but fought back by saying it was the result of the global economic downturn and not a homemade problem as stoiber had suggested .
as for the delayed tax cut , he said , " i 'm convinced that the people of this country understand that today 's damage ca n't be compensated for with debts that our children and grandchildren will then have to pay . "
how full is the ship ?
addressing immigration , stoiber said he thought it was " wrong for germany to have a law that provides for more immigration . "
he said that every year germany takes in 500,000 to 600,000 new immigrants - the equivalent of cities like dortmund or nuremburg .
he said the new immigration law would increase that number by 100,000 to 150,000 .
" we are n't even finished assimilating the foreigner children who are already here .
we need to do a lot more .
for that reason we should n't increase immigration , " he said .
schröder defended his government 's new law , passed in march , saying it both limited immigration in areas where it is n't needed while at the same time opening doors for highly skilled workers who are needed in the technology sector .
while stoiber 's numbers were correct , he said , he had omitted the annual outflow of several hundred thousand – refugees of countries once torn by civil war , for example .
when you add those figures in , he said , the increase is more like 100,000 people .
stoiber : schröder 's iraq position " irresponsible " schröder also found himself on the defensive on the subject of a possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
recently , schröder has alluded that the u.s. was planning to engage in " military adventurism , " and said that germany would not participate , even under a united nations mandate .
on sunday night , however , schröder sought to draw a line between his stances on u.n. efforts to get weapons inspectors back inside baghdad and the u.s. ' desire to topple saddam hussein 's regime .
" in light of the situation in the middle east , and considering the fact that we have n't conquered the taliban and are far from having rebuilt afghanistan , a military intervention in iraq is wrong , and for that reason , under my leadership , germany will not help in that effort , " the chancellor said .
stoiber , meanwhile , called schröder 's public statements on the issue , and his stance , " irresponsible . "
he specifically criticized schröder for saying the country must go the " german way , " a phrase he said had historically charged connotations - at least in the ears of the international community .
he also said schröder 's public statements and policy reduced some of the international pressure on hussein .
" with saddam hussein , you have a war criminal as head of government , a head of state who possesses weapons of mass destruction and has even used them against his own people and those in neighboring iran .
we need to do everything we can , make every diplomatic effort , apply as much political pressure " as is needed to get un inspectors back inside iraq , stoiber said .
he said the chancellor should n't be ruling out every " theoretical option . "
stalemate so who won ?
the jury ca n't seem to make up its mind .
immediately after the debate , the editor in chief of the newsweekly " der spiegel , " stefan aust , said he " did n't get the impression he -lrb- schröder -rrb- was the media chancellor .
he could have done better . "
aust even accused him of putting his german television audience to sleep .
but polls taken of viewers sunday night were all over the board .
a forsa institute poll for sat.1 put schröder ahead .
another , by pollster wahlen for public broadcaster zdf had stoiber ahead by two points .
but another , by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard put schröder far ahead of his bavarian challenger .
in editorials published in the monday editions , many major regional newspapers shied away from declaring a victor .
the mass-circulation " bild " described german voters as the victors for even taking an interest in the debate .
the " berliner zeitung , " meanwhile , described it as a duel that had neither a conqueror nor someone who had been conquered .

the company saw the tracks of some of its main lines near dresden get washed away , train stations flooded and the collapse of crucial bridges , including one on a high-speed rail line connecting northern and southern germany .
appearing at the chancellery in berlin on wednesday , deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn issued a preliminary estimate of over one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in flood damages .
" according to our cautious first estimates , we believe we have suffered revenue losses and damages of 1.025 billion euro , " mehdorn said .
he stressed that this would not be the final damage sum .
a laundry list of damages more than 400 kilometers of deutsche bahn tracks are currently unusable , and 94 bridges and 200 train stations have been badly damaged .
early estimates suggest that the service outages alone will lead to a 90 million euro -lrb- $ 88 million -rrb- drop in revenue from passenger and freight services .
mehdorn said it would take two and a half years before deutsche bahn service could return to its pre-flood level in the region .
the federal government has already agreed to provide deutsche bahn with 650 million euro -lrb- $ 638 million -rrb- to rebuild its network and repair damaged train stations .
more than half the money had already been earmarked for transportation infrastructure development projects in the eastern states that were formerly part of east germany .
deutsche bahn said its first reconstruction priorities would be lines in the leipzig-dresden-chemnitz triangle .
a line connecting dresden with prague will also be rebuilt as quickly as possible .
mehdorn said there are currently no plans to cancel any proposed deutsche bahn projects – including the planned transrapid train line between dortmund and düsseldorf .
new priorities , however , could lead to delays , he warned .
a job-saving deal as part of a four-point " immediate aid " program , the government also reached an agreement with deutsche bahn and the transnet union that the company would not lay off any employees between now and 2006 as a result of the flooding .
until this week 's agreement , talks between the employees ' union and bahn had reached an impasse .
mehdorn said deutsche bahn will reintroduce regular long-distance train service in the state of saxony-anhalt on thursday and is working on a plan to reintroduce long-distance trains in saxony as quickly as possible .
agricultural damage estimated at 267 million euro separately , german consumer protection and agricultural minister renate künast announced the government would release 141 million euro -lrb- $ 138 million -rrb- between now and the end of the year in immediate aid to farmers struck by the flooding .
künast said the government is estimating an initial 267 million euro -lrb- $ 262 million -rrb- in damages to farms .
but the government has not yet added damages to farm buildings to its estimate . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting deutsche bahn back on track after floods germany 's main railway company , deutsche bahn , estimates flood damage to the country 's railway network will reach " tens of billion euro " .

developing countries are calling for more aid commitments and debt relief from the industrialized west .
according to oxfam international 's policy advisor penny fowler , they are also urging western nations to drop their agricultural subsidies and tariffs that prevent them from accessing western markets .
trade is one of the most critical - and contentious - issues with industrialized nations at the summit , says fowler .
" we want to see them committing to ending their unfair trade policies .
in particular , to stop putting pressure on developing countries to rapidly liberalize their economies in a way that does n't take account of the impact on poor people . "
no progress without change developed countries are currently pushing these policies , she says .
" at the same time , they 're hypocritically maintaining high levels of protection of their own economies and very high levels of subsidies to their own agricultural producers , for example , by dumping their agricultural surpluses on world markets . "
this had devastating impacts on the livelihoods of poor farmers in developing countries .
" unless those policies are changed , it 's very hard to see how this summit will make progress on promoting sustainable development , " says fowler .
although oxfam and other non-governmental organizations are busy spreading the word to delegates meeting in the marble-lined conference halls of sandton convention center , the message does n't seem to be getting through to the sessions behind closed doors .
both the european union and the united states are opposed to any new aid initiatives for developing nations , arguing that they want to stick to the proposals made in march at the international conference for development financing in monterrey , mexico .
valuable resources are necessary green groups have been criticized of focusing too much on environmental issues and preventing the world 's poor from having the same access to resources , such as energy and water .
but gordon shepherd , director of wwf international 's policy program , says renewable energy is a sustainable alternative .
" poor people are the ones who will suffer the most from climate change , " says shepherd .
" there are a large number of people not getting energy who need it . "
in his opinion , the renewable aspects need to be stressed at the summit .
" that is the way forward and the biodiversity and freshwater systems will suffer from climate change in the same way as people will , so the two are inextricably linked . "
environment groups in johannesburg are critical of the industrial countries ' argument that poverty can only be alleviated through economic growth and private investment .
they want tighter controls and more corporate accountability .
this issue is certain to dominate discussions over the next week . jennifer macey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de footing the development bill the proportion of gross national product that wealthy industrial nations spend on development has fallen over the past decades .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.09.2002 bitter wrangling in debate on flood clean-up funds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how are we going to pay for this ? - a destroyed house in eastern germany germany ’ s governing and opposition parties were at loggerheads over the financing of the billion-euro injection in flood-affected areas at a special debate in the lower house of parliament . the only thing that the government and the opposition could agree upon on thursday ’ s special session on flood relief in the lower house of parliament was that flood victims need to be helped as soon as possible .
as far as actually financing the repair of the damages went , heated arguments and acrimonious debates were the order of the day .
opening the debate , german chancellor gerhard schröder said that the floods had caused the worst damage in germany since the second world war .
he thanked the scores of voluntary and professional helpers who had laboured to pile sandbags and help people to safety .
" not just a catastrophic flood , but also an unbelievable wave of solidarity has swept through germany " , he said .
stoiber on the offensive opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- sharply criticised the government ’ s plan to finance a large chunk of the 10 billion euro -lrb- dollar -rrb- flood relief package by postponing next year 's scheduled tax reform and increasing the corporation tax .
he said that the opposition union bloc had chosen not to block the government 's plans to avoid " fighting on the backs of the victims " .
but he emphasised that he thinks the government 's strategy is wrong .
" high taxes will cripple economic performance , stem growth , destroy jobs " , he said .
the opposition is pushing instead to use the profits of germany 's central bank to finance flood repairs .
" higher interest rates are a lesser evil compared to higher taxes " , stoiber said .
pulling out his main weapon against schröder in the current election campaign , stoiber added that that recent floods were germany 's second national catastrophe of the summer , the first being the country 's four million unemployed .
social democrats deride opposition proposal but chancellor schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- vehemently opposes using central bank profits .
schröder has called it " socially imbalanced " and accused the opposition of wanting to burden future generations with more debt .
german foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party said that higher debts would hurt the country 's competitiveness .
free democrats want to go third way the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- joined the union parties in opposing the planned hike in corporation taxes .
fdp leader guido westerwelle accused the government of worsening the flood catastrophe through another " catastrophe " of higher taxes .
but the union bloc 's financing suggestion did n't meet with the liberals ' approval either .
the money instead should come from diverting funds and saving in other areas , westerwelle said .
pds wants money from military projects parliamentary floor leader of the party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- , roland claus , called upon the government to cancel planned weapons projects such as the military transporter a400 m in order to finance repairs .
if schröder says he doesn ’ t want a military adventure in iraq , " then he can do without a military adventure gadget " , he said .
will the relief package suffice ?
despite the barbed debates , georg milbrandt , the premier of one of the most affected states , saxony , took comfort in the fact that that the relief package could be coming soon .
but he was skeptical about whether 10 billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in direct financial assistance approved earlier this week would be enough .
for saxony alone , the premier estimated damage costs could run as high as 15 billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- .
the draft flood relief legislation should go through both chambers of parliament before the september 22 federal elections . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flood relief on its way the german cabinet has approved the draft law for helping the country 's flood victims .
the legislation will enable rapid and direct financial assistance totalling some 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- .

11 terrorist in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm announces charges morrocan born mounir el motassadeq will face at least 3,116 counts of accessory to murder for his alleged role in helping mohammed atta 's hamburg cell plan the sept .
11 terror attack . close to a year after the terror attacks of sept .
11 , the federal prosecutors office in germany announced it filed criminal charges this week against a hamburg man suspected of aiding in the planning and financing of the attacks .
the charges are the first against a german member of the terror cell responsible for the attacks .
on thursday , federal prosecutor kay nehm said the suspect , morrocan citizen mounir el motassadeq , was charged on wednesday as an accessory to murder in the killings of at least 3,116 people in new york and washington and for membership in a terrorist organization .
prosecutors believe the 28-year-old student was deeply involved in the hamburg terror cell led by mohammed atta that carried out the deadly attacks .
the case has brought many previously unknown facts about the sept .
11 attacks to light .
investigators here now believe the terrorist cell had begun planning a major attack as far back as oct .
1999 , and that the world trade center first emerged as a possible target in april or may 2000 .
at the time , nehm said , hijacker marwan al shehhi told a hamburg librarian of his intentions .
" there will be thousands of dead , you will all think of me , " he reportedly said .
nehm said he also uttered the words " world trade center . "
a member " right up to the end " authorities arrested electrical engineering student el motassadeq in nov .
2001 , and he has been held in investigative custody since then in a jail in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
nehm said motassadeq had maintained intensive contacts with the terror cell for several years and also lived in the same neighborhood as the terrorists with his wife and child .
nehm said he believes motassadeq " remained part of the assassination preparations right up to the end . "
motassadeq played a definitive role in the financing of the hamburg terror cell 's activities , the indictement stated . he held power of attorney over , as well as an automated teller card for , a bank account that had originally been opened by al shehhi , one of the terrorists who died in the airplane attacks .
prosecutor nehm said the terrorists used the hamburg bank account to pay for pilot training for said bahaji and zakariya essabar in the united states .
al qaeda terrorists also allegedly used the account to pay their expenses while living in the u.s. both are still on the run from authorities .
nehm described motassadeq as a " governor in hamburg " for the terror cell during the time atta and others were in taking classes in u.s. flight schools .
additionally , nehm said , motassadeq 's signature appeared on a testament written by atta that surfaced after the deadly attacks were carried out .
training in afghanistan between may and august 2000 , prosecutors said , motassadeq spent time in an al qaeda terror training camp located near kandahar in afghanistan .
" in addition to ideological and military traning , such visits were also used by leaders of the international network to discuss and agree on details of attacks and the logistical support needed to carry them out , " nehm said .
meanwhile , prosecutors say they have learned little from statements made by motassadeq following his arrest , with chief prosecutor nehm describing his statements as " meaningless . "
in december , motassadeq denied any involvement in the attacks ' planning as well as membership in al qaeda .
an attorney representing motassadeq on thursday described the 90-page indictment against him as " sparse . "
a trial against motassadeq , however , is still on schedule to commence in october .
the birth of a terror cell in his press conference on thursday , nehm also rehashed detailed conclusions drawn by investigators about the origins of the hamburg terror cell and its members .
the group , comprised initially of seven students , came together in hamburg during the early 1990s .
cell leader atta , second wtc pilot al shehhi and third pilot ziad jarrah were all part of the group .
" all of the members of this cell shared the same religious convictions , an islamic lifestyle , a feeling of being out of place in unfamiliar cultural surroundings , " nehm said .
" at the center of this stood the hatred of the world 's jews and the u.s. "
nehm said el motassadeq had served as a logistician for the terror cell along with three other men who are still being sought by authorities , including ramsi binalshibh , bahaji and essabar .
neither bahaji nor essabar were able to participate in the attacks because immigration officials rejected their visa applications to travel to the u.s. the group 's mission , according to nehm , was " the militant rejection of western society and its values and the defense of the muslim world against non-muslims , including through terrorist acts , was the basis of the group 's activities .

11 terrorist in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm announces charges morrocan born mounir el motassadeq will face at least 3,116 counts of accessory to murder for his alleged role in helping mohammed atta 's hamburg cell plan the sept .
11 terror attack . close to a year after the terror attacks of sept .
11 , the federal prosecutors office in germany announced it filed criminal charges this week against a hamburg man suspected of aiding in the planning and financing of the attacks .
the charges are the first against a german member of the terror cell responsible for the attacks .
on thursday , federal prosecutor kay nehm said the suspect , morrocan citizen mounir el motassadeq , was charged on wednesday as an accessory to murder in the killings of at least 3,116 people in new york and washington and for membership in a terrorist organization .
prosecutors believe the 28-year-old student was deeply involved in the hamburg terror cell led by mohammed atta that carried out the deadly attacks .
the case has brought many previously unknown facts about the sept .
11 attacks to light .
investigators here now believe the terrorist cell had begun planning a major attack as far back as oct .
1999 , and that the world trade center first emerged as a possible target in april or may 2000 .
at the time , nehm said , hijacker marwan al shehhi told a hamburg librarian of his intentions .
" there will be thousands of dead , you will all think of me , " he reportedly said .
nehm said he also uttered the words " world trade center . "
a member " right up to the end " authorities arrested electrical engineering student el motassadeq in nov .
2001 , and he has been held in investigative custody since then in a jail in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
nehm said motassadeq had maintained intensive contacts with the terror cell for several years and also lived in the same neighborhood as the terrorists with his wife and child .
nehm said he believes motassadeq " remained part of the assassination preparations right up to the end . "
motassadeq played a definitive role in the financing of the hamburg terror cell 's activities , the indictement stated . he held power of attorney over , as well as an automated teller card for , a bank account that had originally been opened by al shehhi , one of the terrorists who died in the airplane attacks .
prosecutor nehm said the terrorists used the hamburg bank account to pay for pilot training for said bahaji and zakariya essabar in the united states .
al qaeda terrorists also allegedly used the account to pay their expenses while living in the u.s. both are still on the run from authorities .
nehm described motassadeq as a " governor in hamburg " for the terror cell during the time atta and others were in taking classes in u.s. flight schools .
additionally , nehm said , motassadeq 's signature appeared on a testament written by atta that surfaced after the deadly attacks were carried out .
training in afghanistan between may and august 2000 , prosecutors said , motassadeq spent time in an al qaeda terror training camp located near kandahar in afghanistan .
" in addition to ideological and military traning , such visits were also used by leaders of the international network to discuss and agree on details of attacks and the logistical support needed to carry them out , " nehm said .
meanwhile , prosecutors say they have learned little from statements made by motassadeq following his arrest , with chief prosecutor nehm describing his statements as " meaningless . "
in december , motassadeq denied any involvement in the attacks ' planning as well as membership in al qaeda .
an attorney representing motassadeq on thursday described the 90-page indictment against him as " sparse . "
a trial against motassadeq , however , is still on schedule to commence in october .
the birth of a terror cell in his press conference on thursday , nehm also rehashed detailed conclusions drawn by investigators about the origins of the hamburg terror cell and its members .
the group , comprised initially of seven students , came together in hamburg during the early 1990s .
cell leader atta , second wtc pilot al shehhi and third pilot ziad jarrah were all part of the group .
" all of the members of this cell shared the same religious convictions , an islamic lifestyle , a feeling of being out of place in unfamiliar cultural surroundings , " nehm said .
" at the center of this stood the hatred of the world 's jews and the u.s. "
nehm said el motassadeq had served as a logistician for the terror cell along with three other men who are still being sought by authorities , including ramsi binalshibh , bahaji and essabar .
neither bahaji nor essabar were able to participate in the attacks because immigration officials rejected their visa applications to travel to the u.s. the group 's mission , according to nehm , was " the militant rejection of western society and its values and the defense of the muslim world against non-muslims , including through terrorist acts , was the basis of the group 's activities .

western countries are promoting “ public-private partnerships ” at the earth summit in johannesburg as a path to sustainable development .
environmentalists are skeptical , saying it puts big business before people . led by the united states , western countries showcased partnerships on thursday between governments , private industry and other groups as a practical way of furthering economic development and saving the environment . they say such partnerships are ways for business and governments to pool their resources and harness the funds and the know-how to accomplish more than either could on its own . un organizers say they have received 218 proposed partnerships , in areas ranging from health care to renewable energy projects that could go a long way in helping meet summit goals of halving global poverty by 2015 while slowing environmental degradation . congo project a multi-nation project to expand efforts to save forests in central africa ’ s congo basin was announced on thursday .
germany , the us , japan and indonesia are among the countries that want to provide an additional $ 53 million dollars over four years to a partnership between the paper industry active in the region and the local population .
the plan aims to develop protected forest areas and cut down on illegal logging . but many environmentalists are wary of relying on private business to save the planet .
they say partnerships may let companies cash in on providing essential services like water and electricity , while allowing governments to shirk their traditional responsibilities . “ if a government doesn ’ t do its regulation homework , it could be more than happy to let a private company come in and take over things , ” jörg kusche with greenpeace in germany told dw-world .
“ but then there would be no transparency or accountability .
we don ’ t think that ’ s the right direction . ” he and other environmental activists have expressed concern that public-private partnerships will be used by big business as an exercise in “ greenwash ” – putting a cloak of environmental responsibility around a company that could mask activities that could actually be damaging to the environment or people in development countries . martin kaiser , international environmental expert for greenpeace who is in johannesburg , criticised the congo plan after it was announced saying it appeared to have been developed largely by the paper industry with only minimal input from indigenous groups threatened by the congo forests ’ destruction . “ there ’ s already a lot of criticism about these initiatives .
a lot seem to be one-sided in favor of industry , ” he told dw-world . in un parlance , these public-private agreements are called “ type 2 ” initiatives .
the idea is that these voluntary programs can be decided on and launched quickly by the parties involved as opposed to being endorsed by the “ type 1 ” process , which requires the approval of an international forum and can be bureaucratic and time-consuming . “ we think it would be more sensible if these were a completion of type 1 initiatives and a part of binding agreements instead of just voluntary ones , whose outcome is anything but certain , ” kusche said . practical steps but the americans at the summit see such agreements as practical steps towards sustainable development .
public funds used in partnerships , according to us thinking , can leverage private investment .
assistant secretary of state john turner said the us plans on commiting $ 970 million over the next three years to water projects , but expects to mobilize more than $ 1.6 billion through partnerships . the us agency for international development presented a $ 90 million proposal to fight hunger in africa by teaming up with regional trade groups and industry partners . paula dobriansky , a us undersecretary of state for global affairs , dismissed skepticism on the part of some activists . “ i have found a great deal of enthusiasm … all want to see us really have some action here , ” she said . european union officials were also talking up several of their proposed projects on thursday , including agreements in energy and water management .
but they were more circumspect than their translatlantic partners about the extent to which public-private partnerships can solve all the world ’ s problems . in a statement , danish environment minister hans christian schmidt , who is representing the eu in johannesburg , cautioned against upsetting the balance between the public and private part of the equation . “ partnerships are a complement to -lrb- government -rrb- commitments , ” he said , “ not a substitute for them . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de on the green road from rio to johannesburg the un summit in johannesburg next week has been dubbed " rio + 10 " or " earth summit 2 " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.09.2002 government under fire for neo-nazi informants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : explosive combination : neo-nazi informants and hate music in the latest scandal involving the domestic intelligence agency 's use of informants , reports allege the government looked the other way as two extremist spooks produced a cd inciting the murder of prominent german jews . on thursday , the domestic affairs committee of the german parliament , the bundestag , will convene to debate the use of informants from right-wing extremist and neo-nazi groups by the federal office for the protection of the constitution , germany 's domestic intelligence agency .
for years , the agency has put members of extremist organizations , often leaders , on its payroll in an effort to get a better grasp of the activities of these groups .
in recent years , it has used information culled from informants to build its federal constitutional court case to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
however , subsequent revelations about the relationship between the agency and its informants have jeopardized the npd ban petition and led critics to ask whether it has gone over the line in nurturing such relationships .
" this bullet is for you " the latest twist involves mirko h. , a neo-nazi from the state of saxony who has been working as an informant for the office of the protection of the constitution since the mid-1990s .
it has been alleged that during his time on the agency 's payroll , he also produced thousands of copies of a cd by the band white aryan rebels called " notes of hate , " containing nazi lyrics that are banned in germany .
the song " this bullet is for you " includes a death threat against the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , michel friedman , and other german politicians .
the album , chilling in its unabashed xenophobia , also includes calls for the killing of mo asumang , a popular german erotic television star of ghanian ancestry .
the second informant implicated in the scandal is toni s. , a neo-nazi from the eastern german city of cottbus who worked for the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of brandenburg .
toni s. is currently in investigative police custody as his relationship with the white aryan rebels is probed .
the dresden public prosecutors ' office , meanwhile , has filed a criminal case against mirko h. for his role in the production and distribution of the cd .
what did the government know , and when ?
a report in the current issue of " focus , " a national newsweekly , alleged that the office of the protection of the constitution was aware of mirko h. 's involvement in the creation of the cd and still continued to work with him without stopping its production .
the newsweekly reported he earned more than 105,000 euro from the hate-filled lp .
the article also accused the federal interior ministry of withhold from the secret service committee of parliament the information that mirko h. had been convicted of illegal weapons possession and incitement in 2001 .
the interior ministry has denied the charge .
still , that does n't make it easier for the celebrities threatened in " notes of hate , " to sleep at night .
" i 'm shaken and feel less secure by the idea that security authorities have become a part of the threat , " michel friedman told the berlin newspaper " tagesspiegel , " in its wednesday edition .
" this ca n't be accepted by the government . "
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union are calling for immediate answers from the interior ministry and the government .
" in the face of the dramatic events in this informant scandal , we expect that the interior minister will provide answers , " the deputy head of the union bloc 's parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , told the " berliner zeitung " newspaper .
" he has to tell us what he knew about the informant , what the interior ministry knew , who carries the political responsibility and what conclusions should be drawn . "
criticism from within concern is also growing inside the government .
christian ströbele , a green member of parliament , told the same paper he believed the situation must be clarified before the sept .

for years , the agency has put members of extremist organizations , often leaders , on its payroll in an effort to get a better grasp of the activities of these groups .
in recent years , it has used information culled from informants to build its federal constitutional court case to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
however , subsequent revelations about the relationship between the agency and its informants have jeopardized the npd ban petition and led critics to ask whether it has gone over the line in nurturing such relationships .
" this bullet is for you " the latest twist involves mirko h. , a neo-nazi from the state of saxony who has been working as an informant for the office of the protection of the constitution since the mid-1990s .
it has been alleged that during his time on the agency 's payroll , he also produced thousands of copies of a cd by the band white aryan rebels called " notes of hate , " containing nazi lyrics that are banned in germany .
the song " this bullet is for you " includes a death threat against the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , michel friedman , and other german politicians .
the album , chilling in its unabashed xenophobia , also includes calls for the killing of mo asumang , a popular german erotic television star of ghanian ancestry .
the second informant implicated in the scandal is toni s. , a neo-nazi from the eastern german city of cottbus who worked for the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of brandenburg .
toni s. is currently in investigative police custody as his relationship with the white aryan rebels is probed .
the dresden public prosecutors ' office , meanwhile , has filed a criminal case against mirko h. for his role in the production and distribution of the cd .
what did the government know , and when ?
a report in the current issue of " focus , " a national newsweekly , alleged that the office of the protection of the constitution was aware of mirko h. 's involvement in the creation of the cd and still continued to work with him without stopping its production .
the newsweekly reported he earned more than 105,000 euro from the hate-filled lp .
the article also accused the federal interior ministry of withhold from the secret service committee of parliament the information that mirko h. had been convicted of illegal weapons possession and incitement in 2001 .
the interior ministry has denied the charge .
still , that does n't make it easier for the celebrities threatened in " notes of hate , " to sleep at night .
" i 'm shaken and feel less secure by the idea that security authorities have become a part of the threat , " michel friedman told the berlin newspaper " tagesspiegel , " in its wednesday edition .
" this ca n't be accepted by the government . "
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union are calling for immediate answers from the interior ministry and the government .
" in the face of the dramatic events in this informant scandal , we expect that the interior minister will provide answers , " the deputy head of the union bloc 's parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , told the " berliner zeitung " newspaper .
" he has to tell us what he knew about the informant , what the interior ministry knew , who carries the political responsibility and what conclusions should be drawn . "
criticism from within concern is also growing inside the government .
christian ströbele , a green member of parliament , told the same paper he believed the situation must be clarified before the sept .
22 federal elections .
ströbele said he believed the latest incident was just " one more example of the questionable methods of the office for the protection of the constitution . "
where do you draw the line , he asked , between activities right-wing extremists have developed themselves and those that have been inspired and financed by the office for the protection of the constitution ?
" you have to ask yourself whether some -lrb- authorities from the office -rrb- are doing more to endanger our constitution than to protect it , " ströbele said .

developing countries are calling for more aid commitments and debt relief from the industrialized west .
according to oxfam international 's policy advisor penny fowler , they are also urging western nations to drop their agricultural subsidies and tariffs that prevent them from accessing western markets .
trade is one of the most critical - and contentious - issues with industrialized nations at the summit , says fowler .
" we want to see them committing to ending their unfair trade policies .
in particular , to stop putting pressure on developing countries to rapidly liberalize their economies in a way that does n't take account of the impact on poor people . "
no progress without change developed countries are currently pushing these policies , she says .
" at the same time , they 're hypocritically maintaining high levels of protection of their own economies and very high levels of subsidies to their own agricultural producers , for example , by dumping their agricultural surpluses on world markets . "
this had devastating impacts on the livelihoods of poor farmers in developing countries .
" unless those policies are changed , it 's very hard to see how this summit will make progress on promoting sustainable development , " says fowler .
although oxfam and other non-governmental organizations are busy spreading the word to delegates meeting in the marble-lined conference halls of sandton convention center , the message does n't seem to be getting through to the sessions behind closed doors .
both the european union and the united states are opposed to any new aid initiatives for developing nations , arguing that they want to stick to the proposals made in march at the international conference for development financing in monterrey , mexico .
valuable resources are necessary green groups have been criticized of focusing too much on environmental issues and preventing the world 's poor from having the same access to resources , such as energy and water .
but gordon shepherd , director of wwf international 's policy program , says renewable energy is a sustainable alternative .
" poor people are the ones who will suffer the most from climate change , " says shepherd .
" there are a large number of people not getting energy who need it . "
in his opinion , the renewable aspects need to be stressed at the summit .
" that is the way forward and the biodiversity and freshwater systems will suffer from climate change in the same way as people will , so the two are inextricably linked . "
environment groups in johannesburg are critical of the industrial countries ' argument that poverty can only be alleviated through economic growth and private investment .
they want tighter controls and more corporate accountability .
this issue is certain to dominate discussions over the next week . jennifer macey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de footing the development bill the proportion of gross national product that wealthy industrial nations spend on development has fallen over the past decades .

but stoiber and schröder succeeded in piquing interest in what had until now been a sleepy election . going into sunday night 's debate against edmund stoiber , gerhard schröder already had a huge disadvantage – as the four-year chancellor of germany , he found himself in a defensive position .
it was a fundamental weakness that challenger stoiber , the premier of bavaria , put to his advantage in a series of forceful attacks against the chancellor covering the most important issues of the election , making the anticipated event feel like a political soccer match .
the most contentious exchanges revolved around spiraling unemployment , a stagnant economy , tax reforms , immigration and germany 's stance on a possible iraq invasion – all dominant issues in the media during the days and weeks leading up to the first debate .
the keyword of the night seemed to be " failure , " of which both candidates repeatedly accused the other of on each key issue .
the debate , which is being called a " duel " here , was broadcast by the private television stations rtl and sat.1.
schröder taken to task for soaring unemployment in one of the most aggressive salvos of the evening , stoiber blamed germany 's high unemployment level of over four million on the current red-green government , led by schröder 's social democrats and the greens .
he said schröder had failed in his promise to reduce unemployment levels to fewer than 3.5 million people .
he criticized schröder for his plan to delay a tax cut scheduled for 2003 in order to fund the rebuilding of communities ravaged this summer by the biggest floods in a hundred years .
he said the government made a " mistake " by instituting tax reforms that did nothing to help what he described as the " most important " part of the german economy : small- to middle-sized businesses .
" we ca n't forget that the center of gravity of our labor market is dependent on the ...
german market .
we have only a relatively small share of exports to america .
other countries , like england , france , sweden , finland and spain have the same international ties , but they do n't have the dramatically growing number of unemployed or such a weak economic growth rate . "
schröder conceded he was disappointed by germany 's unemployment rate , but fought back by saying it was the result of the global economic downturn and not a homemade problem as stoiber had suggested .
as for the delayed tax cut , he said , " i 'm convinced that the people of this country understand that today 's damage ca n't be compensated for with debts that our children and grandchildren will then have to pay . "
how full is the ship ?
addressing immigration , stoiber said he thought it was " wrong for germany to have a law that provides for more immigration . "
he said that every year germany takes in 500,000 to 600,000 new immigrants - the equivalent of cities like dortmund or nuremburg .
he said the new immigration law would increase that number by 100,000 to 150,000 .
" we are n't even finished assimilating the foreigner children who are already here .
we need to do a lot more .
for that reason we should n't increase immigration , " he said .
schröder defended his government 's new law , passed in march , saying it both limited immigration in areas where it is n't needed while at the same time opening doors for highly skilled workers who are needed in the technology sector .
while stoiber 's numbers were correct , he said , he had omitted the annual outflow of several hundred thousand – refugees of countries once torn by civil war , for example .
when you add those figures in , he said , the increase is more like 100,000 people .
stoiber : schröder 's iraq position " irresponsible " schröder also found himself on the defensive on the subject of a possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
recently , schröder has alluded that the u.s. was planning to engage in " military adventurism , " and said that germany would not participate , even under a united nations mandate .
on sunday night , however , schröder sought to draw a line between his stances on u.n. efforts to get weapons inspectors back inside baghdad and the u.s. ' desire to topple saddam hussein 's regime .
" in light of the situation in the middle east , and considering the fact that we have n't conquered the taliban and are far from having rebuilt afghanistan , a military intervention in iraq is wrong , and for that reason , under my leadership , germany will not help in that effort , " the chancellor said .
stoiber , meanwhile , called schröder 's public statements on the issue , and his stance , " irresponsible . "
he specifically criticized schröder for saying the country must go the " german way , " a phrase he said had historically charged connotations - at least in the ears of the international community .
he also said schröder 's public statements and policy reduced some of the international pressure on hussein .
" with saddam hussein , you have a war criminal as head of government , a head of state who possesses weapons of mass destruction and has even used them against his own people and those in neighboring iran .
we need to do everything we can , make every diplomatic effort , apply as much political pressure " as is needed to get un inspectors back inside iraq , stoiber said .
he said the chancellor should n't be ruling out every " theoretical option . "
stalemate so who won ?
the jury ca n't seem to make up its mind .
immediately after the debate , the editor in chief of the newsweekly " der spiegel , " stefan aust , said he " did n't get the impression he -lrb- schröder -rrb- was the media chancellor .
he could have done better . "
aust even accused him of putting his german television audience to sleep .
but polls taken of viewers sunday night were all over the board .
a forsa institute poll for sat.1 put schröder ahead .
another , by pollster wahlen for public broadcaster zdf had stoiber ahead by two points .
but another , by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard put schröder far ahead of his bavarian challenger .
in editorials published in the monday editions , many major regional newspapers shied away from declaring a victor .
the mass-circulation " bild " described german voters as the victors for even taking an interest in the debate .
the " berliner zeitung , " meanwhile , described it as a duel that had neither a conqueror nor someone who had been conquered .
indeed , if a television debate were analogous to soccer , you might say that stoiber controlled the ball for much of the game – e.g. he steered the issues and went in with the most attacks – but neither candidate , it seemed , scored many goals . and that 's too bad considering that in germany 's first ever television debate there was no provision for penalty shots . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery read everything you need to know about the politicians , parties and hot-button issues , along with a dummy 's guide to the german political system , as germans head for the polls for national elections on september 22 .

western countries are promoting “ public-private partnerships ” at the earth summit in johannesburg as a path to sustainable development .
environmentalists are skeptical , saying it puts big business before people . led by the united states , western countries showcased partnerships on thursday between governments , private industry and other groups as a practical way of furthering economic development and saving the environment . they say such partnerships are ways for business and governments to pool their resources and harness the funds and the know-how to accomplish more than either could on its own . un organizers say they have received 218 proposed partnerships , in areas ranging from health care to renewable energy projects that could go a long way in helping meet summit goals of halving global poverty by 2015 while slowing environmental degradation . congo project a multi-nation project to expand efforts to save forests in central africa ’ s congo basin was announced on thursday .
germany , the us , japan and indonesia are among the countries that want to provide an additional $ 53 million dollars over four years to a partnership between the paper industry active in the region and the local population .
the plan aims to develop protected forest areas and cut down on illegal logging . but many environmentalists are wary of relying on private business to save the planet .
they say partnerships may let companies cash in on providing essential services like water and electricity , while allowing governments to shirk their traditional responsibilities . “ if a government doesn ’ t do its regulation homework , it could be more than happy to let a private company come in and take over things , ” jörg kusche with greenpeace in germany told dw-world .
“ but then there would be no transparency or accountability .
we don ’ t think that ’ s the right direction . ” he and other environmental activists have expressed concern that public-private partnerships will be used by big business as an exercise in “ greenwash ” – putting a cloak of environmental responsibility around a company that could mask activities that could actually be damaging to the environment or people in development countries . martin kaiser , international environmental expert for greenpeace who is in johannesburg , criticised the congo plan after it was announced saying it appeared to have been developed largely by the paper industry with only minimal input from indigenous groups threatened by the congo forests ’ destruction . “ there ’ s already a lot of criticism about these initiatives .
a lot seem to be one-sided in favor of industry , ” he told dw-world . in un parlance , these public-private agreements are called “ type 2 ” initiatives .
the idea is that these voluntary programs can be decided on and launched quickly by the parties involved as opposed to being endorsed by the “ type 1 ” process , which requires the approval of an international forum and can be bureaucratic and time-consuming . “ we think it would be more sensible if these were a completion of type 1 initiatives and a part of binding agreements instead of just voluntary ones , whose outcome is anything but certain , ” kusche said . practical steps but the americans at the summit see such agreements as practical steps towards sustainable development .
public funds used in partnerships , according to us thinking , can leverage private investment .
assistant secretary of state john turner said the us plans on commiting $ 970 million over the next three years to water projects , but expects to mobilize more than $ 1.6 billion through partnerships . the us agency for international development presented a $ 90 million proposal to fight hunger in africa by teaming up with regional trade groups and industry partners . paula dobriansky , a us undersecretary of state for global affairs , dismissed skepticism on the part of some activists . “ i have found a great deal of enthusiasm … all want to see us really have some action here , ” she said . european union officials were also talking up several of their proposed projects on thursday , including agreements in energy and water management .
but they were more circumspect than their translatlantic partners about the extent to which public-private partnerships can solve all the world ’ s problems . in a statement , danish environment minister hans christian schmidt , who is representing the eu in johannesburg , cautioned against upsetting the balance between the public and private part of the equation . “ partnerships are a complement to -lrb- government -rrb- commitments , ” he said , “ not a substitute for them . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de on the green road from rio to johannesburg the un summit in johannesburg next week has been dubbed " rio + 10 " or " earth summit 2 " .

western countries are promoting “ public-private partnerships ” at the earth summit in johannesburg as a path to sustainable development .
environmentalists are skeptical , saying it puts big business before people . led by the united states , western countries showcased partnerships on thursday between governments , private industry and other groups as a practical way of furthering economic development and saving the environment . they say such partnerships are ways for business and governments to pool their resources and harness the funds and the know-how to accomplish more than either could on its own . un organizers say they have received 218 proposed partnerships , in areas ranging from health care to renewable energy projects that could go a long way in helping meet summit goals of halving global poverty by 2015 while slowing environmental degradation . congo project a multi-nation project to expand efforts to save forests in central africa ’ s congo basin was announced on thursday .
germany , the us , japan and indonesia are among the countries that want to provide an additional $ 53 million dollars over four years to a partnership between the paper industry active in the region and the local population .
the plan aims to develop protected forest areas and cut down on illegal logging . but many environmentalists are wary of relying on private business to save the planet .
they say partnerships may let companies cash in on providing essential services like water and electricity , while allowing governments to shirk their traditional responsibilities . “ if a government doesn ’ t do its regulation homework , it could be more than happy to let a private company come in and take over things , ” jörg kusche with greenpeace in germany told dw-world .
“ but then there would be no transparency or accountability .
we don ’ t think that ’ s the right direction . ” he and other environmental activists have expressed concern that public-private partnerships will be used by big business as an exercise in “ greenwash ” – putting a cloak of environmental responsibility around a company that could mask activities that could actually be damaging to the environment or people in development countries . martin kaiser , international environmental expert for greenpeace who is in johannesburg , criticised the congo plan after it was announced saying it appeared to have been developed largely by the paper industry with only minimal input from indigenous groups threatened by the congo forests ’ destruction . “ there ’ s already a lot of criticism about these initiatives .
a lot seem to be one-sided in favor of industry , ” he told dw-world . in un parlance , these public-private agreements are called “ type 2 ” initiatives .
the idea is that these voluntary programs can be decided on and launched quickly by the parties involved as opposed to being endorsed by the “ type 1 ” process , which requires the approval of an international forum and can be bureaucratic and time-consuming . “ we think it would be more sensible if these were a completion of type 1 initiatives and a part of binding agreements instead of just voluntary ones , whose outcome is anything but certain , ” kusche said . practical steps but the americans at the summit see such agreements as practical steps towards sustainable development .
public funds used in partnerships , according to us thinking , can leverage private investment .
assistant secretary of state john turner said the us plans on commiting $ 970 million over the next three years to water projects , but expects to mobilize more than $ 1.6 billion through partnerships . the us agency for international development presented a $ 90 million proposal to fight hunger in africa by teaming up with regional trade groups and industry partners . paula dobriansky , a us undersecretary of state for global affairs , dismissed skepticism on the part of some activists . “ i have found a great deal of enthusiasm … all want to see us really have some action here , ” she said . european union officials were also talking up several of their proposed projects on thursday , including agreements in energy and water management .
but they were more circumspect than their translatlantic partners about the extent to which public-private partnerships can solve all the world ’ s problems . in a statement , danish environment minister hans christian schmidt , who is representing the eu in johannesburg , cautioned against upsetting the balance between the public and private part of the equation . “ partnerships are a complement to -lrb- government -rrb- commitments , ” he said , “ not a substitute for them . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de on the green road from rio to johannesburg the un summit in johannesburg next week has been dubbed " rio + 10 " or " earth summit 2 " .

the pact calls for reducing catches to sustainable levels . a deal was struck late tuesday night in johannesburg , aiming to replenish the world ’ s overfished waters by 2015 and head off a looming fisheries crisis .
it ’ s the first concrete target date set at this summit where 200 nations have gathered to come up with an action plan to reduce world poverty without destroying the environment .
environmentalists , who have been highly critical of the summit for its reluctance to set definite targets for reform , welcomed the fisheries plan , calling it a welcome advance . “ it ’ s pleasing that they have reached agreement on oceans , ” sian pullen of the environmental group wwf told reuters .
“ we would have liked it to be more progressive but it ’ s good compared to some of the other issues which may be going backwards . ”
catching fewer fish the plan calls for reducing fish catches to levels where the maximum sustainable yield can be taken indefinitely .
it gives governments a deadline of 2015 to restore fish stocks to sustainable levels .
that could entail enacting temporary fishing bans in some areas or setting up permanent no-fishing zones to preserve breeding grounds .
according to the united nations , more than 25 percent of the world ’ s commercially important fish stocks are overexploited and 50 percent are being fished to full capacity .
after pressure from the us , delegates agreed add a clause stating that fish levels should be replenished “ where possible . ”
the americans argued some stocks , such as cod on the grand banks of canada ’ s eastern seaboard , are thought to have already been fished beyond recovery .
enforcement questions while the agreement has buoyed delegates ’ spirits , some environmentalists question whether the agreement can be enforeced against pirate trawlers .
for example , the fish stocks off of mozambique , south africa ’ s neighbor , have been reduced by more than 70 percent in the last decade , thanks largely to fleets of chinese and tanzanian fishermen who invade mozambican waters and dynamite all species .
they come to the waters off the island nation because they have exhausted the stocks in their own waters .
“ -lrb- the agreement -rrb- does recognize the need for enforcement but it doesn ’ t say how it ’ s going to be done .
it ’ s a major issue and not one that ’ s been adequately addressed , ” said the wwf ’ s sian pullen .
like the other parts of the action plan that heads of state are due to approve when they come to the summit finale next week , the fisheries agreement is not legally binding .
proponents hope however that it will form a moral basis for action and keep governments under pressure from the public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes radical reforms on fishing a disputed plan to reform eu fishing would remove thousands of fishing vessels from european seas in an attempt to save threatened fish stocks and create a sustainable industry .

the company saw the tracks of some of its main lines near dresden get washed away , train stations flooded and the collapse of crucial bridges , including one on a high-speed rail line connecting northern and southern germany .
appearing at the chancellery in berlin on wednesday , deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn issued a preliminary estimate of over one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in flood damages .
" according to our cautious first estimates , we believe we have suffered revenue losses and damages of 1.025 billion euro , " mehdorn said .
he stressed that this would not be the final damage sum .
a laundry list of damages more than 400 kilometers of deutsche bahn tracks are currently unusable , and 94 bridges and 200 train stations have been badly damaged .
early estimates suggest that the service outages alone will lead to a 90 million euro -lrb- $ 88 million -rrb- drop in revenue from passenger and freight services .
mehdorn said it would take two and a half years before deutsche bahn service could return to its pre-flood level in the region .
the federal government has already agreed to provide deutsche bahn with 650 million euro -lrb- $ 638 million -rrb- to rebuild its network and repair damaged train stations .
more than half the money had already been earmarked for transportation infrastructure development projects in the eastern states that were formerly part of east germany .
deutsche bahn said its first reconstruction priorities would be lines in the leipzig-dresden-chemnitz triangle .
a line connecting dresden with prague will also be rebuilt as quickly as possible .
mehdorn said there are currently no plans to cancel any proposed deutsche bahn projects – including the planned transrapid train line between dortmund and düsseldorf .
new priorities , however , could lead to delays , he warned .
a job-saving deal as part of a four-point " immediate aid " program , the government also reached an agreement with deutsche bahn and the transnet union that the company would not lay off any employees between now and 2006 as a result of the flooding .
until this week 's agreement , talks between the employees ' union and bahn had reached an impasse .
mehdorn said deutsche bahn will reintroduce regular long-distance train service in the state of saxony-anhalt on thursday and is working on a plan to reintroduce long-distance trains in saxony as quickly as possible .
agricultural damage estimated at 267 million euro separately , german consumer protection and agricultural minister renate künast announced the government would release 141 million euro -lrb- $ 138 million -rrb- between now and the end of the year in immediate aid to farmers struck by the flooding .
künast said the government is estimating an initial 267 million euro -lrb- $ 262 million -rrb- in damages to farms .

the pact calls for reducing catches to sustainable levels . a deal was struck late tuesday night in johannesburg , aiming to replenish the world ’ s overfished waters by 2015 and head off a looming fisheries crisis .
it ’ s the first concrete target date set at this summit where 200 nations have gathered to come up with an action plan to reduce world poverty without destroying the environment .
environmentalists , who have been highly critical of the summit for its reluctance to set definite targets for reform , welcomed the fisheries plan , calling it a welcome advance . “ it ’ s pleasing that they have reached agreement on oceans , ” sian pullen of the environmental group wwf told reuters .
“ we would have liked it to be more progressive but it ’ s good compared to some of the other issues which may be going backwards . ”
catching fewer fish the plan calls for reducing fish catches to levels where the maximum sustainable yield can be taken indefinitely .
it gives governments a deadline of 2015 to restore fish stocks to sustainable levels .
that could entail enacting temporary fishing bans in some areas or setting up permanent no-fishing zones to preserve breeding grounds .
according to the united nations , more than 25 percent of the world ’ s commercially important fish stocks are overexploited and 50 percent are being fished to full capacity .
after pressure from the us , delegates agreed add a clause stating that fish levels should be replenished “ where possible . ”
the americans argued some stocks , such as cod on the grand banks of canada ’ s eastern seaboard , are thought to have already been fished beyond recovery .
enforcement questions while the agreement has buoyed delegates ’ spirits , some environmentalists question whether the agreement can be enforeced against pirate trawlers .
for example , the fish stocks off of mozambique , south africa ’ s neighbor , have been reduced by more than 70 percent in the last decade , thanks largely to fleets of chinese and tanzanian fishermen who invade mozambican waters and dynamite all species .
they come to the waters off the island nation because they have exhausted the stocks in their own waters .
“ -lrb- the agreement -rrb- does recognize the need for enforcement but it doesn ’ t say how it ’ s going to be done .
it ’ s a major issue and not one that ’ s been adequately addressed , ” said the wwf ’ s sian pullen .
like the other parts of the action plan that heads of state are due to approve when they come to the summit finale next week , the fisheries agreement is not legally binding .
proponents hope however that it will form a moral basis for action and keep governments under pressure from the public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes radical reforms on fishing a disputed plan to reform eu fishing would remove thousands of fishing vessels from european seas in an attempt to save threatened fish stocks and create a sustainable industry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.09.2002 government under fire for neo-nazi informants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : explosive combination : neo-nazi informants and hate music in the latest scandal involving the domestic intelligence agency 's use of informants , reports allege the government looked the other way as two extremist spooks produced a cd inciting the murder of prominent german jews . on thursday , the domestic affairs committee of the german parliament , the bundestag , will convene to debate the use of informants from right-wing extremist and neo-nazi groups by the federal office for the protection of the constitution , germany 's domestic intelligence agency .
for years , the agency has put members of extremist organizations , often leaders , on its payroll in an effort to get a better grasp of the activities of these groups .
in recent years , it has used information culled from informants to build its federal constitutional court case to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
however , subsequent revelations about the relationship between the agency and its informants have jeopardized the npd ban petition and led critics to ask whether it has gone over the line in nurturing such relationships .
" this bullet is for you " the latest twist involves mirko h. , a neo-nazi from the state of saxony who has been working as an informant for the office of the protection of the constitution since the mid-1990s .
it has been alleged that during his time on the agency 's payroll , he also produced thousands of copies of a cd by the band white aryan rebels called " notes of hate , " containing nazi lyrics that are banned in germany .
the song " this bullet is for you " includes a death threat against the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , michel friedman , and other german politicians .
the album , chilling in its unabashed xenophobia , also includes calls for the killing of mo asumang , a popular german erotic television star of ghanian ancestry .
the second informant implicated in the scandal is toni s. , a neo-nazi from the eastern german city of cottbus who worked for the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of brandenburg .
toni s. is currently in investigative police custody as his relationship with the white aryan rebels is probed .
the dresden public prosecutors ' office , meanwhile , has filed a criminal case against mirko h. for his role in the production and distribution of the cd .
what did the government know , and when ?
a report in the current issue of " focus , " a national newsweekly , alleged that the office of the protection of the constitution was aware of mirko h. 's involvement in the creation of the cd and still continued to work with him without stopping its production .
the newsweekly reported he earned more than 105,000 euro from the hate-filled lp .
the article also accused the federal interior ministry of withhold from the secret service committee of parliament the information that mirko h. had been convicted of illegal weapons possession and incitement in 2001 .
the interior ministry has denied the charge .
still , that does n't make it easier for the celebrities threatened in " notes of hate , " to sleep at night .
" i 'm shaken and feel less secure by the idea that security authorities have become a part of the threat , " michel friedman told the berlin newspaper " tagesspiegel , " in its wednesday edition .
" this ca n't be accepted by the government . "
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union are calling for immediate answers from the interior ministry and the government .
" in the face of the dramatic events in this informant scandal , we expect that the interior minister will provide answers , " the deputy head of the union bloc 's parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , told the " berliner zeitung " newspaper .
" he has to tell us what he knew about the informant , what the interior ministry knew , who carries the political responsibility and what conclusions should be drawn . "
criticism from within concern is also growing inside the government .
christian ströbele , a green member of parliament , told the same paper he believed the situation must be clarified before the sept .
22 federal elections .
ströbele said he believed the latest incident was just " one more example of the questionable methods of the office for the protection of the constitution . "
where do you draw the line , he asked , between activities right-wing extremists have developed themselves and those that have been inspired and financed by the office for the protection of the constitution ?
" you have to ask yourself whether some -lrb- authorities from the office -rrb- are doing more to endanger our constitution than to protect it , " ströbele said .
a growing informant scandal the neo-nazi cd scandal is only the latest gaffe for the office of the protection of the constitution in its use of extremist informants who are still active .
the constitutional court temporarily suspended the government 's case to ban the npd in january after it learned a key member of the right-wing extremist party 's leadership had at one point served as an informant for the domestic intelligence agency 's investigation , which laid the foundations for the ban petition .
the court learned that part of the government 's case had been gleaned from wolfgang frenz , an npd official and witness for the defense who had worked as an informant for the north rhine-westphalia state office for the protection of the constitution .
days later , it learned that udo holtmann , head of the npd 's state chapter in north rhine-westphalia , had also aided in the government 's case .
the government has said it must rely on unidentified informants in such cases because it is their best hope to gain intelligence on the groups .
on thursday , the practice will be put under the microscope of the bundestag , where more than a handful of politicians have already said they will question the government practice . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new problems for case against far-right party ?
germany 's state interior ministers have informally reached an agreement to shield the identities of informants in the government 's case to ban the right-wing extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
-lrb- july 11 , 2002 -rrb- controlling the secret service a second member of the far-right npd party has surfaced as an informant for germany 's domestic intelligence agency .
a debate on the workings of the secret service has now arisen .

the company saw the tracks of some of its main lines near dresden get washed away , train stations flooded and the collapse of crucial bridges , including one on a high-speed rail line connecting northern and southern germany .
appearing at the chancellery in berlin on wednesday , deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn issued a preliminary estimate of over one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in flood damages .
" according to our cautious first estimates , we believe we have suffered revenue losses and damages of 1.025 billion euro , " mehdorn said .
he stressed that this would not be the final damage sum .
a laundry list of damages more than 400 kilometers of deutsche bahn tracks are currently unusable , and 94 bridges and 200 train stations have been badly damaged .
early estimates suggest that the service outages alone will lead to a 90 million euro -lrb- $ 88 million -rrb- drop in revenue from passenger and freight services .
mehdorn said it would take two and a half years before deutsche bahn service could return to its pre-flood level in the region .
the federal government has already agreed to provide deutsche bahn with 650 million euro -lrb- $ 638 million -rrb- to rebuild its network and repair damaged train stations .
more than half the money had already been earmarked for transportation infrastructure development projects in the eastern states that were formerly part of east germany .
deutsche bahn said its first reconstruction priorities would be lines in the leipzig-dresden-chemnitz triangle .
a line connecting dresden with prague will also be rebuilt as quickly as possible .
mehdorn said there are currently no plans to cancel any proposed deutsche bahn projects – including the planned transrapid train line between dortmund and düsseldorf .
new priorities , however , could lead to delays , he warned .
a job-saving deal as part of a four-point " immediate aid " program , the government also reached an agreement with deutsche bahn and the transnet union that the company would not lay off any employees between now and 2006 as a result of the flooding .
until this week 's agreement , talks between the employees ' union and bahn had reached an impasse .
mehdorn said deutsche bahn will reintroduce regular long-distance train service in the state of saxony-anhalt on thursday and is working on a plan to reintroduce long-distance trains in saxony as quickly as possible .

the company saw the tracks of some of its main lines near dresden get washed away , train stations flooded and the collapse of crucial bridges , including one on a high-speed rail line connecting northern and southern germany .
appearing at the chancellery in berlin on wednesday , deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn issued a preliminary estimate of over one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in flood damages .
" according to our cautious first estimates , we believe we have suffered revenue losses and damages of 1.025 billion euro , " mehdorn said .
he stressed that this would not be the final damage sum .
a laundry list of damages more than 400 kilometers of deutsche bahn tracks are currently unusable , and 94 bridges and 200 train stations have been badly damaged .
early estimates suggest that the service outages alone will lead to a 90 million euro -lrb- $ 88 million -rrb- drop in revenue from passenger and freight services .
mehdorn said it would take two and a half years before deutsche bahn service could return to its pre-flood level in the region .
the federal government has already agreed to provide deutsche bahn with 650 million euro -lrb- $ 638 million -rrb- to rebuild its network and repair damaged train stations .
more than half the money had already been earmarked for transportation infrastructure development projects in the eastern states that were formerly part of east germany .
deutsche bahn said its first reconstruction priorities would be lines in the leipzig-dresden-chemnitz triangle .
a line connecting dresden with prague will also be rebuilt as quickly as possible .
mehdorn said there are currently no plans to cancel any proposed deutsche bahn projects – including the planned transrapid train line between dortmund and düsseldorf .
new priorities , however , could lead to delays , he warned .
a job-saving deal as part of a four-point " immediate aid " program , the government also reached an agreement with deutsche bahn and the transnet union that the company would not lay off any employees between now and 2006 as a result of the flooding .
until this week 's agreement , talks between the employees ' union and bahn had reached an impasse .
mehdorn said deutsche bahn will reintroduce regular long-distance train service in the state of saxony-anhalt on thursday and is working on a plan to reintroduce long-distance trains in saxony as quickly as possible .
agricultural damage estimated at 267 million euro separately , german consumer protection and agricultural minister renate künast announced the government would release 141 million euro -lrb- $ 138 million -rrb- between now and the end of the year in immediate aid to farmers struck by the flooding .
künast said the government is estimating an initial 267 million euro -lrb- $ 262 million -rrb- in damages to farms .
but the government has not yet added damages to farm buildings to its estimate . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting deutsche bahn back on track after floods germany 's main railway company , deutsche bahn , estimates flood damage to the country 's railway network will reach " tens of billion euro " .

as far as actually financing the repair of the damages went , heated arguments and acrimonious debates were the order of the day .
opening the debate , german chancellor gerhard schröder said that the floods had caused the worst damage in germany since the second world war .

he said that the opposition union bloc had chosen not to block the government 's plans to avoid " fighting on the backs of the victims " .
but he emphasised that he thinks the government 's strategy is wrong .
" high taxes will cripple economic performance , stem growth , destroy jobs " , he said .
the opposition is pushing instead to use the profits of germany 's central bank to finance flood repairs .

fdp leader guido westerwelle accused the government of worsening the flood catastrophe through another " catastrophe " of higher taxes .

for years , the agency has put members of extremist organizations , often leaders , on its payroll in an effort to get a better grasp of the activities of these groups .
in recent years , it has used information culled from informants to build its federal constitutional court case to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
however , subsequent revelations about the relationship between the agency and its informants have jeopardized the npd ban petition and led critics to ask whether it has gone over the line in nurturing such relationships .
" this bullet is for you " the latest twist involves mirko h. , a neo-nazi from the state of saxony who has been working as an informant for the office of the protection of the constitution since the mid-1990s .
it has been alleged that during his time on the agency 's payroll , he also produced thousands of copies of a cd by the band white aryan rebels called " notes of hate , " containing nazi lyrics that are banned in germany .
the song " this bullet is for you " includes a death threat against the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , michel friedman , and other german politicians .
the album , chilling in its unabashed xenophobia , also includes calls for the killing of mo asumang , a popular german erotic television star of ghanian ancestry .
the second informant implicated in the scandal is toni s. , a neo-nazi from the eastern german city of cottbus who worked for the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of brandenburg .
toni s. is currently in investigative police custody as his relationship with the white aryan rebels is probed .
the dresden public prosecutors ' office , meanwhile , has filed a criminal case against mirko h. for his role in the production and distribution of the cd .
what did the government know , and when ?
a report in the current issue of " focus , " a national newsweekly , alleged that the office of the protection of the constitution was aware of mirko h. 's involvement in the creation of the cd and still continued to work with him without stopping its production .
the newsweekly reported he earned more than 105,000 euro from the hate-filled lp .
the article also accused the federal interior ministry of withhold from the secret service committee of parliament the information that mirko h. had been convicted of illegal weapons possession and incitement in 2001 .
the interior ministry has denied the charge .
still , that does n't make it easier for the celebrities threatened in " notes of hate , " to sleep at night .
" i 'm shaken and feel less secure by the idea that security authorities have become a part of the threat , " michel friedman told the berlin newspaper " tagesspiegel , " in its wednesday edition .
" this ca n't be accepted by the government . "
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union are calling for immediate answers from the interior ministry and the government .
" in the face of the dramatic events in this informant scandal , we expect that the interior minister will provide answers , " the deputy head of the union bloc 's parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , told the " berliner zeitung " newspaper .
" he has to tell us what he knew about the informant , what the interior ministry knew , who carries the political responsibility and what conclusions should be drawn . "
criticism from within concern is also growing inside the government .
christian ströbele , a green member of parliament , told the same paper he believed the situation must be clarified before the sept .
22 federal elections .
ströbele said he believed the latest incident was just " one more example of the questionable methods of the office for the protection of the constitution . "
where do you draw the line , he asked , between activities right-wing extremists have developed themselves and those that have been inspired and financed by the office for the protection of the constitution ?
" you have to ask yourself whether some -lrb- authorities from the office -rrb- are doing more to endanger our constitution than to protect it , " ströbele said .
a growing informant scandal the neo-nazi cd scandal is only the latest gaffe for the office of the protection of the constitution in its use of extremist informants who are still active .
the constitutional court temporarily suspended the government 's case to ban the npd in january after it learned a key member of the right-wing extremist party 's leadership had at one point served as an informant for the domestic intelligence agency 's investigation , which laid the foundations for the ban petition .
the court learned that part of the government 's case had been gleaned from wolfgang frenz , an npd official and witness for the defense who had worked as an informant for the north rhine-westphalia state office for the protection of the constitution .
days later , it learned that udo holtmann , head of the npd 's state chapter in north rhine-westphalia , had also aided in the government 's case .
the government has said it must rely on unidentified informants in such cases because it is their best hope to gain intelligence on the groups .
on thursday , the practice will be put under the microscope of the bundestag , where more than a handful of politicians have already said they will question the government practice . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new problems for case against far-right party ?
germany 's state interior ministers have informally reached an agreement to shield the identities of informants in the government 's case to ban the right-wing extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
-lrb- july 11 , 2002 -rrb- controlling the secret service a second member of the far-right npd party has surfaced as an informant for germany 's domestic intelligence agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.09.2002 government under fire for neo-nazi informants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : explosive combination : neo-nazi informants and hate music in the latest scandal involving the domestic intelligence agency 's use of informants , reports allege the government looked the other way as two extremist spooks produced a cd inciting the murder of prominent german jews . on thursday , the domestic affairs committee of the german parliament , the bundestag , will convene to debate the use of informants from right-wing extremist and neo-nazi groups by the federal office for the protection of the constitution , germany 's domestic intelligence agency .
for years , the agency has put members of extremist organizations , often leaders , on its payroll in an effort to get a better grasp of the activities of these groups .
in recent years , it has used information culled from informants to build its federal constitutional court case to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
however , subsequent revelations about the relationship between the agency and its informants have jeopardized the npd ban petition and led critics to ask whether it has gone over the line in nurturing such relationships .
" this bullet is for you " the latest twist involves mirko h. , a neo-nazi from the state of saxony who has been working as an informant for the office of the protection of the constitution since the mid-1990s .
it has been alleged that during his time on the agency 's payroll , he also produced thousands of copies of a cd by the band white aryan rebels called " notes of hate , " containing nazi lyrics that are banned in germany .
the song " this bullet is for you " includes a death threat against the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , michel friedman , and other german politicians .
the album , chilling in its unabashed xenophobia , also includes calls for the killing of mo asumang , a popular german erotic television star of ghanian ancestry .
the second informant implicated in the scandal is toni s. , a neo-nazi from the eastern german city of cottbus who worked for the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of brandenburg .
toni s. is currently in investigative police custody as his relationship with the white aryan rebels is probed .
the dresden public prosecutors ' office , meanwhile , has filed a criminal case against mirko h. for his role in the production and distribution of the cd .
what did the government know , and when ?
a report in the current issue of " focus , " a national newsweekly , alleged that the office of the protection of the constitution was aware of mirko h. 's involvement in the creation of the cd and still continued to work with him without stopping its production .
the newsweekly reported he earned more than 105,000 euro from the hate-filled lp .
the article also accused the federal interior ministry of withhold from the secret service committee of parliament the information that mirko h. had been convicted of illegal weapons possession and incitement in 2001 .
the interior ministry has denied the charge .
still , that does n't make it easier for the celebrities threatened in " notes of hate , " to sleep at night .
" i 'm shaken and feel less secure by the idea that security authorities have become a part of the threat , " michel friedman told the berlin newspaper " tagesspiegel , " in its wednesday edition .
" this ca n't be accepted by the government . "
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union are calling for immediate answers from the interior ministry and the government .
" in the face of the dramatic events in this informant scandal , we expect that the interior minister will provide answers , " the deputy head of the union bloc 's parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , told the " berliner zeitung " newspaper .
" he has to tell us what he knew about the informant , what the interior ministry knew , who carries the political responsibility and what conclusions should be drawn . "
criticism from within concern is also growing inside the government .
christian ströbele , a green member of parliament , told the same paper he believed the situation must be clarified before the sept .
22 federal elections .
ströbele said he believed the latest incident was just " one more example of the questionable methods of the office for the protection of the constitution . "
where do you draw the line , he asked , between activities right-wing extremists have developed themselves and those that have been inspired and financed by the office for the protection of the constitution ?
" you have to ask yourself whether some -lrb- authorities from the office -rrb- are doing more to endanger our constitution than to protect it , " ströbele said .
a growing informant scandal the neo-nazi cd scandal is only the latest gaffe for the office of the protection of the constitution in its use of extremist informants who are still active .
the constitutional court temporarily suspended the government 's case to ban the npd in january after it learned a key member of the right-wing extremist party 's leadership had at one point served as an informant for the domestic intelligence agency 's investigation , which laid the foundations for the ban petition .
the court learned that part of the government 's case had been gleaned from wolfgang frenz , an npd official and witness for the defense who had worked as an informant for the north rhine-westphalia state office for the protection of the constitution .
days later , it learned that udo holtmann , head of the npd 's state chapter in north rhine-westphalia , had also aided in the government 's case .
the government has said it must rely on unidentified informants in such cases because it is their best hope to gain intelligence on the groups .
on thursday , the practice will be put under the microscope of the bundestag , where more than a handful of politicians have already said they will question the government practice . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new problems for case against far-right party ?
germany 's state interior ministers have informally reached an agreement to shield the identities of informants in the government 's case to ban the right-wing extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : environment matters german minister keeps his faith in upcoming earth summit on the green road from rio to johannesburg steering environmental issues back on the political agenda world summit opens with eu , us at odds germany -pipe- 03.09.2002 summit looks at public-private cooperation to protect the planet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private industry can play a key role in saving the planet .
western countries are promoting “ public-private partnerships ” at the earth summit in johannesburg as a path to sustainable development .
environmentalists are skeptical , saying it puts big business before people . led by the united states , western countries showcased partnerships on thursday between governments , private industry and other groups as a practical way of furthering economic development and saving the environment . they say such partnerships are ways for business and governments to pool their resources and harness the funds and the know-how to accomplish more than either could on its own . un organizers say they have received 218 proposed partnerships , in areas ranging from health care to renewable energy projects that could go a long way in helping meet summit goals of halving global poverty by 2015 while slowing environmental degradation . congo project a multi-nation project to expand efforts to save forests in central africa ’ s congo basin was announced on thursday .
germany , the us , japan and indonesia are among the countries that want to provide an additional $ 53 million dollars over four years to a partnership between the paper industry active in the region and the local population .
the plan aims to develop protected forest areas and cut down on illegal logging . but many environmentalists are wary of relying on private business to save the planet .
they say partnerships may let companies cash in on providing essential services like water and electricity , while allowing governments to shirk their traditional responsibilities . “ if a government doesn ’ t do its regulation homework , it could be more than happy to let a private company come in and take over things , ” jörg kusche with greenpeace in germany told dw-world .
“ but then there would be no transparency or accountability .
we don ’ t think that ’ s the right direction . ” he and other environmental activists have expressed concern that public-private partnerships will be used by big business as an exercise in “ greenwash ” – putting a cloak of environmental responsibility around a company that could mask activities that could actually be damaging to the environment or people in development countries . martin kaiser , international environmental expert for greenpeace who is in johannesburg , criticised the congo plan after it was announced saying it appeared to have been developed largely by the paper industry with only minimal input from indigenous groups threatened by the congo forests ’ destruction . “ there ’ s already a lot of criticism about these initiatives .
a lot seem to be one-sided in favor of industry , ” he told dw-world . in un parlance , these public-private agreements are called “ type 2 ” initiatives .
the idea is that these voluntary programs can be decided on and launched quickly by the parties involved as opposed to being endorsed by the “ type 1 ” process , which requires the approval of an international forum and can be bureaucratic and time-consuming . “ we think it would be more sensible if these were a completion of type 1 initiatives and a part of binding agreements instead of just voluntary ones , whose outcome is anything but certain , ” kusche said . practical steps but the americans at the summit see such agreements as practical steps towards sustainable development .
public funds used in partnerships , according to us thinking , can leverage private investment .
assistant secretary of state john turner said the us plans on commiting $ 970 million over the next three years to water projects , but expects to mobilize more than $ 1.6 billion through partnerships . the us agency for international development presented a $ 90 million proposal to fight hunger in africa by teaming up with regional trade groups and industry partners . paula dobriansky , a us undersecretary of state for global affairs , dismissed skepticism on the part of some activists . “ i have found a great deal of enthusiasm … all want to see us really have some action here , ” she said . european union officials were also talking up several of their proposed projects on thursday , including agreements in energy and water management .
but they were more circumspect than their translatlantic partners about the extent to which public-private partnerships can solve all the world ’ s problems . in a statement , danish environment minister hans christian schmidt , who is representing the eu in johannesburg , cautioned against upsetting the balance between the public and private part of the equation . “ partnerships are a complement to -lrb- government -rrb- commitments , ” he said , “ not a substitute for them . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de on the green road from rio to johannesburg the un summit in johannesburg next week has been dubbed " rio + 10 " or " earth summit 2 " .

as far as actually financing the repair of the damages went , heated arguments and acrimonious debates were the order of the day .
opening the debate , german chancellor gerhard schröder said that the floods had caused the worst damage in germany since the second world war .
he thanked the scores of voluntary and professional helpers who had laboured to pile sandbags and help people to safety .
" not just a catastrophic flood , but also an unbelievable wave of solidarity has swept through germany " , he said .
stoiber on the offensive opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- sharply criticised the government ’ s plan to finance a large chunk of the 10 billion euro -lrb- dollar -rrb- flood relief package by postponing next year 's scheduled tax reform and increasing the corporation tax .
he said that the opposition union bloc had chosen not to block the government 's plans to avoid " fighting on the backs of the victims " .
but he emphasised that he thinks the government 's strategy is wrong .
" high taxes will cripple economic performance , stem growth , destroy jobs " , he said .
the opposition is pushing instead to use the profits of germany 's central bank to finance flood repairs .
" higher interest rates are a lesser evil compared to higher taxes " , stoiber said .
pulling out his main weapon against schröder in the current election campaign , stoiber added that that recent floods were germany 's second national catastrophe of the summer , the first being the country 's four million unemployed .
social democrats deride opposition proposal but chancellor schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- vehemently opposes using central bank profits .
schröder has called it " socially imbalanced " and accused the opposition of wanting to burden future generations with more debt .
german foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party said that higher debts would hurt the country 's competitiveness .
free democrats want to go third way the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- joined the union parties in opposing the planned hike in corporation taxes .
fdp leader guido westerwelle accused the government of worsening the flood catastrophe through another " catastrophe " of higher taxes .
but the union bloc 's financing suggestion did n't meet with the liberals ' approval either .
the money instead should come from diverting funds and saving in other areas , westerwelle said .
pds wants money from military projects parliamentary floor leader of the party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- , roland claus , called upon the government to cancel planned weapons projects such as the military transporter a400 m in order to finance repairs .
if schröder says he doesn ’ t want a military adventure in iraq , " then he can do without a military adventure gadget " , he said .
will the relief package suffice ?
despite the barbed debates , georg milbrandt , the premier of one of the most affected states , saxony , took comfort in the fact that that the relief package could be coming soon .
but he was skeptical about whether 10 billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in direct financial assistance approved earlier this week would be enough .
for saxony alone , the premier estimated damage costs could run as high as 15 billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- .
the draft flood relief legislation should go through both chambers of parliament before the september 22 federal elections . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flood relief on its way the german cabinet has approved the draft law for helping the country 's flood victims .
the legislation will enable rapid and direct financial assistance totalling some 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.75 billion -rrb- .

but stoiber and schröder succeeded in piquing interest in what had until now been a sleepy election . going into sunday night 's debate against edmund stoiber , gerhard schröder already had a huge disadvantage – as the four-year chancellor of germany , he found himself in a defensive position .
it was a fundamental weakness that challenger stoiber , the premier of bavaria , put to his advantage in a series of forceful attacks against the chancellor covering the most important issues of the election , making the anticipated event feel like a political soccer match .
the most contentious exchanges revolved around spiraling unemployment , a stagnant economy , tax reforms , immigration and germany 's stance on a possible iraq invasion – all dominant issues in the media during the days and weeks leading up to the first debate .
the keyword of the night seemed to be " failure , " of which both candidates repeatedly accused the other of on each key issue .
the debate , which is being called a " duel " here , was broadcast by the private television stations rtl and sat.1.
schröder taken to task for soaring unemployment in one of the most aggressive salvos of the evening , stoiber blamed germany 's high unemployment level of over four million on the current red-green government , led by schröder 's social democrats and the greens .
he said schröder had failed in his promise to reduce unemployment levels to fewer than 3.5 million people .
he criticized schröder for his plan to delay a tax cut scheduled for 2003 in order to fund the rebuilding of communities ravaged this summer by the biggest floods in a hundred years .
he said the government made a " mistake " by instituting tax reforms that did nothing to help what he described as the " most important " part of the german economy : small- to middle-sized businesses .
" we ca n't forget that the center of gravity of our labor market is dependent on the ...
german market .
we have only a relatively small share of exports to america .
other countries , like england , france , sweden , finland and spain have the same international ties , but they do n't have the dramatically growing number of unemployed or such a weak economic growth rate . "
schröder conceded he was disappointed by germany 's unemployment rate , but fought back by saying it was the result of the global economic downturn and not a homemade problem as stoiber had suggested .
as for the delayed tax cut , he said , " i 'm convinced that the people of this country understand that today 's damage ca n't be compensated for with debts that our children and grandchildren will then have to pay . "
how full is the ship ?
addressing immigration , stoiber said he thought it was " wrong for germany to have a law that provides for more immigration . "
he said that every year germany takes in 500,000 to 600,000 new immigrants - the equivalent of cities like dortmund or nuremburg .
he said the new immigration law would increase that number by 100,000 to 150,000 .
" we are n't even finished assimilating the foreigner children who are already here .
we need to do a lot more .
for that reason we should n't increase immigration , " he said .
schröder defended his government 's new law , passed in march , saying it both limited immigration in areas where it is n't needed while at the same time opening doors for highly skilled workers who are needed in the technology sector .
while stoiber 's numbers were correct , he said , he had omitted the annual outflow of several hundred thousand – refugees of countries once torn by civil war , for example .
when you add those figures in , he said , the increase is more like 100,000 people .
stoiber : schröder 's iraq position " irresponsible " schröder also found himself on the defensive on the subject of a possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
recently , schröder has alluded that the u.s. was planning to engage in " military adventurism , " and said that germany would not participate , even under a united nations mandate .
on sunday night , however , schröder sought to draw a line between his stances on u.n. efforts to get weapons inspectors back inside baghdad and the u.s. ' desire to topple saddam hussein 's regime .
" in light of the situation in the middle east , and considering the fact that we have n't conquered the taliban and are far from having rebuilt afghanistan , a military intervention in iraq is wrong , and for that reason , under my leadership , germany will not help in that effort , " the chancellor said .
stoiber , meanwhile , called schröder 's public statements on the issue , and his stance , " irresponsible . "
he specifically criticized schröder for saying the country must go the " german way , " a phrase he said had historically charged connotations - at least in the ears of the international community .
he also said schröder 's public statements and policy reduced some of the international pressure on hussein .
" with saddam hussein , you have a war criminal as head of government , a head of state who possesses weapons of mass destruction and has even used them against his own people and those in neighboring iran .
we need to do everything we can , make every diplomatic effort , apply as much political pressure " as is needed to get un inspectors back inside iraq , stoiber said .
he said the chancellor should n't be ruling out every " theoretical option . "
stalemate so who won ?
the jury ca n't seem to make up its mind .
immediately after the debate , the editor in chief of the newsweekly " der spiegel , " stefan aust , said he " did n't get the impression he -lrb- schröder -rrb- was the media chancellor .
he could have done better . "
aust even accused him of putting his german television audience to sleep .
but polls taken of viewers sunday night were all over the board .
a forsa institute poll for sat.1 put schröder ahead .
another , by pollster wahlen for public broadcaster zdf had stoiber ahead by two points .
but another , by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard put schröder far ahead of his bavarian challenger .
in editorials published in the monday editions , many major regional newspapers shied away from declaring a victor .
the mass-circulation " bild " described german voters as the victors for even taking an interest in the debate .
the " berliner zeitung , " meanwhile , described it as a duel that had neither a conqueror nor someone who had been conquered .
indeed , if a television debate were analogous to soccer , you might say that stoiber controlled the ball for much of the game – e.g. he steered the issues and went in with the most attacks – but neither candidate , it seemed , scored many goals . and that 's too bad considering that in germany 's first ever television debate there was no provision for penalty shots . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery read everything you need to know about the politicians , parties and hot-button issues , along with a dummy 's guide to the german political system , as germans head for the polls for national elections on september 22 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : environment matters german minister keeps his faith in upcoming earth summit on the green road from rio to johannesburg steering environmental issues back on the political agenda world summit opens with eu , us at odds germany -pipe- 03.09.2002 johannesburg nets fisheries agreement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overfishing is affecting more than 70 percent of the world 's commercially important fish in the first substantive agreement at the earth summit in johannesburg , delegates agreed on a plan to try and protect the world 's diminishing fish stocks .
the pact calls for reducing catches to sustainable levels . a deal was struck late tuesday night in johannesburg , aiming to replenish the world ’ s overfished waters by 2015 and head off a looming fisheries crisis .
it ’ s the first concrete target date set at this summit where 200 nations have gathered to come up with an action plan to reduce world poverty without destroying the environment .
environmentalists , who have been highly critical of the summit for its reluctance to set definite targets for reform , welcomed the fisheries plan , calling it a welcome advance . “ it ’ s pleasing that they have reached agreement on oceans , ” sian pullen of the environmental group wwf told reuters .
“ we would have liked it to be more progressive but it ’ s good compared to some of the other issues which may be going backwards . ”
catching fewer fish the plan calls for reducing fish catches to levels where the maximum sustainable yield can be taken indefinitely .
it gives governments a deadline of 2015 to restore fish stocks to sustainable levels .
that could entail enacting temporary fishing bans in some areas or setting up permanent no-fishing zones to preserve breeding grounds .
according to the united nations , more than 25 percent of the world ’ s commercially important fish stocks are overexploited and 50 percent are being fished to full capacity .
after pressure from the us , delegates agreed add a clause stating that fish levels should be replenished “ where possible . ”
the americans argued some stocks , such as cod on the grand banks of canada ’ s eastern seaboard , are thought to have already been fished beyond recovery .
enforcement questions while the agreement has buoyed delegates ’ spirits , some environmentalists question whether the agreement can be enforeced against pirate trawlers .
for example , the fish stocks off of mozambique , south africa ’ s neighbor , have been reduced by more than 70 percent in the last decade , thanks largely to fleets of chinese and tanzanian fishermen who invade mozambican waters and dynamite all species .
they come to the waters off the island nation because they have exhausted the stocks in their own waters .
“ -lrb- the agreement -rrb- does recognize the need for enforcement but it doesn ’ t say how it ’ s going to be done .
it ’ s a major issue and not one that ’ s been adequately addressed , ” said the wwf ’ s sian pullen .
like the other parts of the action plan that heads of state are due to approve when they come to the summit finale next week , the fisheries agreement is not legally binding .
proponents hope however that it will form a moral basis for action and keep governments under pressure from the public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes radical reforms on fishing a disputed plan to reform eu fishing would remove thousands of fishing vessels from european seas in an attempt to save threatened fish stocks and create a sustainable industry .

the company saw the tracks of some of its main lines near dresden get washed away , train stations flooded and the collapse of crucial bridges , including one on a high-speed rail line connecting northern and southern germany .
appearing at the chancellery in berlin on wednesday , deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn issued a preliminary estimate of over one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in flood damages .
" according to our cautious first estimates , we believe we have suffered revenue losses and damages of 1.025 billion euro , " mehdorn said .
he stressed that this would not be the final damage sum .
a laundry list of damages more than 400 kilometers of deutsche bahn tracks are currently unusable , and 94 bridges and 200 train stations have been badly damaged .
early estimates suggest that the service outages alone will lead to a 90 million euro -lrb- $ 88 million -rrb- drop in revenue from passenger and freight services .
mehdorn said it would take two and a half years before deutsche bahn service could return to its pre-flood level in the region .
the federal government has already agreed to provide deutsche bahn with 650 million euro -lrb- $ 638 million -rrb- to rebuild its network and repair damaged train stations .
more than half the money had already been earmarked for transportation infrastructure development projects in the eastern states that were formerly part of east germany .
deutsche bahn said its first reconstruction priorities would be lines in the leipzig-dresden-chemnitz triangle .
a line connecting dresden with prague will also be rebuilt as quickly as possible .
mehdorn said there are currently no plans to cancel any proposed deutsche bahn projects – including the planned transrapid train line between dortmund and düsseldorf .
new priorities , however , could lead to delays , he warned .
a job-saving deal as part of a four-point " immediate aid " program , the government also reached an agreement with deutsche bahn and the transnet union that the company would not lay off any employees between now and 2006 as a result of the flooding .
until this week 's agreement , talks between the employees ' union and bahn had reached an impasse .
mehdorn said deutsche bahn will reintroduce regular long-distance train service in the state of saxony-anhalt on thursday and is working on a plan to reintroduce long-distance trains in saxony as quickly as possible .
agricultural damage estimated at 267 million euro separately , german consumer protection and agricultural minister renate künast announced the government would release 141 million euro -lrb- $ 138 million -rrb- between now and the end of the year in immediate aid to farmers struck by the flooding .

for years , the agency has put members of extremist organizations , often leaders , on its payroll in an effort to get a better grasp of the activities of these groups .
in recent years , it has used information culled from informants to build its federal constitutional court case to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
however , subsequent revelations about the relationship between the agency and its informants have jeopardized the npd ban petition and led critics to ask whether it has gone over the line in nurturing such relationships .
" this bullet is for you " the latest twist involves mirko h. , a neo-nazi from the state of saxony who has been working as an informant for the office of the protection of the constitution since the mid-1990s .
it has been alleged that during his time on the agency 's payroll , he also produced thousands of copies of a cd by the band white aryan rebels called " notes of hate , " containing nazi lyrics that are banned in germany .
the song " this bullet is for you " includes a death threat against the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , michel friedman , and other german politicians .
the album , chilling in its unabashed xenophobia , also includes calls for the killing of mo asumang , a popular german erotic television star of ghanian ancestry .
the second informant implicated in the scandal is toni s. , a neo-nazi from the eastern german city of cottbus who worked for the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of brandenburg .
toni s. is currently in investigative police custody as his relationship with the white aryan rebels is probed .
the dresden public prosecutors ' office , meanwhile , has filed a criminal case against mirko h. for his role in the production and distribution of the cd .
what did the government know , and when ?
a report in the current issue of " focus , " a national newsweekly , alleged that the office of the protection of the constitution was aware of mirko h. 's involvement in the creation of the cd and still continued to work with him without stopping its production .
the newsweekly reported he earned more than 105,000 euro from the hate-filled lp .
the article also accused the federal interior ministry of withhold from the secret service committee of parliament the information that mirko h. had been convicted of illegal weapons possession and incitement in 2001 .
the interior ministry has denied the charge .

" i 'm shaken and feel less secure by the idea that security authorities have become a part of the threat , " michel friedman told the berlin newspaper " tagesspiegel , " in its wednesday edition .
" this ca n't be accepted by the government . "
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union are calling for immediate answers from the interior ministry and the government .
" in the face of the dramatic events in this informant scandal , we expect that the interior minister will provide answers , " the deputy head of the union bloc 's parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , told the " berliner zeitung " newspaper .
" he has to tell us what he knew about the informant , what the interior ministry knew , who carries the political responsibility and what conclusions should be drawn . "
criticism from within concern is also growing inside the government .

ströbele said he believed the latest incident was just " one more example of the questionable methods of the office for the protection of the constitution . "
where do you draw the line , he asked , between activities right-wing extremists have developed themselves and those that have been inspired and financed by the office for the protection of the constitution ?
" you have to ask yourself whether some -lrb- authorities from the office -rrb- are doing more to endanger our constitution than to protect it , " ströbele said .
a growing informant scandal the neo-nazi cd scandal is only the latest gaffe for the office of the protection of the constitution in its use of extremist informants who are still active .
the constitutional court temporarily suspended the government 's case to ban the npd in january after it learned a key member of the right-wing extremist party 's leadership had at one point served as an informant for the domestic intelligence agency 's investigation , which laid the foundations for the ban petition .
the court learned that part of the government 's case had been gleaned from wolfgang frenz , an npd official and witness for the defense who had worked as an informant for the north rhine-westphalia state office for the protection of the constitution .
days later , it learned that udo holtmann , head of the npd 's state chapter in north rhine-westphalia , had also aided in the government 's case .
the government has said it must rely on unidentified informants in such cases because it is their best hope to gain intelligence on the groups .

the company saw the tracks of some of its main lines near dresden get washed away , train stations flooded and the collapse of crucial bridges , including one on a high-speed rail line connecting northern and southern germany .
appearing at the chancellery in berlin on wednesday , deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn issued a preliminary estimate of over one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in flood damages .
" according to our cautious first estimates , we believe we have suffered revenue losses and damages of 1.025 billion euro , " mehdorn said .
he stressed that this would not be the final damage sum .
a laundry list of damages more than 400 kilometers of deutsche bahn tracks are currently unusable , and 94 bridges and 200 train stations have been badly damaged .
early estimates suggest that the service outages alone will lead to a 90 million euro -lrb- $ 88 million -rrb- drop in revenue from passenger and freight services .
mehdorn said it would take two and a half years before deutsche bahn service could return to its pre-flood level in the region .
the federal government has already agreed to provide deutsche bahn with 650 million euro -lrb- $ 638 million -rrb- to rebuild its network and repair damaged train stations .

mehdorn said there are currently no plans to cancel any proposed deutsche bahn projects – including the planned transrapid train line between dortmund and düsseldorf .
new priorities , however , could lead to delays , he warned .
a job-saving deal as part of a four-point " immediate aid " program , the government also reached an agreement with deutsche bahn and the transnet union that the company would not lay off any employees between now and 2006 as a result of the flooding .
until this week 's agreement , talks between the employees ' union and bahn had reached an impasse .
mehdorn said deutsche bahn will reintroduce regular long-distance train service in the state of saxony-anhalt on thursday and is working on a plan to reintroduce long-distance trains in saxony as quickly as possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : environment matters german minister keeps his faith in upcoming earth summit on the green road from rio to johannesburg steering environmental issues back on the political agenda world summit opens with eu , us at odds germany -pipe- 03.09.2002 johannesburg nets fisheries agreement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overfishing is affecting more than 70 percent of the world 's commercially important fish in the first substantive agreement at the earth summit in johannesburg , delegates agreed on a plan to try and protect the world 's diminishing fish stocks .
the pact calls for reducing catches to sustainable levels . a deal was struck late tuesday night in johannesburg , aiming to replenish the world ’ s overfished waters by 2015 and head off a looming fisheries crisis .
it ’ s the first concrete target date set at this summit where 200 nations have gathered to come up with an action plan to reduce world poverty without destroying the environment .
environmentalists , who have been highly critical of the summit for its reluctance to set definite targets for reform , welcomed the fisheries plan , calling it a welcome advance . “ it ’ s pleasing that they have reached agreement on oceans , ” sian pullen of the environmental group wwf told reuters .
“ we would have liked it to be more progressive but it ’ s good compared to some of the other issues which may be going backwards . ”
catching fewer fish the plan calls for reducing fish catches to levels where the maximum sustainable yield can be taken indefinitely .
it gives governments a deadline of 2015 to restore fish stocks to sustainable levels .
that could entail enacting temporary fishing bans in some areas or setting up permanent no-fishing zones to preserve breeding grounds .
according to the united nations , more than 25 percent of the world ’ s commercially important fish stocks are overexploited and 50 percent are being fished to full capacity .
after pressure from the us , delegates agreed add a clause stating that fish levels should be replenished “ where possible . ”
the americans argued some stocks , such as cod on the grand banks of canada ’ s eastern seaboard , are thought to have already been fished beyond recovery .
enforcement questions while the agreement has buoyed delegates ’ spirits , some environmentalists question whether the agreement can be enforeced against pirate trawlers .
for example , the fish stocks off of mozambique , south africa ’ s neighbor , have been reduced by more than 70 percent in the last decade , thanks largely to fleets of chinese and tanzanian fishermen who invade mozambican waters and dynamite all species .
they come to the waters off the island nation because they have exhausted the stocks in their own waters .
“ -lrb- the agreement -rrb- does recognize the need for enforcement but it doesn ’ t say how it ’ s going to be done .
it ’ s a major issue and not one that ’ s been adequately addressed , ” said the wwf ’ s sian pullen .
like the other parts of the action plan that heads of state are due to approve when they come to the summit finale next week , the fisheries agreement is not legally binding .
proponents hope however that it will form a moral basis for action and keep governments under pressure from the public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes radical reforms on fishing a disputed plan to reform eu fishing would remove thousands of fishing vessels from european seas in an attempt to save threatened fish stocks and create a sustainable industry .

for years , the agency has put members of extremist organizations , often leaders , on its payroll in an effort to get a better grasp of the activities of these groups .
in recent years , it has used information culled from informants to build its federal constitutional court case to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
however , subsequent revelations about the relationship between the agency and its informants have jeopardized the npd ban petition and led critics to ask whether it has gone over the line in nurturing such relationships .
" this bullet is for you " the latest twist involves mirko h. , a neo-nazi from the state of saxony who has been working as an informant for the office of the protection of the constitution since the mid-1990s .
it has been alleged that during his time on the agency 's payroll , he also produced thousands of copies of a cd by the band white aryan rebels called " notes of hate , " containing nazi lyrics that are banned in germany .
the song " this bullet is for you " includes a death threat against the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , michel friedman , and other german politicians .
the album , chilling in its unabashed xenophobia , also includes calls for the killing of mo asumang , a popular german erotic television star of ghanian ancestry .
the second informant implicated in the scandal is toni s. , a neo-nazi from the eastern german city of cottbus who worked for the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of brandenburg .
toni s. is currently in investigative police custody as his relationship with the white aryan rebels is probed .
the dresden public prosecutors ' office , meanwhile , has filed a criminal case against mirko h. for his role in the production and distribution of the cd .
what did the government know , and when ?
a report in the current issue of " focus , " a national newsweekly , alleged that the office of the protection of the constitution was aware of mirko h. 's involvement in the creation of the cd and still continued to work with him without stopping its production .
the newsweekly reported he earned more than 105,000 euro from the hate-filled lp .
the article also accused the federal interior ministry of withhold from the secret service committee of parliament the information that mirko h. had been convicted of illegal weapons possession and incitement in 2001 .

the company saw the tracks of some of its main lines near dresden get washed away , train stations flooded and the collapse of crucial bridges , including one on a high-speed rail line connecting northern and southern germany .
appearing at the chancellery in berlin on wednesday , deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn issued a preliminary estimate of over one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in flood damages .
" according to our cautious first estimates , we believe we have suffered revenue losses and damages of 1.025 billion euro , " mehdorn said .
he stressed that this would not be the final damage sum .
a laundry list of damages more than 400 kilometers of deutsche bahn tracks are currently unusable , and 94 bridges and 200 train stations have been badly damaged .
early estimates suggest that the service outages alone will lead to a 90 million euro -lrb- $ 88 million -rrb- drop in revenue from passenger and freight services .
mehdorn said it would take two and a half years before deutsche bahn service could return to its pre-flood level in the region .
the federal government has already agreed to provide deutsche bahn with 650 million euro -lrb- $ 638 million -rrb- to rebuild its network and repair damaged train stations .
more than half the money had already been earmarked for transportation infrastructure development projects in the eastern states that were formerly part of east germany .
deutsche bahn said its first reconstruction priorities would be lines in the leipzig-dresden-chemnitz triangle .
a line connecting dresden with prague will also be rebuilt as quickly as possible .
mehdorn said there are currently no plans to cancel any proposed deutsche bahn projects – including the planned transrapid train line between dortmund and düsseldorf .

for years , the agency has put members of extremist organizations , often leaders , on its payroll in an effort to get a better grasp of the activities of these groups .
in recent years , it has used information culled from informants to build its federal constitutional court case to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
however , subsequent revelations about the relationship between the agency and its informants have jeopardized the npd ban petition and led critics to ask whether it has gone over the line in nurturing such relationships .
" this bullet is for you " the latest twist involves mirko h. , a neo-nazi from the state of saxony who has been working as an informant for the office of the protection of the constitution since the mid-1990s .
it has been alleged that during his time on the agency 's payroll , he also produced thousands of copies of a cd by the band white aryan rebels called " notes of hate , " containing nazi lyrics that are banned in germany .
the song " this bullet is for you " includes a death threat against the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , michel friedman , and other german politicians .

a report in the current issue of " focus , " a national newsweekly , alleged that the office of the protection of the constitution was aware of mirko h. 's involvement in the creation of the cd and still continued to work with him without stopping its production .
the newsweekly reported he earned more than 105,000 euro from the hate-filled lp .

the company saw the tracks of some of its main lines near dresden get washed away , train stations flooded and the collapse of crucial bridges , including one on a high-speed rail line connecting northern and southern germany .
appearing at the chancellery in berlin on wednesday , deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn issued a preliminary estimate of over one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in flood damages .
" according to our cautious first estimates , we believe we have suffered revenue losses and damages of 1.025 billion euro , " mehdorn said .
he stressed that this would not be the final damage sum .
a laundry list of damages more than 400 kilometers of deutsche bahn tracks are currently unusable , and 94 bridges and 200 train stations have been badly damaged .
early estimates suggest that the service outages alone will lead to a 90 million euro -lrb- $ 88 million -rrb- drop in revenue from passenger and freight services .
mehdorn said it would take two and a half years before deutsche bahn service could return to its pre-flood level in the region .
the federal government has already agreed to provide deutsche bahn with 650 million euro -lrb- $ 638 million -rrb- to rebuild its network and repair damaged train stations .
more than half the money had already been earmarked for transportation infrastructure development projects in the eastern states that were formerly part of east germany .
deutsche bahn said its first reconstruction priorities would be lines in the leipzig-dresden-chemnitz triangle .
a line connecting dresden with prague will also be rebuilt as quickly as possible .
mehdorn said there are currently no plans to cancel any proposed deutsche bahn projects – including the planned transrapid train line between dortmund and düsseldorf .
new priorities , however , could lead to delays , he warned .
a job-saving deal as part of a four-point " immediate aid " program , the government also reached an agreement with deutsche bahn and the transnet union that the company would not lay off any employees between now and 2006 as a result of the flooding .
until this week 's agreement , talks between the employees ' union and bahn had reached an impasse .
mehdorn said deutsche bahn will reintroduce regular long-distance train service in the state of saxony-anhalt on thursday and is working on a plan to reintroduce long-distance trains in saxony as quickly as possible .
agricultural damage estimated at 267 million euro separately , german consumer protection and agricultural minister renate künast announced the government would release 141 million euro -lrb- $ 138 million -rrb- between now and the end of the year in immediate aid to farmers struck by the flooding .
künast said the government is estimating an initial 267 million euro -lrb- $ 262 million -rrb- in damages to farms .
but the government has not yet added damages to farm buildings to its estimate . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting deutsche bahn back on track after floods germany 's main railway company , deutsche bahn , estimates flood damage to the country 's railway network will reach " tens of billion euro " .

but stoiber and schröder succeeded in piquing interest in what had until now been a sleepy election . going into sunday night 's debate against edmund stoiber , gerhard schröder already had a huge disadvantage – as the four-year chancellor of germany , he found himself in a defensive position .
it was a fundamental weakness that challenger stoiber , the premier of bavaria , put to his advantage in a series of forceful attacks against the chancellor covering the most important issues of the election , making the anticipated event feel like a political soccer match .
the most contentious exchanges revolved around spiraling unemployment , a stagnant economy , tax reforms , immigration and germany 's stance on a possible iraq invasion – all dominant issues in the media during the days and weeks leading up to the first debate .
the keyword of the night seemed to be " failure , " of which both candidates repeatedly accused the other of on each key issue .
the debate , which is being called a " duel " here , was broadcast by the private television stations rtl and sat.1.
schröder taken to task for soaring unemployment in one of the most aggressive salvos of the evening , stoiber blamed germany 's high unemployment level of over four million on the current red-green government , led by schröder 's social democrats and the greens .
he said schröder had failed in his promise to reduce unemployment levels to fewer than 3.5 million people .
he criticized schröder for his plan to delay a tax cut scheduled for 2003 in order to fund the rebuilding of communities ravaged this summer by the biggest floods in a hundred years .
he said the government made a " mistake " by instituting tax reforms that did nothing to help what he described as the " most important " part of the german economy : small- to middle-sized businesses .
" we ca n't forget that the center of gravity of our labor market is dependent on the ...
german market .
we have only a relatively small share of exports to america .
other countries , like england , france , sweden , finland and spain have the same international ties , but they do n't have the dramatically growing number of unemployed or such a weak economic growth rate . "
schröder conceded he was disappointed by germany 's unemployment rate , but fought back by saying it was the result of the global economic downturn and not a homemade problem as stoiber had suggested .
as for the delayed tax cut , he said , " i 'm convinced that the people of this country understand that today 's damage ca n't be compensated for with debts that our children and grandchildren will then have to pay . "
how full is the ship ?
addressing immigration , stoiber said he thought it was " wrong for germany to have a law that provides for more immigration . "
he said that every year germany takes in 500,000 to 600,000 new immigrants - the equivalent of cities like dortmund or nuremburg .
he said the new immigration law would increase that number by 100,000 to 150,000 .
" we are n't even finished assimilating the foreigner children who are already here .
we need to do a lot more .
for that reason we should n't increase immigration , " he said .
schröder defended his government 's new law , passed in march , saying it both limited immigration in areas where it is n't needed while at the same time opening doors for highly skilled workers who are needed in the technology sector .
while stoiber 's numbers were correct , he said , he had omitted the annual outflow of several hundred thousand – refugees of countries once torn by civil war , for example .
when you add those figures in , he said , the increase is more like 100,000 people .
stoiber : schröder 's iraq position " irresponsible " schröder also found himself on the defensive on the subject of a possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
recently , schröder has alluded that the u.s. was planning to engage in " military adventurism , " and said that germany would not participate , even under a united nations mandate .
on sunday night , however , schröder sought to draw a line between his stances on u.n. efforts to get weapons inspectors back inside baghdad and the u.s. ' desire to topple saddam hussein 's regime .
" in light of the situation in the middle east , and considering the fact that we have n't conquered the taliban and are far from having rebuilt afghanistan , a military intervention in iraq is wrong , and for that reason , under my leadership , germany will not help in that effort , " the chancellor said .
stoiber , meanwhile , called schröder 's public statements on the issue , and his stance , " irresponsible . "
he specifically criticized schröder for saying the country must go the " german way , " a phrase he said had historically charged connotations - at least in the ears of the international community .
he also said schröder 's public statements and policy reduced some of the international pressure on hussein .
" with saddam hussein , you have a war criminal as head of government , a head of state who possesses weapons of mass destruction and has even used them against his own people and those in neighboring iran .
we need to do everything we can , make every diplomatic effort , apply as much political pressure " as is needed to get un inspectors back inside iraq , stoiber said .
he said the chancellor should n't be ruling out every " theoretical option . "
stalemate so who won ?
the jury ca n't seem to make up its mind .
immediately after the debate , the editor in chief of the newsweekly " der spiegel , " stefan aust , said he " did n't get the impression he -lrb- schröder -rrb- was the media chancellor .
he could have done better . "
aust even accused him of putting his german television audience to sleep .
but polls taken of viewers sunday night were all over the board .
a forsa institute poll for sat.1 put schröder ahead .
another , by pollster wahlen for public broadcaster zdf had stoiber ahead by two points .
but another , by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard put schröder far ahead of his bavarian challenger .
in editorials published in the monday editions , many major regional newspapers shied away from declaring a victor .
the mass-circulation " bild " described german voters as the victors for even taking an interest in the debate .
the " berliner zeitung , " meanwhile , described it as a duel that had neither a conqueror nor someone who had been conquered .
indeed , if a television debate were analogous to soccer , you might say that stoiber controlled the ball for much of the game – e.g. he steered the issues and went in with the most attacks – but neither candidate , it seemed , scored many goals . and that 's too bad considering that in germany 's first ever television debate there was no provision for penalty shots . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery read everything you need to know about the politicians , parties and hot-button issues , along with a dummy 's guide to the german political system , as germans head for the polls for national elections on september 22 .

but stoiber and schröder succeeded in piquing interest in what had until now been a sleepy election . going into sunday night 's debate against edmund stoiber , gerhard schröder already had a huge disadvantage – as the four-year chancellor of germany , he found himself in a defensive position .
it was a fundamental weakness that challenger stoiber , the premier of bavaria , put to his advantage in a series of forceful attacks against the chancellor covering the most important issues of the election , making the anticipated event feel like a political soccer match .
the most contentious exchanges revolved around spiraling unemployment , a stagnant economy , tax reforms , immigration and germany 's stance on a possible iraq invasion – all dominant issues in the media during the days and weeks leading up to the first debate .
the keyword of the night seemed to be " failure , " of which both candidates repeatedly accused the other of on each key issue .
the debate , which is being called a " duel " here , was broadcast by the private television stations rtl and sat.1.
schröder taken to task for soaring unemployment in one of the most aggressive salvos of the evening , stoiber blamed germany 's high unemployment level of over four million on the current red-green government , led by schröder 's social democrats and the greens .
he said schröder had failed in his promise to reduce unemployment levels to fewer than 3.5 million people .
he criticized schröder for his plan to delay a tax cut scheduled for 2003 in order to fund the rebuilding of communities ravaged this summer by the biggest floods in a hundred years .
he said the government made a " mistake " by instituting tax reforms that did nothing to help what he described as the " most important " part of the german economy : small- to middle-sized businesses .
" we ca n't forget that the center of gravity of our labor market is dependent on the ...
german market .
we have only a relatively small share of exports to america .
other countries , like england , france , sweden , finland and spain have the same international ties , but they do n't have the dramatically growing number of unemployed or such a weak economic growth rate . "
schröder conceded he was disappointed by germany 's unemployment rate , but fought back by saying it was the result of the global economic downturn and not a homemade problem as stoiber had suggested .
as for the delayed tax cut , he said , " i 'm convinced that the people of this country understand that today 's damage ca n't be compensated for with debts that our children and grandchildren will then have to pay . "
how full is the ship ?
addressing immigration , stoiber said he thought it was " wrong for germany to have a law that provides for more immigration . "
he said that every year germany takes in 500,000 to 600,000 new immigrants - the equivalent of cities like dortmund or nuremburg .
he said the new immigration law would increase that number by 100,000 to 150,000 .
" we are n't even finished assimilating the foreigner children who are already here .
we need to do a lot more .
for that reason we should n't increase immigration , " he said .
schröder defended his government 's new law , passed in march , saying it both limited immigration in areas where it is n't needed while at the same time opening doors for highly skilled workers who are needed in the technology sector .
while stoiber 's numbers were correct , he said , he had omitted the annual outflow of several hundred thousand – refugees of countries once torn by civil war , for example .
when you add those figures in , he said , the increase is more like 100,000 people .
stoiber : schröder 's iraq position " irresponsible " schröder also found himself on the defensive on the subject of a possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
recently , schröder has alluded that the u.s. was planning to engage in " military adventurism , " and said that germany would not participate , even under a united nations mandate .
on sunday night , however , schröder sought to draw a line between his stances on u.n. efforts to get weapons inspectors back inside baghdad and the u.s. ' desire to topple saddam hussein 's regime .
" in light of the situation in the middle east , and considering the fact that we have n't conquered the taliban and are far from having rebuilt afghanistan , a military intervention in iraq is wrong , and for that reason , under my leadership , germany will not help in that effort , " the chancellor said .
stoiber , meanwhile , called schröder 's public statements on the issue , and his stance , " irresponsible . "
he specifically criticized schröder for saying the country must go the " german way , " a phrase he said had historically charged connotations - at least in the ears of the international community .
he also said schröder 's public statements and policy reduced some of the international pressure on hussein .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : environment matters german minister keeps his faith in upcoming earth summit on the green road from rio to johannesburg steering environmental issues back on the political agenda world summit opens with eu , us at odds germany -pipe- 03.09.2002 johannesburg nets fisheries agreement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overfishing is affecting more than 70 percent of the world 's commercially important fish in the first substantive agreement at the earth summit in johannesburg , delegates agreed on a plan to try and protect the world 's diminishing fish stocks .
the pact calls for reducing catches to sustainable levels . a deal was struck late tuesday night in johannesburg , aiming to replenish the world ’ s overfished waters by 2015 and head off a looming fisheries crisis .
it ’ s the first concrete target date set at this summit where 200 nations have gathered to come up with an action plan to reduce world poverty without destroying the environment .
environmentalists , who have been highly critical of the summit for its reluctance to set definite targets for reform , welcomed the fisheries plan , calling it a welcome advance . “ it ’ s pleasing that they have reached agreement on oceans , ” sian pullen of the environmental group wwf told reuters .
“ we would have liked it to be more progressive but it ’ s good compared to some of the other issues which may be going backwards . ”
catching fewer fish the plan calls for reducing fish catches to levels where the maximum sustainable yield can be taken indefinitely .
it gives governments a deadline of 2015 to restore fish stocks to sustainable levels .
that could entail enacting temporary fishing bans in some areas or setting up permanent no-fishing zones to preserve breeding grounds .
according to the united nations , more than 25 percent of the world ’ s commercially important fish stocks are overexploited and 50 percent are being fished to full capacity .
after pressure from the us , delegates agreed add a clause stating that fish levels should be replenished “ where possible . ”
the americans argued some stocks , such as cod on the grand banks of canada ’ s eastern seaboard , are thought to have already been fished beyond recovery .
enforcement questions while the agreement has buoyed delegates ’ spirits , some environmentalists question whether the agreement can be enforeced against pirate trawlers .
for example , the fish stocks off of mozambique , south africa ’ s neighbor , have been reduced by more than 70 percent in the last decade , thanks largely to fleets of chinese and tanzanian fishermen who invade mozambican waters and dynamite all species .
they come to the waters off the island nation because they have exhausted the stocks in their own waters .
“ -lrb- the agreement -rrb- does recognize the need for enforcement but it doesn ’ t say how it ’ s going to be done .

the company saw the tracks of some of its main lines near dresden get washed away , train stations flooded and the collapse of crucial bridges , including one on a high-speed rail line connecting northern and southern germany .
appearing at the chancellery in berlin on wednesday , deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn issued a preliminary estimate of over one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in flood damages .
" according to our cautious first estimates , we believe we have suffered revenue losses and damages of 1.025 billion euro , " mehdorn said .
he stressed that this would not be the final damage sum .
a laundry list of damages more than 400 kilometers of deutsche bahn tracks are currently unusable , and 94 bridges and 200 train stations have been badly damaged .
early estimates suggest that the service outages alone will lead to a 90 million euro -lrb- $ 88 million -rrb- drop in revenue from passenger and freight services .
mehdorn said it would take two and a half years before deutsche bahn service could return to its pre-flood level in the region .
the federal government has already agreed to provide deutsche bahn with 650 million euro -lrb- $ 638 million -rrb- to rebuild its network and repair damaged train stations .
more than half the money had already been earmarked for transportation infrastructure development projects in the eastern states that were formerly part of east germany .
deutsche bahn said its first reconstruction priorities would be lines in the leipzig-dresden-chemnitz triangle .
a line connecting dresden with prague will also be rebuilt as quickly as possible .
mehdorn said there are currently no plans to cancel any proposed deutsche bahn projects – including the planned transrapid train line between dortmund and düsseldorf .
new priorities , however , could lead to delays , he warned .
a job-saving deal as part of a four-point " immediate aid " program , the government also reached an agreement with deutsche bahn and the transnet union that the company would not lay off any employees between now and 2006 as a result of the flooding .
until this week 's agreement , talks between the employees ' union and bahn had reached an impasse .
mehdorn said deutsche bahn will reintroduce regular long-distance train service in the state of saxony-anhalt on thursday and is working on a plan to reintroduce long-distance trains in saxony as quickly as possible .
agricultural damage estimated at 267 million euro separately , german consumer protection and agricultural minister renate künast announced the government would release 141 million euro -lrb- $ 138 million -rrb- between now and the end of the year in immediate aid to farmers struck by the flooding .
künast said the government is estimating an initial 267 million euro -lrb- $ 262 million -rrb- in damages to farms .
but the government has not yet added damages to farm buildings to its estimate . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting deutsche bahn back on track after floods germany 's main railway company , deutsche bahn , estimates flood damage to the country 's railway network will reach " tens of billion euro " .

developing countries are calling for more aid commitments and debt relief from the industrialized west .
according to oxfam international 's policy advisor penny fowler , they are also urging western nations to drop their agricultural subsidies and tariffs that prevent them from accessing western markets .
trade is one of the most critical - and contentious - issues with industrialized nations at the summit , says fowler .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.09.2002 lots of touchés , but no clear winner in german debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both failed to score many goals in germany 's first televised chancellor debate there was no clear winner in germany 's first televised debate between chancellor candidates on sunday night .
but stoiber and schröder succeeded in piquing interest in what had until now been a sleepy election . going into sunday night 's debate against edmund stoiber , gerhard schröder already had a huge disadvantage – as the four-year chancellor of germany , he found himself in a defensive position .
it was a fundamental weakness that challenger stoiber , the premier of bavaria , put to his advantage in a series of forceful attacks against the chancellor covering the most important issues of the election , making the anticipated event feel like a political soccer match .
the most contentious exchanges revolved around spiraling unemployment , a stagnant economy , tax reforms , immigration and germany 's stance on a possible iraq invasion – all dominant issues in the media during the days and weeks leading up to the first debate .
the keyword of the night seemed to be " failure , " of which both candidates repeatedly accused the other of on each key issue .
the debate , which is being called a " duel " here , was broadcast by the private television stations rtl and sat.1.
schröder taken to task for soaring unemployment in one of the most aggressive salvos of the evening , stoiber blamed germany 's high unemployment level of over four million on the current red-green government , led by schröder 's social democrats and the greens .
he said schröder had failed in his promise to reduce unemployment levels to fewer than 3.5 million people .
he criticized schröder for his plan to delay a tax cut scheduled for 2003 in order to fund the rebuilding of communities ravaged this summer by the biggest floods in a hundred years .
he said the government made a " mistake " by instituting tax reforms that did nothing to help what he described as the " most important " part of the german economy : small- to middle-sized businesses .
" we ca n't forget that the center of gravity of our labor market is dependent on the ...
german market .
we have only a relatively small share of exports to america .
other countries , like england , france , sweden , finland and spain have the same international ties , but they do n't have the dramatically growing number of unemployed or such a weak economic growth rate . "
schröder conceded he was disappointed by germany 's unemployment rate , but fought back by saying it was the result of the global economic downturn and not a homemade problem as stoiber had suggested .
as for the delayed tax cut , he said , " i 'm convinced that the people of this country understand that today 's damage ca n't be compensated for with debts that our children and grandchildren will then have to pay . "
how full is the ship ?
addressing immigration , stoiber said he thought it was " wrong for germany to have a law that provides for more immigration . "
he said that every year germany takes in 500,000 to 600,000 new immigrants - the equivalent of cities like dortmund or nuremburg .
he said the new immigration law would increase that number by 100,000 to 150,000 .
" we are n't even finished assimilating the foreigner children who are already here .
we need to do a lot more .
for that reason we should n't increase immigration , " he said .
schröder defended his government 's new law , passed in march , saying it both limited immigration in areas where it is n't needed while at the same time opening doors for highly skilled workers who are needed in the technology sector .
while stoiber 's numbers were correct , he said , he had omitted the annual outflow of several hundred thousand – refugees of countries once torn by civil war , for example .
when you add those figures in , he said , the increase is more like 100,000 people .
stoiber : schröder 's iraq position " irresponsible " schröder also found himself on the defensive on the subject of a possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
recently , schröder has alluded that the u.s. was planning to engage in " military adventurism , " and said that germany would not participate , even under a united nations mandate .
on sunday night , however , schröder sought to draw a line between his stances on u.n. efforts to get weapons inspectors back inside baghdad and the u.s. ' desire to topple saddam hussein 's regime .
" in light of the situation in the middle east , and considering the fact that we have n't conquered the taliban and are far from having rebuilt afghanistan , a military intervention in iraq is wrong , and for that reason , under my leadership , germany will not help in that effort , " the chancellor said .
stoiber , meanwhile , called schröder 's public statements on the issue , and his stance , " irresponsible . "
he specifically criticized schröder for saying the country must go the " german way , " a phrase he said had historically charged connotations - at least in the ears of the international community .
he also said schröder 's public statements and policy reduced some of the international pressure on hussein .
" with saddam hussein , you have a war criminal as head of government , a head of state who possesses weapons of mass destruction and has even used them against his own people and those in neighboring iran .
we need to do everything we can , make every diplomatic effort , apply as much political pressure " as is needed to get un inspectors back inside iraq , stoiber said .
he said the chancellor should n't be ruling out every " theoretical option . "
stalemate so who won ?
the jury ca n't seem to make up its mind .
immediately after the debate , the editor in chief of the newsweekly " der spiegel , " stefan aust , said he " did n't get the impression he -lrb- schröder -rrb- was the media chancellor .
he could have done better . "
aust even accused him of putting his german television audience to sleep .
but polls taken of viewers sunday night were all over the board .
a forsa institute poll for sat.1 put schröder ahead .
another , by pollster wahlen for public broadcaster zdf had stoiber ahead by two points .
but another , by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard put schröder far ahead of his bavarian challenger .
in editorials published in the monday editions , many major regional newspapers shied away from declaring a victor .
the mass-circulation " bild " described german voters as the victors for even taking an interest in the debate .
the " berliner zeitung , " meanwhile , described it as a duel that had neither a conqueror nor someone who had been conquered .
indeed , if a television debate were analogous to soccer , you might say that stoiber controlled the ball for much of the game – e.g. he steered the issues and went in with the most attacks – but neither candidate , it seemed , scored many goals . and that 's too bad considering that in germany 's first ever television debate there was no provision for penalty shots . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery read everything you need to know about the politicians , parties and hot-button issues , along with a dummy 's guide to the german political system , as germans head for the polls for national elections on september 22 .

the pact calls for reducing catches to sustainable levels . a deal was struck late tuesday night in johannesburg , aiming to replenish the world ’ s overfished waters by 2015 and head off a looming fisheries crisis .
it ’ s the first concrete target date set at this summit where 200 nations have gathered to come up with an action plan to reduce world poverty without destroying the environment .
environmentalists , who have been highly critical of the summit for its reluctance to set definite targets for reform , welcomed the fisheries plan , calling it a welcome advance . “ it ’ s pleasing that they have reached agreement on oceans , ” sian pullen of the environmental group wwf told reuters .
“ we would have liked it to be more progressive but it ’ s good compared to some of the other issues which may be going backwards . ”
catching fewer fish the plan calls for reducing fish catches to levels where the maximum sustainable yield can be taken indefinitely .
it gives governments a deadline of 2015 to restore fish stocks to sustainable levels .
that could entail enacting temporary fishing bans in some areas or setting up permanent no-fishing zones to preserve breeding grounds .
according to the united nations , more than 25 percent of the world ’ s commercially important fish stocks are overexploited and 50 percent are being fished to full capacity .
after pressure from the us , delegates agreed add a clause stating that fish levels should be replenished “ where possible . ”
the americans argued some stocks , such as cod on the grand banks of canada ’ s eastern seaboard , are thought to have already been fished beyond recovery .
enforcement questions while the agreement has buoyed delegates ’ spirits , some environmentalists question whether the agreement can be enforeced against pirate trawlers .
for example , the fish stocks off of mozambique , south africa ’ s neighbor , have been reduced by more than 70 percent in the last decade , thanks largely to fleets of chinese and tanzanian fishermen who invade mozambican waters and dynamite all species .
they come to the waters off the island nation because they have exhausted the stocks in their own waters .
“ -lrb- the agreement -rrb- does recognize the need for enforcement but it doesn ’ t say how it ’ s going to be done .
it ’ s a major issue and not one that ’ s been adequately addressed , ” said the wwf ’ s sian pullen .
like the other parts of the action plan that heads of state are due to approve when they come to the summit finale next week , the fisheries agreement is not legally binding .
proponents hope however that it will form a moral basis for action and keep governments under pressure from the public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes radical reforms on fishing a disputed plan to reform eu fishing would remove thousands of fishing vessels from european seas in an attempt to save threatened fish stocks and create a sustainable industry .

11 : one year later fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany current affairs -pipe- 03.09.2002 terrorism fears a no show in german elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the american embassy in berlin after september 11 almost a year after the sept .
11 attacks , terrorism has vanished from the political agenda in germany .
experts say time and other issues have pushed the topic from voters ' minds . in the months following sept .
11 , germans couldn ’ t get enough tough talk on terrorism . the realization that the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon were most likely planned in hamburg , sent shockwaves through the country and , as a result , through the political establishment as well . the government was quick to react : interior minister otto schily prepared two “ security packages ” that expanded the reach and financing of germany ’ s law enforcement and got them past the legislature within a quick few months . germans rewarded their government ’ s tough talk on terrorism with high approval ratings and observers wondered at the speed and solidarity with which berlin was operating . now , just weeks before the attacks ’ anniversary , terrorism has all but escaped from the voters ’ minds , and , as a result , the political agenda .
in the midst of a hard-fought election campaign , germany ’ s recent floods , the high unemployment rate and slumping economy have grabbed the headlines , pushing aside concern over the spread of islamic fundamentalism and terror cells in the country . the reasons , say experts , have to do with both the time lapse since sept .
11 and the zero tolerance image chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has presented since then .
the speed with which the government moved to pass anti-terrorism measures and assure germans their country was safe was enough to allay fears relatively quickly , said jochen hippler , political scientist at the university of duisberg . quick enough to calm fears “ in a sense , the internal security situation , at least unofficially , has never been deemed so dangerous , “ said hippler .
“ it would have been different if the government had been more loose in its words and actions . ” there is also little difference in the way both schröder ’ s social democratic party and his challenger , edmund stoiber and his christian democratic and christian social union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- bloc , approach the anti-terrorism fight . the cdu / csu and spd look at foreign policy and domestic security in the same context .
the union bloc argues that instability on german soil is often connected to instablity caused by a country ’ s foreign policy .
the red-green coalition says that many of the union ’ s suggestions , such as increased cooperation between immigration and police authorities , have already been put into place . even schily ’ s challenger in the union bloc , hard-line bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , grudgingly admires the former green party member ’ s tough stance on domestic security .
“ schily and i went to the same school , ” beckstein has told reporters in the past . as a result , campaign managers on both sides , eager to play up differences between the cdu / csu and spd , have pushed more divisive issues further up the agenda . law enforcement wants terrorism back on the agenda the absence of terrorism in today ’ s political agenda has made it difficult for at least one interested bloc : the country ’ s law enforcement lobby .
since interest in domestic security died down , police lobbyist rüdiger holecek has had a difficult time bringing complaints of underfunding and staffing to the government ’ s attention . holecek , of the country ’ s police union , says that the government ’ s domestic security plan has overstretched an already overburdened police force .
more officers have been recruited into the country ’ s federal domestic security agency , the verfassungschutz , without enough money being left over for adequate replacements . “ we ’ re suffering as a result of this inattention , ” holecek told dw-world . the group , which represents the interests of more than 190 000 officers in germany , plans to call attention to itself during a press conference on sept .
11 .
at the conference the union will present a handbook on terrorist activity in germany .
holecek is hoping people will take notice . “ we want to prevent this topic from sinking out of view of the political , ” establishment , he said . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.09.2002 government under fire for neo-nazi informants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : explosive combination : neo-nazi informants and hate music in the latest scandal involving the domestic intelligence agency 's use of informants , reports allege the government looked the other way as two extremist spooks produced a cd inciting the murder of prominent german jews . on thursday , the domestic affairs committee of the german parliament , the bundestag , will convene to debate the use of informants from right-wing extremist and neo-nazi groups by the federal office for the protection of the constitution , germany 's domestic intelligence agency .
for years , the agency has put members of extremist organizations , often leaders , on its payroll in an effort to get a better grasp of the activities of these groups .
in recent years , it has used information culled from informants to build its federal constitutional court case to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
however , subsequent revelations about the relationship between the agency and its informants have jeopardized the npd ban petition and led critics to ask whether it has gone over the line in nurturing such relationships .
" this bullet is for you " the latest twist involves mirko h. , a neo-nazi from the state of saxony who has been working as an informant for the office of the protection of the constitution since the mid-1990s .
it has been alleged that during his time on the agency 's payroll , he also produced thousands of copies of a cd by the band white aryan rebels called " notes of hate , " containing nazi lyrics that are banned in germany .
the song " this bullet is for you " includes a death threat against the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , michel friedman , and other german politicians .
the album , chilling in its unabashed xenophobia , also includes calls for the killing of mo asumang , a popular german erotic television star of ghanian ancestry .
the second informant implicated in the scandal is toni s. , a neo-nazi from the eastern german city of cottbus who worked for the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of brandenburg .
toni s. is currently in investigative police custody as his relationship with the white aryan rebels is probed .
the dresden public prosecutors ' office , meanwhile , has filed a criminal case against mirko h. for his role in the production and distribution of the cd .
what did the government know , and when ?
a report in the current issue of " focus , " a national newsweekly , alleged that the office of the protection of the constitution was aware of mirko h. 's involvement in the creation of the cd and still continued to work with him without stopping its production .
the newsweekly reported he earned more than 105,000 euro from the hate-filled lp .
the article also accused the federal interior ministry of withhold from the secret service committee of parliament the information that mirko h. had been convicted of illegal weapons possession and incitement in 2001 .
the interior ministry has denied the charge .
still , that does n't make it easier for the celebrities threatened in " notes of hate , " to sleep at night .
" i 'm shaken and feel less secure by the idea that security authorities have become a part of the threat , " michel friedman told the berlin newspaper " tagesspiegel , " in its wednesday edition .
" this ca n't be accepted by the government . "
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union are calling for immediate answers from the interior ministry and the government .
" in the face of the dramatic events in this informant scandal , we expect that the interior minister will provide answers , " the deputy head of the union bloc 's parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , told the " berliner zeitung " newspaper .
" he has to tell us what he knew about the informant , what the interior ministry knew , who carries the political responsibility and what conclusions should be drawn . "
criticism from within concern is also growing inside the government .
christian ströbele , a green member of parliament , told the same paper he believed the situation must be clarified before the sept .
22 federal elections .
ströbele said he believed the latest incident was just " one more example of the questionable methods of the office for the protection of the constitution . "
where do you draw the line , he asked , between activities right-wing extremists have developed themselves and those that have been inspired and financed by the office for the protection of the constitution ?
" you have to ask yourself whether some -lrb- authorities from the office -rrb- are doing more to endanger our constitution than to protect it , " ströbele said .
a growing informant scandal the neo-nazi cd scandal is only the latest gaffe for the office of the protection of the constitution in its use of extremist informants who are still active .
the constitutional court temporarily suspended the government 's case to ban the npd in january after it learned a key member of the right-wing extremist party 's leadership had at one point served as an informant for the domestic intelligence agency 's investigation , which laid the foundations for the ban petition .
the court learned that part of the government 's case had been gleaned from wolfgang frenz , an npd official and witness for the defense who had worked as an informant for the north rhine-westphalia state office for the protection of the constitution .
days later , it learned that udo holtmann , head of the npd 's state chapter in north rhine-westphalia , had also aided in the government 's case .
the government has said it must rely on unidentified informants in such cases because it is their best hope to gain intelligence on the groups .

for years , the agency has put members of extremist organizations , often leaders , on its payroll in an effort to get a better grasp of the activities of these groups .
in recent years , it has used information culled from informants to build its federal constitutional court case to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
however , subsequent revelations about the relationship between the agency and its informants have jeopardized the npd ban petition and led critics to ask whether it has gone over the line in nurturing such relationships .
" this bullet is for you " the latest twist involves mirko h. , a neo-nazi from the state of saxony who has been working as an informant for the office of the protection of the constitution since the mid-1990s .
it has been alleged that during his time on the agency 's payroll , he also produced thousands of copies of a cd by the band white aryan rebels called " notes of hate , " containing nazi lyrics that are banned in germany .
the song " this bullet is for you " includes a death threat against the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , michel friedman , and other german politicians .
the album , chilling in its unabashed xenophobia , also includes calls for the killing of mo asumang , a popular german erotic television star of ghanian ancestry .
the second informant implicated in the scandal is toni s. , a neo-nazi from the eastern german city of cottbus who worked for the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of brandenburg .
toni s. is currently in investigative police custody as his relationship with the white aryan rebels is probed .
the dresden public prosecutors ' office , meanwhile , has filed a criminal case against mirko h. for his role in the production and distribution of the cd .
what did the government know , and when ?
a report in the current issue of " focus , " a national newsweekly , alleged that the office of the protection of the constitution was aware of mirko h. 's involvement in the creation of the cd and still continued to work with him without stopping its production .
the newsweekly reported he earned more than 105,000 euro from the hate-filled lp .
the article also accused the federal interior ministry of withhold from the secret service committee of parliament the information that mirko h. had been convicted of illegal weapons possession and incitement in 2001 .
the interior ministry has denied the charge .
still , that does n't make it easier for the celebrities threatened in " notes of hate , " to sleep at night .
" i 'm shaken and feel less secure by the idea that security authorities have become a part of the threat , " michel friedman told the berlin newspaper " tagesspiegel , " in its wednesday edition .
" this ca n't be accepted by the government . "
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union are calling for immediate answers from the interior ministry and the government .
" in the face of the dramatic events in this informant scandal , we expect that the interior minister will provide answers , " the deputy head of the union bloc 's parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , told the " berliner zeitung " newspaper .
" he has to tell us what he knew about the informant , what the interior ministry knew , who carries the political responsibility and what conclusions should be drawn . "
criticism from within concern is also growing inside the government .
christian ströbele , a green member of parliament , told the same paper he believed the situation must be clarified before the sept .
22 federal elections .
ströbele said he believed the latest incident was just " one more example of the questionable methods of the office for the protection of the constitution . "
where do you draw the line , he asked , between activities right-wing extremists have developed themselves and those that have been inspired and financed by the office for the protection of the constitution ?
" you have to ask yourself whether some -lrb- authorities from the office -rrb- are doing more to endanger our constitution than to protect it , " ströbele said .
a growing informant scandal the neo-nazi cd scandal is only the latest gaffe for the office of the protection of the constitution in its use of extremist informants who are still active .
the constitutional court temporarily suspended the government 's case to ban the npd in january after it learned a key member of the right-wing extremist party 's leadership had at one point served as an informant for the domestic intelligence agency 's investigation , which laid the foundations for the ban petition .
the court learned that part of the government 's case had been gleaned from wolfgang frenz , an npd official and witness for the defense who had worked as an informant for the north rhine-westphalia state office for the protection of the constitution .
days later , it learned that udo holtmann , head of the npd 's state chapter in north rhine-westphalia , had also aided in the government 's case .
the government has said it must rely on unidentified informants in such cases because it is their best hope to gain intelligence on the groups .
on thursday , the practice will be put under the microscope of the bundestag , where more than a handful of politicians have already said they will question the government practice . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new problems for case against far-right party ?

in the midst of a hard-fought election campaign , germany ’ s recent floods , the high unemployment rate and slumping economy have grabbed the headlines , pushing aside concern over the spread of islamic fundamentalism and terror cells in the country . the reasons , say experts , have to do with both the time lapse since sept .

the union bloc argues that instability on german soil is often connected to instablity caused by a country ’ s foreign policy .
the red-green coalition says that many of the union ’ s suggestions , such as increased cooperation between immigration and police authorities , have already been put into place . even schily ’ s challenger in the union bloc , hard-line bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , grudgingly admires the former green party member ’ s tough stance on domestic security .
“ schily and i went to the same school , ” beckstein has told reporters in the past . as a result , campaign managers on both sides , eager to play up differences between the cdu / csu and spd , have pushed more divisive issues further up the agenda . law enforcement wants terrorism back on the agenda the absence of terrorism in today ’ s political agenda has made it difficult for at least one interested bloc : the country ’ s law enforcement lobby .

the pact calls for reducing catches to sustainable levels . a deal was struck late tuesday night in johannesburg , aiming to replenish the world ’ s overfished waters by 2015 and head off a looming fisheries crisis .
it ’ s the first concrete target date set at this summit where 200 nations have gathered to come up with an action plan to reduce world poverty without destroying the environment .
environmentalists , who have been highly critical of the summit for its reluctance to set definite targets for reform , welcomed the fisheries plan , calling it a welcome advance . “ it ’ s pleasing that they have reached agreement on oceans , ” sian pullen of the environmental group wwf told reuters .
“ we would have liked it to be more progressive but it ’ s good compared to some of the other issues which may be going backwards . ”
catching fewer fish the plan calls for reducing fish catches to levels where the maximum sustainable yield can be taken indefinitely .
it gives governments a deadline of 2015 to restore fish stocks to sustainable levels .
that could entail enacting temporary fishing bans in some areas or setting up permanent no-fishing zones to preserve breeding grounds .
according to the united nations , more than 25 percent of the world ’ s commercially important fish stocks are overexploited and 50 percent are being fished to full capacity .
after pressure from the us , delegates agreed add a clause stating that fish levels should be replenished “ where possible . ”
the americans argued some stocks , such as cod on the grand banks of canada ’ s eastern seaboard , are thought to have already been fished beyond recovery .
enforcement questions while the agreement has buoyed delegates ’ spirits , some environmentalists question whether the agreement can be enforeced against pirate trawlers .
for example , the fish stocks off of mozambique , south africa ’ s neighbor , have been reduced by more than 70 percent in the last decade , thanks largely to fleets of chinese and tanzanian fishermen who invade mozambican waters and dynamite all species .
they come to the waters off the island nation because they have exhausted the stocks in their own waters .
“ -lrb- the agreement -rrb- does recognize the need for enforcement but it doesn ’ t say how it ’ s going to be done .
it ’ s a major issue and not one that ’ s been adequately addressed , ” said the wwf ’ s sian pullen .
like the other parts of the action plan that heads of state are due to approve when they come to the summit finale next week , the fisheries agreement is not legally binding .
proponents hope however that it will form a moral basis for action and keep governments under pressure from the public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes radical reforms on fishing a disputed plan to reform eu fishing would remove thousands of fishing vessels from european seas in an attempt to save threatened fish stocks and create a sustainable industry .

developing countries are calling for more aid commitments and debt relief from the industrialized west .
according to oxfam international 's policy advisor penny fowler , they are also urging western nations to drop their agricultural subsidies and tariffs that prevent them from accessing western markets .
trade is one of the most critical - and contentious - issues with industrialized nations at the summit , says fowler .
" we want to see them committing to ending their unfair trade policies .
in particular , to stop putting pressure on developing countries to rapidly liberalize their economies in a way that does n't take account of the impact on poor people . "
no progress without change developed countries are currently pushing these policies , she says .
" at the same time , they 're hypocritically maintaining high levels of protection of their own economies and very high levels of subsidies to their own agricultural producers , for example , by dumping their agricultural surpluses on world markets . "
this had devastating impacts on the livelihoods of poor farmers in developing countries .
" unless those policies are changed , it 's very hard to see how this summit will make progress on promoting sustainable development , " says fowler .
although oxfam and other non-governmental organizations are busy spreading the word to delegates meeting in the marble-lined conference halls of sandton convention center , the message does n't seem to be getting through to the sessions behind closed doors .
both the european union and the united states are opposed to any new aid initiatives for developing nations , arguing that they want to stick to the proposals made in march at the international conference for development financing in monterrey , mexico .
valuable resources are necessary green groups have been criticized of focusing too much on environmental issues and preventing the world 's poor from having the same access to resources , such as energy and water .
but gordon shepherd , director of wwf international 's policy program , says renewable energy is a sustainable alternative .
" poor people are the ones who will suffer the most from climate change , " says shepherd .
" there are a large number of people not getting energy who need it . "
in his opinion , the renewable aspects need to be stressed at the summit .
" that is the way forward and the biodiversity and freshwater systems will suffer from climate change in the same way as people will , so the two are inextricably linked . "
environment groups in johannesburg are critical of the industrial countries ' argument that poverty can only be alleviated through economic growth and private investment .
they want tighter controls and more corporate accountability .
this issue is certain to dominate discussions over the next week . jennifer macey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de footing the development bill the proportion of gross national product that wealthy industrial nations spend on development has fallen over the past decades .

for years , the agency has put members of extremist organizations , often leaders , on its payroll in an effort to get a better grasp of the activities of these groups .
in recent years , it has used information culled from informants to build its federal constitutional court case to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
however , subsequent revelations about the relationship between the agency and its informants have jeopardized the npd ban petition and led critics to ask whether it has gone over the line in nurturing such relationships .
" this bullet is for you " the latest twist involves mirko h. , a neo-nazi from the state of saxony who has been working as an informant for the office of the protection of the constitution since the mid-1990s .
it has been alleged that during his time on the agency 's payroll , he also produced thousands of copies of a cd by the band white aryan rebels called " notes of hate , " containing nazi lyrics that are banned in germany .
the song " this bullet is for you " includes a death threat against the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , michel friedman , and other german politicians .
the album , chilling in its unabashed xenophobia , also includes calls for the killing of mo asumang , a popular german erotic television star of ghanian ancestry .
the second informant implicated in the scandal is toni s. , a neo-nazi from the eastern german city of cottbus who worked for the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of brandenburg .
toni s. is currently in investigative police custody as his relationship with the white aryan rebels is probed .
the dresden public prosecutors ' office , meanwhile , has filed a criminal case against mirko h. for his role in the production and distribution of the cd .
what did the government know , and when ?
a report in the current issue of " focus , " a national newsweekly , alleged that the office of the protection of the constitution was aware of mirko h. 's involvement in the creation of the cd and still continued to work with him without stopping its production .
the newsweekly reported he earned more than 105,000 euro from the hate-filled lp .
the article also accused the federal interior ministry of withhold from the secret service committee of parliament the information that mirko h. had been convicted of illegal weapons possession and incitement in 2001 .
the interior ministry has denied the charge .
still , that does n't make it easier for the celebrities threatened in " notes of hate , " to sleep at night .
" i 'm shaken and feel less secure by the idea that security authorities have become a part of the threat , " michel friedman told the berlin newspaper " tagesspiegel , " in its wednesday edition .
" this ca n't be accepted by the government . "
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union are calling for immediate answers from the interior ministry and the government .
" in the face of the dramatic events in this informant scandal , we expect that the interior minister will provide answers , " the deputy head of the union bloc 's parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , told the " berliner zeitung " newspaper .
" he has to tell us what he knew about the informant , what the interior ministry knew , who carries the political responsibility and what conclusions should be drawn . "
criticism from within concern is also growing inside the government .
christian ströbele , a green member of parliament , told the same paper he believed the situation must be clarified before the sept .
22 federal elections .
ströbele said he believed the latest incident was just " one more example of the questionable methods of the office for the protection of the constitution . "
where do you draw the line , he asked , between activities right-wing extremists have developed themselves and those that have been inspired and financed by the office for the protection of the constitution ?
" you have to ask yourself whether some -lrb- authorities from the office -rrb- are doing more to endanger our constitution than to protect it , " ströbele said .
a growing informant scandal the neo-nazi cd scandal is only the latest gaffe for the office of the protection of the constitution in its use of extremist informants who are still active .
the constitutional court temporarily suspended the government 's case to ban the npd in january after it learned a key member of the right-wing extremist party 's leadership had at one point served as an informant for the domestic intelligence agency 's investigation , which laid the foundations for the ban petition .
the court learned that part of the government 's case had been gleaned from wolfgang frenz , an npd official and witness for the defense who had worked as an informant for the north rhine-westphalia state office for the protection of the constitution .
days later , it learned that udo holtmann , head of the npd 's state chapter in north rhine-westphalia , had also aided in the government 's case .
the government has said it must rely on unidentified informants in such cases because it is their best hope to gain intelligence on the groups .
on thursday , the practice will be put under the microscope of the bundestag , where more than a handful of politicians have already said they will question the government practice . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new problems for case against far-right party ?

the song " this bullet is for you " includes a death threat against the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , michel friedman , and other german politicians .
the album , chilling in its unabashed xenophobia , also includes calls for the killing of mo asumang , a popular german erotic television star of ghanian ancestry .
the second informant implicated in the scandal is toni s. , a neo-nazi from the eastern german city of cottbus who worked for the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of brandenburg .
toni s. is currently in investigative police custody as his relationship with the white aryan rebels is probed .
the dresden public prosecutors ' office , meanwhile , has filed a criminal case against mirko h. for his role in the production and distribution of the cd .
what did the government know , and when ?
a report in the current issue of " focus , " a national newsweekly , alleged that the office of the protection of the constitution was aware of mirko h. 's involvement in the creation of the cd and still continued to work with him without stopping its production .
the newsweekly reported he earned more than 105,000 euro from the hate-filled lp .
the article also accused the federal interior ministry of withhold from the secret service committee of parliament the information that mirko h. had been convicted of illegal weapons possession and incitement in 2001 .
the interior ministry has denied the charge .
still , that does n't make it easier for the celebrities threatened in " notes of hate , " to sleep at night .
" i 'm shaken and feel less secure by the idea that security authorities have become a part of the threat , " michel friedman told the berlin newspaper " tagesspiegel , " in its wednesday edition .
" this ca n't be accepted by the government . "
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union are calling for immediate answers from the interior ministry and the government .
" in the face of the dramatic events in this informant scandal , we expect that the interior minister will provide answers , " the deputy head of the union bloc 's parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , told the " berliner zeitung " newspaper .
" he has to tell us what he knew about the informant , what the interior ministry knew , who carries the political responsibility and what conclusions should be drawn . "
criticism from within concern is also growing inside the government .
christian ströbele , a green member of parliament , told the same paper he believed the situation must be clarified before the sept .
22 federal elections .
ströbele said he believed the latest incident was just " one more example of the questionable methods of the office for the protection of the constitution . "
where do you draw the line , he asked , between activities right-wing extremists have developed themselves and those that have been inspired and financed by the office for the protection of the constitution ?
" you have to ask yourself whether some -lrb- authorities from the office -rrb- are doing more to endanger our constitution than to protect it , " ströbele said .
a growing informant scandal the neo-nazi cd scandal is only the latest gaffe for the office of the protection of the constitution in its use of extremist informants who are still active .
the constitutional court temporarily suspended the government 's case to ban the npd in january after it learned a key member of the right-wing extremist party 's leadership had at one point served as an informant for the domestic intelligence agency 's investigation , which laid the foundations for the ban petition .
the court learned that part of the government 's case had been gleaned from wolfgang frenz , an npd official and witness for the defense who had worked as an informant for the north rhine-westphalia state office for the protection of the constitution .
days later , it learned that udo holtmann , head of the npd 's state chapter in north rhine-westphalia , had also aided in the government 's case .
the government has said it must rely on unidentified informants in such cases because it is their best hope to gain intelligence on the groups .
on thursday , the practice will be put under the microscope of the bundestag , where more than a handful of politicians have already said they will question the government practice . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new problems for case against far-right party ?

the pact calls for reducing catches to sustainable levels . a deal was struck late tuesday night in johannesburg , aiming to replenish the world ’ s overfished waters by 2015 and head off a looming fisheries crisis .
it ’ s the first concrete target date set at this summit where 200 nations have gathered to come up with an action plan to reduce world poverty without destroying the environment .
environmentalists , who have been highly critical of the summit for its reluctance to set definite targets for reform , welcomed the fisheries plan , calling it a welcome advance . “ it ’ s pleasing that they have reached agreement on oceans , ” sian pullen of the environmental group wwf told reuters .
“ we would have liked it to be more progressive but it ’ s good compared to some of the other issues which may be going backwards . ”
catching fewer fish the plan calls for reducing fish catches to levels where the maximum sustainable yield can be taken indefinitely .
it gives governments a deadline of 2015 to restore fish stocks to sustainable levels .
that could entail enacting temporary fishing bans in some areas or setting up permanent no-fishing zones to preserve breeding grounds .
according to the united nations , more than 25 percent of the world ’ s commercially important fish stocks are overexploited and 50 percent are being fished to full capacity .
after pressure from the us , delegates agreed add a clause stating that fish levels should be replenished “ where possible . ”
the americans argued some stocks , such as cod on the grand banks of canada ’ s eastern seaboard , are thought to have already been fished beyond recovery .
enforcement questions while the agreement has buoyed delegates ’ spirits , some environmentalists question whether the agreement can be enforeced against pirate trawlers .
for example , the fish stocks off of mozambique , south africa ’ s neighbor , have been reduced by more than 70 percent in the last decade , thanks largely to fleets of chinese and tanzanian fishermen who invade mozambican waters and dynamite all species .
they come to the waters off the island nation because they have exhausted the stocks in their own waters .
“ -lrb- the agreement -rrb- does recognize the need for enforcement but it doesn ’ t say how it ’ s going to be done .
it ’ s a major issue and not one that ’ s been adequately addressed , ” said the wwf ’ s sian pullen .
like the other parts of the action plan that heads of state are due to approve when they come to the summit finale next week , the fisheries agreement is not legally binding .
proponents hope however that it will form a moral basis for action and keep governments under pressure from the public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes radical reforms on fishing a disputed plan to reform eu fishing would remove thousands of fishing vessels from european seas in an attempt to save threatened fish stocks and create a sustainable industry .

the company saw the tracks of some of its main lines near dresden get washed away , train stations flooded and the collapse of crucial bridges , including one on a high-speed rail line connecting northern and southern germany .
appearing at the chancellery in berlin on wednesday , deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn issued a preliminary estimate of over one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in flood damages .
" according to our cautious first estimates , we believe we have suffered revenue losses and damages of 1.025 billion euro , " mehdorn said .
he stressed that this would not be the final damage sum .
a laundry list of damages more than 400 kilometers of deutsche bahn tracks are currently unusable , and 94 bridges and 200 train stations have been badly damaged .
early estimates suggest that the service outages alone will lead to a 90 million euro -lrb- $ 88 million -rrb- drop in revenue from passenger and freight services .
mehdorn said it would take two and a half years before deutsche bahn service could return to its pre-flood level in the region .
the federal government has already agreed to provide deutsche bahn with 650 million euro -lrb- $ 638 million -rrb- to rebuild its network and repair damaged train stations .
more than half the money had already been earmarked for transportation infrastructure development projects in the eastern states that were formerly part of east germany .
deutsche bahn said its first reconstruction priorities would be lines in the leipzig-dresden-chemnitz triangle .

mehdorn said there are currently no plans to cancel any proposed deutsche bahn projects – including the planned transrapid train line between dortmund and düsseldorf .
new priorities , however , could lead to delays , he warned .
a job-saving deal as part of a four-point " immediate aid " program , the government also reached an agreement with deutsche bahn and the transnet union that the company would not lay off any employees between now and 2006 as a result of the flooding .

the company saw the tracks of some of its main lines near dresden get washed away , train stations flooded and the collapse of crucial bridges , including one on a high-speed rail line connecting northern and southern germany .
appearing at the chancellery in berlin on wednesday , deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn issued a preliminary estimate of over one billion euro -lrb- dollars -rrb- in flood damages .
" according to our cautious first estimates , we believe we have suffered revenue losses and damages of 1.025 billion euro , " mehdorn said .
he stressed that this would not be the final damage sum .
a laundry list of damages more than 400 kilometers of deutsche bahn tracks are currently unusable , and 94 bridges and 200 train stations have been badly damaged .
early estimates suggest that the service outages alone will lead to a 90 million euro -lrb- $ 88 million -rrb- drop in revenue from passenger and freight services .
mehdorn said it would take two and a half years before deutsche bahn service could return to its pre-flood level in the region .
the federal government has already agreed to provide deutsche bahn with 650 million euro -lrb- $ 638 million -rrb- to rebuild its network and repair damaged train stations .
more than half the money had already been earmarked for transportation infrastructure development projects in the eastern states that were formerly part of east germany .
deutsche bahn said its first reconstruction priorities would be lines in the leipzig-dresden-chemnitz triangle .
a line connecting dresden with prague will also be rebuilt as quickly as possible .
mehdorn said there are currently no plans to cancel any proposed deutsche bahn projects – including the planned transrapid train line between dortmund and düsseldorf .
new priorities , however , could lead to delays , he warned .
a job-saving deal as part of a four-point " immediate aid " program , the government also reached an agreement with deutsche bahn and the transnet union that the company would not lay off any employees between now and 2006 as a result of the flooding .
until this week 's agreement , talks between the employees ' union and bahn had reached an impasse .
mehdorn said deutsche bahn will reintroduce regular long-distance train service in the state of saxony-anhalt on thursday and is working on a plan to reintroduce long-distance trains in saxony as quickly as possible .
agricultural damage estimated at 267 million euro separately , german consumer protection and agricultural minister renate künast announced the government would release 141 million euro -lrb- $ 138 million -rrb- between now and the end of the year in immediate aid to farmers struck by the flooding .
künast said the government is estimating an initial 267 million euro -lrb- $ 262 million -rrb- in damages to farms .

developing countries are calling for more aid commitments and debt relief from the industrialized west .
according to oxfam international 's policy advisor penny fowler , they are also urging western nations to drop their agricultural subsidies and tariffs that prevent them from accessing western markets .
trade is one of the most critical - and contentious - issues with industrialized nations at the summit , says fowler .
" we want to see them committing to ending their unfair trade policies .
in particular , to stop putting pressure on developing countries to rapidly liberalize their economies in a way that does n't take account of the impact on poor people . "

this had devastating impacts on the livelihoods of poor farmers in developing countries .
" unless those policies are changed , it 's very hard to see how this summit will make progress on promoting sustainable development , " says fowler .
although oxfam and other non-governmental organizations are busy spreading the word to delegates meeting in the marble-lined conference halls of sandton convention center , the message does n't seem to be getting through to the sessions behind closed doors .

the pact calls for reducing catches to sustainable levels . a deal was struck late tuesday night in johannesburg , aiming to replenish the world ’ s overfished waters by 2015 and head off a looming fisheries crisis .
it ’ s the first concrete target date set at this summit where 200 nations have gathered to come up with an action plan to reduce world poverty without destroying the environment .
environmentalists , who have been highly critical of the summit for its reluctance to set definite targets for reform , welcomed the fisheries plan , calling it a welcome advance . “ it ’ s pleasing that they have reached agreement on oceans , ” sian pullen of the environmental group wwf told reuters .
“ we would have liked it to be more progressive but it ’ s good compared to some of the other issues which may be going backwards . ”
catching fewer fish the plan calls for reducing fish catches to levels where the maximum sustainable yield can be taken indefinitely .
it gives governments a deadline of 2015 to restore fish stocks to sustainable levels .
that could entail enacting temporary fishing bans in some areas or setting up permanent no-fishing zones to preserve breeding grounds .
according to the united nations , more than 25 percent of the world ’ s commercially important fish stocks are overexploited and 50 percent are being fished to full capacity .
after pressure from the us , delegates agreed add a clause stating that fish levels should be replenished “ where possible . ”
the americans argued some stocks , such as cod on the grand banks of canada ’ s eastern seaboard , are thought to have already been fished beyond recovery .
enforcement questions while the agreement has buoyed delegates ’ spirits , some environmentalists question whether the agreement can be enforeced against pirate trawlers .
for example , the fish stocks off of mozambique , south africa ’ s neighbor , have been reduced by more than 70 percent in the last decade , thanks largely to fleets of chinese and tanzanian fishermen who invade mozambican waters and dynamite all species .
they come to the waters off the island nation because they have exhausted the stocks in their own waters .
“ -lrb- the agreement -rrb- does recognize the need for enforcement but it doesn ’ t say how it ’ s going to be done .
it ’ s a major issue and not one that ’ s been adequately addressed , ” said the wwf ’ s sian pullen .
like the other parts of the action plan that heads of state are due to approve when they come to the summit finale next week , the fisheries agreement is not legally binding .
proponents hope however that it will form a moral basis for action and keep governments under pressure from the public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes radical reforms on fishing a disputed plan to reform eu fishing would remove thousands of fishing vessels from european seas in an attempt to save threatened fish stocks and create a sustainable industry .

11 : one year later fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany current affairs -pipe- 03.09.2002 terrorism fears a no show in german elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the american embassy in berlin after september 11 almost a year after the sept .
11 attacks , terrorism has vanished from the political agenda in germany .
experts say time and other issues have pushed the topic from voters ' minds . in the months following sept .
11 , germans couldn ’ t get enough tough talk on terrorism . the realization that the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon were most likely planned in hamburg , sent shockwaves through the country and , as a result , through the political establishment as well . the government was quick to react : interior minister otto schily prepared two “ security packages ” that expanded the reach and financing of germany ’ s law enforcement and got them past the legislature within a quick few months . germans rewarded their government ’ s tough talk on terrorism with high approval ratings and observers wondered at the speed and solidarity with which berlin was operating . now , just weeks before the attacks ’ anniversary , terrorism has all but escaped from the voters ’ minds , and , as a result , the political agenda .
in the midst of a hard-fought election campaign , germany ’ s recent floods , the high unemployment rate and slumping economy have grabbed the headlines , pushing aside concern over the spread of islamic fundamentalism and terror cells in the country . the reasons , say experts , have to do with both the time lapse since sept .
11 and the zero tolerance image chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has presented since then .
the speed with which the government moved to pass anti-terrorism measures and assure germans their country was safe was enough to allay fears relatively quickly , said jochen hippler , political scientist at the university of duisberg . quick enough to calm fears “ in a sense , the internal security situation , at least unofficially , has never been deemed so dangerous , “ said hippler .
“ it would have been different if the government had been more loose in its words and actions . ” there is also little difference in the way both schröder ’ s social democratic party and his challenger , edmund stoiber and his christian democratic and christian social union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- bloc , approach the anti-terrorism fight . the cdu / csu and spd look at foreign policy and domestic security in the same context .
the union bloc argues that instability on german soil is often connected to instablity caused by a country ’ s foreign policy .
the red-green coalition says that many of the union ’ s suggestions , such as increased cooperation between immigration and police authorities , have already been put into place . even schily ’ s challenger in the union bloc , hard-line bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , grudgingly admires the former green party member ’ s tough stance on domestic security .
“ schily and i went to the same school , ” beckstein has told reporters in the past . as a result , campaign managers on both sides , eager to play up differences between the cdu / csu and spd , have pushed more divisive issues further up the agenda . law enforcement wants terrorism back on the agenda the absence of terrorism in today ’ s political agenda has made it difficult for at least one interested bloc : the country ’ s law enforcement lobby .
since interest in domestic security died down , police lobbyist rüdiger holecek has had a difficult time bringing complaints of underfunding and staffing to the government ’ s attention . holecek , of the country ’ s police union , says that the government ’ s domestic security plan has overstretched an already overburdened police force .
more officers have been recruited into the country ’ s federal domestic security agency , the verfassungschutz , without enough money being left over for adequate replacements . “ we ’ re suffering as a result of this inattention , ” holecek told dw-world . the group , which represents the interests of more than 190 000 officers in germany , plans to call attention to itself during a press conference on sept .
11 .
at the conference the union will present a handbook on terrorist activity in germany .
holecek is hoping people will take notice . “ we want to prevent this topic from sinking out of view of the political , ” establishment , he said . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

for years , the agency has put members of extremist organizations , often leaders , on its payroll in an effort to get a better grasp of the activities of these groups .
in recent years , it has used information culled from informants to build its federal constitutional court case to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
however , subsequent revelations about the relationship between the agency and its informants have jeopardized the npd ban petition and led critics to ask whether it has gone over the line in nurturing such relationships .
" this bullet is for you " the latest twist involves mirko h. , a neo-nazi from the state of saxony who has been working as an informant for the office of the protection of the constitution since the mid-1990s .
it has been alleged that during his time on the agency 's payroll , he also produced thousands of copies of a cd by the band white aryan rebels called " notes of hate , " containing nazi lyrics that are banned in germany .
the song " this bullet is for you " includes a death threat against the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , michel friedman , and other german politicians .
the album , chilling in its unabashed xenophobia , also includes calls for the killing of mo asumang , a popular german erotic television star of ghanian ancestry .
the second informant implicated in the scandal is toni s. , a neo-nazi from the eastern german city of cottbus who worked for the office of the protection of the constitution in the state of brandenburg .
toni s. is currently in investigative police custody as his relationship with the white aryan rebels is probed .
the dresden public prosecutors ' office , meanwhile , has filed a criminal case against mirko h. for his role in the production and distribution of the cd .
what did the government know , and when ?
a report in the current issue of " focus , " a national newsweekly , alleged that the office of the protection of the constitution was aware of mirko h. 's involvement in the creation of the cd and still continued to work with him without stopping its production .
the newsweekly reported he earned more than 105,000 euro from the hate-filled lp .
the article also accused the federal interior ministry of withhold from the secret service committee of parliament the information that mirko h. had been convicted of illegal weapons possession and incitement in 2001 .
the interior ministry has denied the charge .
still , that does n't make it easier for the celebrities threatened in " notes of hate , " to sleep at night .
" i 'm shaken and feel less secure by the idea that security authorities have become a part of the threat , " michel friedman told the berlin newspaper " tagesspiegel , " in its wednesday edition .
" this ca n't be accepted by the government . "
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union are calling for immediate answers from the interior ministry and the government .
" in the face of the dramatic events in this informant scandal , we expect that the interior minister will provide answers , " the deputy head of the union bloc 's parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , told the " berliner zeitung " newspaper .
" he has to tell us what he knew about the informant , what the interior ministry knew , who carries the political responsibility and what conclusions should be drawn . "
criticism from within concern is also growing inside the government .
christian ströbele , a green member of parliament , told the same paper he believed the situation must be clarified before the sept .
22 federal elections .
ströbele said he believed the latest incident was just " one more example of the questionable methods of the office for the protection of the constitution . "
where do you draw the line , he asked , between activities right-wing extremists have developed themselves and those that have been inspired and financed by the office for the protection of the constitution ?
" you have to ask yourself whether some -lrb- authorities from the office -rrb- are doing more to endanger our constitution than to protect it , " ströbele said .
a growing informant scandal the neo-nazi cd scandal is only the latest gaffe for the office of the protection of the constitution in its use of extremist informants who are still active .
the constitutional court temporarily suspended the government 's case to ban the npd in january after it learned a key member of the right-wing extremist party 's leadership had at one point served as an informant for the domestic intelligence agency 's investigation , which laid the foundations for the ban petition .
the court learned that part of the government 's case had been gleaned from wolfgang frenz , an npd official and witness for the defense who had worked as an informant for the north rhine-westphalia state office for the protection of the constitution .
days later , it learned that udo holtmann , head of the npd 's state chapter in north rhine-westphalia , had also aided in the government 's case .
the government has said it must rely on unidentified informants in such cases because it is their best hope to gain intelligence on the groups .
on thursday , the practice will be put under the microscope of the bundestag , where more than a handful of politicians have already said they will question the government practice . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new problems for case against far-right party ?
germany 's state interior ministers have informally reached an agreement to shield the identities of informants in the government 's case to ban the right-wing extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .

" the german chancellor -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was the first head-of-state from the european union to speak at the conference , alluded to the recent flood catastrophe in eastern europe and germany as a sign that the time to act on greenhouse gas reduction was now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder speaks to the plenary session of the world summit on sustainable development at sandton convention center in johannesburg on monday sept .
2 , 2002 .
“ it ’ s … about the future of our children , ” he told delegates at the united nations summit on sustainable development in south africa , which will wind up this wednesday .
“ that ’ s why this conference should encourage the states who have not yet ratified the kyoto protocol , to do that as quickly as possible so that it can come into effect next year . ” kyoto protocol a sticking point at summit the protocol , agreed on in 1997 , calls on its signatories to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from their 1990 stand by 5.2 percent by 2012 . the usa and australia , among other nations , have so far refused to sign it .
the protocol , therefore , is now relying on the russian parliament ’ s ratification before it can take effect . the protocol remains one of the unresolved disputes as the conference winds its way down .
after last week ’ s delegations , the first governmental ministers started arriving in johannesburg over the weekend to smooth out differences on disputes over renewable energies and access to water before the arrival of schröder and other heads of state on monday . as at the inaugural earth summit in rio de janeiro in 1992 , government leaders will affix their signature to a 70-page action plan at the conclusion of the summit .
the agreement will aim to provide a blueprint on global environmental and developmental policy over the next decade . solar , wind power still an obstacle around 95 percent of the plan has been agreed on , according to reports from the summit , but the remaining 5 percent contains a host of controversial topics – chief among them a quota on renewable energy . germany , along with the european union and a clutch of other nations , wants renewable energies , such as wind and solar power to comprise 15 percent of the world ’ s energy use by 2010 - 2 percent more than it is now . the united states and smaller , oil-producing nations are against setting such a timetable . environmental organizations are saying the plan isn ’ t aggressive enough . schröder used his speech to praise his country 's commitment to renewable energy and urge the rest of the conference to follow germany 's lead . “ with the efficient use of energy and the massive expansion of the renewable energy sector , we will have pointed the way to the future , ” schröder told conference participants , among them united nations general secretary kofi annan and south african president thabo mbeki . he said the german government would spend 100 million euro a year over the next five years to work with developing countries on increasing their use of renewable energy .
he also said his country would take part in a global network of energy agencies agreed on sunday and invited conference participants to an international renewable energy conference in germany . drinking water a crucial step in fighting poverty echoing his development and aid minister , heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who attended the conference earlier , schröder called for a more effective battle against poverty .
the eu member states , he said , will raise their public aid budget from the current 26 billion euro to 35 billion euro in 2006 .
providing clean drinking water to populations in developing countries will also form a central plank of the fight against poverty .
earlier german environmental minister jürgen trittin told dw-tv that the reduction of poverty will " only be possible with access to the basic requirement of life : water . "

11 terrorist in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm announces charges morrocan born mounir el motassadeq will face at least 3,116 counts of accessory to murder for his alleged role in helping mohammed atta 's hamburg cell plan the sept .
11 terror attack . close to a year after the terror attacks of sept .
11 , the federal prosecutors office in germany announced it filed criminal charges this week against a hamburg man suspected of aiding in the planning and financing of the attacks .
the charges are the first against a german member of the terror cell responsible for the attacks .
on thursday , federal prosecutor kay nehm said the suspect , morrocan citizen mounir el motassadeq , was charged on wednesday as an accessory to murder in the killings of at least 3,116 people in new york and washington and for membership in a terrorist organization .
prosecutors believe the 28-year-old student was deeply involved in the hamburg terror cell led by mohammed atta that carried out the deadly attacks .
the case has brought many previously unknown facts about the sept .
11 attacks to light .
investigators here now believe the terrorist cell had begun planning a major attack as far back as oct .
1999 , and that the world trade center first emerged as a possible target in april or may 2000 .
at the time , nehm said , hijacker marwan al shehhi told a hamburg librarian of his intentions .
" there will be thousands of dead , you will all think of me , " he reportedly said .
nehm said he also uttered the words " world trade center . "
a member " right up to the end " authorities arrested electrical engineering student el motassadeq in nov .
2001 , and he has been held in investigative custody since then in a jail in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
nehm said motassadeq had maintained intensive contacts with the terror cell for several years and also lived in the same neighborhood as the terrorists with his wife and child .
nehm said he believes motassadeq " remained part of the assassination preparations right up to the end . "
motassadeq played a definitive role in the financing of the hamburg terror cell 's activities , the indictement stated . he held power of attorney over , as well as an automated teller card for , a bank account that had originally been opened by al shehhi , one of the terrorists who died in the airplane attacks .
prosecutor nehm said the terrorists used the hamburg bank account to pay for pilot training for said bahaji and zakariya essabar in the united states .
al qaeda terrorists also allegedly used the account to pay their expenses while living in the u.s. both are still on the run from authorities .
nehm described motassadeq as a " governor in hamburg " for the terror cell during the time atta and others were in taking classes in u.s. flight schools .
additionally , nehm said , motassadeq 's signature appeared on a testament written by atta that surfaced after the deadly attacks were carried out .
training in afghanistan between may and august 2000 , prosecutors said , motassadeq spent time in an al qaeda terror training camp located near kandahar in afghanistan .
" in addition to ideological and military traning , such visits were also used by leaders of the international network to discuss and agree on details of attacks and the logistical support needed to carry them out , " nehm said .
meanwhile , prosecutors say they have learned little from statements made by motassadeq following his arrest , with chief prosecutor nehm describing his statements as " meaningless . "
in december , motassadeq denied any involvement in the attacks ' planning as well as membership in al qaeda .
an attorney representing motassadeq on thursday described the 90-page indictment against him as " sparse . "
a trial against motassadeq , however , is still on schedule to commence in october .
the birth of a terror cell in his press conference on thursday , nehm also rehashed detailed conclusions drawn by investigators about the origins of the hamburg terror cell and its members .
the group , comprised initially of seven students , came together in hamburg during the early 1990s .
cell leader atta , second wtc pilot al shehhi and third pilot ziad jarrah were all part of the group .
" all of the members of this cell shared the same religious convictions , an islamic lifestyle , a feeling of being out of place in unfamiliar cultural surroundings , " nehm said .
" at the center of this stood the hatred of the world 's jews and the u.s. "
nehm said el motassadeq had served as a logistician for the terror cell along with three other men who are still being sought by authorities , including ramsi binalshibh , bahaji and essabar .
neither bahaji nor essabar were able to participate in the attacks because immigration officials rejected their visa applications to travel to the u.s. the group 's mission , according to nehm , was " the militant rejection of western society and its values and the defense of the muslim world against non-muslims , including through terrorist acts , was the basis of the group 's activities .

western countries are promoting “ public-private partnerships ” at the earth summit in johannesburg as a path to sustainable development .
environmentalists are skeptical , saying it puts big business before people . led by the united states , western countries showcased partnerships on thursday between governments , private industry and other groups as a practical way of furthering economic development and saving the environment . they say such partnerships are ways for business and governments to pool their resources and harness the funds and the know-how to accomplish more than either could on its own . un organizers say they have received 218 proposed partnerships , in areas ranging from health care to renewable energy projects that could go a long way in helping meet summit goals of halving global poverty by 2015 while slowing environmental degradation . congo project a multi-nation project to expand efforts to save forests in central africa ’ s congo basin was announced on thursday .
germany , the us , japan and indonesia are among the countries that want to provide an additional $ 53 million dollars over four years to a partnership between the paper industry active in the region and the local population .
the plan aims to develop protected forest areas and cut down on illegal logging . but many environmentalists are wary of relying on private business to save the planet .
they say partnerships may let companies cash in on providing essential services like water and electricity , while allowing governments to shirk their traditional responsibilities . “ if a government doesn ’ t do its regulation homework , it could be more than happy to let a private company come in and take over things , ” jörg kusche with greenpeace in germany told dw-world .

public funds used in partnerships , according to us thinking , can leverage private investment .
assistant secretary of state john turner said the us plans on commiting $ 970 million over the next three years to water projects , but expects to mobilize more than $ 1.6 billion through partnerships . the us agency for international development presented a $ 90 million proposal to fight hunger in africa by teaming up with regional trade groups and industry partners . paula dobriansky , a us undersecretary of state for global affairs , dismissed skepticism on the part of some activists . “ i have found a great deal of enthusiasm … all want to see us really have some action here , ” she said . european union officials were also talking up several of their proposed projects on thursday , including agreements in energy and water management .

11 terrorist in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm announces charges morrocan born mounir el motassadeq will face at least 3,116 counts of accessory to murder for his alleged role in helping mohammed atta 's hamburg cell plan the sept .
11 terror attack . close to a year after the terror attacks of sept .
11 , the federal prosecutors office in germany announced it filed criminal charges this week against a hamburg man suspected of aiding in the planning and financing of the attacks .
the charges are the first against a german member of the terror cell responsible for the attacks .
on thursday , federal prosecutor kay nehm said the suspect , morrocan citizen mounir el motassadeq , was charged on wednesday as an accessory to murder in the killings of at least 3,116 people in new york and washington and for membership in a terrorist organization .
prosecutors believe the 28-year-old student was deeply involved in the hamburg terror cell led by mohammed atta that carried out the deadly attacks .
the case has brought many previously unknown facts about the sept .
11 attacks to light .
investigators here now believe the terrorist cell had begun planning a major attack as far back as oct .
1999 , and that the world trade center first emerged as a possible target in april or may 2000 .
at the time , nehm said , hijacker marwan al shehhi told a hamburg librarian of his intentions .
" there will be thousands of dead , you will all think of me , " he reportedly said .
nehm said he also uttered the words " world trade center . "
a member " right up to the end " authorities arrested electrical engineering student el motassadeq in nov .
2001 , and he has been held in investigative custody since then in a jail in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
nehm said motassadeq had maintained intensive contacts with the terror cell for several years and also lived in the same neighborhood as the terrorists with his wife and child .
nehm said he believes motassadeq " remained part of the assassination preparations right up to the end . "
motassadeq played a definitive role in the financing of the hamburg terror cell 's activities , the indictement stated . he held power of attorney over , as well as an automated teller card for , a bank account that had originally been opened by al shehhi , one of the terrorists who died in the airplane attacks .
prosecutor nehm said the terrorists used the hamburg bank account to pay for pilot training for said bahaji and zakariya essabar in the united states .
al qaeda terrorists also allegedly used the account to pay their expenses while living in the u.s. both are still on the run from authorities .
nehm described motassadeq as a " governor in hamburg " for the terror cell during the time atta and others were in taking classes in u.s. flight schools .
additionally , nehm said , motassadeq 's signature appeared on a testament written by atta that surfaced after the deadly attacks were carried out .
training in afghanistan between may and august 2000 , prosecutors said , motassadeq spent time in an al qaeda terror training camp located near kandahar in afghanistan .
" in addition to ideological and military traning , such visits were also used by leaders of the international network to discuss and agree on details of attacks and the logistical support needed to carry them out , " nehm said .
meanwhile , prosecutors say they have learned little from statements made by motassadeq following his arrest , with chief prosecutor nehm describing his statements as " meaningless . "
in december , motassadeq denied any involvement in the attacks ' planning as well as membership in al qaeda .
an attorney representing motassadeq on thursday described the 90-page indictment against him as " sparse . "
a trial against motassadeq , however , is still on schedule to commence in october .
the birth of a terror cell in his press conference on thursday , nehm also rehashed detailed conclusions drawn by investigators about the origins of the hamburg terror cell and its members .
the group , comprised initially of seven students , came together in hamburg during the early 1990s .
cell leader atta , second wtc pilot al shehhi and third pilot ziad jarrah were all part of the group .
" all of the members of this cell shared the same religious convictions , an islamic lifestyle , a feeling of being out of place in unfamiliar cultural surroundings , " nehm said .
" at the center of this stood the hatred of the world 's jews and the u.s. "
nehm said el motassadeq had served as a logistician for the terror cell along with three other men who are still being sought by authorities , including ramsi binalshibh , bahaji and essabar .
neither bahaji nor essabar were able to participate in the attacks because immigration officials rejected their visa applications to travel to the u.s. the group 's mission , according to nehm , was " the militant rejection of western society and its values and the defense of the muslim world against non-muslims , including through terrorist acts , was the basis of the group 's activities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : environment matters german minister keeps his faith in upcoming earth summit on the green road from rio to johannesburg steering environmental issues back on the political agenda world summit opens with eu , us at odds germany -pipe- 03.09.2002 summit looks at public-private cooperation to protect the planet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private industry can play a key role in saving the planet .
western countries are promoting “ public-private partnerships ” at the earth summit in johannesburg as a path to sustainable development .
environmentalists are skeptical , saying it puts big business before people . led by the united states , western countries showcased partnerships on thursday between governments , private industry and other groups as a practical way of furthering economic development and saving the environment . they say such partnerships are ways for business and governments to pool their resources and harness the funds and the know-how to accomplish more than either could on its own . un organizers say they have received 218 proposed partnerships , in areas ranging from health care to renewable energy projects that could go a long way in helping meet summit goals of halving global poverty by 2015 while slowing environmental degradation . congo project a multi-nation project to expand efforts to save forests in central africa ’ s congo basin was announced on thursday .
germany , the us , japan and indonesia are among the countries that want to provide an additional $ 53 million dollars over four years to a partnership between the paper industry active in the region and the local population .
the plan aims to develop protected forest areas and cut down on illegal logging . but many environmentalists are wary of relying on private business to save the planet .
they say partnerships may let companies cash in on providing essential services like water and electricity , while allowing governments to shirk their traditional responsibilities . “ if a government doesn ’ t do its regulation homework , it could be more than happy to let a private company come in and take over things , ” jörg kusche with greenpeace in germany told dw-world .
“ but then there would be no transparency or accountability .
we don ’ t think that ’ s the right direction . ” he and other environmental activists have expressed concern that public-private partnerships will be used by big business as an exercise in “ greenwash ” – putting a cloak of environmental responsibility around a company that could mask activities that could actually be damaging to the environment or people in development countries . martin kaiser , international environmental expert for greenpeace who is in johannesburg , criticised the congo plan after it was announced saying it appeared to have been developed largely by the paper industry with only minimal input from indigenous groups threatened by the congo forests ’ destruction . “ there ’ s already a lot of criticism about these initiatives .
a lot seem to be one-sided in favor of industry , ” he told dw-world . in un parlance , these public-private agreements are called “ type 2 ” initiatives .
the idea is that these voluntary programs can be decided on and launched quickly by the parties involved as opposed to being endorsed by the “ type 1 ” process , which requires the approval of an international forum and can be bureaucratic and time-consuming . “ we think it would be more sensible if these were a completion of type 1 initiatives and a part of binding agreements instead of just voluntary ones , whose outcome is anything but certain , ” kusche said . practical steps but the americans at the summit see such agreements as practical steps towards sustainable development .
public funds used in partnerships , according to us thinking , can leverage private investment .
assistant secretary of state john turner said the us plans on commiting $ 970 million over the next three years to water projects , but expects to mobilize more than $ 1.6 billion through partnerships . the us agency for international development presented a $ 90 million proposal to fight hunger in africa by teaming up with regional trade groups and industry partners . paula dobriansky , a us undersecretary of state for global affairs , dismissed skepticism on the part of some activists . “ i have found a great deal of enthusiasm … all want to see us really have some action here , ” she said . european union officials were also talking up several of their proposed projects on thursday , including agreements in energy and water management .

the german government ’ s latest strategy to tackle its unemployment rate says workers need to be more mobile .
six coal miners in the ruhr region are taking that to the extreme by emigrating to america for work . andreas willrodt has called germany ’ s ruhr region home his entire life .
the coal mines there are all he ’ s ever known .
he and his brother peter are the third generation of the family that has long made its living underground .
his grandfather was a miner , so was his father .
but coal in germany is a dying industry , and willrodt knows it .
although the sector still employs 47,000 people here , it survives only thanks to a lifeline in the form of € 3 billion -lrb- $ 2.97 billion -rrb- in subsidies it gets every year .
while those subsidies are safe for now , miners see the writing on the wall .
in the next five years , at least two of the remaining ten coal mines will have to close , leaving 12,000 without jobs .
forty-year-old willrodt has decided to get out while the getting is good .
he ’ s one of the first two miners participating in a program set up by the essen-based rag coal international that is relocating company workers to the united states .
they ’ ll soon pack up their picks and shovels and head west .
willrodt dreams of riding his bmw across the wide-open spaces of wyoming and working without worrying that his mine could be closed in a year or two .
" i ’ m definitely going to seize this once-in-a-lifetime chance , " willrodt says , " and at some point i want to become an american citizen . "
fulfilling the american dream willrodt is one of more than 100 miners who applied for the program set up by rag , which operates mines in australia and in the u.s. states of wyoming , west virginia , colorado and illinois .
one other german miner will be relocated to rag ’ s west virginia operation .
four others have been approved for the program and are now just waiting for job positions to open up .
" i think the idea of the ‘ american dream ’ is still very strong with some people , " says wolfgang unterkötter , rag ’ s spokesman , when describing the response the company got when it publicized the program in the job centers that are in place at every german mine .
" they see the u.s. as a place of almost unlimited possibilities and love the country ’ s beautiful landscapes . "
he says dozens of miners could follow .
applicants must possess a proficient enough knowledge of english to work in the mines , the correct qualifications for the job and the willingness to leave home and hearth behind and start a new life in a foreign country .
" i ’ ll miss the atmosphere in the ruhr region , " admits steffen scholand , 20 , who will be heading for the west virginia mountains in four to six weeks .
but he ’ s young and unmarried and ambitious enough to pull up stakes in order to make sure he has steady work .
the german government wishes there were more people like him .
flexibility , the new mantra the german government is n't encouraging its citizens to leave the country or hoping for a mass wave of emigration to relieve its swelling unemployment rolls .
but michael kinzler of the essen labor office says the idea of these miners looking beyond their own backyards for a chance for a secure future is an encouraging one which could serve as a model for many germans .
" we need people to be flexible and mobile these days , " he says , " and i think the rag project offers an interesting perspective about what it can take to find secure employment .
even though this is kind of an extreme example . "
at the end of june , volkswagen board member and personnel director peter hartz unveiled his plan for sweeping labor-market reforms in germany – reforms that hartz claims can cut the country ’ s unemployment rolls in half .
his proposals have been on the lips of politicians and the media ever since .
among the specific measures suggested by the hartz commission is a requirement that single people whose personal circumstances allow for some mobility should accept jobs anywhere in the country .
that means an out-of-work plumber in the eastern city of magdeburg should be willing to move to stuttgart in the southwest part of the country if an available job is vacant .
while many politicians and even the labor unions have welcomed the idea of demanding increased worker flexibility and mobility , the idea is n't been without its critics .
matthias platzeck , premier of the eastern state of brandenburg , warns against creating a " nomadic society " whose direction is only determined by the whims of the free market .
but kinzler says there is little danger of that – even in economically depressed areas like the ruhr region , where unemployment hovers at 11.6 percent .
" people are settled and germans are less likely than americans to pull up roots and leave their home region , much less leave the country , " he says .
rarin ’ to go but andreas willrodt can ’ t wait .
he ’ s getting the motorcycle ready for those miles and miles of wide-open spaces .
he sees little future for german mining and at 40 years of age , he said it ’ s too late for him to start fresh in germany .
" america is my chance , " he says . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

he ’ s one of the first two miners participating in a program set up by the essen-based rag coal international that is relocating company workers to the united states .
they ’ ll soon pack up their picks and shovels and head west .
willrodt dreams of riding his bmw across the wide-open spaces of wyoming and working without worrying that his mine could be closed in a year or two .
" i ’ m definitely going to seize this once-in-a-lifetime chance , " willrodt says , " and at some point i want to become an american citizen . "
fulfilling the american dream willrodt is one of more than 100 miners who applied for the program set up by rag , which operates mines in australia and in the u.s. states of wyoming , west virginia , colorado and illinois .
one other german miner will be relocated to rag ’ s west virginia operation .
four others have been approved for the program and are now just waiting for job positions to open up .
" i think the idea of the ‘ american dream ’ is still very strong with some people , " says wolfgang unterkötter , rag ’ s spokesman , when describing the response the company got when it publicized the program in the job centers that are in place at every german mine .
" they see the u.s. as a place of almost unlimited possibilities and love the country ’ s beautiful landscapes . "
he says dozens of miners could follow .
applicants must possess a proficient enough knowledge of english to work in the mines , the correct qualifications for the job and the willingness to leave home and hearth behind and start a new life in a foreign country .
" i ’ ll miss the atmosphere in the ruhr region , " admits steffen scholand , 20 , who will be heading for the west virginia mountains in four to six weeks .
but he ’ s young and unmarried and ambitious enough to pull up stakes in order to make sure he has steady work .
the german government wishes there were more people like him .
flexibility , the new mantra the german government is n't encouraging its citizens to leave the country or hoping for a mass wave of emigration to relieve its swelling unemployment rolls .
but michael kinzler of the essen labor office says the idea of these miners looking beyond their own backyards for a chance for a secure future is an encouraging one which could serve as a model for many germans .
" we need people to be flexible and mobile these days , " he says , " and i think the rag project offers an interesting perspective about what it can take to find secure employment .
even though this is kind of an extreme example . "
at the end of june , volkswagen board member and personnel director peter hartz unveiled his plan for sweeping labor-market reforms in germany – reforms that hartz claims can cut the country ’ s unemployment rolls in half .
his proposals have been on the lips of politicians and the media ever since .
among the specific measures suggested by the hartz commission is a requirement that single people whose personal circumstances allow for some mobility should accept jobs anywhere in the country .
that means an out-of-work plumber in the eastern city of magdeburg should be willing to move to stuttgart in the southwest part of the country if an available job is vacant .
while many politicians and even the labor unions have welcomed the idea of demanding increased worker flexibility and mobility , the idea is n't been without its critics .
matthias platzeck , premier of the eastern state of brandenburg , warns against creating a " nomadic society " whose direction is only determined by the whims of the free market .
but kinzler says there is little danger of that – even in economically depressed areas like the ruhr region , where unemployment hovers at 11.6 percent .
" people are settled and germans are less likely than americans to pull up roots and leave their home region , much less leave the country , " he says .

the german government ’ s latest strategy to tackle its unemployment rate says workers need to be more mobile .
six coal miners in the ruhr region are taking that to the extreme by emigrating to america for work . andreas willrodt has called germany ’ s ruhr region home his entire life .
the coal mines there are all he ’ s ever known .
he and his brother peter are the third generation of the family that has long made its living underground .
his grandfather was a miner , so was his father .
but coal in germany is a dying industry , and willrodt knows it .
although the sector still employs 47,000 people here , it survives only thanks to a lifeline in the form of € 3 billion -lrb- $ 2.97 billion -rrb- in subsidies it gets every year .
while those subsidies are safe for now , miners see the writing on the wall .
in the next five years , at least two of the remaining ten coal mines will have to close , leaving 12,000 without jobs .
forty-year-old willrodt has decided to get out while the getting is good .
he ’ s one of the first two miners participating in a program set up by the essen-based rag coal international that is relocating company workers to the united states .
they ’ ll soon pack up their picks and shovels and head west .
willrodt dreams of riding his bmw across the wide-open spaces of wyoming and working without worrying that his mine could be closed in a year or two .
" i ’ m definitely going to seize this once-in-a-lifetime chance , " willrodt says , " and at some point i want to become an american citizen . "
fulfilling the american dream willrodt is one of more than 100 miners who applied for the program set up by rag , which operates mines in australia and in the u.s. states of wyoming , west virginia , colorado and illinois .
one other german miner will be relocated to rag ’ s west virginia operation .
four others have been approved for the program and are now just waiting for job positions to open up .
" i think the idea of the ‘ american dream ’ is still very strong with some people , " says wolfgang unterkötter , rag ’ s spokesman , when describing the response the company got when it publicized the program in the job centers that are in place at every german mine .
" they see the u.s. as a place of almost unlimited possibilities and love the country ’ s beautiful landscapes . "
he says dozens of miners could follow .
applicants must possess a proficient enough knowledge of english to work in the mines , the correct qualifications for the job and the willingness to leave home and hearth behind and start a new life in a foreign country .
" i ’ ll miss the atmosphere in the ruhr region , " admits steffen scholand , 20 , who will be heading for the west virginia mountains in four to six weeks .
but he ’ s young and unmarried and ambitious enough to pull up stakes in order to make sure he has steady work .
the german government wishes there were more people like him .
flexibility , the new mantra the german government is n't encouraging its citizens to leave the country or hoping for a mass wave of emigration to relieve its swelling unemployment rolls .
but michael kinzler of the essen labor office says the idea of these miners looking beyond their own backyards for a chance for a secure future is an encouraging one which could serve as a model for many germans .
" we need people to be flexible and mobile these days , " he says , " and i think the rag project offers an interesting perspective about what it can take to find secure employment .
even though this is kind of an extreme example . "
at the end of june , volkswagen board member and personnel director peter hartz unveiled his plan for sweeping labor-market reforms in germany – reforms that hartz claims can cut the country ’ s unemployment rolls in half .
his proposals have been on the lips of politicians and the media ever since .
among the specific measures suggested by the hartz commission is a requirement that single people whose personal circumstances allow for some mobility should accept jobs anywhere in the country .
that means an out-of-work plumber in the eastern city of magdeburg should be willing to move to stuttgart in the southwest part of the country if an available job is vacant .
while many politicians and even the labor unions have welcomed the idea of demanding increased worker flexibility and mobility , the idea is n't been without its critics .
matthias platzeck , premier of the eastern state of brandenburg , warns against creating a " nomadic society " whose direction is only determined by the whims of the free market .
but kinzler says there is little danger of that – even in economically depressed areas like the ruhr region , where unemployment hovers at 11.6 percent .
" people are settled and germans are less likely than americans to pull up roots and leave their home region , much less leave the country , " he says .
rarin ’ to go but andreas willrodt can ’ t wait .
he ’ s getting the motorcycle ready for those miles and miles of wide-open spaces .

at the end of june , volkswagen board member and personnel director peter hartz unveiled his plan for sweeping labor-market reforms in germany – reforms that hartz claims can cut the country ’ s unemployment rolls in half .
his proposals have been on the lips of politicians and the media ever since .
among the specific measures suggested by the hartz commission is a requirement that single people whose personal circumstances allow for some mobility should accept jobs anywhere in the country .
that means an out-of-work plumber in the eastern city of magdeburg should be willing to move to stuttgart in the southwest part of the country if an available job is vacant .
while many politicians and even the labor unions have welcomed the idea of demanding increased worker flexibility and mobility , the idea is n't been without its critics .
matthias platzeck , premier of the eastern state of brandenburg , warns against creating a " nomadic society " whose direction is only determined by the whims of the free market .
but kinzler says there is little danger of that – even in economically depressed areas like the ruhr region , where unemployment hovers at 11.6 percent .

the german government ’ s latest strategy to tackle its unemployment rate says workers need to be more mobile .
six coal miners in the ruhr region are taking that to the extreme by emigrating to america for work . andreas willrodt has called germany ’ s ruhr region home his entire life .
the coal mines there are all he ’ s ever known .
he and his brother peter are the third generation of the family that has long made its living underground .
his grandfather was a miner , so was his father .
but coal in germany is a dying industry , and willrodt knows it .
although the sector still employs 47,000 people here , it survives only thanks to a lifeline in the form of € 3 billion -lrb- $ 2.97 billion -rrb- in subsidies it gets every year .
while those subsidies are safe for now , miners see the writing on the wall .
in the next five years , at least two of the remaining ten coal mines will have to close , leaving 12,000 without jobs .
forty-year-old willrodt has decided to get out while the getting is good .
he ’ s one of the first two miners participating in a program set up by the essen-based rag coal international that is relocating company workers to the united states .
they ’ ll soon pack up their picks and shovels and head west .
willrodt dreams of riding his bmw across the wide-open spaces of wyoming and working without worrying that his mine could be closed in a year or two .
" i ’ m definitely going to seize this once-in-a-lifetime chance , " willrodt says , " and at some point i want to become an american citizen . "

the german government ’ s latest strategy to tackle its unemployment rate says workers need to be more mobile .
six coal miners in the ruhr region are taking that to the extreme by emigrating to america for work . andreas willrodt has called germany ’ s ruhr region home his entire life .
the coal mines there are all he ’ s ever known .
he and his brother peter are the third generation of the family that has long made its living underground .
his grandfather was a miner , so was his father .
but coal in germany is a dying industry , and willrodt knows it .
although the sector still employs 47,000 people here , it survives only thanks to a lifeline in the form of € 3 billion -lrb- $ 2.97 billion -rrb- in subsidies it gets every year .
while those subsidies are safe for now , miners see the writing on the wall .
in the next five years , at least two of the remaining ten coal mines will have to close , leaving 12,000 without jobs .
forty-year-old willrodt has decided to get out while the getting is good .
he ’ s one of the first two miners participating in a program set up by the essen-based rag coal international that is relocating company workers to the united states .
they ’ ll soon pack up their picks and shovels and head west .
willrodt dreams of riding his bmw across the wide-open spaces of wyoming and working without worrying that his mine could be closed in a year or two .
" i ’ m definitely going to seize this once-in-a-lifetime chance , " willrodt says , " and at some point i want to become an american citizen . "
fulfilling the american dream willrodt is one of more than 100 miners who applied for the program set up by rag , which operates mines in australia and in the u.s. states of wyoming , west virginia , colorado and illinois .
one other german miner will be relocated to rag ’ s west virginia operation .
four others have been approved for the program and are now just waiting for job positions to open up .
" i think the idea of the ‘ american dream ’ is still very strong with some people , " says wolfgang unterkötter , rag ’ s spokesman , when describing the response the company got when it publicized the program in the job centers that are in place at every german mine .
" they see the u.s. as a place of almost unlimited possibilities and love the country ’ s beautiful landscapes . "
he says dozens of miners could follow .
applicants must possess a proficient enough knowledge of english to work in the mines , the correct qualifications for the job and the willingness to leave home and hearth behind and start a new life in a foreign country .
" i ’ ll miss the atmosphere in the ruhr region , " admits steffen scholand , 20 , who will be heading for the west virginia mountains in four to six weeks .
but he ’ s young and unmarried and ambitious enough to pull up stakes in order to make sure he has steady work .
the german government wishes there were more people like him .
flexibility , the new mantra the german government is n't encouraging its citizens to leave the country or hoping for a mass wave of emigration to relieve its swelling unemployment rolls .
but michael kinzler of the essen labor office says the idea of these miners looking beyond their own backyards for a chance for a secure future is an encouraging one which could serve as a model for many germans .
" we need people to be flexible and mobile these days , " he says , " and i think the rag project offers an interesting perspective about what it can take to find secure employment .
even though this is kind of an extreme example . "
at the end of june , volkswagen board member and personnel director peter hartz unveiled his plan for sweeping labor-market reforms in germany – reforms that hartz claims can cut the country ’ s unemployment rolls in half .
his proposals have been on the lips of politicians and the media ever since .
among the specific measures suggested by the hartz commission is a requirement that single people whose personal circumstances allow for some mobility should accept jobs anywhere in the country .
that means an out-of-work plumber in the eastern city of magdeburg should be willing to move to stuttgart in the southwest part of the country if an available job is vacant .
while many politicians and even the labor unions have welcomed the idea of demanding increased worker flexibility and mobility , the idea is n't been without its critics .
matthias platzeck , premier of the eastern state of brandenburg , warns against creating a " nomadic society " whose direction is only determined by the whims of the free market .
but kinzler says there is little danger of that – even in economically depressed areas like the ruhr region , where unemployment hovers at 11.6 percent .
" people are settled and germans are less likely than americans to pull up roots and leave their home region , much less leave the country , " he says .
rarin ’ to go but andreas willrodt can ’ t wait .
he ’ s getting the motorcycle ready for those miles and miles of wide-open spaces .
he sees little future for german mining and at 40 years of age , he said it ’ s too late for him to start fresh in germany .

at the end of june , volkswagen board member and personnel director peter hartz unveiled his plan for sweeping labor-market reforms in germany – reforms that hartz claims can cut the country ’ s unemployment rolls in half .
his proposals have been on the lips of politicians and the media ever since .
among the specific measures suggested by the hartz commission is a requirement that single people whose personal circumstances allow for some mobility should accept jobs anywhere in the country .
that means an out-of-work plumber in the eastern city of magdeburg should be willing to move to stuttgart in the southwest part of the country if an available job is vacant .
while many politicians and even the labor unions have welcomed the idea of demanding increased worker flexibility and mobility , the idea is n't been without its critics .
matthias platzeck , premier of the eastern state of brandenburg , warns against creating a " nomadic society " whose direction is only determined by the whims of the free market .
but kinzler says there is little danger of that – even in economically depressed areas like the ruhr region , where unemployment hovers at 11.6 percent .

the german government ’ s latest strategy to tackle its unemployment rate says workers need to be more mobile .
six coal miners in the ruhr region are taking that to the extreme by emigrating to america for work . andreas willrodt has called germany ’ s ruhr region home his entire life .
the coal mines there are all he ’ s ever known .
he and his brother peter are the third generation of the family that has long made its living underground .
his grandfather was a miner , so was his father .
but coal in germany is a dying industry , and willrodt knows it .
although the sector still employs 47,000 people here , it survives only thanks to a lifeline in the form of € 3 billion -lrb- $ 2.97 billion -rrb- in subsidies it gets every year .
while those subsidies are safe for now , miners see the writing on the wall .
in the next five years , at least two of the remaining ten coal mines will have to close , leaving 12,000 without jobs .
forty-year-old willrodt has decided to get out while the getting is good .
he ’ s one of the first two miners participating in a program set up by the essen-based rag coal international that is relocating company workers to the united states .
they ’ ll soon pack up their picks and shovels and head west .
willrodt dreams of riding his bmw across the wide-open spaces of wyoming and working without worrying that his mine could be closed in a year or two .
" i ’ m definitely going to seize this once-in-a-lifetime chance , " willrodt says , " and at some point i want to become an american citizen . "
fulfilling the american dream willrodt is one of more than 100 miners who applied for the program set up by rag , which operates mines in australia and in the u.s. states of wyoming , west virginia , colorado and illinois .
one other german miner will be relocated to rag ’ s west virginia operation .
four others have been approved for the program and are now just waiting for job positions to open up .

the german government ’ s latest strategy to tackle its unemployment rate says workers need to be more mobile .
six coal miners in the ruhr region are taking that to the extreme by emigrating to america for work . andreas willrodt has called germany ’ s ruhr region home his entire life .
the coal mines there are all he ’ s ever known .
he and his brother peter are the third generation of the family that has long made its living underground .
his grandfather was a miner , so was his father .
but coal in germany is a dying industry , and willrodt knows it .
although the sector still employs 47,000 people here , it survives only thanks to a lifeline in the form of € 3 billion -lrb- $ 2.97 billion -rrb- in subsidies it gets every year .
while those subsidies are safe for now , miners see the writing on the wall .
in the next five years , at least two of the remaining ten coal mines will have to close , leaving 12,000 without jobs .
forty-year-old willrodt has decided to get out while the getting is good .
he ’ s one of the first two miners participating in a program set up by the essen-based rag coal international that is relocating company workers to the united states .
they ’ ll soon pack up their picks and shovels and head west .
willrodt dreams of riding his bmw across the wide-open spaces of wyoming and working without worrying that his mine could be closed in a year or two .
" i ’ m definitely going to seize this once-in-a-lifetime chance , " willrodt says , " and at some point i want to become an american citizen . "
fulfilling the american dream willrodt is one of more than 100 miners who applied for the program set up by rag , which operates mines in australia and in the u.s. states of wyoming , west virginia , colorado and illinois .
one other german miner will be relocated to rag ’ s west virginia operation .
four others have been approved for the program and are now just waiting for job positions to open up .
" i think the idea of the ‘ american dream ’ is still very strong with some people , " says wolfgang unterkötter , rag ’ s spokesman , when describing the response the company got when it publicized the program in the job centers that are in place at every german mine .
" they see the u.s. as a place of almost unlimited possibilities and love the country ’ s beautiful landscapes . "
he says dozens of miners could follow .
applicants must possess a proficient enough knowledge of english to work in the mines , the correct qualifications for the job and the willingness to leave home and hearth behind and start a new life in a foreign country .
" i ’ ll miss the atmosphere in the ruhr region , " admits steffen scholand , 20 , who will be heading for the west virginia mountains in four to six weeks .
but he ’ s young and unmarried and ambitious enough to pull up stakes in order to make sure he has steady work .
the german government wishes there were more people like him .
flexibility , the new mantra the german government is n't encouraging its citizens to leave the country or hoping for a mass wave of emigration to relieve its swelling unemployment rolls .
but michael kinzler of the essen labor office says the idea of these miners looking beyond their own backyards for a chance for a secure future is an encouraging one which could serve as a model for many germans .
" we need people to be flexible and mobile these days , " he says , " and i think the rag project offers an interesting perspective about what it can take to find secure employment .
even though this is kind of an extreme example . "
at the end of june , volkswagen board member and personnel director peter hartz unveiled his plan for sweeping labor-market reforms in germany – reforms that hartz claims can cut the country ’ s unemployment rolls in half .
his proposals have been on the lips of politicians and the media ever since .
among the specific measures suggested by the hartz commission is a requirement that single people whose personal circumstances allow for some mobility should accept jobs anywhere in the country .
that means an out-of-work plumber in the eastern city of magdeburg should be willing to move to stuttgart in the southwest part of the country if an available job is vacant .
while many politicians and even the labor unions have welcomed the idea of demanding increased worker flexibility and mobility , the idea is n't been without its critics .
matthias platzeck , premier of the eastern state of brandenburg , warns against creating a " nomadic society " whose direction is only determined by the whims of the free market .
but kinzler says there is little danger of that – even in economically depressed areas like the ruhr region , where unemployment hovers at 11.6 percent .
" people are settled and germans are less likely than americans to pull up roots and leave their home region , much less leave the country , " he says .
rarin ’ to go but andreas willrodt can ’ t wait .
he ’ s getting the motorcycle ready for those miles and miles of wide-open spaces .
he sees little future for german mining and at 40 years of age , he said it ’ s too late for him to start fresh in germany .
" america is my chance , " he says . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the german government ’ s latest strategy to tackle its unemployment rate says workers need to be more mobile .
six coal miners in the ruhr region are taking that to the extreme by emigrating to america for work . andreas willrodt has called germany ’ s ruhr region home his entire life .
the coal mines there are all he ’ s ever known .
he and his brother peter are the third generation of the family that has long made its living underground .
his grandfather was a miner , so was his father .
but coal in germany is a dying industry , and willrodt knows it .
although the sector still employs 47,000 people here , it survives only thanks to a lifeline in the form of € 3 billion -lrb- $ 2.97 billion -rrb- in subsidies it gets every year .
while those subsidies are safe for now , miners see the writing on the wall .
in the next five years , at least two of the remaining ten coal mines will have to close , leaving 12,000 without jobs .
forty-year-old willrodt has decided to get out while the getting is good .
he ’ s one of the first two miners participating in a program set up by the essen-based rag coal international that is relocating company workers to the united states .
they ’ ll soon pack up their picks and shovels and head west .
willrodt dreams of riding his bmw across the wide-open spaces of wyoming and working without worrying that his mine could be closed in a year or two .
" i ’ m definitely going to seize this once-in-a-lifetime chance , " willrodt says , " and at some point i want to become an american citizen . "
fulfilling the american dream willrodt is one of more than 100 miners who applied for the program set up by rag , which operates mines in australia and in the u.s. states of wyoming , west virginia , colorado and illinois .
one other german miner will be relocated to rag ’ s west virginia operation .
four others have been approved for the program and are now just waiting for job positions to open up .
" i think the idea of the ‘ american dream ’ is still very strong with some people , " says wolfgang unterkötter , rag ’ s spokesman , when describing the response the company got when it publicized the program in the job centers that are in place at every german mine .
" they see the u.s. as a place of almost unlimited possibilities and love the country ’ s beautiful landscapes . "
he says dozens of miners could follow .

the german government ’ s latest strategy to tackle its unemployment rate says workers need to be more mobile .
six coal miners in the ruhr region are taking that to the extreme by emigrating to america for work . andreas willrodt has called germany ’ s ruhr region home his entire life .
the coal mines there are all he ’ s ever known .
he and his brother peter are the third generation of the family that has long made its living underground .
his grandfather was a miner , so was his father .
but coal in germany is a dying industry , and willrodt knows it .
although the sector still employs 47,000 people here , it survives only thanks to a lifeline in the form of € 3 billion -lrb- $ 2.97 billion -rrb- in subsidies it gets every year .
while those subsidies are safe for now , miners see the writing on the wall .
in the next five years , at least two of the remaining ten coal mines will have to close , leaving 12,000 without jobs .
forty-year-old willrodt has decided to get out while the getting is good .
he ’ s one of the first two miners participating in a program set up by the essen-based rag coal international that is relocating company workers to the united states .
they ’ ll soon pack up their picks and shovels and head west .
willrodt dreams of riding his bmw across the wide-open spaces of wyoming and working without worrying that his mine could be closed in a year or two .
" i ’ m definitely going to seize this once-in-a-lifetime chance , " willrodt says , " and at some point i want to become an american citizen . "
fulfilling the american dream willrodt is one of more than 100 miners who applied for the program set up by rag , which operates mines in australia and in the u.s. states of wyoming , west virginia , colorado and illinois .
one other german miner will be relocated to rag ’ s west virginia operation .
four others have been approved for the program and are now just waiting for job positions to open up .
" i think the idea of the ‘ american dream ’ is still very strong with some people , " says wolfgang unterkötter , rag ’ s spokesman , when describing the response the company got when it publicized the program in the job centers that are in place at every german mine .
" they see the u.s. as a place of almost unlimited possibilities and love the country ’ s beautiful landscapes . "
he says dozens of miners could follow .
applicants must possess a proficient enough knowledge of english to work in the mines , the correct qualifications for the job and the willingness to leave home and hearth behind and start a new life in a foreign country .
" i ’ ll miss the atmosphere in the ruhr region , " admits steffen scholand , 20 , who will be heading for the west virginia mountains in four to six weeks .
but he ’ s young and unmarried and ambitious enough to pull up stakes in order to make sure he has steady work .
the german government wishes there were more people like him .
flexibility , the new mantra the german government is n't encouraging its citizens to leave the country or hoping for a mass wave of emigration to relieve its swelling unemployment rolls .
but michael kinzler of the essen labor office says the idea of these miners looking beyond their own backyards for a chance for a secure future is an encouraging one which could serve as a model for many germans .
" we need people to be flexible and mobile these days , " he says , " and i think the rag project offers an interesting perspective about what it can take to find secure employment .
even though this is kind of an extreme example . "
at the end of june , volkswagen board member and personnel director peter hartz unveiled his plan for sweeping labor-market reforms in germany – reforms that hartz claims can cut the country ’ s unemployment rolls in half .
his proposals have been on the lips of politicians and the media ever since .
among the specific measures suggested by the hartz commission is a requirement that single people whose personal circumstances allow for some mobility should accept jobs anywhere in the country .
that means an out-of-work plumber in the eastern city of magdeburg should be willing to move to stuttgart in the southwest part of the country if an available job is vacant .
while many politicians and even the labor unions have welcomed the idea of demanding increased worker flexibility and mobility , the idea is n't been without its critics .
matthias platzeck , premier of the eastern state of brandenburg , warns against creating a " nomadic society " whose direction is only determined by the whims of the free market .
but kinzler says there is little danger of that – even in economically depressed areas like the ruhr region , where unemployment hovers at 11.6 percent .
" people are settled and germans are less likely than americans to pull up roots and leave their home region , much less leave the country , " he says .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- us terror fund drive stalls news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : business news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business e-commerce economy market data entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk tuesday , 3 september , 2002 , 06:03 gmt 07:03 uk us terror fund drive stalls hawala brokers are common in dubai 's gold markets by jeremy scott-joynt bbc news online business reporter disagreements between us agencies are hampering the fight against terrorist finance , bbc news online has learned .
traditional rivalries have not been overcome between the fbi , the cia , customs , and the treasury , despite the creation of two new joint agencies to lead the terror fund fight .
we came from a standing start ...
there was no roadmap , no gameplan rob nichols us treasury and the drive to close down the sources of terrorist finance has slowed sharply , with many fewer suspect charities or bank accounts being shut down than in the months immediately after 11 september .
for the past year the us government has been leading an international initiative to close down the pipelines through which acts of terror are funded .
but according to a leaked draft report from a un monitoring group - due to be released on 5 september - the efforts so far have been woefully inadequate .
" standing start " more than $ 112m -lrb- £ 72m -rrb- in suspect bank accounts has been frozen , 160 countries have participated in the intelligence effort , and the list of people and organisations on united nations-sanctioned blacklists now runs to more than 30 pages of closely-spaced text , listing aliases , dates of birth and last known locations .
a handful of controversial charities have been shut down - a contentious move in some cases .
somalia 's al-barakaat , a traditional and informal system of global money transfer , has been virtually destroyed .
for officials at the us treasury , to which most of the agencies conducting the hunt for terrorist finance report , front-page headlines saying the attack against terror funds had stalled was hardly what they wanted to see less than a fortnight before the first anniversary of 11 september .
the un report 's conclusions were clear : the fight against terror finance was failing , al-qaeda has as much money as it needs and can move it wherever it wants , while international co-operation is faltering .
rob nichols , deputy assistant secretary at the us treasury , is not surprised by the intense interest the news attracted around the world .
but , he told bbc news online , the un has got the wrong end of the stick .
no-one , he says , is pretending that they have " spiked the football " - the celebratory slamming of an american football into the ground once the points have been scored .
" we came from a standing start , " he says .
" there was no roadmap , no gameplan . "
and if the report is simply trying to suggest that there 's a long road ahead , then he is not going to disagree .
under the radar for a start , before 11 september 2001 tracking terrorist funding was not a huge priority .
" when we found someone plotting some terrorist act , we 'd arrest him and then , only on a secondary level , we 'd look through his finances to see where that leads , " mr nichols said .
" after 11 september we flipped that , did a complete about face . "
concealed within a large box of ritz crackers , two boxes of baby wipes and a box of quaker oats was approximately $ 659,000 arrest warrant for a man caught smuggling cash through new york 's jfk airport the more esoteric tools used by some groups to channel money where they needed it , including informal money transfer systems and the alleged use of islamic charities as cover , " would not have been things that jumped to the forefront of people 's minds pre-11 september " , he admits .
follow the money !
it is worth noting that investigators working on money laundering - of the criminal rather than terrorist kind - have always focused on the money trail .
" follow the money " is a mantra in that business , and both serving and former members of us agencies including the fbi and the internal revenue service - whose responsibilities include charity oversight - have confirmed that their expertise was never truly exploited in counter-terrorism .
as for informal money transfer systems , often dubbed hawala after a hindi word for " trust " , afghan drug runners have used them for years - as narcotics investigators are well aware .
and if the afghan drugs trade knew about it , it seems obvious - in retrospect - that al-qaeda did too .
not only that , but the traditional rivalry between counter-terrorist agencies was often , although not always , a sticking point .
legal structures got in the way too - a point addressed in the usa patriot act of october 2001 , which laid down a string of strict new rules for financial institutions and for the federal government itself .
the information held by the myriad different agencies , mr nichols says , was " stovepiped " - unavailable to other agencies .
everyone had a different piece of the puzzle , so two inter-agency teams - operation green quest , led by us customs and consisting of law enforcement agents , and the foreign terrorist asset tracking centre for financial intelligence - were formed to try to bring things together .
cutting the cash flow twelve months on , though , mr nichols insists that solid progress is being made whatever the un report might say - which , he points out , is still only a leaked unofficial draft .
for a start , the un only looked at the blocking orders , reckoning that because 90 % came before the end of 2001 the process had run into the sand .
" that 's simply backwards , " mr nichols says .
" we welcome the time when there are less blockings and freezings because it indicates that our other fronts are being successful . "
and it 's the other fronts which are key : cutting the pipelines through which money flows , making those moving money for " heinous ends " do so through channels which are easier to track than a simple electronic money transfer .
" if we can drive terrorists out of recorded banking systems ... we can force them into using bulk cash transfers - literally taking trunkfuls of cash around the globe .
dogs can smell money that , incidentally , is not as easy as it sounds .
marcy forman , the us customs agent in charge of operation green quest , told bbc news online that sniffer dogs can actually smell the ink in dollar bills these days .
not that it always takes sniffer dogs .
one man , ms forman said , was arrested at a simple customs check at new york 's john f kennedy airport .
mogadishu : no banks , and informal money transfer systems are being shut down in his luggage , as the arrest warrant puts it , " investigators found concealed within a large box of ritz crackers , two boxes of baby wipes and a box of quaker oats , approximately $ 659,000 in us currency . "
other alternatives becoming popular involve the transfer of gems and gold - a trade in highly portable items which is traditionally secretive in any case .
expatriates suffer and increasingly the off-the-books channels are now being watched too .
often it 's a case of a few insiders pushing money out through the back door .
in the case of one charity , al-hamarain , which was closed in collaboration with saudi arabia , " we found that the main branches had no idea what some of their satellites were up to " .
it is unfortunate that the crackdown is causing some collateral damage .
informal money transfer systems are hugely useful to immigrants and expatriates in getting money home to parts of the world without modern electronic banking .
mr nichols acknowledges that their closure is causing much grief .
regrettable , he agrees , but necessary .
" it may require folks to find alternatives , but we simply can not allow a pipeline to al-qaeda to exist , " he says .
rush to support us crackdown in the meantime , following a well-attended conference in bahrain earlier this year , international efforts are under way to come up with ways of regulating hawala and charities to cut down on the risk of back-channel operations .
and it 's further international cooperation that will keep the across-the-board push working .
" in the first days after 11 september our phone was ringing off the hook with offers of assistance , " mr nichols says .
according to the treasury , that has n't slackened - despite the much-publicised arguments between the us and most of the rest of the world over iraq , the environment , the international criminal court and other issues .
mr nichols points to the increasing trend for countries other than the us to issue their own terror money blacklists , either alone or with us support .
italy , for one , issued a joint notification with the us less than a week ago , with 25 people and organisations to add to the global asset freeze .
" ensuring the international co-operation remains strong is perhaps the most important thing we have to do , " mr nichols says .
the un report due out on 5 september seems likely to contradict that statement , claiming that european countries in particular face legal problems in blocking assets as requested .
the secrecy inherent in financial intelligence work certainly makes judging these conflicting claims a difficult task .
but over the coming months cases will begin to come to court .
the evidence presented there will demonstrate whether rob nichols ' optimism is justified .

traditional rivalries have not been overcome between the fbi , the cia , customs , and the treasury , despite the creation of two new joint agencies to lead the terror fund fight . "
we came from a standing start ...
there was no roadmap , no gameplan " rob nichols us treasury and the drive to close down the sources of terrorist finance has slowed sharply , with many fewer suspect charities or bank accounts being shut down than in the months immediately after 11 september .
for the past year the us government has been leading an international initiative to close down the pipelines through which acts of terror are funded .
but according to a leaked draft report from a un monitoring group - due to be released on 5 september - the efforts so far have been woefully inadequate .
" standing start " more than $ 112m -lrb- £ 72m -rrb- in suspect bank accounts has been frozen , 160 countries have participated in the intelligence effort , and the list of people and organisations on united nations-sanctioned blacklists now runs to more than 30 pages of closely-spaced text , listing aliases , dates of birth and last known locations .
a handful of controversial charities have been shut down - a contentious move in some cases .
somalia 's al-barakaat , a traditional and informal system of global money transfer , has been virtually destroyed .
for officials at the us treasury , to which most of the agencies conducting the hunt for terrorist finance report , front-page headlines saying the attack against terror funds had stalled was hardly what they wanted to see less than a fortnight before the first anniversary of 11 september .
the un report 's conclusions were clear : the fight against terror finance was failing , al-qaeda has as much money as it needs and can move it wherever it wants , while international co-operation is faltering .
rob nichols , deputy assistant secretary at the us treasury , is not surprised by the intense interest the news attracted around the world .
but , he told bbc news online , the un has got the wrong end of the stick .
no-one , he says , is pretending that they have " spiked the football " - the celebratory slamming of an american football into the ground once the points have been scored .
" we came from a standing start , " he says .
" there was no roadmap , no gameplan . "
and if the report is simply trying to suggest that there 's a long road ahead , then he is not going to disagree .
under the radar for a start , before 11 september 2001 tracking terrorist funding was not a huge priority .
" when we found someone plotting some terrorist act , we 'd arrest him and then , only on a secondary level , we 'd look through his finances to see where that leads , " mr nichols said .
" after 11 september we flipped that , did a complete about face . "
" concealed within a large box of ritz crackers , two boxes of baby wipes and a box of quaker oats was approximately $ 659,000 " arrest warrant for a man caught smuggling cash through new york 's jfk airport the more esoteric tools used by some groups to channel money where they needed it , including informal money transfer systems and the alleged use of islamic charities as cover , " would not have been things that jumped to the forefront of people 's minds pre-11 september " , he admits .
follow the money !
it is worth noting that investigators working on money laundering - of the criminal rather than terrorist kind - have always focused on the money trail .
" follow the money " is a mantra in that business , and both serving and former members of us agencies including the fbi and the internal revenue service - whose responsibilities include charity oversight - have confirmed that their expertise was never truly exploited in counter-terrorism .
as for informal money transfer systems , often dubbed hawala after a hindi word for " trust " , afghan drug runners have used them for years - as narcotics investigators are well aware .
and if the afghan drugs trade knew about it , it seems obvious - in retrospect - that al-qaeda did too .
not only that , but the traditional rivalry between counter-terrorist agencies was often , although not always , a sticking point .
legal structures got in the way too - a point addressed in the usa patriot act of october 2001 , which laid down a string of strict new rules for financial institutions and for the federal government itself .
the information held by the myriad different agencies , mr nichols says , was " stovepiped " - unavailable to other agencies .
everyone had a different piece of the puzzle , so two inter-agency teams - operation green quest , led by us customs and consisting of law enforcement agents , and the foreign terrorist asset tracking centre for financial intelligence - were formed to try to bring things together .
cutting the cash flow twelve months on , though , mr nichols insists that solid progress is being made whatever the un report might say - which , he points out , is still only a leaked unofficial draft .
for a start , the un only looked at the blocking orders , reckoning that because 90 % came before the end of 2001 the process had run into the sand .
" that 's simply backwards , " mr nichols says .
" we welcome the time when there are less blockings and freezings because it indicates that our other fronts are being successful . "
and it 's the other fronts which are key : cutting the pipelines through which money flows , making those moving money for " heinous ends " do so through channels which are easier to track than a simple electronic money transfer .
" if we can drive terrorists out of recorded banking systems ... we can force them into using bulk cash transfers - literally taking trunkfuls of cash around the globe .
dogs can smell money that , incidentally , is not as easy as it sounds .
marcy forman , the us customs agent in charge of operation green quest , told bbc news online that sniffer dogs can actually smell the ink in dollar bills these days .
not that it always takes sniffer dogs .
one man , ms forman said , was arrested at a simple customs check at new york 's john f kennedy airport .
in his luggage , as the arrest warrant puts it , " investigators found concealed within a large box of ritz crackers , two boxes of baby wipes and a box of quaker oats , approximately $ 659,000 in us currency . "
other alternatives becoming popular involve the transfer of gems and gold - a trade in highly portable items which is traditionally secretive in any case .
expatriates suffer and increasingly the off-the-books channels are now being watched too .
often it 's a case of a few insiders pushing money out through the back door .
in the case of one charity , al-hamarain , which was closed in collaboration with saudi arabia , " we found that the main branches had no idea what some of their satellites were up to " .
it is unfortunate that the crackdown is causing some collateral damage .
informal money transfer systems are hugely useful to immigrants and expatriates in getting money home to parts of the world without modern electronic banking .
mr nichols acknowledges that their closure is causing much grief .
regrettable , he agrees , but necessary .
" it may require folks to find alternatives , but we simply can not allow a pipeline to al-qaeda to exist , " he says .
rush to support us crackdown in the meantime , following a well-attended conference in bahrain earlier this year , international efforts are under way to come up with ways of regulating hawala and charities to cut down on the risk of back-channel operations .
and it 's further international cooperation that will keep the across-the-board push working .
" in the first days after 11 september our phone was ringing off the hook with offers of assistance , " mr nichols says .
according to the treasury , that has n't slackened - despite the much-publicised arguments between the us and most of the rest of the world over iraq , the environment , the international criminal court and other issues .
mr nichols points to the increasing trend for countries other than the us to issue their own terror money blacklists , either alone or with us support .
italy , for one , issued a joint notification with the us less than a week ago , with 25 people and organisations to add to the global asset freeze .
" ensuring the international co-operation remains strong is perhaps the most important thing we have to do , " mr nichols says .
the un report due out on 5 september seems likely to contradict that statement , claiming that european countries in particular face legal problems in blocking assets as requested .
the secrecy inherent in financial intelligence work certainly makes judging these conflicting claims a difficult task .
but over the coming months cases will begin to come to court .
the evidence presented there will demonstrate whether rob nichols ' optimism is justified .

it will tell the office of fair trading on tuesday of cases where salesmen have allegedly lied about the law , their identity and the product they are selling .
the accusations are contained in a report compiled from cases in northern ireland .
the national association of citizens ' advice bureau report claims sales representatives use " aggressive sales tactics and downright deception to trap vulnerable people into expensive contracts they ca n't escape " .
the report is based on 1,500 reports from more than 350 cabs in england and northern ireland .
however , the problem is not thought to be as extensive in northern ireland as in england .
nacab says the report suggests : sales reps lie - about the law , their identity , the product they are selling and the purpose of their visit to get their foot in the door .
use high pressure sales tactics to intimidate people into agreeing a sale under duress give consumers misleading information about their rights before , during and after a sale give poor quality information about complex and high value goods and services they are trying to sell , such as disability aids , legal services and linked credit agreements outstay their welcome and refuse to leave when asked target elderly and disabled people to sell them unsuitable equipment at highly inflated prices make unreasonable demands for payment before a sale or after cancellation refuse to accept cancellations , approaching consumers repeatedly to try and persuade them to change their minds . watch / listen on this story siobhan harding of the citizen 's advice bureau : " the salesperson took the 75 year old to her bank to withdraw money " see also : 31 aug 00 -pipe- scotland changing face of advice network 25 jul 01 -pipe- scotland debt crackdown welcomed 23 feb 01 -pipe- business death of a salesman 03 mar 99 -pipe- uk slamming the door on sales ' conmen ' internet links : national association of citizens ' advice bureau the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top n ireland stories now : nail bombs thrown at station omagh detectives make arrest orde defends inquiry comments warders still concerned at breach sdlp member ' being forced out ' jobs threat at council family claim attack was ' sectarian ' adair fails in prison challenge links to more n ireland stories are at the foot of the page .

in an exclusive interview , supachai pantchpakdi has told the bbc that the new trade round must make progress on agriculture , the most important export from developing countries .
he has also said he is prepared to sit down and talk to the anti-globalisation protesters who have been targeting the wto .
supachai pantchpakdi is a former deputy prime minster and trade minster of thailand and the first director general of the wto from a poor country .
the new boss wants trade to help poor countries and with his developing world background , he is trying to balance on an awkward tightrope - addressing the concerns of the developing nations have about the wto without being seen as against the rich countries .
some industrial nations , notably the united states did n't want him to have the job in the first place .
in a bbc interview , mr supachai said all that was in the past .
he thinks he now has the backing of those that did n't support him at first .
he sees himself as a representative of the world trading system as a whole , pushing for more open trade to bring balanced benefits for all members to enjoy .
credibility but he is also acutely aware that the wto 's credibility has long been undermined by the constant stream of complaints form the developing world that their interests are n't taken seriously enough .
so what can he do ?
he points to the doha development agenda , the trade talks launched by the wto at a ministerial meeting in the middle east last year .
he says there are a number of items on the agenda that will be of great benefit to developing countries .
his task he says is to ensure that all these items are included in the final agreement from the negotiations ; that they do n't just remain bits of paper .
agriculture agriculture is the outstanding example .
the wto is not getting a firebrand campaigner the rich countries have promised to negotiate reductions the subsidies they give their farmers - subsidies which make it harder for farmers in other countries to compete .
it 's a difficult time to be looking for such action .
it was only a few months ago that the us president george w bush approved new laws increasing farm supports .
but mr supachai is not downhearted .
he says he 's confident that the major trading nations understand that they have a lot to gain form a successful conclusion to the doha negotiations .
he says they understand that to achieve that agriculture has to be the most important element in any agreement .
eu-us tensions mr supachai takes over at a time of fractious trade relations between the us and the european union .
last week , a wto dispute panel gave the eu permission to go ahead with a record level of retaliation over us export subsidies enjoyed by giants such as boeing and microsoft .
steel tariffs erected by the us earlier this year also cast a shadow over the wto .
mr supachai says these quarrels just go to prove the need for such an organisation .
and he says he is concerned that the number of conflicts might escalate in the future .
but he thinks that more could be resolved by consultation between the countries involved - without needing to use the wto 's legal procedures for settling disputes .
protests he is also prepared for the chorus of complaints he will hear about the wto from protestors ; people who were represented on the streets of seattle in 1999 when a wto ministerial meeting ended in acrimonious dissension inside the conference and sometimes violent confrontations between police and demonstrators on the streets .
their litany of complaints against the organisation is familiar to mr supachai - that it is in the pocket of big business , that its trade rules make it impossible to protect the environment , that its free trade agenda is bad for poor people and poor nations .
he wants to talk more to the critics and have rational arguments with them .
he says you do n't win arguments by shouting louder .
he says he wants a dialogue to make people understand that the wto really cares .
he will no doubt hear plenty of these criticisms in johannesburg at the sustainable development summit where he arrives on tuesday .
to those who say the wto desecrates the environment , he says - the wto ca n't desecrate the environment although the members sometimes do .
he says there are things going on the doha negotiations - such as moves to reduce fishing subsidies - which are what he calls " win , win , win " - pro-trade , pro-environment , and pro-development .
he believes the three can go hand in hand . watch / listen on this story supachai pantchpakdi , director general " i 'm most mindful of the needs of the less privileged members of the wto . "

he will no doubt hear plenty of these criticisms in johannesburg at the sustainable development summit where he arrives on tuesday .
to those who say the wto desecrates the environment , he says - the wto ca n't desecrate the environment although the members sometimes do .
he says there are things going on the doha negotiations - such as moves to reduce fishing subsidies - which are what he calls " win , win , win " - pro-trade , pro-environment , and pro-development .
he believes the three can go hand in hand .

the scottish grocers ' federation -lrb- sgf -rrb- predicts that crime will cost convenience stores more than £ 4m this year and hundreds of staff will be assaulted .
the sgf said small retailers are pouring more and more money into fighting crime .
last year the bill topped £ 600,000 but the first survey by the grocers ' federation suggests those efforts are failing to stem the rise in retail crime .
closure fears this year it is expected that more than 5,000 shop staff will be threatened with physical violence and 800 will be assaulted .
the sgf said that if the trend continues then stores may have to close .
it wants the scottish executive to liaise with local authorities and police forces to give more support to the trade .
a report released in july by the association of convenience stores found that four-fifths of corner shops have been victims of crime in the last year .
shoplifting in 2000 cost the scottish economy £ 181m .
the first ever crime survey from the scottish retail consortium -lrb- src -rrb- concluded that store theft and other retail crime amounted to the equivalent of £ 83-per-household .
about one tenth of scotland 's workforce - 210,000 people - are employed in the retail sector .

previous research has shown that drinking wine in sensible amounts may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease .
but the new research suggests that it might also be an effective way to reduce the risk for people who have already had one heart attack .
french researchers found that middle-aged men who had had one heart attack and who drank two or more glasses of wine regularly were 50 % less likely than non-drinkers to have a second attack .
dr michel de lorgeril , of the joseph fourier university of grenoble , france , and colleagues studied 353 men aged 40 to 60 who had just had heart attacks .
there were no significant differences in how severe their heart attacks had been , what drugs they used to treat heart disease or what they ate .
the main differences lay in whether the men drank wine .
between them , the men had 104 cardiovascular complications such as a heart attack or stroke over the next year .
thirty-six of the complications occurred among men who abstained from alcohol , 34 among men who drank fewer than two glasses of wine a day , 18 among those who drank about two glasses a day , and 16 among men who drank an average of four to five glasses of wine a day .
caution the researchers stressed that more studies are needed to better define what type of patients would most benefit from moderate drinking after a heart attack .
the american heart association recommends drinking only moderately and advises anyone who does not drink against starting to do so .
last year the aha published guidance to doctors advising them not to prescribe red wine as a way to ward off heart attacks .
us doctors have been advised not to tell their patients that drinking red wine is an effective way to ward off heart attacks .
it said the protective benefits of red wine remain uncertain , and that doctors should concentrate on promoting more proven methods to reduce risk .
professor ira goldberg , of columbia university in new york city and a member of the aha 's nutrition committee , said : " we want to make clear that there are other risk-reduction options that are well-documented and free of the potential hazards associated with alcohol consumption . "
professor sir charles george , medical director of the british heart foundation , said : " this is further evidence to drink moderate quantities of wine remain at a lower risk of having a heart attack than those who are teetotal .
" in middle age , men are much more likely to have had a heat attack than women , and consequently the findings from the study apply to middle-aged men and not more generally to other age groups . "

the flagship nikkei stock index lost 305 points - or 3.12 % - to close at 9,217.04 .
market sentiment is absolutely awful right now masaharu sakudo tachibana securities that is its lowest close since september 1983 , when it ended just one point below tuesday 's close .
firms which export goods to the us - such as sony and nissan - have been suffering from new fears over the state of the us economy .
and that in turn has created more pressure on banks , which are threatened with bad debts if the flow of firms filing for bankruptcy increases .
no buyers " part of our weakness lies in concerns about the cloudy economic outlook in the us , " said masanori hoshina , head of global portfolio marketing at bnp paribas .
" but the key problem is that there are still no signs of a sustainable economic recovery in japan . "
there are also grave doubts over the ability of the japanese economy to continue to pull itself out of a deep 15 year recession .
and new data on tuesday showed that japan 's tentative manufacturing industry faltered in august .

this region , which includes parts of cameroon , central african republic , democratic republic of congo , republic of congo and gabon , contains one of the world 's largest primary rainforests - second only to the amazon .
the major partnership plan was presented at the johannesburg sustainable development summit .
logging , shifting agriculture , population growth and the oil and mining industries are all putting pressure on the congo basin forests , which are disappearing at the rate of 0.6 % a year .
france , germany , japan , the uk and the usa will work with the world bank and a number of ngo partners to monitor and evaluate the forest ecosystem of the region , create a regional network of protected forests and better manage the harvesting of forest resources .
globally , tropical forests support more than 500 million people but , according to world bank estimates , every year an area of forest three times the size of belgium is cut down .
biodiversity and development so far , $ 90 million has been pledged for the partnership project and another $ 35 million is being sought from both public and private donors .
the united states has contributed the majority of the funds already pledged - $ 35 million .
stressing the importance of the region 's forests , a world bank report says that the protection of the forest and its diverse species is vital for sustainable economic development of the countries which make up the basin .
congo basin forests world 's 2nd largest forest contains 26 % of world 's remaining rainforest covers 2.1 million square km 62.6 million people dependent on its resources contains unique biodiversity resources this development requires " an effective strategy for biodiversity conservation and management " .
" all the project countries are heavily dependent on their natural resources , and none can afford the economic , ecological and social costs resulting from their destruction or serious impairment , " the world bank says .
it warns of the danger of ecosystem destruction and species extinction through over-exploitation of timber resources , rainforest destruction resulting from shifting agriculture and habitat loss through road construction in forest areas .
illegal logging according to the british guardian newspaper , a background paper prepared for the johannesburg summit , says that within 15 years about a fifth of all the region 's forests could be lost .
the newspaper notes that 10 years ago , the forests were " virtually untouched " but logging operations , with little or no monitoring by governments , have begun to take a heavy toll .
the environmental group global witness , employed as an independent forest resources monitor by the cameroon government , has detailed extensive illegal logging by many companies involved in legal timber extraction there .
only a few thousand lowland gorillas survive in the dr congo , illegal logging is believed to be an even more serious problem with monitoring rendered impossible by years of civil war .
seven neighbouring countries have sent troops into the dr congo and this has exacerbated the problems of illegal logging and poaching of endangered forest species for ivory or for meat .
species at risk illegal or uncontrolled logging is not only leading to the rapid depletion of valuable economic resources with minimal return for the countries involved , it is also leading to the destruction of the habitats of rare animal species .
among the endangered creatures found in the congo basin are the bonobo or pygmy chimpanzee , the western lowland gorilla , forest elephants , and apes such as the drill and the mandrill , according to the international union for the conservation of nature .
the loss of forests , cutting of roads through vital habitats and the expansion of the " bush meat " trade all threaten these and other species .
speaking at the johannesburg summit , the world-renowned ape specialist jane goodall , said that efforts to save forest and animals must bring in timber companies as well as governments and conservation groups .
she said that chimp populations had declined from two million to 200,000 over the last century and that there were only a few thousand lowland gorillas left .
while logging was the main problem , the damage caused by timber firms was wider , she said .
the bonobo or pygmy chimpanzee is under threat " when they build a road into the forest they give access to all sorts of people including hunters in the bush meat trade " , she told the reuters news agency .
bush meat -lrb- often from endangered species -rrb- was sold as a delicacy as well as being a source of food for loggers .
when loggers or hunters moved on from an area , they had often killed most of the animals and deprived local people of a whole way of life in the forests .
the new congo basin forest partnership seeks to involve timber companies through the international tropical timber organisation and the african timber organisation , as well as conservation groups such as the world wide fund for nature and global forest watch .

some schools have said they may have to send children home because of the delays .
head teachers and governors are concerned that assurances by the criminal records bureau that all checks on staff would be complete by 4 september have not been fulfilled .
schools are concerned by the disruption voluntary organisations such as st john ambulance , have also raised concerns over delays on checking their own staff .
the home office admitted on sunday that 7,000 checks on staff in the uk would not be completed by wednesday .
the checks are meant to be a " one-stop-shop " to process criminal records and checks against government blacklists of people not suitable to work with children .
they must be carried out before teachers and support staff can work with children .
we have been telling the home office for months that this situation was avoidable .
karl davies , naht in cardiff , 126 teachers are still waiting to be cleared for work .
the checks on teachers have been brought in by the uk government and come in the wake of the deaths of cambridgeshire school children holly wells and jessica chapman .
karl davies , director of the national association of head teachers in wales , said the crb procedure delays were not acceptable .
he said there should be no need for pupils to be sent home at schools where staff checks were incomplete , which has happened at some schools in england .
criminal records bureau : lengthy delays but mr davies added schools affected in wales would have to be creative with their teaching rotas to deal with the situation .
" it is something that is avoidable .
we have been telling the home office for months that this situation was avoidable .
" whereas until recently schools were able to check staff against list 99 - those people who have been convicted of an offence - the government said further checks were necessary .
" what we want to see at the beginning of the first term of the year is a good start for teachers and pupils . "
we are stockpiling problems keith dunn , st john ambulance john dunford , general secretary the secondary heads association , said it was a very bad start to the new school year .
" this is a messy , avoidable crisis that we predicted a year ago and warned the government about . "
keith dunn , of st john ambulance , said the situation for voluntary groups was also becoming serious .
" we are very concerned at the delays taking place .

in a landmark ruling , a nine-judge panel upheld an order issued last month against the brother and sister of a palestinian suspected of organising suicide bombings . "
-lsb- the ajouris -rsb- were involved in terrorism to the extent required such that they presented a reasonable possibility of danger " israeli supreme court it said a third palestinian related to another militant suspected of two shooting attacks near a jewish settlement in the west bank should be set free .
palestinian officials called the decision a " black day for human rights " and said they might file a complaint with the un security council and the international criminal court .
the militant palestinian group hamas called the ruling a " grave escalation " which " will be met by an escalation in the palestinian resistance " .
the three accused had appealed against the order , saying it was a form of collective punishment and violated international law .
israel said the move was intended to deter future attacks by palestinian militants .
militant helped the israeli army said the brother and sister - 28-year-old kifah and 34-year-old intisar ajouri - knew in advance about their brother ali 's plan to carry out attacks but did not act to prevent them .
the two are accused of providing logistical support for their brother , helping him avoid capture and having moved bombs .
the israeli army -lrb- idf -rrb- said ali ajouri masterminded several suicide attacks , including one in tel aviv on 17 july , 2002 , which killed five people and wounded 40 others .
the idf said intisar had sewn explosives into a belt used by a suicide bomber in one of the attacks .
ali ajouri was shot dead by israeli troops on 6 august , 2002 .
the court said that it " had proved that they -lsb- the ajouris -rsb- were involved in terrorism to the extent required such that they presented a reasonable possibility of danger " .
it ruled that the ajouris could be expelled from their home in the iskar refugee camp in nablus to the gaza strip for two years .
but the judges overturned an expulsion order against abdel nasser asidi , the brother a militant accused of two west bank ambushes which killed 19 israelis .
burden of proof in handing down the ruling , chief justice aharon barak said israel could only expel a suspected militant 's relative if they presented a real security threat . "
the court ruled with a loud voice that deterrence can not be a cause to take steps " leah tzemel , ajouris ' lawyer legal experts say the decision means israel can not expel people merely to deter future attacks , and that the army will have to provide proof of some form of involvement before it can issue expulsion orders .
" the court ruled with a loud voice that deterrence can not be a cause to take steps .
this is a very , very positive point , " said the ajouris ' lawyer leah tzemel .
the order against the ajouris has been condemned by human rights organisations , who say it contravenes the geneva conventions and therefore constitutes a war crime - a charge that israel denies .
the judges said they had not breached international law because the west bank and gaza formed one territorial unit and the orders were relocations rather than expulsions .
if the expulsions are carried out it will be the first time israel has expelled a palestinian from the area in which they live for 10 years .

the fire brigades ' union -lrb- fbu -rrb- will now recall its national conference later this month to vote on industrial action .
it also claimed up to 30 brigades had already imposed " work to rule " conditions , under which they only attend 999 calls .
the threat of a walkout came after talks between union leaders and local authority employers lasted less than 90 minutes , despite the presence of thousands of banner-waving firefighters on the streets outside .

the employers said they were " extremely disappointed " no agreement had been made but simply could not afford the union 's " unrealistic " demands .
andy gilchrist , the fbu 's general secretary , told the crowd how negotiations had broken down .
he said : " be very clear - the executive council are recommending national strike action .
we 're well up to the task .
it 's a difficult job .
let 's get it done . "
he added that strike action appeared inevitable .
' last chance ' " today was the employers ' last chance , " he said .
" it is my view they have already wasted valuable time and now have turned down our alternative approach towards pay . "
the union - claiming public support - wants the pay of a qualified firefighter to rise from £ 21,500 a year to £ 30,000 , plus a new formula .
syd hall , 51 , a leading oxford firefighter , said : " i 'm here to support our claim for a decent living wage .
green goddesses could return to the streets " the old pay offer has served its purpose .
it 's outdated and we 've been falling behind other workers for years .
" i was in the strike in ' 77 and if i have to do it again then i will .
" i take home just over £ 1,400 a month when i 've been a firefighter for 29 years . "
a strike would endanger lives and property , according to the employers .
charles nolda - executive director of the local government association -lrb- lga -rrb- , which employs firefighters - said industrial action would see 900 army ' green goddess ' fire engines mobilised across the uk .
but he said the cover would be less efficient than that provided by the fire authorities ' 3,000 fire engines .
work to rule the lga said a substantial pay rise would have to be considered by an independent inquiry , underwritten by the government .
but the fbu thinks the current pay formula , worked out after the last national strike in 1977 , is outdated .
since the breakdown of talks the fbu claims brigades across the uk have already imposed ' ' unofficial " action .
a pay deal was last agreed 25 years ago union officials said forces in the south west , essex , derbyshire , leicestershire , northants , norfolk , suffolk and bedfordshire were only answering 999 calls , as a sign of protest .
a spokesman for cheshire fire service said firefighters were not dealing with administrative tasks and were " filtering " non-emergency calls .
" a work to rule by firefighters in no way jeopardises public safety , " he added .
the greater manchester service operated an unofficial " work to rule " from 9am on monday , but the action finished at 6pm and there were no immediate plans to restart , a spokesman said .
the action is also being opposed by the retained firefighters union -lrb- rfu -rrb- , who represent thousands of part-time professional firefighters .
retained firefighters serve more rural areas which do not have their own full-time manned station .
each is paid a flat fee of around £ 2,000 a year and between £ 14-20 per incident they attend .
a spokesman for the rfu said : " -lsb- rfu -rsb- members follow their own written constitution which includes a no-strike policy .
" they simply do not recognise strike action and will be serving their communities as normal to ensure where possible there is no loss of life during the expected industrial action . "
