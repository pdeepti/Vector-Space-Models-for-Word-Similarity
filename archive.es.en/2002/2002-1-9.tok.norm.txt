opening the bett 2002 educational technology conference in london , the education secretary presented a promotional video showing a computer-generated model of the school of tomorrow .
beyond the office-style reception desk , students enter the school using a swipe card to take part in " self-directed learning " using the latest technology .
as a step along the road , ms morris announced a £ 100m scheme to provide teachers in england with laptop computers .
this will provide laptops for about 100,000 teachers over the next two years - although that will still leave almost twice as many without .
use of assistants information technology would revolutionise schools , she promised , acting as the " dna or the combustion engine " of education .
it would change everything from the way pupils were taught to school timetables and staffing arrangements , she said .
instead of pupils learning in conventional year groups , she suggested that children could learn at their own pace and in settings which need not be in traditional classrooms .
gifted older pupils might be studying at undergraduate level , she said , and there could be scope for learning from home .
and schools would be expected to be connected to their local communities , so that pupils could access online libraries out of school hours .
" for the first time , it allows teachers to teach pupils as individuals ... and the most able and the most disaffected can be taught in the same classroom . "
" we also need to look at how schools of the future are designed , to make sure they are able to manage current and future changes in ict . "
and the department for education would soon be producing a guide which would help schools adapt buildings for new technology , she said .
but she warned that the investment in educational technology - worth £ 1.8bn over six years - was an opportunity that would not be repeated and that schools had to show that the money was well spent .
suggesting what this money might achieve , the video showed vast , open-plan spaces containing hi-tech study areas equipped with palmtops , laptops , plasma screens and electronic whiteboards .
the classroom of the future is fast becoming a reality department for education video teachers provide " leadership " with the help of classroom assistants and on-call technical support .
the stress on the use of assistants reiterates the education secretary 's recent speeches promoting their greater use in schools .
the video 's commentary says " a fusion of teaching , learning and technology " is fast becoming a reality .
support the school becomes a place where technology allows " children of all abilities to learn at their own pace alongside one another , studying individually or in groups " - where " teachers can offer leadership to pupils with the support of a classroom assistant " .
learning support assistants provide one-to-one help for those with special needs .
" all of this is backed by the availability of technical support , so that there is no disruption to the free flow of learning and development , " it says .
the lack of affordable technical support has been one of the big complaints from schools benefiting from £ 1.8bn worth of equipment under the national grid for learning initiative .
teachers ' unions have welcomed the promise of laptops , but say it will take much more than that to transform most schools in line with the vision .
free laptops the association of teachers and lecturers said : " if there is a cautionary note to be sounded it is that ict -lsb- information and communication technology -rsb- is a valuable educational adjunct but it is no panacea .
" deep-seated problems need more than a shiny new laptop . "
the department for education sees it as crucial to the more effective use of ict that teachers have regular personal access to computers to build up their knowledge and confidence .
previous schemes have provided some 50,000 teachers with support towards purchasing their own machines .
this time , they will not have to make any financial contribution .
instead , from this summer , education authorities will be able to buy laptops which will then be owned - and maintained - by their schools .
' not enough ' priority is to be given to head teachers who do not yet have a laptop .
the national association of head teachers said the £ 100m was about half the figure recommended by the pricewaterhousecoopers ' study on reducing teachers ' workloads , but was " a real step in the right direction " .
the general secretary , david hart , said he was happy to talk to the government about its vision of the school of the future , providing this was not just an attempt to avoid dealing with the problems of the present .
word of caution " today 's recruitment and retention problems can not be solved by talking about tomorrow 's schools , " he said .
the nasuwt teachers ' union said research on the relationship between pupil performance and ict resources was inconclusive .
it was happy to encourage development of ict , recognising that it had a very useful role in education " but is most unlikely ever to be able to compensate for the active presence and motivating force of a teacher . "

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- daiei could get debt relief categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 9 january , 2002 , 06:20 gmt daiei could get debt relief daiei is one of japan 's largest retailers shares in the japanese supermarket chain daiei have jumped after a newspaper report said four of its creditors are considering ways of easing its debt burden .
the mainichi shimbun daily said that daiei 's four main creditor banks were mulling debt forgiveness through a debt-for-equity swap and other means of financial support .
the report prompted a 40 % jump in the retailer 's share price .
daiei is estimated to have debts of about 2.31 trillion yen -lrb- $ 17.5bn -rrb- and its share price has fallen in recent months as investors worried it could go the same way as rival chain mycal .
in september last year , mycal - which was japan 's fourth largest supermarket chain - filed for court protection from creditors with debts of 1.7 trillion yen .
business plan " we have begun talks with our four main creditor banks regarding a new three-year business plan , but nothing specific has been decided at this time , " daiei said in a statement .
the company is to give details of a new business plan next month which is aimed at cutting the firm 's debt burden to less than one trillion yen over five years .
the plan is seen as key to whether debt forgiveness will work .
" daiei must convince -lrb- investors -rrb- that a reduction in its debt burden would firmly pave the path for steady recovery .
otherwise , the debt waiver would have adverse implications for banks and their efforts to reduce problem loans , " said naoko nemoto at standard & poor 's .
some analysts said investors had over-reacted to the newspaper report .
" i 'm not so sure the degree of the rise that daiei 's stock is getting from this report is justified considering that the amount of forgiveness represents a small part of its overall debt , " said minoru tada at world nichiei securities .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- more bad news for gateway categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 9 january , 2002 , 06:57 gmt more bad news for gateway the struggling computer maker gateway suffered another blow late on tuesday when the ratings agency moody 's cut its credit worthiness to junk status , and warned it could downgrade it further .
the news wrapped up a grim day for the pc maker .
shares in gateway had already dropped 25 % after the company said its fourth quarter revenue would be lower than expected .
the firm also said sales would be 15 % down on the previous quarter .
all computer makers are facing tough market conditions with falling pc sales and fierce price competition .
doug audrey is principal analyst and director of finance at the us semiconductor industry association in san jose , california , he believes the industry is going through a phase of conditions - part of a cycle that is usual in the technology sector .
" part of the perception about 2001 , is that nothing like this has happened before but if you go back through the history of the technology industries , you 've had a couple of shakeouts like this happen before . "
" if you take a look at what has happened with the pc companies and disc-drive companies in 1983 and 84 , it was very similar to what happened with the dot.com companies in 2000 and 2001 . "
dell has managed to expand its market share through an aggressive price cutting strategy , while compaq and hewlett packard are attempting to merge .
cost cutting in august last year gateway said it would shed 4,600 staff - one quarter of its global workforce .
the following month it announced the closure of its european operations as it focused on its core business in the us .
but there are still few , if any , signs of a recovery in the company 's fortunes .
on tuesday it said fourth quarter revenue would be about $ 1.16bn , less than the $ 1.39bn analysts had been forecasting .
investors were alarmed at the news , and gateway 's share price ended down $ 2.56 at $ 7.69 .
" although gateway is in the early stages of its cost-saving consolidation on the u.s. market , the preannounced results show that gateway is losing grasp even on its home turf , " said credit suisse first boston analyst kevin mccarthy in a research note .
after the close of trade , moody 's cut gateway 's credit rating to junk status .
moody 's said its move reflects " growing concerns regarding the company 's ability to maintain or grow revenues and market share in the intensely competitive u.s. personal computer market .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- yen hits 3-year low against dollar categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 9 january , 2002 , 07:23 gmt yen hits 3-year low against dollar the yen has been weakening steadily for months the yen has fallen to a three-year low against the dollar , in a sign that the japanese government may be hoping to export its way out of recession .
the dollar posted its biggest one-day gain against the yen since september on tuesday , momentarily reaching a value of 132.79 yen , the japanese currency 's lowest level since late 1998 .
in tokyo trade on wednesday , the yen recovered slightly and by mid-afternoon was trading at 132.58 yen to the dollar .
the yen 's sharp fall came after japanese economy minister heizo takenaka signalled that his government does not intend to intervene in order to support the sliding currency .
" i myself do not think that the current exchange rate is misaligned with the fundamentals of japan , " he said after a meeting in washington with us economics officials .
and in tokyo , the chief cabinet secretary yasuo fukuda said the government could tolerate the dollar at 133 yen , although he cautioned against a steep fall in the value of the currency .
export boost the decline in the yen , which has now been weakening steadily for months , makes japanese exports cheaper , and hence more competitive .
mr takenaka 's comments were interpreted as a signal that the japanese government believes that the weak yen could lift the country 's stagnant economy by boosting exports .
japan is mired in its second recession in three years , caught in a deflationary spiral as consumers , unnerved by rising unemployment , continue to rein in spending .
analysts said the weak yen will boost exports , and will also help japan 's flagging stock market by boosting the yen value of japanese companies ' overseas assets .
but they stressed that a weak yen policy also has a downside .
" the other side of the coin is that the depreciation of the yen will put up material import prices in japan , and may well tip some japanese companies that are on the knife-edge at the moment into bankruptcy , " paul chertkow , head of global currency research at tokyo mitsubishi bank in london told the bbc 's world business report .
japan 's export drive will be limited by the ongoing economic downturn in the us and europe , but is likely to steal market share away from its asian rivals .
earlier this week , the korean and chinese governments both expressed concern at the impact of the weak yen on their exporters .

mr takenaka 's comments were interpreted as a signal that the japanese government believes that the weak yen could lift the country 's stagnant economy by boosting exports .
japan is mired in its second recession in three years , caught in a deflationary spiral as consumers , unnerved by rising unemployment , continue to rein in spending .
analysts said the weak yen will boost exports , and will also help japan 's flagging stock market by boosting the yen value of japanese companies ' overseas assets .
but they stressed that a weak yen policy also has a downside .
" the other side of the coin is that the depreciation of the yen will put up material import prices in japan , and may well tip some japanese companies that are on the knife-edge at the moment into bankruptcy , " paul chertkow , head of global currency research at tokyo mitsubishi bank in london told the bbc 's world business report .
japan 's export drive will be limited by the ongoing economic downturn in the us and europe , but is likely to steal market share away from its asian rivals .
earlier this week , the korean and chinese governments both expressed concern at the impact of the weak yen on their exporters .

her off-stage clothing was described as " frumpy " by critic and self proclaimed fashion guru , mr blackwell .
britney spears came second in the list for 2001 for a fashion sense said to be " a rehashed madonna on a really bad day " .
camilla parker bowles 's dress sense is attacked american r 'n'b group destiny 's child come fourth for being a " trilogy of taste-free terror hitting a crescendo of off-pitch kitsch " .
and camilla parker bowles also makes it to the top ten after she is said by mr blackwell to " pack the stylistic punch of a dilapidated yorkshire pudding . "
the dubious honour of being worst dressed woman , which has been compiled since 1960 , is usually reserved for music and movie stars .
but the bbc television presenter has become a television star in the states with the british quiz show being screened on american broadcaster nbc .
it is not her on-screen trademark black clothes that have won the attentions of mr blackwell but rather her attire when not in front of the camera .
he said she looked somewhat like " harry potter in drag .
a hogwart 's horror " .

shares in the independent uk oil company rose more than 20 % in late trade on tuesday following news of the approach .
at tuesday 's market close , the company was valued at just over £ 2.9bn -lrb- $ 4.06bn -rrb- .
since the start of the year , enterprise oil 's share price has risen on speculation that it could be a bid target .
but the company - one of the uk 's few remaining independent oil firms - has previously seemed determined to avoid the consolidation which has swept through the rest of the industry .
in a statement on tuesday , the company confirmed that it had " recently received an unsolicited approach from a third party regarding a possible offer for the company , which has been rejected . "
it gave no further details of the approach and did not name the bidder .
several potential bidders analysts say the depressed share prices seen in recent months have made it cheaper for oil companies to expand through takeovers rather than organic expansion .
and there appear to be several potential bidders for enterprise .
eni , which bought lasmo in 2000 for £ 2.7bn , and partners enterprise oil in italy , may be the winner .
but other names mentioned as possible suitors have included the canadian firm talisman energy and the us -based firms amerada hess and conoco .
" it could be any number of companies with sufficiently deep pockets , " said tony alves , oil analyst at investec bank .
" enterprise is a high quality company which has been trading at a very low valuation relative to its assets and growth potential . "

rail , maritime and transport union -lrb- rmt -rrb- members working for arriva trains northern have announced two 48-hour strikes , on 24 and 25 january and 5 and 6 february .
and the union has announced a third 48-hour strike , on 24 and 25 january , on south west trains -lrb- swt -rrb- , which serves much of the south-east and london .
future strikes arriva : 24/25 january and 5/6 february swt : 24/25 january inter-city routes across the pennines , regional railways across the north and north-east and local services on merseyside could be affected by the arriva northern action .
passengers at leeds station said the news was " very frustrating " .
one told bbc radio 5 live : " i ca n't see that the continued privatisation of the railways works .
god forbid we may have to go back to some sort of nationalisation but at least there was some element of national control over what was then going on . "
the second swt strike , which ended at midnight on tuesday , caused severe disruption , with swt saying it ran only about 400 of 1,700 trains on tuesday , and even fewer on monday .
further delays are expected on wednesday morning because of knock-on effects such as trains being in the wrong station .
the disruption has led to renewed criticism of transport secretary stephen byers , with shadow transport secretary theresa may accusing him of presiding over " ongoing chaos on the nation 's railways " .
but tony blair 's spokesman said the prime minister had " absolute confidence " in his minister .
the government , which has repeatedly maintained it would not intervene in the rail dispute , is also denying reports in the guardian on wednesday that it sent in a go-between to try to end the action .
the paper reports that labour mp keith hill , former political officer to the rmt , pressed swt to impose a pay offer - a move which appears to have backfired .
arriva talks the third swt strike was called after the rmt rejected a 7.6 % pay offer from the company .
swt managing director andrew haines said the offer should be enough to break the deadlock , after " exhaustive talks and four damaging strike days " .
but the rmt expressed outrage that the company had announced the rise to the press before the union , and had tried to force the offer on its members .
rmt members say swt 's imposed pay rise of 7.6 % is over two years , and that it is their first pay rise for two years .
acting general secretary vernon hince said the management had been " arrogant and belligerent " in trying to unilaterally impose a settlement .
he added that swt had been refusing to talk to union officials - but that a meeting with arriva bosses was arranged .
the arriva action is aimed at narrowing pay differences between guards and drivers .
rail disruption has also been continuing in scotland .
only about 75 % of trains are running , as drivers continue an unofficial overtime ban on scotrail , completely separate from the rmt action .
the dispute began at the end of last month , after the company offered a 3 % increase but drivers wanted 22 % .

the 28 branches it currently operates will be consolidated into eight , and the workforce will be chopped from 1,700 to just 500 .

fast retailing saw its shares fell by their daily limit of 2,000 yen to 10,550 yen - a drop of nearly 16 % - and traders say they could fall further .
" the market has been hit over the head again by the realisation that this is not a growth stock anymore , " said takehiko takachio at kokusai asset management .
the slump was triggered after the company said its profits would fall for the first time in 14 years .
" sales are projected to fall below our earlier estimate because a uniqlo boom has calmed down with a reduced amount of purchases per person , " said japan-based fast retailing .
consumer spending in japan has stalled as the world 's second biggest economy grapples with recession .
unemployment is at its highest level since world war two .
" our customers ' inclination for low prices is increasing , " fast retailing acknowledged .
fast reversal falling sales at uniqlo are expected to reduce profits by 24 % in the 12 months to august 2002 , the company said .
in the past , fast retailing 's growth has lived up to its name : its shares rocketed upwards by 2,000 % over a two year period , peaking last may .
uniqlo has become known for cheap , good-quality , casual clothing - such as fleeces - with a preference for primary colours , and has often been compared to the gap brand .
uniqlo insists it wants to sell to all age-groups and its tv adverts promote the brand as active-wear for 50-year olds as well as twenty-somethings .
global brand plans during 2001 , it opened its first overseas stores , targeting britain as part of what it wants to become a chain of 50 uk shops by the end of next year .
" i want to make uniqlo a global casual clothing brand , like britain 's marks & spencer and gap of the united states , " said company president tadashi yanai when he unveiled the expansion .
but with a handful of stores in london , overseas sales are still a long way from being able to buffer fast retailing against the slowdown in its home market .
so impressive has fast 's past growth been , that news it was about to issue a trading update sent its shares higher on the tokyo stock exchange .
but the news when it came was of an end to 13 years of expansion .
" having had a dreadful previous few months , they 're basically saying the next few months are going to be no better , " said jeremy tonkin of commerzbank securities in tokyo .
food store venture with eight months of its financial year still to go , fast cut its sales estimates by 18.8 % from its october guidance .
sales are now expected to be 6.8 % lower than the previous financial year , at 390bn yen -lrb- $ 2.9bn ; £ 2.04bn -rrb- .
annual profits are seen at 45bn yen , down 24 % on the previous year and 33.8 % from what was hoped for in august .
fast said it plans to enter the food business in the autumn , selling mostly fruit and vegetables in specialist stores and via the internet .
in a bid to support its share-price , it will buy back up to 12bn yen of its own shares .
then , in april , it will increase the number of its shares , which is likely to make them more readily available to private investors .

no , few people have .
so it may come as a surprise that online travel companies are showing a rare resilience to the cold wind blowing through the leisure industry .
online travel spend -lrb- $ bn -rrb- europe 2000:2.4 2001:5.8 2002:12.7 north america 2000:6.4 2001:11.0 2002:18.7 uk 2000:0.8 2001:1.8 2002:3.7 source : datamonitor since 11 september , airlines and travel companies have felt the pain of both an economic slowdown and a sharp fall-off in demand .
analysts at ac nielsen estimate that bookings for holidays next summer have fallen by about 40 % since 11 september .
however , paul richer , a senior partner at the travel technology consultancy , genesys , believes the online operators are in a strong position to capitalise on the slowdown .
" the online companies have better tools to survive the blip , " he says .
survival tactics websites , for example , have been able to promote the latest ticket prices , particularly at a time when they are being slashed on a day-to-day basis , to tempt travellers back into the air .
hotels on expedia could change their prices in an illustration of this , hotels advertising on the travel agency site expedia changed prices on a 24-hour basis through an extranet after 11 september .
similarly , travel sites can e-mail a wide customer base with relative ease to promote special deals .
the economic realities have " forced online companies to be more efficient in running their businesses " , adds tony hart , a managing analyst with datamonitor .
taking advantage such tactics have driven the recent success of discount airlines - which tend to sell their tickets online - in maintaining sales .
but pure-play online travel companies have also benefited .
expedia took an initial knock from 11 september , but then saw its transaction volumes recover by 80-85 % during october .
lastminute is among the most popular uk travel sites " like every travel company , we experienced a downturn , but we then recovered a lot more quickly than the traditional industry , " says james vaile , managing director of expedia in the uk .
webhancer , which measures consumer usage of the internet , also reported that overall traffic to travel sites was 104 % higher than pre-11 september levels by the beginning of october .
the evidence suggests that advertising of special fares helped to bring surfers back to the travel sites , despite the concerns about world travel .
in the uk , lastminute.com remained the most visited site , ahead of ebookers.com , expedia and some of the discount airlines such as easyjet and ryanair .
delayed bookings online travel sites are also well positioned to exploit the recent procrastination by consumers in booking holidays .
customers are booking holidays later than usual " people are booking later than usual this year and the internet is a natural place to hunt down last-minute bargains , " says mr richer .
nevertheless , it is less easy to convert the renewed interest in travel sites into a profit for the company concerned .
" i do n't think more people want to travel , it 's just a question of capturing those who will , " points out mr richer .
expedia 's mr vaile also admits that sales are euphemistically " still growing " even though traffic to his site has jumped .
an online traveller ...
travels 4-6 times a year has higher disposable income than non-online users travels for work favours short-haul city trips source : expedia the site has revised down its forecast for annual profits in june to $ 40m from $ 50m .
mr vaile hopes that by establishing expedia as a source of valuable information , surfers will return to the site when they actually want to book a holiday .
meanwhile , ebookers , which sells scheduled flights , has been forced to cut 20 % of its staff since 11 september , in spite of improving its financial performance in its last set of results .
similarly , priceline.com in europe has eliminated most of its jobs in london , in a widespread restructuring .
even lastminute.com , which maintains it will break even in 2004 , admits it is managing to beat rivals because of its wide-ranging products outside the travel sector .
clicks and mortar the online arena , however , remains an important outlet , prompting established tour operators such as airtours to continue investing in their e-commerce strategies .
in the past few weeks , airtours launched a website called mytravel.com to both promote and sell its package holidays online .
most travel sites find it relatively easy to sell airfares , hotel accommodation and car hire online , but packages have proved more difficult .
technology to manage the complex pricing for packages - including the number of people and available accommodation to coincide with desired flight times - is generally not available for the web , says mike cogan , a partner at the travel consultancy , equinus .
expedia , for example , drives customers to a call centre to buy packages .
" -lsb- these customers -rsb- usually need hand-holding and access to more information , " says mr vaile .
airtours ' mytravel.com , however , uses home-grown software to execute sales online , says a spokeswoman .
she adds that the company has sold " quite a few " packages online already , but declines to give precise numbers .
converting calls nevertheless , the interactivity of good travel sites tends to increase the chances of a sale , even if it is made through the call centre , points out equinus 's mr cogan .
" the call conversion rates from websites are three times better than on teletext , " he says , explaining that customers are able to do their research before committing to the holiday .
all of these advantages " could put online sites in a good position as long as they manage their costs right , " concludes mr cogan .
expedia 's mr vaile is equally positive .
" -lsb- the downturn -rsb- has proved to suppliers our real worth .
they used to ask ' what value does an electronic distributor add to the chain ? '
" and now all of a sudden they can see the value .

similarly , travel sites can e-mail a wide customer base with relative ease to promote special deals .
the economic realities have " forced online companies to be more efficient in running their businesses " , adds tony hart , a managing analyst with datamonitor .
taking advantage such tactics have driven the recent success of discount airlines - which tend to sell their tickets online - in maintaining sales .
but pure-play online travel companies have also benefited .
expedia took an initial knock from 11 september , but then saw its transaction volumes recover by 80-85 % during october .
" like every travel company , we experienced a downturn , but we then recovered a lot more quickly than the traditional industry , " says james vaile , managing director of expedia in the uk .
webhancer , which measures consumer usage of the internet , also reported that overall traffic to travel sites was 104 % higher than pre-11 september levels by the beginning of october .
the evidence suggests that advertising of special fares helped to bring surfers back to the travel sites , despite the concerns about world travel .
in the uk , lastminute.com remained the most visited site , ahead of ebookers.com , expedia and some of the discount airlines such as easyjet and ryanair .
delayed bookings online travel sites are also well positioned to exploit the recent procrastination by consumers in booking holidays .
" people are booking later than usual this year and the internet is a natural place to hunt down last-minute bargains , " says mr richer .
nevertheless , it is less easy to convert the renewed interest in travel sites into a profit for the company concerned .
" i do n't think more people want to travel , it 's just a question of capturing those who will , " points out mr richer .
expedia 's mr vaile also admits that sales are euphemistically " still growing " even though traffic to his site has jumped .
an online traveller ...
travels 4-6 times a year has higher disposable income than non-online users travels for work favours short-haul city trips source : expedia the site has revised down its forecast for annual profits in june to $ 40m from $ 50m .
mr vaile hopes that by establishing expedia as a source of valuable information , surfers will return to the site when they actually want to book a holiday .
meanwhile , ebookers , which sells scheduled flights , has been forced to cut 20 % of its staff since 11 september , in spite of improving its financial performance in its last set of results .
similarly , priceline.com in europe has eliminated most of its jobs in london , in a widespread restructuring .
even lastminute.com , which maintains it will break even in 2004 , admits it is managing to beat rivals because of its wide-ranging products outside the travel sector .
clicks and mortar the online arena , however , remains an important outlet , prompting established tour operators such as airtours to continue investing in their e-commerce strategies .
in the past few weeks , airtours launched a website called mytravel.com to both promote and sell its package holidays online .
most travel sites find it relatively easy to sell airfares , hotel accommodation and car hire online , but packages have proved more difficult .
technology to manage the complex pricing for packages - including the number of people and available accommodation to coincide with desired flight times - is generally not available for the web , says mike cogan , a partner at the travel consultancy , equinus .
expedia , for example , drives customers to a call centre to buy packages .
" -lsb- these customers -rsb- usually need hand-holding and access to more information , " says mr vaile .
airtours ' mytravel.com , however , uses home-grown software to execute sales online , says a spokeswoman .
she adds that the company has sold " quite a few " packages online already , but declines to give precise numbers .
converting calls nevertheless , the interactivity of good travel sites tends to increase the chances of a sale , even if it is made through the call centre , points out equinus 's mr cogan .
" the call conversion rates from websites are three times better than on teletext , " he says , explaining that customers are able to do their research before committing to the holiday .
all of these advantages " could put online sites in a good position as long as they manage their costs right , " concludes mr cogan .
expedia 's mr vaile is equally positive .
" -lsb- the downturn -rsb- has proved to suppliers our real worth .
they used to ask ' what value does an electronic distributor add to the chain ? '
" and now all of a sudden they can see the value . "

" banks in euro hold-up " was the front page headline of france soir that neatly summed up many consumers ' thoughts over the past week .
the newspaper went on to list its readers ' grievances .
these include accusations that some banks have been simply refusing to change francs for euros .
others allowed only their own customers to change money and turned away any others trying to offload their last francs .
economics minister laurent fabius gave the banks a rap over the knuckles for this behaviour and told them they had to rise to the challenge that their central role in the euro changeover presented .
confusion all round colette cova of the fbf , the french banking federation , said the problem was due to people not behaving as the banks had expected .
" we thought people would come to the banks with large sums to change them into euros and would use smaller sums to make purchases in shops , " she said .
" but in fact almost the opposite happened , and this is what led to long queues in banks . "
another more serious accusation is that french banks are using the arrival of the european currency to bring in new charges for their customers .
banks here are the only ones in europe which do not charge for using cheques or for making withdrawals from cash dispensers .
there have been various attempts over the past 15 years to introduce such charges , but they have always been defeated by consumer and political hostility .
charges on the way since 1 january however there has been a flurry of hints from senior bank officials that things could soon change .
the french banking federation rejects the suggestion that the euro is being used as a cover for sneaking in new charges .
" we have always said that after the euro this matter would have to be looked at , " says the fbf 's colette cova .
" there is a need for french banks to harmonise their practices with their european counterparts . "
madame cova adds that apart from lengthy queues in banks , the switch to the euro went remarkably well .
a one-day strike by bank workers on 2 january , the first day of opening in the new year , was followed by only a small minority and few bank branches had to remain closed .
no problems in paris bruno milano , director of a paris branch of the ccf bank , says that the arrival of the new currency was relatively smooth .
" it went as we expected it would , " he says .
" by one o 'clock in the morning on 1 january all ccf cash dispensers across france had switched to distributing euros . "
mr milano 's branch is in the 11th arrondissement of the city , not far from the bastille area .
his 18-strong staff look after the accounts of several thousand customers .
most of these are businesses , with individual accounts making up around 30 % of the total .
" the first and second day of opening after the new year there was about double the usual number of customers in this branch .
this week we 're had about 30 % or 40 % more customers per day . "
" we had no reports of serious problems from our customers who run shops , " says mr milano .
" we 'd given these shopkeepers a " euro check-up " last year to find out how much they 'd need and we were able to distribute what they asked for . "
the franc notes received in the branch are quickly sent to the basement vault .
there a pair of workers are busy with the " trouilloteuse " , a hand-operated machine that punches holes in the notes to render them invalid before they are sent back to the banque de france for destruction . ^ ^ back to top -pipe- bbc news home -pipe- bbc homepage -pipe- feedback -pipe- ©
