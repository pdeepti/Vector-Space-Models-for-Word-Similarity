but the latest uninvited guests to arrive on its southern coasts seem to have caught the government off guard .
their presence has revealed deep political divisions on immigration as a humanitarian and a security problem .
some 928 migrants - mainly iraqi kurds - arrived in the sicilian port of catania on sunday , crammed into a rusting hulk of a ship .
hardline minister umberto bossi said the refugees should be sent home there was nowhere to house them on the island , where all accommodation centres are full of others who have arrived in recent weeks - including several hundred tamils from sri lanka .
the kurds were ferried to the mainland and sent by bus to bari , in puglia .
they are being housed in caravans and prefabricated huts in a camp used for refugees during the balkans war , while they are identified and their asylum requests processed .
hardline party the northern league , which has made the fight against illegal immigration a party cause , has attacked the centre-right coalition for " handling immigration badly " .
in an interview , party leader umberto bossi - who is also a cabinet minister - said the government was not tackling the issue of what he called " the hordes " .
the monica was italy 's largest boatload of refugees in years he said there must be a super commissioner with special powers , to avoid energy being dispersed between the interior , defence and foreign affairs ministries .

the criticism was dismissed as absurd , unfair and unacceptable by other members of the government , who underlined that when people , including women and children , were there they could not simply be turned back .
political analysts suggest the league fears being swallowed up in the coalition and is pushing for a crackdown on immigration to preserve its identity .
president carlo azeglio ciampi , who rarely intervenes directly in the political debate , gave a thinly veiled rebuke to mr bossi .
speaking to an audience of administrators in the veneto region , a heartland of the league , he said in emergencies " the humanitarian element can not but prevail " .
new powers yet the row reveals the frustration of the entire coalition - which made immigration a key campaign issue - that while it has tabled a new , much tougher immigration law , it can not stop the flood of desperate people seeking a better life .

the italian cabinet was set to decide on wednesday on a state of emergency to tackle the immigration crisis .
this would give wider powers to the central government delegates in the provinces who would be able to requisition properties for use as accommodation centres .
it would also free up funds to build new centres and allow the traffickers ' vessels to be destroyed as soon as they are confiscated .

the decision threatens to re-open a cabinet row over the sale of the Â£ 28m bae systems device , which was approved with the award of an export licence last december .
ms short said tanzania , one of the world 's poorest countries , could have opted for an adequate alternative which cost a quarter of the price .
the department for international development -lrb- dfid -rrb- has confirmed the aid has been delayed until a report into whether the african state has breached its commitments to alleviate poverty is completed .
moral duty the decision to allow bae systems to sell tanzania the equipment prompted a cabinet row , with ms short and chancellor gordon brown opposing the sale .
they said supporters of the deal - including tony blair , trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt and defence secretary geoff hoon - were wrong because tanzania was receiving international money to tackle food shortages .
after the deal went through ms short told the bbc the government had a moral duty to put concern for the world 's poor above commercial interests .
the tanzanian president , benjamin mkapa , has said his country needs it to ensure air safety .
' no rift ' ms short denied the decision to hold back the aid was aimed at reopening the rift with her colleagues .
she said : " there is no cabinet rift .
the export licence has been granted .
" the decision to delay the release of budgetary support pending a review of tanzania 's air traffic control system was based on tanzania 's commitment to poverty reduction . "
dfid officials said the department was awaiting the outcome of an inquiry by the international civil aviation organisation -lrb- icao -rrb- into whether the purchase breached tanzania 's poverty reduction strategy .
the icao 's report was expected to be published next week .
one official said : " if it is found that tanzania is not sticking to its poverty reduction strategy , then there will be an issue in releasing that budgetary support . " watch / listen on this story talking point radar deal is the uk 's deal with tanzania justified ?

it had been hoped that the welsh capital 's success in staging the party 's spring conference , which was attended by the prime minister , would act as a prelude to attracting the meeting .
tony blair : speaker however , the party will officially reject the city 's bid next week , saying the city does not have enough hotel rooms to house delegates .
labour 's annual conference is one of the largest political events in europe , attracting thousands of delegates , media and exhibitors .
it is a money spinner for the host town or city , despite the security costs .
cardiff 's hopes were high after last month 's successful spring conference in the city .
prime minister tony blair and home secretary david blunkett were among the high-profile speakers at the event .
but when labour 's national executive meets next tuesday , the capital 's bid to host the money-spinning event is expected to be rejected .
the party believes that cardiff does not have enough low-cost hotel accommodation for delegates .
officials also say cardiff international arena is too small to accommodate the number of people expected to attend .
security was tight for the last conference labour is expected to choose a traditional seaside venue like brighton or bournemouth instead .
last month one of the biggest security operations ever seen in wales was mounted for the three-day labour spring conference in the city .
armed police , military specialists and officers from five forces were called in as added security measures for senior labour politicians .
it was the biggest security operation in wales since world leaders attended the european summit four years ago .
the conference hall was double checked for explosives and divers sealed the city 's sewers .
an air exclusion zone was even set up above the city centre .
the tightening in security was partly in response to the increased terrorist threat sparked by the 11 september attacks in the us .

bbc world service 's arts in action programme investigated its success .
there are more than 50 versions of the millionaire format around the world , in which contestants compete for ever-spiralling amounts of money by answering general knowledge questions .
in the case of the arabic version , the final jackpot is equivalent to a quarter of a million dollars .
taped in cairo by the saudi-owned mbc satellite channel , who wants to win a million ? , as it is known in arabic , is hosted by the sharp-suited , presenter george kurdahi .
with a version of the catchphrase , " is that your final answer ? " - " jawaab nihaa 'ee ? " - suave kurdahi has become a household name .
sex symbol kurdahi said the show goes beyond just entertainment .
he recently told the egyptian press : " i would n't be exaggerating if i say that this programme brings the whole arab world together .
smooth operator : kurdahi " it brings it together despite all the contradictions of the arab world . "
however , rhola kharsa , an egyptian journalist based in cairo , told the bbc she thinks that kurdahi has in fact " divided " audiences .
" men do n't really like him as a person " , she said , " but women adore him . "
kurdahi , famous for his slicked back hair and designer outfits , teases contestants as they deliberate over their answers .
however , the lebanese presenter has refuted claims that he is an object of desire .
" people like my personality ; they find it close to themselves , their thinking and their feelings , but not to the degree that i 'm a sex symbol or elvis presley , " he said .
veiled love him or hate him , twice a week arab viewers in asia , africa , europe , north and south america tune in to watch the show from across the arab-speaking world .
winners can receive a million saudi riyals -lrb- $ 270,000 -rrb- open to both male and female contestants , rhola kharsa believes that by including veiled women the programme has increased its audience .
" female veiled contestants are very new for the tv , " she said .
" they are completely veiled .
you can just see their eyes ; they are never usually shown on tv . "
' anti-islam ' meanwhile , money remains the ultimate incentive .
since its first broadcast in november 2000 , two contestants have taken the top prize of one million saudi riyals .
according to hosam sokkari , head of bbcarabic.com : " the idea of being a millionaire overnight must certainly appeal to an audience whose majority suffers from poverty and unemployment . "
however , it is the gambling element of the show that has in the past attracted strong opposition .
in june 2001 , egypt 's highest religious authority , grand mufti , issued a fatwa , or religious edict , calling the game show sinful and a form of gambling .
the arabic world is suffering from a cultural emptiness rhola kharsa , egyptian journalist this claim was later contradicted by the sheikh of cairo 's al-azhar university - one of the highest authorities in sunni islam - who ruled that game shows offering big cash prizes are legitimate since they spread general knowledge .
in rhola kharsa 's view , it is the programme 's ability to feed audiences ' minds that has led to the shows continued success .
" the arabic world is suffering from a cultural emptiness , " she said .
" people do n't read anymore .
they do n't have the time as they are running all day after money and earning money . "
" this programme presents a short dinner of information and at the end at least they can remember two or three things . " watch / listen on this story rhola kharsa speaks to bbc world service " men do n't really like him as a person , but women adore him . "

emi said the revamp will cost a total of Â£ 110m -lrb- $ 154m -rrb- to push through , but should generate annual cost savings of Â£ 98.5m.

karl auerbach , one of the elected directors for icann , has filed a lawsuit against the group to gain the access to its records he says he has previously been denied .
mr auerbach wants to see details of staff salaries , travel records and information about the day-to-day running of the organisation .
a civil liberties group , the electronic frontier foundation , is representing mr auerbach in the legal battle .
dangerous times since being elected in december 2000 , mr auerbach says he has repeatedly asked to see the records of icann -lrb- the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -rrb- .
bucharest will see a showdown over plans to re-organise icann mr auerbach was elected to represent us and canadian web-user interests on the icann board .
the organisation is registered in california as a non-profit corporation and under the laws of the us state is required to let its directors know how the organisation is being run .
" icann management has denied me the tools i need to exercise independent judgment and fulfil my duties as director , " mr auerbach said in a statement .
' static bureaucracy ' he claims to have been offered access to the records only if he signs a binding confidentiality agreement - an offer he says he has refused .
since december 2000 , mr auerbach has been a persistent critic of icann , claiming that the organisation is badly run , secretive and takes too long to make decisions .
in an e-mail sent to bbc news online , mr auerbach said that without the oversight provided by its directors , icann was in danger of becoming a static bureaucracy in which staff , rather than the organisation 's elected representatives , dictated policy .
icann has yet to comment on the lawsuit .
under a re-organisation plan floated by icann head stuart lynn last month , mr auerbach looks likely to lose his post as an icann director .
the final vote on the proposed changes to icann will take place at the icann meeting set for 24-28 june in bucharest , romania .
