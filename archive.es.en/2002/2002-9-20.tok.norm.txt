it 's placed a further strain on fraying german-u.s. ties . the already soured political relationship between germany and the united states was dealt a further blow on thursday after highly controversial statements by german justice minister herta däublin-gmelin were made public .
the german newspaper schwäbische tagblatt reported yesterday that the minister of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in a discussion with trade unionists said that president bush wanted to divert attention from domestic political problems through a war against iraq .
she said hitler had employed much the same tactics .
" that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it , " the paper quoted däublin-gmelin as saying .
däubler-gmelin herself has strongly protested the way the newspaper has portrayed her comments .
" i simply didn ’ t say that , " she said on thursday .
the minister said that she did not compare bush as a person to hitler , but only their methods .
" i did not equate bush with hitler , " she said .
she called the newspaper report a " distorted view " and " slanderous " .
us furious over anti-american statements her remarks have drawn swift condemnation from the united states .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said , " the usa and germany have a very long and valuable relationship and the relations between the people of the usa and germany are very important to the americans .
but this statement of the minister is outrageous and inexplicable . "
senator jesse helms , the ranking republican on the senate foreign relations committee , released a statement saying he and other members of congress were " appalled " by the anti-american tenor of the german campaign .
" if chancellor schröder succeeds in winning re-election through america-bashing then the u.s. congress must seriously consider moving u.s. forces out of germany and stationing them on the territory of other nato allies , " the statement said .
outrage at home too even within germany , which goes to the polls on sunday , the minister ’ s statements have led to a storm of protest .
in a campaign that has seen chancellor schröder ’ s spd pull ahead of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- partly due to schröder ’ s anti-war rhetoric and unrelenting stance on joining the u.s. in a war against iraq , the minister ’ s comments have been seized upon by the opposition .
the christian democrats and its sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have strongly criticised the minister and called for her resignation .
the cdu argued that the spd was " deliberately trying to create the impression that the real opponent is bush and not saddam hussein . "
thomas goppel , a spokesman for the cdu told reuters , " this shows what schröder and his social democrats really think of our american allies . "
general secretary of the cdu laurenz meyer spoke of an " unbelievable slip-up " on the part of the minister while the csu is demanding that chancellor schröder fire the minister before elections on sunday .
even washington ’ s ambassador to berlin , daniel coats is reported to have conveyed his displeasure to the german government .
german media unsparingly critical newspaper editorials in the country were highly critical of the minister on friday .
" a cabinet member who makes such comparisons and does not apologise should be fired , if not by the chancellor , then by the voters , " read the editorial in the country ’ s largest-selling newspaper , bild .
the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung titled its editorial , " finished " .
" herta däubler-gmelin can not , will not be a member of the next german cabinet , " the paper said .
" she 's locked in a way of thinking that can not be reconciled with germany 's foreign policy interests . "
spd-greens stand by minister chancellor schröder has defended däubler-gmelin and said that he doubted the minister actually uttered what the newspaper quoted .
he stressed that , " if somebody likened the american president with such crimes , the person would have no place in the government . "
the legal expert for the greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder ’ s government , volker beck said that the accusations against the minister were an " infamous slander campaign " .
schröder risking ties with u.s. a possible war against iraq has dominated the german election campaign in the past few weeks , sidelining issues such as unemployment and the economy .
chancellor schröder ’ s spd , which was trailing the opposition cdu for a long time , has suddenly recovered lost ground with the chancellor ’ s hard anti-war line and inched past the cdu with just two days to go before elections .
but chancellor schröder has been accused of blatant electioneering by the u.s. and critics within germany , using his unbending stance against america ’ s proposed military strikes against iraq to win over pacifist voters .
schröder is widely seen as risking his close relationship to the u.s. for the sake of holding on to power .
on wednesday , u.s. government advisor richard perle told the financial times deutschland " for us , it looks as if the chancellor is distancing himself from an old friend -lrb- the u.s. -rrb- in order to gain a few seats .

but the government has to overcome security and financial hurdles before online voting in germany becomes a reality . do you dread waiting in line at a polling station for your turn to place the all-important cross on the ballot papers ?
internet voting could be the answer .
it ’ s practical , easy and saves time .
only problem is , it ’ s not here yet .
but as germans head to their respective polling districts on sunday , they can rest easy in the knowledge that the next time they go to vote in four years , they can simply head to any polling station of their choice .
ambitious plans for digital voting the german interior ministry has now contracted a working group to take care of the technological aspects of networking all 80,000 polling districts in germany by 2006 , thus making internet voting a second option to traditional voting at the poll station .
going a step further , the government ambitiously also hopes to enable all german citizens to vote over their own computers from the comfort of their homes by 2010 .
advocates of online voting argue that it could help speed up polling results , make the tallying more accurate , be more cost-friendly in the long run and contribute towards an increasingly mobile society .

security concerns are the main hindrances that could block the speedy realisation of internet voting .
of special importance is ensuring that only eligible voters cast their votes and only once at that .

privacy and money concerns protecting the anonymity of the voter is another serious security worry .
the digital vote functions much like the traditional vote – the ballots are available over the internet , and all the citizen needs to do is place a cross with the click of the mouse and then confirm with a so-called signature card .
but it ’ s vital that the recipient of the ballot is not able to trace the sender .
research is still being carried out on the signature card to make it 100 percent fool-proof .
christoph meinel , a technology expert at the university of trier told the german news agency dpa that everyone should be sure that no software producer , network operator or even a virus could affect the voter ’ s ballot in an unauthorised manner .
" it shouldn ’ t be possible to trace the ballot paper of a voter , vote more than once or to change a vote , " meinel said .

it 's placed a further strain on fraying german-u.s. ties . the already soured political relationship between germany and the united states was dealt a further blow on thursday after highly controversial statements by german justice minister herta däublin-gmelin were made public .
the german newspaper schwäbische tagblatt reported yesterday that the minister of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in a discussion with trade unionists said that president bush wanted to divert attention from domestic political problems through a war against iraq .
she said hitler had employed much the same tactics .
" that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it , " the paper quoted däublin-gmelin as saying .
däubler-gmelin herself has strongly protested the way the newspaper has portrayed her comments .
" i simply didn ’ t say that , " she said on thursday .
the minister said that she did not compare bush as a person to hitler , but only their methods .
" i did not equate bush with hitler , " she said .
she called the newspaper report a " distorted view " and " slanderous " .
us furious over anti-american statements her remarks have drawn swift condemnation from the united states .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said , " the usa and germany have a very long and valuable relationship and the relations between the people of the usa and germany are very important to the americans .
but this statement of the minister is outrageous and inexplicable . "
senator jesse helms , the ranking republican on the senate foreign relations committee , released a statement saying he and other members of congress were " appalled " by the anti-american tenor of the german campaign .
" if chancellor schröder succeeds in winning re-election through america-bashing then the u.s. congress must seriously consider moving u.s. forces out of germany and stationing them on the territory of other nato allies , " the statement said .
outrage at home too even within germany , which goes to the polls on sunday , the minister ’ s statements have led to a storm of protest .
in a campaign that has seen chancellor schröder ’ s spd pull ahead of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- partly due to schröder ’ s anti-war rhetoric and unrelenting stance on joining the u.s. in a war against iraq , the minister ’ s comments have been seized upon by the opposition .
the christian democrats and its sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have strongly criticised the minister and called for her resignation .
the cdu argued that the spd was " deliberately trying to create the impression that the real opponent is bush and not saddam hussein . "
thomas goppel , a spokesman for the cdu told reuters , " this shows what schröder and his social democrats really think of our american allies . "
general secretary of the cdu laurenz meyer spoke of an " unbelievable slip-up " on the part of the minister while the csu is demanding that chancellor schröder fire the minister before elections on sunday .
even washington ’ s ambassador to berlin , daniel coats is reported to have conveyed his displeasure to the german government .
german media unsparingly critical newspaper editorials in the country were highly critical of the minister on friday .
" a cabinet member who makes such comparisons and does not apologise should be fired , if not by the chancellor , then by the voters , " read the editorial in the country ’ s largest-selling newspaper , bild .
the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung titled its editorial , " finished " .
" herta däubler-gmelin can not , will not be a member of the next german cabinet , " the paper said .
" she 's locked in a way of thinking that can not be reconciled with germany 's foreign policy interests . "
spd-greens stand by minister chancellor schröder has defended däubler-gmelin and said that he doubted the minister actually uttered what the newspaper quoted .
he stressed that , " if somebody likened the american president with such crimes , the person would have no place in the government . "
the legal expert for the greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder ’ s government , volker beck said that the accusations against the minister were an " infamous slander campaign " .
schröder risking ties with u.s. a possible war against iraq has dominated the german election campaign in the past few weeks , sidelining issues such as unemployment and the economy .
chancellor schröder ’ s spd , which was trailing the opposition cdu for a long time , has suddenly recovered lost ground with the chancellor ’ s hard anti-war line and inched past the cdu with just two days to go before elections .
but chancellor schröder has been accused of blatant electioneering by the u.s. and critics within germany , using his unbending stance against america ’ s proposed military strikes against iraq to win over pacifist voters .
schröder is widely seen as risking his close relationship to the u.s. for the sake of holding on to power .
on wednesday , u.s. government advisor richard perle told the financial times deutschland " for us , it looks as if the chancellor is distancing himself from an old friend -lrb- the u.s. -rrb- in order to gain a few seats .

but the government has to overcome security and financial hurdles before online voting in germany becomes a reality . do you dread waiting in line at a polling station for your turn to place the all-important cross on the ballot papers ?
internet voting could be the answer .
it ’ s practical , easy and saves time .
only problem is , it ’ s not here yet .
but as germans head to their respective polling districts on sunday , they can rest easy in the knowledge that the next time they go to vote in four years , they can simply head to any polling station of their choice .
ambitious plans for digital voting the german interior ministry has now contracted a working group to take care of the technological aspects of networking all 80,000 polling districts in germany by 2006 , thus making internet voting a second option to traditional voting at the poll station .
going a step further , the government ambitiously also hopes to enable all german citizens to vote over their own computers from the comfort of their homes by 2010 .
advocates of online voting argue that it could help speed up polling results , make the tallying more accurate , be more cost-friendly in the long run and contribute towards an increasingly mobile society .

security concerns are the main hindrances that could block the speedy realisation of internet voting .
of special importance is ensuring that only eligible voters cast their votes and only once at that .
the government also wants to emphasise that voting online is principally an added option – no one will be forced to vote over the internet , but can always choose to vote the traditional way by personally going to the poll station .
privacy and money concerns protecting the anonymity of the voter is another serious security worry .
the digital vote functions much like the traditional vote – the ballots are available over the internet , and all the citizen needs to do is place a cross with the click of the mouse and then confirm with a so-called signature card .
but it ’ s vital that the recipient of the ballot is not able to trace the sender .
research is still being carried out on the signature card to make it 100 percent fool-proof .
christoph meinel , a technology expert at the university of trier told the german news agency dpa that everyone should be sure that no software producer , network operator or even a virus could affect the voter ’ s ballot in an unauthorised manner .
" it shouldn ’ t be possible to trace the ballot paper of a voter , vote more than once or to change a vote , " meinel said .

but as germans head to their respective polling districts on sunday , they can rest easy in the knowledge that the next time they go to vote in four years , they can simply head to any polling station of their choice .
ambitious plans for digital voting the german interior ministry has now contracted a working group to take care of the technological aspects of networking all 80,000 polling districts in germany by 2006 , thus making internet voting a second option to traditional voting at the poll station .
going a step further , the government ambitiously also hopes to enable all german citizens to vote over their own computers from the comfort of their homes by 2010 .
advocates of online voting argue that it could help speed up polling results , make the tallying more accurate , be more cost-friendly in the long run and contribute towards an increasingly mobile society .
going will not be smooth but making digital voting a reality is easier said than done .
security concerns are the main hindrances that could block the speedy realisation of internet voting .
of special importance is ensuring that only eligible voters cast their votes and only once at that .
the government also wants to emphasise that voting online is principally an added option – no one will be forced to vote over the internet , but can always choose to vote the traditional way by personally going to the poll station .
privacy and money concerns protecting the anonymity of the voter is another serious security worry .
the digital vote functions much like the traditional vote – the ballots are available over the internet , and all the citizen needs to do is place a cross with the click of the mouse and then confirm with a so-called signature card .
but it ’ s vital that the recipient of the ballot is not able to trace the sender .
research is still being carried out on the signature card to make it 100 percent fool-proof .
christoph meinel , a technology expert at the university of trier told the german news agency dpa that everyone should be sure that no software producer , network operator or even a virus could affect the voter ’ s ballot in an unauthorised manner .
" it shouldn ’ t be possible to trace the ballot paper of a voter , vote more than once or to change a vote , " meinel said .
computer engineering experts also believe that online voting for federal elections would cost the country dearly .
they estimate that creating a signature card and a reading machine for more than 60 million eligible voters would cost several hundred million euro .
online voting not entirely new online voting is not an entirely new concept and is already being tested in instances such as voting a board of directors in a company or a student council at a university .
one of the first complete online votes to be carried out in germany was at the university of osnabrück , where 11,000 students elected members of the student parliament and their representative in the university council with a mouse-click . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

it 's placed a further strain on fraying german-u.s. ties . the already soured political relationship between germany and the united states was dealt a further blow on thursday after highly controversial statements by german justice minister herta däublin-gmelin were made public .
the german newspaper schwäbische tagblatt reported yesterday that the minister of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in a discussion with trade unionists said that president bush wanted to divert attention from domestic political problems through a war against iraq .
she said hitler had employed much the same tactics .
" that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it , " the paper quoted däublin-gmelin as saying .
däubler-gmelin herself has strongly protested the way the newspaper has portrayed her comments .
" i simply didn ’ t say that , " she said on thursday .
the minister said that she did not compare bush as a person to hitler , but only their methods .
" i did not equate bush with hitler , " she said .
she called the newspaper report a " distorted view " and " slanderous " .
us furious over anti-american statements her remarks have drawn swift condemnation from the united states .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said , " the usa and germany have a very long and valuable relationship and the relations between the people of the usa and germany are very important to the americans .
but this statement of the minister is outrageous and inexplicable . "
senator jesse helms , the ranking republican on the senate foreign relations committee , released a statement saying he and other members of congress were " appalled " by the anti-american tenor of the german campaign .
" if chancellor schröder succeeds in winning re-election through america-bashing then the u.s. congress must seriously consider moving u.s. forces out of germany and stationing them on the territory of other nato allies , " the statement said .
outrage at home too even within germany , which goes to the polls on sunday , the minister ’ s statements have led to a storm of protest .
in a campaign that has seen chancellor schröder ’ s spd pull ahead of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- partly due to schröder ’ s anti-war rhetoric and unrelenting stance on joining the u.s. in a war against iraq , the minister ’ s comments have been seized upon by the opposition .
the christian democrats and its sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have strongly criticised the minister and called for her resignation .
the cdu argued that the spd was " deliberately trying to create the impression that the real opponent is bush and not saddam hussein . "
thomas goppel , a spokesman for the cdu told reuters , " this shows what schröder and his social democrats really think of our american allies . "
general secretary of the cdu laurenz meyer spoke of an " unbelievable slip-up " on the part of the minister while the csu is demanding that chancellor schröder fire the minister before elections on sunday .
even washington ’ s ambassador to berlin , daniel coats is reported to have conveyed his displeasure to the german government .
german media unsparingly critical newspaper editorials in the country were highly critical of the minister on friday .
" a cabinet member who makes such comparisons and does not apologise should be fired , if not by the chancellor , then by the voters , " read the editorial in the country ’ s largest-selling newspaper , bild .
the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung titled its editorial , " finished " .
" herta däubler-gmelin can not , will not be a member of the next german cabinet , " the paper said .
" she 's locked in a way of thinking that can not be reconciled with germany 's foreign policy interests . "
spd-greens stand by minister chancellor schröder has defended däubler-gmelin and said that he doubted the minister actually uttered what the newspaper quoted .
he stressed that , " if somebody likened the american president with such crimes , the person would have no place in the government . "
the legal expert for the greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder ’ s government , volker beck said that the accusations against the minister were an " infamous slander campaign " .
schröder risking ties with u.s. a possible war against iraq has dominated the german election campaign in the past few weeks , sidelining issues such as unemployment and the economy .
chancellor schröder ’ s spd , which was trailing the opposition cdu for a long time , has suddenly recovered lost ground with the chancellor ’ s hard anti-war line and inched past the cdu with just two days to go before elections .
but chancellor schröder has been accused of blatant electioneering by the u.s. and critics within germany , using his unbending stance against america ’ s proposed military strikes against iraq to win over pacifist voters .
schröder is widely seen as risking his close relationship to the u.s. for the sake of holding on to power .
on wednesday , u.s. government advisor richard perle told the financial times deutschland " for us , it looks as if the chancellor is distancing himself from an old friend -lrb- the u.s. -rrb- in order to gain a few seats .

it 's placed a further strain on fraying german-u.s. ties . the already soured political relationship between germany and the united states was dealt a further blow on thursday after highly controversial statements by german justice minister herta däublin-gmelin were made public .
the german newspaper schwäbische tagblatt reported yesterday that the minister of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in a discussion with trade unionists said that president bush wanted to divert attention from domestic political problems through a war against iraq .
she said hitler had employed much the same tactics .
" that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it , " the paper quoted däublin-gmelin as saying .
däubler-gmelin herself has strongly protested the way the newspaper has portrayed her comments .
" i simply didn ’ t say that , " she said on thursday .
the minister said that she did not compare bush as a person to hitler , but only their methods .
" i did not equate bush with hitler , " she said .
she called the newspaper report a " distorted view " and " slanderous " .
us furious over anti-american statements her remarks have drawn swift condemnation from the united states .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said , " the usa and germany have a very long and valuable relationship and the relations between the people of the usa and germany are very important to the americans .
but this statement of the minister is outrageous and inexplicable . "
senator jesse helms , the ranking republican on the senate foreign relations committee , released a statement saying he and other members of congress were " appalled " by the anti-american tenor of the german campaign .
" if chancellor schröder succeeds in winning re-election through america-bashing then the u.s. congress must seriously consider moving u.s. forces out of germany and stationing them on the territory of other nato allies , " the statement said .
outrage at home too even within germany , which goes to the polls on sunday , the minister ’ s statements have led to a storm of protest .
in a campaign that has seen chancellor schröder ’ s spd pull ahead of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- partly due to schröder ’ s anti-war rhetoric and unrelenting stance on joining the u.s. in a war against iraq , the minister ’ s comments have been seized upon by the opposition .
the christian democrats and its sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have strongly criticised the minister and called for her resignation .
the cdu argued that the spd was " deliberately trying to create the impression that the real opponent is bush and not saddam hussein . "
thomas goppel , a spokesman for the cdu told reuters , " this shows what schröder and his social democrats really think of our american allies . "
general secretary of the cdu laurenz meyer spoke of an " unbelievable slip-up " on the part of the minister while the csu is demanding that chancellor schröder fire the minister before elections on sunday .
even washington ’ s ambassador to berlin , daniel coats is reported to have conveyed his displeasure to the german government .
german media unsparingly critical newspaper editorials in the country were highly critical of the minister on friday .
" a cabinet member who makes such comparisons and does not apologise should be fired , if not by the chancellor , then by the voters , " read the editorial in the country ’ s largest-selling newspaper , bild .
the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung titled its editorial , " finished " .
" herta däubler-gmelin can not , will not be a member of the next german cabinet , " the paper said .
" she 's locked in a way of thinking that can not be reconciled with germany 's foreign policy interests . "
spd-greens stand by minister chancellor schröder has defended däubler-gmelin and said that he doubted the minister actually uttered what the newspaper quoted .
he stressed that , " if somebody likened the american president with such crimes , the person would have no place in the government . "
the legal expert for the greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder ’ s government , volker beck said that the accusations against the minister were an " infamous slander campaign " .
schröder risking ties with u.s. a possible war against iraq has dominated the german election campaign in the past few weeks , sidelining issues such as unemployment and the economy .
chancellor schröder ’ s spd , which was trailing the opposition cdu for a long time , has suddenly recovered lost ground with the chancellor ’ s hard anti-war line and inched past the cdu with just two days to go before elections .
but chancellor schröder has been accused of blatant electioneering by the u.s. and critics within germany , using his unbending stance against america ’ s proposed military strikes against iraq to win over pacifist voters .
schröder is widely seen as risking his close relationship to the u.s. for the sake of holding on to power .
on wednesday , u.s. government advisor richard perle told the financial times deutschland " for us , it looks as if the chancellor is distancing himself from an old friend -lrb- the u.s. -rrb- in order to gain a few seats .

in a campaign that has seen chancellor schröder ’ s spd pull ahead of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- partly due to schröder ’ s anti-war rhetoric and unrelenting stance on joining the u.s. in a war against iraq , the minister ’ s comments have been seized upon by the opposition .
the christian democrats and its sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have strongly criticised the minister and called for her resignation .
the cdu argued that the spd was " deliberately trying to create the impression that the real opponent is bush and not saddam hussein . "
thomas goppel , a spokesman for the cdu told reuters , " this shows what schröder and his social democrats really think of our american allies . "

spd-greens stand by minister chancellor schröder has defended däubler-gmelin and said that he doubted the minister actually uttered what the newspaper quoted .
he stressed that , " if somebody likened the american president with such crimes , the person would have no place in the government . "
the legal expert for the greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder ’ s government , volker beck said that the accusations against the minister were an " infamous slander campaign " .
schröder risking ties with u.s. a possible war against iraq has dominated the german election campaign in the past few weeks , sidelining issues such as unemployment and the economy .
chancellor schröder ’ s spd , which was trailing the opposition cdu for a long time , has suddenly recovered lost ground with the chancellor ’ s hard anti-war line and inched past the cdu with just two days to go before elections .

it 's placed a further strain on fraying german-u.s. ties . the already soured political relationship between germany and the united states was dealt a further blow on thursday after highly controversial statements by german justice minister herta däublin-gmelin were made public .
the german newspaper schwäbische tagblatt reported yesterday that the minister of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in a discussion with trade unionists said that president bush wanted to divert attention from domestic political problems through a war against iraq .
she said hitler had employed much the same tactics .
" that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it , " the paper quoted däublin-gmelin as saying .
däubler-gmelin herself has strongly protested the way the newspaper has portrayed her comments .
" i simply didn ’ t say that , " she said on thursday .
the minister said that she did not compare bush as a person to hitler , but only their methods .
" i did not equate bush with hitler , " she said .
she called the newspaper report a " distorted view " and " slanderous " .
us furious over anti-american statements her remarks have drawn swift condemnation from the united states .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said , " the usa and germany have a very long and valuable relationship and the relations between the people of the usa and germany are very important to the americans .

senator jesse helms , the ranking republican on the senate foreign relations committee , released a statement saying he and other members of congress were " appalled " by the anti-american tenor of the german campaign .

internet voting could be the answer .

it 's placed a further strain on fraying german-u.s. ties . the already soured political relationship between germany and the united states was dealt a further blow on thursday after highly controversial statements by german justice minister herta däublin-gmelin were made public .
the german newspaper schwäbische tagblatt reported yesterday that the minister of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in a discussion with trade unionists said that president bush wanted to divert attention from domestic political problems through a war against iraq .
she said hitler had employed much the same tactics .
" that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it , " the paper quoted däublin-gmelin as saying .
däubler-gmelin herself has strongly protested the way the newspaper has portrayed her comments .
" i simply didn ’ t say that , " she said on thursday .
the minister said that she did not compare bush as a person to hitler , but only their methods .
" i did not equate bush with hitler , " she said .
she called the newspaper report a " distorted view " and " slanderous " .
us furious over anti-american statements her remarks have drawn swift condemnation from the united states .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said , " the usa and germany have a very long and valuable relationship and the relations between the people of the usa and germany are very important to the americans .
but this statement of the minister is outrageous and inexplicable . "
senator jesse helms , the ranking republican on the senate foreign relations committee , released a statement saying he and other members of congress were " appalled " by the anti-american tenor of the german campaign .
" if chancellor schröder succeeds in winning re-election through america-bashing then the u.s. congress must seriously consider moving u.s. forces out of germany and stationing them on the territory of other nato allies , " the statement said .
outrage at home too even within germany , which goes to the polls on sunday , the minister ’ s statements have led to a storm of protest .
in a campaign that has seen chancellor schröder ’ s spd pull ahead of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- partly due to schröder ’ s anti-war rhetoric and unrelenting stance on joining the u.s. in a war against iraq , the minister ’ s comments have been seized upon by the opposition .
the christian democrats and its sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have strongly criticised the minister and called for her resignation .
the cdu argued that the spd was " deliberately trying to create the impression that the real opponent is bush and not saddam hussein . "
thomas goppel , a spokesman for the cdu told reuters , " this shows what schröder and his social democrats really think of our american allies . "
general secretary of the cdu laurenz meyer spoke of an " unbelievable slip-up " on the part of the minister while the csu is demanding that chancellor schröder fire the minister before elections on sunday .
even washington ’ s ambassador to berlin , daniel coats is reported to have conveyed his displeasure to the german government .
german media unsparingly critical newspaper editorials in the country were highly critical of the minister on friday .
" a cabinet member who makes such comparisons and does not apologise should be fired , if not by the chancellor , then by the voters , " read the editorial in the country ’ s largest-selling newspaper , bild .
the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung titled its editorial , " finished " .
" herta däubler-gmelin can not , will not be a member of the next german cabinet , " the paper said .
" she 's locked in a way of thinking that can not be reconciled with germany 's foreign policy interests . "
spd-greens stand by minister chancellor schröder has defended däubler-gmelin and said that he doubted the minister actually uttered what the newspaper quoted .
he stressed that , " if somebody likened the american president with such crimes , the person would have no place in the government . "
the legal expert for the greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder ’ s government , volker beck said that the accusations against the minister were an " infamous slander campaign " .
schröder risking ties with u.s. a possible war against iraq has dominated the german election campaign in the past few weeks , sidelining issues such as unemployment and the economy .
chancellor schröder ’ s spd , which was trailing the opposition cdu for a long time , has suddenly recovered lost ground with the chancellor ’ s hard anti-war line and inched past the cdu with just two days to go before elections .
but chancellor schröder has been accused of blatant electioneering by the u.s. and critics within germany , using his unbending stance against america ’ s proposed military strikes against iraq to win over pacifist voters .
schröder is widely seen as risking his close relationship to the u.s. for the sake of holding on to power .
on wednesday , u.s. government advisor richard perle told the financial times deutschland " for us , it looks as if the chancellor is distancing himself from an old friend -lrb- the u.s. -rrb- in order to gain a few seats .
germany has lost all influence through the chancellor ’ s remarkable isolationism " , he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press criticizes government the german press on saturday joined u.s. officials in condemning comments made by the justice minister linking president bush to hitler .

it 's placed a further strain on fraying german-u.s. ties . the already soured political relationship between germany and the united states was dealt a further blow on thursday after highly controversial statements by german justice minister herta däublin-gmelin were made public .
the german newspaper schwäbische tagblatt reported yesterday that the minister of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in a discussion with trade unionists said that president bush wanted to divert attention from domestic political problems through a war against iraq .
she said hitler had employed much the same tactics .
" that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it , " the paper quoted däublin-gmelin as saying .
däubler-gmelin herself has strongly protested the way the newspaper has portrayed her comments .
" i simply didn ’ t say that , " she said on thursday .
the minister said that she did not compare bush as a person to hitler , but only their methods .
" i did not equate bush with hitler , " she said .
she called the newspaper report a " distorted view " and " slanderous " .
us furious over anti-american statements her remarks have drawn swift condemnation from the united states .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said , " the usa and germany have a very long and valuable relationship and the relations between the people of the usa and germany are very important to the americans .
but this statement of the minister is outrageous and inexplicable . "
senator jesse helms , the ranking republican on the senate foreign relations committee , released a statement saying he and other members of congress were " appalled " by the anti-american tenor of the german campaign .
" if chancellor schröder succeeds in winning re-election through america-bashing then the u.s. congress must seriously consider moving u.s. forces out of germany and stationing them on the territory of other nato allies , " the statement said .
outrage at home too even within germany , which goes to the polls on sunday , the minister ’ s statements have led to a storm of protest .
in a campaign that has seen chancellor schröder ’ s spd pull ahead of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- partly due to schröder ’ s anti-war rhetoric and unrelenting stance on joining the u.s. in a war against iraq , the minister ’ s comments have been seized upon by the opposition .
the christian democrats and its sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have strongly criticised the minister and called for her resignation .
the cdu argued that the spd was " deliberately trying to create the impression that the real opponent is bush and not saddam hussein . "
thomas goppel , a spokesman for the cdu told reuters , " this shows what schröder and his social democrats really think of our american allies . "
general secretary of the cdu laurenz meyer spoke of an " unbelievable slip-up " on the part of the minister while the csu is demanding that chancellor schröder fire the minister before elections on sunday .
even washington ’ s ambassador to berlin , daniel coats is reported to have conveyed his displeasure to the german government .
german media unsparingly critical newspaper editorials in the country were highly critical of the minister on friday .
" a cabinet member who makes such comparisons and does not apologise should be fired , if not by the chancellor , then by the voters , " read the editorial in the country ’ s largest-selling newspaper , bild .
the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung titled its editorial , " finished " .
" herta däubler-gmelin can not , will not be a member of the next german cabinet , " the paper said .
" she 's locked in a way of thinking that can not be reconciled with germany 's foreign policy interests . "
spd-greens stand by minister chancellor schröder has defended däubler-gmelin and said that he doubted the minister actually uttered what the newspaper quoted .
he stressed that , " if somebody likened the american president with such crimes , the person would have no place in the government . "
the legal expert for the greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder ’ s government , volker beck said that the accusations against the minister were an " infamous slander campaign " .
schröder risking ties with u.s. a possible war against iraq has dominated the german election campaign in the past few weeks , sidelining issues such as unemployment and the economy .
chancellor schröder ’ s spd , which was trailing the opposition cdu for a long time , has suddenly recovered lost ground with the chancellor ’ s hard anti-war line and inched past the cdu with just two days to go before elections .
but chancellor schröder has been accused of blatant electioneering by the u.s. and critics within germany , using his unbending stance against america ’ s proposed military strikes against iraq to win over pacifist voters .
schröder is widely seen as risking his close relationship to the u.s. for the sake of holding on to power .
on wednesday , u.s. government advisor richard perle told the financial times deutschland " for us , it looks as if the chancellor is distancing himself from an old friend -lrb- the u.s. -rrb- in order to gain a few seats .

it 's placed a further strain on fraying german-u.s. ties . the already soured political relationship between germany and the united states was dealt a further blow on thursday after highly controversial statements by german justice minister herta däublin-gmelin were made public .
the german newspaper schwäbische tagblatt reported yesterday that the minister of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in a discussion with trade unionists said that president bush wanted to divert attention from domestic political problems through a war against iraq .
she said hitler had employed much the same tactics .
" that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it , " the paper quoted däublin-gmelin as saying .
däubler-gmelin herself has strongly protested the way the newspaper has portrayed her comments .
" i simply didn ’ t say that , " she said on thursday .
the minister said that she did not compare bush as a person to hitler , but only their methods .
" i did not equate bush with hitler , " she said .
she called the newspaper report a " distorted view " and " slanderous " .
us furious over anti-american statements her remarks have drawn swift condemnation from the united states .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said , " the usa and germany have a very long and valuable relationship and the relations between the people of the usa and germany are very important to the americans .
but this statement of the minister is outrageous and inexplicable . "
senator jesse helms , the ranking republican on the senate foreign relations committee , released a statement saying he and other members of congress were " appalled " by the anti-american tenor of the german campaign .
" if chancellor schröder succeeds in winning re-election through america-bashing then the u.s. congress must seriously consider moving u.s. forces out of germany and stationing them on the territory of other nato allies , " the statement said .
outrage at home too even within germany , which goes to the polls on sunday , the minister ’ s statements have led to a storm of protest .
in a campaign that has seen chancellor schröder ’ s spd pull ahead of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- partly due to schröder ’ s anti-war rhetoric and unrelenting stance on joining the u.s. in a war against iraq , the minister ’ s comments have been seized upon by the opposition .
the christian democrats and its sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have strongly criticised the minister and called for her resignation .
the cdu argued that the spd was " deliberately trying to create the impression that the real opponent is bush and not saddam hussein . "
thomas goppel , a spokesman for the cdu told reuters , " this shows what schröder and his social democrats really think of our american allies . "
general secretary of the cdu laurenz meyer spoke of an " unbelievable slip-up " on the part of the minister while the csu is demanding that chancellor schröder fire the minister before elections on sunday .
even washington ’ s ambassador to berlin , daniel coats is reported to have conveyed his displeasure to the german government .
german media unsparingly critical newspaper editorials in the country were highly critical of the minister on friday .
" a cabinet member who makes such comparisons and does not apologise should be fired , if not by the chancellor , then by the voters , " read the editorial in the country ’ s largest-selling newspaper , bild .
the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung titled its editorial , " finished " .
" herta däubler-gmelin can not , will not be a member of the next german cabinet , " the paper said .
" she 's locked in a way of thinking that can not be reconciled with germany 's foreign policy interests . "
spd-greens stand by minister chancellor schröder has defended däubler-gmelin and said that he doubted the minister actually uttered what the newspaper quoted .
he stressed that , " if somebody likened the american president with such crimes , the person would have no place in the government . "
the legal expert for the greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder ’ s government , volker beck said that the accusations against the minister were an " infamous slander campaign " .
schröder risking ties with u.s. a possible war against iraq has dominated the german election campaign in the past few weeks , sidelining issues such as unemployment and the economy .
chancellor schröder ’ s spd , which was trailing the opposition cdu for a long time , has suddenly recovered lost ground with the chancellor ’ s hard anti-war line and inched past the cdu with just two days to go before elections .
but chancellor schröder has been accused of blatant electioneering by the u.s. and critics within germany , using his unbending stance against america ’ s proposed military strikes against iraq to win over pacifist voters .
schröder is widely seen as risking his close relationship to the u.s. for the sake of holding on to power .
on wednesday , u.s. government advisor richard perle told the financial times deutschland " for us , it looks as if the chancellor is distancing himself from an old friend -lrb- the u.s. -rrb- in order to gain a few seats .
germany has lost all influence through the chancellor ’ s remarkable isolationism " , he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press criticizes government the german press on saturday joined u.s. officials in condemning comments made by the justice minister linking president bush to hitler .

but the government has to overcome security and financial hurdles before online voting in germany becomes a reality . do you dread waiting in line at a polling station for your turn to place the all-important cross on the ballot papers ?
internet voting could be the answer .
it ’ s practical , easy and saves time .
only problem is , it ’ s not here yet .
but as germans head to their respective polling districts on sunday , they can rest easy in the knowledge that the next time they go to vote in four years , they can simply head to any polling station of their choice .
ambitious plans for digital voting the german interior ministry has now contracted a working group to take care of the technological aspects of networking all 80,000 polling districts in germany by 2006 , thus making internet voting a second option to traditional voting at the poll station .
going a step further , the government ambitiously also hopes to enable all german citizens to vote over their own computers from the comfort of their homes by 2010 .
advocates of online voting argue that it could help speed up polling results , make the tallying more accurate , be more cost-friendly in the long run and contribute towards an increasingly mobile society .

the digital vote functions much like the traditional vote – the ballots are available over the internet , and all the citizen needs to do is place a cross with the click of the mouse and then confirm with a so-called signature card .
but it ’ s vital that the recipient of the ballot is not able to trace the sender .
research is still being carried out on the signature card to make it 100 percent fool-proof .
christoph meinel , a technology expert at the university of trier told the german news agency dpa that everyone should be sure that no software producer , network operator or even a virus could affect the voter ’ s ballot in an unauthorised manner .
" it shouldn ’ t be possible to trace the ballot paper of a voter , vote more than once or to change a vote , " meinel said .

but the government has to overcome security and financial hurdles before online voting in germany becomes a reality . do you dread waiting in line at a polling station for your turn to place the all-important cross on the ballot papers ?
internet voting could be the answer .
it ’ s practical , easy and saves time .
only problem is , it ’ s not here yet .
but as germans head to their respective polling districts on sunday , they can rest easy in the knowledge that the next time they go to vote in four years , they can simply head to any polling station of their choice .
ambitious plans for digital voting the german interior ministry has now contracted a working group to take care of the technological aspects of networking all 80,000 polling districts in germany by 2006 , thus making internet voting a second option to traditional voting at the poll station .
going a step further , the government ambitiously also hopes to enable all german citizens to vote over their own computers from the comfort of their homes by 2010 .
advocates of online voting argue that it could help speed up polling results , make the tallying more accurate , be more cost-friendly in the long run and contribute towards an increasingly mobile society .
going will not be smooth but making digital voting a reality is easier said than done .
security concerns are the main hindrances that could block the speedy realisation of internet voting .
of special importance is ensuring that only eligible voters cast their votes and only once at that .
the government also wants to emphasise that voting online is principally an added option – no one will be forced to vote over the internet , but can always choose to vote the traditional way by personally going to the poll station .
privacy and money concerns protecting the anonymity of the voter is another serious security worry .
the digital vote functions much like the traditional vote – the ballots are available over the internet , and all the citizen needs to do is place a cross with the click of the mouse and then confirm with a so-called signature card .
but it ’ s vital that the recipient of the ballot is not able to trace the sender .
research is still being carried out on the signature card to make it 100 percent fool-proof .
christoph meinel , a technology expert at the university of trier told the german news agency dpa that everyone should be sure that no software producer , network operator or even a virus could affect the voter ’ s ballot in an unauthorised manner .
" it shouldn ’ t be possible to trace the ballot paper of a voter , vote more than once or to change a vote , " meinel said .
computer engineering experts also believe that online voting for federal elections would cost the country dearly .
they estimate that creating a signature card and a reading machine for more than 60 million eligible voters would cost several hundred million euro .
online voting not entirely new online voting is not an entirely new concept and is already being tested in instances such as voting a board of directors in a company or a student council at a university .
one of the first complete online votes to be carried out in germany was at the university of osnabrück , where 11,000 students elected members of the student parliament and their representative in the university council with a mouse-click . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

it 's placed a further strain on fraying german-u.s. ties . the already soured political relationship between germany and the united states was dealt a further blow on thursday after highly controversial statements by german justice minister herta däublin-gmelin were made public .
the german newspaper schwäbische tagblatt reported yesterday that the minister of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in a discussion with trade unionists said that president bush wanted to divert attention from domestic political problems through a war against iraq .
she said hitler had employed much the same tactics .
" that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it , " the paper quoted däublin-gmelin as saying .
däubler-gmelin herself has strongly protested the way the newspaper has portrayed her comments .
" i simply didn ’ t say that , " she said on thursday .
the minister said that she did not compare bush as a person to hitler , but only their methods .
" i did not equate bush with hitler , " she said .
she called the newspaper report a " distorted view " and " slanderous " .
us furious over anti-american statements her remarks have drawn swift condemnation from the united states .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said , " the usa and germany have a very long and valuable relationship and the relations between the people of the usa and germany are very important to the americans .
but this statement of the minister is outrageous and inexplicable . "
senator jesse helms , the ranking republican on the senate foreign relations committee , released a statement saying he and other members of congress were " appalled " by the anti-american tenor of the german campaign .
" if chancellor schröder succeeds in winning re-election through america-bashing then the u.s. congress must seriously consider moving u.s. forces out of germany and stationing them on the territory of other nato allies , " the statement said .
outrage at home too even within germany , which goes to the polls on sunday , the minister ’ s statements have led to a storm of protest .
in a campaign that has seen chancellor schröder ’ s spd pull ahead of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- partly due to schröder ’ s anti-war rhetoric and unrelenting stance on joining the u.s. in a war against iraq , the minister ’ s comments have been seized upon by the opposition .
the christian democrats and its sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have strongly criticised the minister and called for her resignation .
the cdu argued that the spd was " deliberately trying to create the impression that the real opponent is bush and not saddam hussein . "
thomas goppel , a spokesman for the cdu told reuters , " this shows what schröder and his social democrats really think of our american allies . "
general secretary of the cdu laurenz meyer spoke of an " unbelievable slip-up " on the part of the minister while the csu is demanding that chancellor schröder fire the minister before elections on sunday .
even washington ’ s ambassador to berlin , daniel coats is reported to have conveyed his displeasure to the german government .
german media unsparingly critical newspaper editorials in the country were highly critical of the minister on friday .
" a cabinet member who makes such comparisons and does not apologise should be fired , if not by the chancellor , then by the voters , " read the editorial in the country ’ s largest-selling newspaper , bild .
the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung titled its editorial , " finished " .
" herta däubler-gmelin can not , will not be a member of the next german cabinet , " the paper said .
" she 's locked in a way of thinking that can not be reconciled with germany 's foreign policy interests . "
spd-greens stand by minister chancellor schröder has defended däubler-gmelin and said that he doubted the minister actually uttered what the newspaper quoted .
he stressed that , " if somebody likened the american president with such crimes , the person would have no place in the government . "
the legal expert for the greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder ’ s government , volker beck said that the accusations against the minister were an " infamous slander campaign " .
schröder risking ties with u.s. a possible war against iraq has dominated the german election campaign in the past few weeks , sidelining issues such as unemployment and the economy .
chancellor schröder ’ s spd , which was trailing the opposition cdu for a long time , has suddenly recovered lost ground with the chancellor ’ s hard anti-war line and inched past the cdu with just two days to go before elections .
but chancellor schröder has been accused of blatant electioneering by the u.s. and critics within germany , using his unbending stance against america ’ s proposed military strikes against iraq to win over pacifist voters .
schröder is widely seen as risking his close relationship to the u.s. for the sake of holding on to power .
on wednesday , u.s. government advisor richard perle told the financial times deutschland " for us , it looks as if the chancellor is distancing himself from an old friend -lrb- the u.s. -rrb- in order to gain a few seats .

but the government has to overcome security and financial hurdles before online voting in germany becomes a reality . do you dread waiting in line at a polling station for your turn to place the all-important cross on the ballot papers ?
internet voting could be the answer .
it ’ s practical , easy and saves time .
only problem is , it ’ s not here yet .
but as germans head to their respective polling districts on sunday , they can rest easy in the knowledge that the next time they go to vote in four years , they can simply head to any polling station of their choice .
ambitious plans for digital voting the german interior ministry has now contracted a working group to take care of the technological aspects of networking all 80,000 polling districts in germany by 2006 , thus making internet voting a second option to traditional voting at the poll station .
going a step further , the government ambitiously also hopes to enable all german citizens to vote over their own computers from the comfort of their homes by 2010 .
advocates of online voting argue that it could help speed up polling results , make the tallying more accurate , be more cost-friendly in the long run and contribute towards an increasingly mobile society .
going will not be smooth but making digital voting a reality is easier said than done .
security concerns are the main hindrances that could block the speedy realisation of internet voting .
of special importance is ensuring that only eligible voters cast their votes and only once at that .
the government also wants to emphasise that voting online is principally an added option – no one will be forced to vote over the internet , but can always choose to vote the traditional way by personally going to the poll station .
privacy and money concerns protecting the anonymity of the voter is another serious security worry .
the digital vote functions much like the traditional vote – the ballots are available over the internet , and all the citizen needs to do is place a cross with the click of the mouse and then confirm with a so-called signature card .
but it ’ s vital that the recipient of the ballot is not able to trace the sender .
research is still being carried out on the signature card to make it 100 percent fool-proof .
christoph meinel , a technology expert at the university of trier told the german news agency dpa that everyone should be sure that no software producer , network operator or even a virus could affect the voter ’ s ballot in an unauthorised manner .
" it shouldn ’ t be possible to trace the ballot paper of a voter , vote more than once or to change a vote , " meinel said .
computer engineering experts also believe that online voting for federal elections would cost the country dearly .
they estimate that creating a signature card and a reading machine for more than 60 million eligible voters would cost several hundred million euro .
online voting not entirely new online voting is not an entirely new concept and is already being tested in instances such as voting a board of directors in a company or a student council at a university .
one of the first complete online votes to be carried out in germany was at the university of osnabrück , where 11,000 students elected members of the student parliament and their representative in the university council with a mouse-click . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

it 's placed a further strain on fraying german-u.s. ties . the already soured political relationship between germany and the united states was dealt a further blow on thursday after highly controversial statements by german justice minister herta däublin-gmelin were made public .
the german newspaper schwäbische tagblatt reported yesterday that the minister of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in a discussion with trade unionists said that president bush wanted to divert attention from domestic political problems through a war against iraq .
she said hitler had employed much the same tactics .
" that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it , " the paper quoted däublin-gmelin as saying .
däubler-gmelin herself has strongly protested the way the newspaper has portrayed her comments .
" i simply didn ’ t say that , " she said on thursday .
the minister said that she did not compare bush as a person to hitler , but only their methods .
" i did not equate bush with hitler , " she said .
she called the newspaper report a " distorted view " and " slanderous " .
us furious over anti-american statements her remarks have drawn swift condemnation from the united states .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said , " the usa and germany have a very long and valuable relationship and the relations between the people of the usa and germany are very important to the americans .
but this statement of the minister is outrageous and inexplicable . "
senator jesse helms , the ranking republican on the senate foreign relations committee , released a statement saying he and other members of congress were " appalled " by the anti-american tenor of the german campaign .
" if chancellor schröder succeeds in winning re-election through america-bashing then the u.s. congress must seriously consider moving u.s. forces out of germany and stationing them on the territory of other nato allies , " the statement said .
outrage at home too even within germany , which goes to the polls on sunday , the minister ’ s statements have led to a storm of protest .
in a campaign that has seen chancellor schröder ’ s spd pull ahead of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- partly due to schröder ’ s anti-war rhetoric and unrelenting stance on joining the u.s. in a war against iraq , the minister ’ s comments have been seized upon by the opposition .
the christian democrats and its sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have strongly criticised the minister and called for her resignation .
the cdu argued that the spd was " deliberately trying to create the impression that the real opponent is bush and not saddam hussein . "
thomas goppel , a spokesman for the cdu told reuters , " this shows what schröder and his social democrats really think of our american allies . "
general secretary of the cdu laurenz meyer spoke of an " unbelievable slip-up " on the part of the minister while the csu is demanding that chancellor schröder fire the minister before elections on sunday .
even washington ’ s ambassador to berlin , daniel coats is reported to have conveyed his displeasure to the german government .
german media unsparingly critical newspaper editorials in the country were highly critical of the minister on friday .
" a cabinet member who makes such comparisons and does not apologise should be fired , if not by the chancellor , then by the voters , " read the editorial in the country ’ s largest-selling newspaper , bild .
the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung titled its editorial , " finished " .
" herta däubler-gmelin can not , will not be a member of the next german cabinet , " the paper said .
" she 's locked in a way of thinking that can not be reconciled with germany 's foreign policy interests . "
spd-greens stand by minister chancellor schröder has defended däubler-gmelin and said that he doubted the minister actually uttered what the newspaper quoted .
he stressed that , " if somebody likened the american president with such crimes , the person would have no place in the government . "
the legal expert for the greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder ’ s government , volker beck said that the accusations against the minister were an " infamous slander campaign " .
schröder risking ties with u.s. a possible war against iraq has dominated the german election campaign in the past few weeks , sidelining issues such as unemployment and the economy .
chancellor schröder ’ s spd , which was trailing the opposition cdu for a long time , has suddenly recovered lost ground with the chancellor ’ s hard anti-war line and inched past the cdu with just two days to go before elections .
but chancellor schröder has been accused of blatant electioneering by the u.s. and critics within germany , using his unbending stance against america ’ s proposed military strikes against iraq to win over pacifist voters .
schröder is widely seen as risking his close relationship to the u.s. for the sake of holding on to power .
on wednesday , u.s. government advisor richard perle told the financial times deutschland " for us , it looks as if the chancellor is distancing himself from an old friend -lrb- the u.s. -rrb- in order to gain a few seats .

the minister said that she did not compare bush as a person to hitler , but only their methods .
" i did not equate bush with hitler , " she said .
she called the newspaper report a " distorted view " and " slanderous " .
us furious over anti-american statements her remarks have drawn swift condemnation from the united states .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said , " the usa and germany have a very long and valuable relationship and the relations between the people of the usa and germany are very important to the americans .
but this statement of the minister is outrageous and inexplicable . "
senator jesse helms , the ranking republican on the senate foreign relations committee , released a statement saying he and other members of congress were " appalled " by the anti-american tenor of the german campaign .
" if chancellor schröder succeeds in winning re-election through america-bashing then the u.s. congress must seriously consider moving u.s. forces out of germany and stationing them on the territory of other nato allies , " the statement said .
outrage at home too even within germany , which goes to the polls on sunday , the minister ’ s statements have led to a storm of protest .
in a campaign that has seen chancellor schröder ’ s spd pull ahead of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- partly due to schröder ’ s anti-war rhetoric and unrelenting stance on joining the u.s. in a war against iraq , the minister ’ s comments have been seized upon by the opposition .
the christian democrats and its sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have strongly criticised the minister and called for her resignation .
the cdu argued that the spd was " deliberately trying to create the impression that the real opponent is bush and not saddam hussein . "
thomas goppel , a spokesman for the cdu told reuters , " this shows what schröder and his social democrats really think of our american allies . "
general secretary of the cdu laurenz meyer spoke of an " unbelievable slip-up " on the part of the minister while the csu is demanding that chancellor schröder fire the minister before elections on sunday .
even washington ’ s ambassador to berlin , daniel coats is reported to have conveyed his displeasure to the german government .
german media unsparingly critical newspaper editorials in the country were highly critical of the minister on friday .
" a cabinet member who makes such comparisons and does not apologise should be fired , if not by the chancellor , then by the voters , " read the editorial in the country ’ s largest-selling newspaper , bild .
the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung titled its editorial , " finished " .
" herta däubler-gmelin can not , will not be a member of the next german cabinet , " the paper said .
" she 's locked in a way of thinking that can not be reconciled with germany 's foreign policy interests . "
spd-greens stand by minister chancellor schröder has defended däubler-gmelin and said that he doubted the minister actually uttered what the newspaper quoted .
he stressed that , " if somebody likened the american president with such crimes , the person would have no place in the government . "
the legal expert for the greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder ’ s government , volker beck said that the accusations against the minister were an " infamous slander campaign " .
schröder risking ties with u.s. a possible war against iraq has dominated the german election campaign in the past few weeks , sidelining issues such as unemployment and the economy .
chancellor schröder ’ s spd , which was trailing the opposition cdu for a long time , has suddenly recovered lost ground with the chancellor ’ s hard anti-war line and inched past the cdu with just two days to go before elections .

it 's placed a further strain on fraying german-u.s. ties . the already soured political relationship between germany and the united states was dealt a further blow on thursday after highly controversial statements by german justice minister herta däublin-gmelin were made public .
the german newspaper schwäbische tagblatt reported yesterday that the minister of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in a discussion with trade unionists said that president bush wanted to divert attention from domestic political problems through a war against iraq .
she said hitler had employed much the same tactics .
" that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it , " the paper quoted däublin-gmelin as saying .

but the government has to overcome security and financial hurdles before online voting in germany becomes a reality . do you dread waiting in line at a polling station for your turn to place the all-important cross on the ballot papers ?
internet voting could be the answer .
it ’ s practical , easy and saves time .
only problem is , it ’ s not here yet .
but as germans head to their respective polling districts on sunday , they can rest easy in the knowledge that the next time they go to vote in four years , they can simply head to any polling station of their choice .
ambitious plans for digital voting the german interior ministry has now contracted a working group to take care of the technological aspects of networking all 80,000 polling districts in germany by 2006 , thus making internet voting a second option to traditional voting at the poll station .
going a step further , the government ambitiously also hopes to enable all german citizens to vote over their own computers from the comfort of their homes by 2010 .
advocates of online voting argue that it could help speed up polling results , make the tallying more accurate , be more cost-friendly in the long run and contribute towards an increasingly mobile society .

security concerns are the main hindrances that could block the speedy realisation of internet voting .
of special importance is ensuring that only eligible voters cast their votes and only once at that .

privacy and money concerns protecting the anonymity of the voter is another serious security worry .
the digital vote functions much like the traditional vote – the ballots are available over the internet , and all the citizen needs to do is place a cross with the click of the mouse and then confirm with a so-called signature card .
but it ’ s vital that the recipient of the ballot is not able to trace the sender .
research is still being carried out on the signature card to make it 100 percent fool-proof .
christoph meinel , a technology expert at the university of trier told the german news agency dpa that everyone should be sure that no software producer , network operator or even a virus could affect the voter ’ s ballot in an unauthorised manner .
" it shouldn ’ t be possible to trace the ballot paper of a voter , vote more than once or to change a vote , " meinel said .

it 's placed a further strain on fraying german-u.s. ties . the already soured political relationship between germany and the united states was dealt a further blow on thursday after highly controversial statements by german justice minister herta däublin-gmelin were made public .
the german newspaper schwäbische tagblatt reported yesterday that the minister of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in a discussion with trade unionists said that president bush wanted to divert attention from domestic political problems through a war against iraq .
she said hitler had employed much the same tactics .
" that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it , " the paper quoted däublin-gmelin as saying .
däubler-gmelin herself has strongly protested the way the newspaper has portrayed her comments .
" i simply didn ’ t say that , " she said on thursday .
the minister said that she did not compare bush as a person to hitler , but only their methods .
" i did not equate bush with hitler , " she said .
she called the newspaper report a " distorted view " and " slanderous " .
us furious over anti-american statements her remarks have drawn swift condemnation from the united states .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said , " the usa and germany have a very long and valuable relationship and the relations between the people of the usa and germany are very important to the americans .
but this statement of the minister is outrageous and inexplicable . "
senator jesse helms , the ranking republican on the senate foreign relations committee , released a statement saying he and other members of congress were " appalled " by the anti-american tenor of the german campaign .
" if chancellor schröder succeeds in winning re-election through america-bashing then the u.s. congress must seriously consider moving u.s. forces out of germany and stationing them on the territory of other nato allies , " the statement said .
outrage at home too even within germany , which goes to the polls on sunday , the minister ’ s statements have led to a storm of protest .
in a campaign that has seen chancellor schröder ’ s spd pull ahead of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- partly due to schröder ’ s anti-war rhetoric and unrelenting stance on joining the u.s. in a war against iraq , the minister ’ s comments have been seized upon by the opposition .
the christian democrats and its sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have strongly criticised the minister and called for her resignation .
the cdu argued that the spd was " deliberately trying to create the impression that the real opponent is bush and not saddam hussein . "
thomas goppel , a spokesman for the cdu told reuters , " this shows what schröder and his social democrats really think of our american allies . "
general secretary of the cdu laurenz meyer spoke of an " unbelievable slip-up " on the part of the minister while the csu is demanding that chancellor schröder fire the minister before elections on sunday .
even washington ’ s ambassador to berlin , daniel coats is reported to have conveyed his displeasure to the german government .
german media unsparingly critical newspaper editorials in the country were highly critical of the minister on friday .
" a cabinet member who makes such comparisons and does not apologise should be fired , if not by the chancellor , then by the voters , " read the editorial in the country ’ s largest-selling newspaper , bild .
the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung titled its editorial , " finished " .
" herta däubler-gmelin can not , will not be a member of the next german cabinet , " the paper said .
" she 's locked in a way of thinking that can not be reconciled with germany 's foreign policy interests . "
spd-greens stand by minister chancellor schröder has defended däubler-gmelin and said that he doubted the minister actually uttered what the newspaper quoted .
he stressed that , " if somebody likened the american president with such crimes , the person would have no place in the government . "
the legal expert for the greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder ’ s government , volker beck said that the accusations against the minister were an " infamous slander campaign " .
schröder risking ties with u.s. a possible war against iraq has dominated the german election campaign in the past few weeks , sidelining issues such as unemployment and the economy .
chancellor schröder ’ s spd , which was trailing the opposition cdu for a long time , has suddenly recovered lost ground with the chancellor ’ s hard anti-war line and inched past the cdu with just two days to go before elections .
but chancellor schröder has been accused of blatant electioneering by the u.s. and critics within germany , using his unbending stance against america ’ s proposed military strikes against iraq to win over pacifist voters .
schröder is widely seen as risking his close relationship to the u.s. for the sake of holding on to power .
on wednesday , u.s. government advisor richard perle told the financial times deutschland " for us , it looks as if the chancellor is distancing himself from an old friend -lrb- the u.s. -rrb- in order to gain a few seats .

but the government has to overcome security and financial hurdles before online voting in germany becomes a reality . do you dread waiting in line at a polling station for your turn to place the all-important cross on the ballot papers ?
internet voting could be the answer .
it ’ s practical , easy and saves time .
only problem is , it ’ s not here yet .
but as germans head to their respective polling districts on sunday , they can rest easy in the knowledge that the next time they go to vote in four years , they can simply head to any polling station of their choice .
ambitious plans for digital voting the german interior ministry has now contracted a working group to take care of the technological aspects of networking all 80,000 polling districts in germany by 2006 , thus making internet voting a second option to traditional voting at the poll station .
going a step further , the government ambitiously also hopes to enable all german citizens to vote over their own computers from the comfort of their homes by 2010 .
advocates of online voting argue that it could help speed up polling results , make the tallying more accurate , be more cost-friendly in the long run and contribute towards an increasingly mobile society .
going will not be smooth but making digital voting a reality is easier said than done .
security concerns are the main hindrances that could block the speedy realisation of internet voting .
of special importance is ensuring that only eligible voters cast their votes and only once at that .
the government also wants to emphasise that voting online is principally an added option – no one will be forced to vote over the internet , but can always choose to vote the traditional way by personally going to the poll station .
privacy and money concerns protecting the anonymity of the voter is another serious security worry .
the digital vote functions much like the traditional vote – the ballots are available over the internet , and all the citizen needs to do is place a cross with the click of the mouse and then confirm with a so-called signature card .
but it ’ s vital that the recipient of the ballot is not able to trace the sender .
research is still being carried out on the signature card to make it 100 percent fool-proof .
christoph meinel , a technology expert at the university of trier told the german news agency dpa that everyone should be sure that no software producer , network operator or even a virus could affect the voter ’ s ballot in an unauthorised manner .
" it shouldn ’ t be possible to trace the ballot paper of a voter , vote more than once or to change a vote , " meinel said .
computer engineering experts also believe that online voting for federal elections would cost the country dearly .
they estimate that creating a signature card and a reading machine for more than 60 million eligible voters would cost several hundred million euro .
online voting not entirely new online voting is not an entirely new concept and is already being tested in instances such as voting a board of directors in a company or a student council at a university .

the cdu argued that the spd was " deliberately trying to create the impression that the real opponent is bush and not saddam hussein . "
thomas goppel , a spokesman for the cdu told reuters , " this shows what schröder and his social democrats really think of our american allies . "
general secretary of the cdu laurenz meyer spoke of an " unbelievable slip-up " on the part of the minister while the csu is demanding that chancellor schröder fire the minister before elections on sunday .
even washington ’ s ambassador to berlin , daniel coats is reported to have conveyed his displeasure to the german government .
german media unsparingly critical newspaper editorials in the country were highly critical of the minister on friday .
" a cabinet member who makes such comparisons and does not apologise should be fired , if not by the chancellor , then by the voters , " read the editorial in the country ’ s largest-selling newspaper , bild .
the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung titled its editorial , " finished " .
" herta däubler-gmelin can not , will not be a member of the next german cabinet , " the paper said .
" she 's locked in a way of thinking that can not be reconciled with germany 's foreign policy interests . "
spd-greens stand by minister chancellor schröder has defended däubler-gmelin and said that he doubted the minister actually uttered what the newspaper quoted .
he stressed that , " if somebody likened the american president with such crimes , the person would have no place in the government . "
the legal expert for the greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder ’ s government , volker beck said that the accusations against the minister were an " infamous slander campaign " .
schröder risking ties with u.s. a possible war against iraq has dominated the german election campaign in the past few weeks , sidelining issues such as unemployment and the economy .
chancellor schröder ’ s spd , which was trailing the opposition cdu for a long time , has suddenly recovered lost ground with the chancellor ’ s hard anti-war line and inched past the cdu with just two days to go before elections .
but chancellor schröder has been accused of blatant electioneering by the u.s. and critics within germany , using his unbending stance against america ’ s proposed military strikes against iraq to win over pacifist voters .
schröder is widely seen as risking his close relationship to the u.s. for the sake of holding on to power .

but the government has to overcome security and financial hurdles before online voting in germany becomes a reality . do you dread waiting in line at a polling station for your turn to place the all-important cross on the ballot papers ?
internet voting could be the answer .
it ’ s practical , easy and saves time .
only problem is , it ’ s not here yet .
but as germans head to their respective polling districts on sunday , they can rest easy in the knowledge that the next time they go to vote in four years , they can simply head to any polling station of their choice .
ambitious plans for digital voting the german interior ministry has now contracted a working group to take care of the technological aspects of networking all 80,000 polling districts in germany by 2006 , thus making internet voting a second option to traditional voting at the poll station .
going a step further , the government ambitiously also hopes to enable all german citizens to vote over their own computers from the comfort of their homes by 2010 .
advocates of online voting argue that it could help speed up polling results , make the tallying more accurate , be more cost-friendly in the long run and contribute towards an increasingly mobile society .
going will not be smooth but making digital voting a reality is easier said than done .
security concerns are the main hindrances that could block the speedy realisation of internet voting .
of special importance is ensuring that only eligible voters cast their votes and only once at that .
the government also wants to emphasise that voting online is principally an added option – no one will be forced to vote over the internet , but can always choose to vote the traditional way by personally going to the poll station .
privacy and money concerns protecting the anonymity of the voter is another serious security worry .
the digital vote functions much like the traditional vote – the ballots are available over the internet , and all the citizen needs to do is place a cross with the click of the mouse and then confirm with a so-called signature card .
but it ’ s vital that the recipient of the ballot is not able to trace the sender .
research is still being carried out on the signature card to make it 100 percent fool-proof .
christoph meinel , a technology expert at the university of trier told the german news agency dpa that everyone should be sure that no software producer , network operator or even a virus could affect the voter ’ s ballot in an unauthorised manner .
" it shouldn ’ t be possible to trace the ballot paper of a voter , vote more than once or to change a vote , " meinel said .
computer engineering experts also believe that online voting for federal elections would cost the country dearly .
they estimate that creating a signature card and a reading machine for more than 60 million eligible voters would cost several hundred million euro .
online voting not entirely new online voting is not an entirely new concept and is already being tested in instances such as voting a board of directors in a company or a student council at a university .
one of the first complete online votes to be carried out in germany was at the university of osnabrück , where 11,000 students elected members of the student parliament and their representative in the university council with a mouse-click . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

it 's placed a further strain on fraying german-u.s. ties . the already soured political relationship between germany and the united states was dealt a further blow on thursday after highly controversial statements by german justice minister herta däublin-gmelin were made public .
the german newspaper schwäbische tagblatt reported yesterday that the minister of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in a discussion with trade unionists said that president bush wanted to divert attention from domestic political problems through a war against iraq .
she said hitler had employed much the same tactics .
" that ’ s a popular method .
even hitler used it , " the paper quoted däublin-gmelin as saying .
däubler-gmelin herself has strongly protested the way the newspaper has portrayed her comments .
" i simply didn ’ t say that , " she said on thursday .
the minister said that she did not compare bush as a person to hitler , but only their methods .
" i did not equate bush with hitler , " she said .
she called the newspaper report a " distorted view " and " slanderous " .
us furious over anti-american statements her remarks have drawn swift condemnation from the united states .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said , " the usa and germany have a very long and valuable relationship and the relations between the people of the usa and germany are very important to the americans .
but this statement of the minister is outrageous and inexplicable . "
senator jesse helms , the ranking republican on the senate foreign relations committee , released a statement saying he and other members of congress were " appalled " by the anti-american tenor of the german campaign .
" if chancellor schröder succeeds in winning re-election through america-bashing then the u.s. congress must seriously consider moving u.s. forces out of germany and stationing them on the territory of other nato allies , " the statement said .
outrage at home too even within germany , which goes to the polls on sunday , the minister ’ s statements have led to a storm of protest .
in a campaign that has seen chancellor schröder ’ s spd pull ahead of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- partly due to schröder ’ s anti-war rhetoric and unrelenting stance on joining the u.s. in a war against iraq , the minister ’ s comments have been seized upon by the opposition .

there will also be a boost for regional programming , with weekly political slots moving to bbc one from bbc two .
a new political programme on bbc one will also be created for scotland , wales and northern ireland .
the first of the new political television programmes should be on air in mid-january .
the bbc has said it will continue to develop a " consumer-led " approach to politics , with features such as the your politics slot on the six o 'clock news .
there are plans for a five minute digest of yesterday in parliament on bbc one 's breakfast and a seven minute summary of the day 's proceedings on bbc news 24 .
the overall aim is to increase viewing figures for parliamentary programmes by a fifth , with 36 more hours of political viewing a year .
keeping watch bbc chairman gavyn davies said : " the governors have given detailed scrutiny to these plans on two occasions .
" we believe that they will both enhance serious political coverage on the bbc and widen its appeal .
sambrook : ' bbc has important public service role ' " the governors will monitor implementation of the strategy and performance of the new programmes and will welcome feedback during the process . "
the results of the review follow a bbc commissioned survey which suggested many people under the age of 45 were disillusioned with politics and believed politicians to be " crooks " , " liars " and " a waste of time " .
political coverage was seen as white , middle-class , middle-aged men arguing with other white , middle-class , middle-aged men in a " secret shared language " , according to the research .
' engaging people ' the review was led by the bbc 's director of news , richard sambrook , with former newsnight editor sian kevill .
mr sambrook said the " wild speculation " about the changes had proved to have little relation to the real world .
such misplaced rumours had worried politicians but having seen the actual plans , the reaction of the main political parties was " neutral to encouraging " .
mr sambrook added : " i certainly do not think it 's a dumbed down package .
i think it 's quite the opposite . "
low turnout sian kevill said research had shown " growing apathy and disillusion among audiences with the wider political process " .
she added : " we hope these changes and ideas will increase the number of people watching and engaging actively with the democratic process . "
the bbc survey was commissioned after the low turnout at the 2001 general election .

a poll taken after the president 's speech but before iraq 's announcement that it would allow weapons inspectors back into the country showed that 60 % of respondents thought president bush had made his case for ousting saddam hussein .
that was up from 39 % before the speech .
but newspaper columnists , including conservative peggy noonan , had expressed scepticism about the need to invade iraq before the speech , and many continued to do so afterwards .
poll numbers questioned thomas friedman of the new york times is sceptical of polls that suggest americans support saddam hussein 's overthrow . "
the most oft-asked question i heard was some variation of : ' how come all of a sudden we have to launch a war against saddam ? "
thomas friedman , new york times based on questions from radio call-in programmes across the us , mr friedman said : " do n't believe the polls that a majority of americans favour a military strike against iraq .
it 's just not true . "
most americans are perplexed , he said .
" the most oft-asked question i heard was some variation of : ' how come all of a sudden we have to launch a war against saddam ? " '
americans believe that they have done a good job of putting saddam in a box and keeping them there .
they are not concerned about saddam , who they believe is deterrable , mr friedman said .
they are concerned about the " ' undeterrables ' - the kind of young arab-muslim men who hit us on 9/11 . " '
and mr friedman believes that these undeterrables are more of a threat than a contained saddam hussein .
race against time before mr bush 's speech before the un , columnist richard cohen of the washington post was not convinced by administration arguments for attacking iraq .
" i can find no one with any expertise who thinks iraq has an imminent nuclear capability .
similarly , i can find no one who thinks iraq is directly linked to al qaeda and thus to the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , " he wrote on 10 september .
show me the proof , he said .
after mr bush 's speech , he remains sceptical that war is necessary and still believes that the administration has produced no credible evidence linking iraq with the attacks of 11 september .
" ' proof ' of it exists only in the writings of certain conservative commentators who hankered for a war against hussein even before sept .
11 , " he wrote .
and he added that the cia and the state department had stopped looking for such a link .
the american public , at least 53 % of them in a gallup poll in august , believe that saddam hussein was " personally involved in the sept .
11 terrorist attacks . "
but , he believes , " little by little , that number will drop and so , as a result , will support for the war . "
conservative support but , conservatives in the us perceive both the new york times and the washington post to be voices of the " liberal elite " .
the proudly conservative washington times is solidly in the bush camp . "
-lrb- saddam hussein -rrb- has dug his own grave .

it was a false and illusory peace then as is the one that exists in a world with saddam hussein , mr blankley writes .
mr blankley has been convinced by administration arguments that the iraqi leader is arming terrorists .
" he is providing both material and psychological support to the terrorists . "
" before there can be hope and peace and justice in the middle east , there must first not be saddam .

the uk cuts at the group 's dresdner kleinwort wasserstein -lrb- drkw -rrb- banking unit follow a year of sharp falls in the merger and advisory business .
dresdner , owned by the german insurance group , allianz , first announced the job reductions in august , as part of a shake up of its loss-making drkw division .
the 300 uk redundancies represent about 10 % of the unit 's london staff , but the group said up to 1,000 drkw workers would go globally .
market tumble dresdner is the third largest bank in germany , but lost 1.2bn euros -lrb- £ 760m -rrb- in the second quarter of this year as the slump in the german economy hit earnings .
the company has consistently denied speculation that it is preparing to sell its drkw unit .
leonhard fischer , drkw 's chief executive , said earlier this year that he expected the division to be back in profit next year but admitted : " we have to clean up our house and backyard , we have to restructure . "
since the start of the year , the banking industry as a whole has shed almost 60,000 jobs worldwide .
a study from the centre for economics and business research -lrb- cebr -rrb- in june predicted that 21,000 jobs would go in london alone by next year as the investment market continues to struggle .

leonhard fischer , drkw 's chief executive , said earlier this year that he expected the division to be back in profit next year but admitted : " we have to clean up our house and backyard , we have to restructure . "
since the start of the year , the banking industry as a whole has shed almost 60,000 jobs worldwide .
a study from the centre for economics and business research -lrb- cebr -rrb- in june predicted that 21,000 jobs would go in london alone by next year as the investment market continues to struggle .

the latest prediction - based on tests on tonsil and appendix tissue taken out in the 1990s , suggested that approximately 7,000 people could be at high risk of developing vcjd .
now the government plans an even wider programme of tests , setting up a national tissue archive for scientists to examine . "
ultimately , we need a blood test for cjd - but none is available at the moments " professor peter smith , seac large sections of the population were undoubtedly exposed to the contaminated beef thought to cause vcjd during the 1980s and 1990s .
however , scientists have found it difficult to predict with any accuracy how many people will fall ill , mainly because they do not know how long the disease " incubates " in the body before symptoms emerge .
to try to improve predictions , researchers from derriford hospital and the cjd surveillance centre in edinburgh examined more than 8,300 tissue samples taken during routine operations between 1995 and 1999 .
their results are published in the british medical journal .
contaminated meat although some were taken from young children unlikely ever to have been exposed to contaminated meat , many were from much older patients who could be harbouring " prions " - thought by most scientists to be the cause of vcjd .
tonsils , and to a lesser extent appendices , are part of the lymphatic system and probably the places where prions are most likely to accumulate .
so people with high levels of prions in these tissues are thought to be at higher risk of developing vcjd . "
we need larger scale studies particularly of tissue from recently removed tonsils so that we can obtain a more reliable picture of the possible numbers of people who may develop vcjd " dr david hilton , derriford hospital when doctors look at tonsils and appendix tissue from patients who have actually got , or died from vcjd , most have high numbers of prions within them .
however , out of the thousands of samples taken from apparently " healthy " patients , only one showed signs of prion accumulation .
if this rate was the same for the entire population , it would mean that for every million people , 120 would have this higher risk .
this would mean a total of tens of thousands at risk of the disease , a far lower estimate than some of the " worst case scenarios " published by scientists .
larger-scale testing however , the authors of the research suggest that larger-scale testing is needed to form any sort of reliable prediction .
dr david hilton , a consultant neuropathologist , told the bbc 's today programme : " we do not know a lot about the reliability of the test .
" there is quite a large margin for error .
" we need larger scale studies involving tens of thousands of samples particularly of tissue from recently removed tonsils so that we can obtain a more reliable picture of the possible numbers of people who may develop vcjd . "
this is likely to happen after sir liam donaldson , england 's chief medical officer , announced on friday that a new " archive of tonsils " would be created .
he said : " the archive will allow prospective studies to be done on the largest possible number of tonsils so that we can get better estimates of the size of the vcjd epidemic . "
professor peter smith , the chairman of the spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee -lrb- seac -rrb- - which helps set government policy on vcjd - said that while the study provided some reassurance , a larger epidemic was still possible .
he said : " these tests offer a potential way of assessing how many people there might be incubating vcjd .
" larger surveys involving more tissue samples would be useful .
" ultimately , we need a blood test for cjd - but none is available at the moments . "

the wintercomfort centre in cambridge held an open day to unveil the new facilities - the result of four months of renovation .
one highlight is a mediterranean-style courtyard garden .
among the new facilities is a shop , where cheap clothes are on sale .
ms hinchliffe-wood : shop encourages responsibility director mieke hinchliffe-wood said the shop was an important facility for those who use the centre .
" it 's in fact part of making choices in your life , taking responsibility for your life .
" perhaps the difference between the next can of special brew and a pair of jeans may actually be the first step on the way to budgeting . "
the wintercomfort charity hit the headlines in 1999 when its then director ruth wyner was jailed for five years and manager john brock for four .
after an appeal the pair , who became known as the cambridge two , were freed from prison , but their convictions upheld .
