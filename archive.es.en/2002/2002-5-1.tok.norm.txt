anarchists , environmentalists , trades unionists and students were in the crowd of about 500 driven back by police as it tried to approach offices of a company which runs detention centres for asylum-seekers .
may day declared an international working-class celebration in 1889 public holiday in many countries celebrated in pagan times in europe as the first day of spring police are on the alert for anti-globalisation protests across the world , with special attention focussing on london , where previous may day events have degenerated into riots .
in france and venezuela , demonstrations have taken on a special , political significance this year with rival marches planned by parties vying for power in both capital cities .
police in sydney described the disturbances outside australasian correctional management -lrb- acm -rrb- as " not major " despite scuffles as police on horseback forced back the protesters .
protest organiser zanny begg said the aim had been to " imprison " acm in its offices so that the company could " know what it feels like , in the way that they imprison refugees " .
may fayre there were violent scenes at a much bigger rally in berlin , germany , on the eve of may day .
hundreds of police officers rushed into a crowd of about 5,000 at a rock concert after masked protesters reportedly broke into a supermarket and began looting it .
several officers were injured , but there were no reports of protesters being hurt at the rally in the kreuzberg district , which has been a traditional event for years .
in london , about 6,000 police officers are on duty ahead of an anti-globalisation protest in the city 's exclusive mayfair district by about 10,000 people .
some businesses have been boarding up their windows in anticipation of anti-capitalist violence , although organisers of the " may fayre " have portrayed it rather as a carnival .
features include a strolling circus and a mass football match .
le pen 's may day with the run-off in france 's presidential election falling this sunday , may day in paris will see two huge rallies for and against far-right contender jean-marie le pen .
the leader of the national front is leading the party 's traditional march to honour france 's patron saint , joan of arc .
meanwhile , hundreds of thousands of people who oppose mr le pen 's views are due to march in protest at his success in reaching the run-off .
police are hoping that the scheduled routes will keep the marchers safely apart .
in the venezuelan capital , caracas , supporters and opponents of the controversial venezuelan president , hugo chavez , are due to hold rival may day rallies .
previous protests against mr chavez 's radical leftist policies have ended in violence with 17 people shot dead last month in unrest which removed the president from power temporarily .
may day protests could spill over into unrest this year in other countries : in the philippines , riot police are surrounding the presidential palace in manila against supporters of joseph estrada , the imprisoned ex-president .
in south korea , tens of thousands of trades unionists will turn out in 10 major cities .

it is comparatively rare , affecting around one or two people in every thousand , mainly older people .
today breakfast asked should we be worried about it , and what steps can we take to help prevent it .
our gp dr rosemary leonard and travel editor sophy roberts debated the issue on breakfast .
-lrb- click on the video icon on the top right hand corner to watch this interview -rrb- deep vein thrombosis , commonly referred to as dvt , is a disease of the circulation .
it occurs most often in people who have not been able to exercise normally .
blood passing through the deepest veins in the calf or thigh flows relatively slowly : when a dvt occurs it moves so slowly that it forms a solid clot which becomes wedged in the vein .
what are the symptoms ?
quite often there are no symptoms at all .
where they do exist there may be pain or tenderness in the leg and raised skin temperature around the area .
sudden swelling in one leg may be the first sign .
occasionally some of the surface veins are more visible through the skin .
there may also be pain on flexing the foot upwards .
how can a dvt be detected ?
dvts are most commonly detected nowadays by use of ultrasound - scientists say they can now use this method to detect even the smallest of clots .
blood tests can also give a good indication that there is a thrombosis .
one test which measures the levels of a by-product of clotting material called d-dimer is commonly used .
if the doctor suspects a dvt he will usually request an urgent ultrasound and order blood tests .
how dangerous is it ?
dvts themselves are not life-threatening but they are associated with complications which can be fatal .
the most common serious complication is a pulmonary embolism which occurs in between one in three and one in four cases of dvt .
a piece of the clot lodged in the leg vein breaks off and travels through the body to the lung , where it becomes lodged again causing severe breathing difficulties .
untreated , up to one in ten people who suffer a pulmonary embolism die as a result .
more rarely , a part of the clot may also lodge in other organs including the brain , where it leads to a stroke .
one less serious complication is post-thrombotic syndrome , which affects many people after a dvt , due to damage to the valves along the length of the vein .
it can cause pain and swelling and ulceration of the skin around the area .
how is dvt treated ?
around two thirds of people with a dvt need to be cared for in hospital in the initial stages .
the aim is to dissolve the clot and , in the longer term , prevent other clots from forming .
the main treatment for dvt - or similar problems with clotting of the blood - is medicines which will thin the blood and allow it to flow more easily .
on diagnosis of a dvt , this usually initially involves giving high doses of the drug heparin by injection .
patients are also prescribed a similar drug , warfarin , in tablet form , which they may stay on for several months .
when taking these blood thinning drugs patients usually have regular blood tests to make sure they are getting the right dose and are not at risk of a haemorrhage .
painkillers and heat applied to the area may also be advised for relief of symptoms of a dvt .
patients will be encouraged to move around as much as they can .
compression stockings are often worn to cover the length of the whole leg to give support to the veins and reduce swelling .
are there any risk factors ?
dvts are rare in young people , usually occurring in people aged over 40 .
there are a number of related conditions which increase the likelihood of developing a dvt cancer obesity varicose veins family history of dvt paralyisis or immobility .
a dvt can happen after major surgery or a broken leg because of being unable to move the leg and encourage blood flow through it .
this happens now than in the past , because gentle exercise is encouraged at the first opportunity .
women taking the pill are three or four times more likely to suffer a dvt than those who do n't and there is also an increased risk for women on hormone replacement therapy .
women who are pregnant or who have recently given birth are also at increased risk of developing a dvt .
one group in whom dvts are becoming more common are travellers .
a french study has shown that journeys more than five hours long by car , plane or train increase the risk of dvt fourfold .
there is particular risk with air travel because of the combination of inactivity and dehydration , which makes the blood more sticky .
a recent study in the lancet showed that as many as one in ten passengers could suffer dvt unless they wore the special compression stockings .
can dvt be prevented ?
people who have already had a dvt are more at risk of going on to develop another one .
taking drug thinning drugs such as aspirin is one way to cut the risk of developing a clot .
taking a low dose of aspirin before a long flight , for example , may reduce risk as does walking around in the cabin .
foot exercises while sitting down - rotating the ankles and wiggling the toes - prevents the blood pooling in the feet and then struggling to climb up through the veins .
wearing compression stockings may also be advised for those at risk of developing a dvt .
special foot cushions have been developed so passengers can exercise while sitting at their seats .
keeping mobile is vital .
immediately after an operation , people are encouraged to get out of bed as early as possible , because of the chance that lying still may lead to a dvt . watch / listen on this story rosemary leonard and sophy roberts talk about dvt home when we are on air recent forums programme archive studio tour today 's information meet the team presenters reporters your say contact us your comments see also : 31 jan 02 -pipe- health green light for dvt compensation bid 24 jan 02 -pipe- health tourist who feared dvt wins damages 21 jan 02 -pipe- health jury out on dvt link say airlines 15 jan 02 -pipe- health fast and ' reliable ' dvt test unveiled 13 sep 01 -pipe- health longer flights have ' greater dvt risk ' 11 may 01 -pipe- c-d deep vein thrombosis internet links : deep vein thrombosis aviation health institute victims of air related dvt association the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites e-mail this story to a friend links to more breakfast stories in this section venables named leeds boss new hope in the fight against aids hewitt 's " great piece of gold .
