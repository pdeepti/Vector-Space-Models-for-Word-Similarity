german president johannes rau is meeting with leaders in brandenburg tuesday to investigate conflicting votes cast in a controversial immigration measure .

instead , it sparked the greatest political row of the year .
a divisive day in the bundesrat on march 22 , brandenburg 's conservative interior minister , jörg schönbohm of the christian democratic union , voted against the immigration measure in the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber .

a constitutional court challenge ?
the opposition union parties immediately threatened to contest the vote tallying to the federal constitutional court if rau signed the bill .
under the german constitution , a state delegation to the bundesrat is required to vote unanimously .
rau has been weighing his decision for several months now .

before signing the immigration bill into law , rau must determine whether its passage was legal .

german president johannes rau is meeting with leaders in brandenburg tuesday to investigate conflicting votes cast in a controversial immigration measure .
the bill could be headed for a constitutional challenge . back in march , after an angrily disputed vote tally in germany 's upper legislative chamber , it seemed like two things could happen to the country 's first-ever immigration bill : it would either be derailed or it would spiral germany into an unprecedented constitutional crises .
a few months on , flaring tempers have cooled , but the legislation is still stalled on the desk of german president johannes rau , who must sign it before it becomes law , like kindling waiting to ignite a fire .

the bill 's creators also sought to draw attention to the multicultural face of germany , where more than 7 million immigrants now reside - from turkish mom-and-pop shop owners to indians working in the it industry .
instead , it sparked the greatest political row of the year .
a divisive day in the bundesrat on march 22 , brandenburg 's conservative interior minister , jörg schönbohm of the christian democratic union , voted against the immigration measure in the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber .

social democrat klaus wowereit , premier of berlin and president of the bundesrat , counted stolpe 's vote as the official vote .
a constitutional court challenge ?
the opposition union parties immediately threatened to contest the vote tallying to the federal constitutional court if rau signed the bill .
under the german constitution , a state delegation to the bundesrat is required to vote unanimously .
rau has been weighing his decision for several months now .

german president johannes rau is meeting with leaders in brandenburg tuesday to investigate conflicting votes cast in a controversial immigration measure .
the bill could be headed for a constitutional challenge . back in march , after an angrily disputed vote tally in germany 's upper legislative chamber , it seemed like two things could happen to the country 's first-ever immigration bill : it would either be derailed or it would spiral germany into an unprecedented constitutional crises .
a few months on , flaring tempers have cooled , but the legislation is still stalled on the desk of german president johannes rau , who must sign it before it becomes law , like kindling waiting to ignite a fire .
on tuesday , rau is set to meet with the premier and interior minister of the state of brandenburg whose votes on the bill briefly threw germany into a political crisis earlier this year .

the bill 's creators also sought to draw attention to the multicultural face of germany , where more than 7 million immigrants now reside - from turkish mom-and-pop shop owners to indians working in the it industry .
instead , it sparked the greatest political row of the year .
a divisive day in the bundesrat on march 22 , brandenburg 's conservative interior minister , jörg schönbohm of the christian democratic union , voted against the immigration measure in the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber .

social democrat klaus wowereit , premier of berlin and president of the bundesrat , counted stolpe 's vote as the official vote .
a constitutional court challenge ?
the opposition union parties immediately threatened to contest the vote tallying to the federal constitutional court if rau signed the bill .
under the german constitution , a state delegation to the bundesrat is required to vote unanimously .
rau has been weighing his decision for several months now .
though the meeting has not been officially confirmed , government sources have told the press that rau will seek to find out whether the members of the brandenburg delegation had established any agreements prior to the bundesrat vote .

a few months on , flaring tempers have cooled , but the legislation is still stalled on the desk of german president johannes rau , who must sign it before it becomes law , like kindling waiting to ignite a fire .
on tuesday , rau is set to meet with the premier and interior minister of the state of brandenburg whose votes on the bill briefly threw germany into a political crisis earlier this year .

the bill 's creators also sought to draw attention to the multicultural face of germany , where more than 7 million immigrants now reside - from turkish mom-and-pop shop owners to indians working in the it industry .
instead , it sparked the greatest political row of the year .
a divisive day in the bundesrat on march 22 , brandenburg 's conservative interior minister , jörg schönbohm of the christian democratic union , voted against the immigration measure in the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber .
but brandenburg 's social democratic premier and schönbohm 's coalition government partner manfred stolpe , voted in favor .
social democrat klaus wowereit , premier of berlin and president of the bundesrat , counted stolpe 's vote as the official vote .
a constitutional court challenge ?
the opposition union parties immediately threatened to contest the vote tallying to the federal constitutional court if rau signed the bill .
under the german constitution , a state delegation to the bundesrat is required to vote unanimously .
rau has been weighing his decision for several months now .
though the meeting has not been officially confirmed , government sources have told the press that rau will seek to find out whether the members of the brandenburg delegation had established any agreements prior to the bundesrat vote .
opposition lobbies rau bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber since march , opposition leaders have lobbied rau intensively not to sign the bill .
bavarian premier and union-bloc chancellor candidate edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- believes the vote tally in the bundesrat was unconstitutional and threatened earlier this week in an interview with the newspaper die welt to make the disputed decision a campaign theme .
if rau signed the bill , he said , it would not just be a question of a constitutional court challenge , but also of the " public interest . "
law still on track however , spd parliamentary group leader peter struck told the hannoverschen allgemeinen zeitung newspaper he was convinced that the law would become effective as scheduled on january 1 , 2003 , and that " even if there is a constitutional court review , it would come to no other conclusion . "
before signing the immigration bill into law , rau must determine whether its passage was legal .

the appliances use the mineral coltan , obtained mainly from the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
part of the country is the last stronghold of the eastern lowland gorilla , which the film says is in drastic decline .
it says a united nations initiative to save the apes could prove a vital factor .
the film , no hiding place - part two , made by television trust for the environment -lrb- tve -rrb- , is shown on bbc world in its earth report series . click here to watch bbc world and its report on the world 's great apes .
tve assesses the prospects for grasp , the great apes survival project , launched by the un environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- and unesco .
mineral frenzy it says there is evidence suggesting that in the last five years the eastern lowland gorillas have declined by 80-90 % , with just 3,000 or so animals left alive .
coltan fuels a vicious war but eastern drc is a war zone , where factions vie for power across the borders of rwanda , burundi and uganda .
coltan is used to make pinhead capacitors , which regulate voltage and store energy in mobile phones .
the spread of mobile phones across the world in recent years has led to a coltan boom in eastern drc , home to 80 % of the world 's coltan reserves .
tve says the price of coltan surged a few years ago from $ 65 to $ 600 a kilogram .
the animals have gone , the forest is silent , and when the loggers finally move what 's left for the indigenous people ?
nothing .
dr jane goodall the british primatologist ian redmond says : " to work in the park , the miners have to pay one spoonful of coltan to the military , and one spoon to the local chief .
that means about $ 15 .
" there are about 15,000 people working here , each paying $ 15 per week to the military who control the region .
" that 's something in the region of $ 1m a month going into the pockets of the militia . "
unwittingly , tve says , the users of mobile phones and other devices incorporating coltan are contributing to the apes ' downfall .
dr jane goodall , renowned for her four decades of work with chimpanzees , tells tve the problem has become acute in the last 10 years , as big logging companies , especially european ones , open up the forests .
left hungry she says : " hunters from the towns go along the roads and shoot everything - elephants , apes , monkeys , bats and birds .
" they smoke it , load it on to the trucks and take it into the cities .
it does n't feed starving people , but people who 'll pay more for bushmeat .
infant orangs are taken for pets " the pygmy hunters who 've lived in harmony with the forest for hundreds of years are now being given guns and ammunition and paid to shoot for the logging camps .
and that 's absolutely not sustainable .
" the animals have gone , the forest is silent , and when the loggers finally move what 's left for the indigenous people ?
nothing . "
national asset in asia , tve says , illegal logging and unsustainable commercial timber production have fuelled a sharp decline in the numbers of orang-utans .
infants are highly prized in the international pet trade , but capturing them inevitably means the death of the mother , the film says .
orang-utans , unlike other great apes , can be re-introduced to the wild .
but forest loss is so bad that conservationists are trying to return them to partially cleared areas .
the film says great apes are a valuable economic resource for their host countries , because they attract tourists .
jane goodall tells tve : " the bounty of the forest is gradually getting less and less and less .
" so the grasp initiative is really crucial in spreading knowledge about the situation , which is very frightening . "

dubbed the " world 's biggest car park " because vehicles are often slowed to standing , the london orbital is the focus of a government-funded study published on tuesday .
the report concludes that if nothing is done to drastically reduce congestion , the m25 corridor will see a 33 % increase in traffic by 2016 .
we can not build our way out of this mess friends of the earth among the report 's recommendations are that tolls be levied to pay for lane widening and a luxury bus service circling the capital .
report author david hardcastle said that the number of cars in the south east is set to increase by three million in 15 years and the existing m25 will not be able to cope .
" to put the brake on this growth , at the same time as addressing congestion on the m25 , a package of measures that combines new public transport alternatives with road widening and control of road use is needed , " he said .
' tough on motorists ' earlier this month , new transport secretary alistair darling ruled out a network of toll roads in britain .
it was in reaction to a suggestion by lord birt , appointed by tony blair to look at transport policy , for a network of " premium " toll roads to be built alongside existing motorways .
but mr darling did make it clear he was prepared to get tough with motorists to cut traffic congestion .
the key recommendations in the report by transport consultancy halliburton are : the establishment of a frequent orbital coach network , co-ordinated by a newly-created strategic coach authority , which would connect key towns in the m25 corridor , providing an alternative to car travel support for major new rail infrastructure developments such as crossrail , thameslink 2000 and airtrack , alongside improvements to orbital lines such as the north downs line widening the m25 , but only in conjunction with measures such as controlled entry to the motorway or segregated lanes for priority vehicles - which are likely to include emergency service vehicles , buses and cars with more than one passenger - and a toll for priority lanes an electronically collected motorway toll .
mr hardcastle added : " we believe that for any road widening of the m25 to be sustainable it should be in conjunction with road user change . "
friends of the earth welcomed some of the strategy 's suggestions but said that the motorway must not be widened .
spokesman tony bosworth said : " we can not build our way out of this mess .
" the government must dramatically improve public transport and develop alternative strategies including road-user charging . "
' extend tolls ' geoff dossetter , of the freight transport association , said tolls " simply had to be on the agenda " .
" goods vehicles will be taxed by distance from 2006 using satellite tracking technology , " he added .
" however , it is cars that are the primary cause of congestion and it is logical that the technology applied to tax , or ' road toll ' , goods vehicles , should be extended to cars as soon as possible . "
views on the consultant 's provisional strategy are being sought by 31 july .
the orbit study 's final recommendations will be submitted to regional planning bodies and the mayor of london in the autumn for consideration .

dubbed the " world 's biggest car park " because vehicles are often slowed to standing , the london orbital is the focus of a government-funded study published on tuesday .
the report concludes that if nothing is done to drastically reduce congestion , the m25 corridor will see a 33 % increase in traffic by 2016 . "
we can not build our way out of this mess " friends of the earth among the report 's recommendations are that tolls be levied to pay for lane widening and a luxury bus service circling the capital .
report author david hardcastle said that the number of cars in the south east is set to increase by three million in 15 years and the existing m25 will not be able to cope .
" to put the brake on this growth , at the same time as addressing congestion on the m25 , a package of measures that combines new public transport alternatives with road widening and control of road use is needed , " he said .
' tough on motorists ' earlier this month , new transport secretary alistair darling ruled out a network of toll roads in britain .
it was in reaction to a suggestion by lord birt , appointed by tony blair to look at transport policy , for a network of " premium " toll roads to be built alongside existing motorways .
but mr darling did make it clear he was prepared to get tough with motorists to cut traffic congestion .
the key recommendations in the report by transport consultancy halliburton are : the establishment of a frequent orbital coach network , co-ordinated by a newly-created strategic coach authority , which would connect key towns in the m25 corridor , providing an alternative to car travel support for major new rail infrastructure developments such as crossrail , thameslink 2000 and airtrack , alongside improvements to orbital lines such as the north downs line widening the m25 , but only in conjunction with measures such as controlled entry to the motorway or segregated lanes for priority vehicles - which are likely to include emergency service vehicles , buses and cars with more than one passenger - and a toll for priority lanes an electronically collected motorway toll .
mr hardcastle added : " we believe that for any road widening of the m25 to be sustainable it should be in conjunction with road user change . "
friends of the earth welcomed some of the strategy 's suggestions but said that the motorway must not be widened .
spokesman tony bosworth said : " we can not build our way out of this mess .
" the government must dramatically improve public transport and develop alternative strategies including road-user charging . "
' extend tolls ' geoff dossetter , of the freight transport association , said tolls " simply had to be on the agenda " .
" goods vehicles will be taxed by distance from 2006 using satellite tracking technology , " he added .
" however , it is cars that are the primary cause of congestion and it is logical that the technology applied to tax , or ' road toll ' , goods vehicles , should be extended to cars as soon as possible . "
views on the consultant 's provisional strategy are being sought by 31 july .
the orbit study 's final recommendations will be submitted to regional planning bodies and the mayor of london in the autumn for consideration .

the increased use of outside engineering companies to do work on the tracks hardly affects passengers , and is n't obvious to passengers but it has become a controversial issue , and even more so following the potters bar train crash .
at the centre of the debate is railtrack - a company which has engineering at its heart , and a duty to maintain the health of the rail network .
yet railtrack does not employ many people who actually get their hands dirty .
in fact , for a long time there was hardly an engineer to be found within the company 's boardroom . "
the crashes at hatfield and potters bar were both caused by faulty track which was maintained by private contractors " railtrack contracts out the work of inspecting , maintaining and replacing track to a range of engineering firms .
the biggest are jarvis , balfour beatty , carillion and amey .
they in turn might contract out work to smaller companies which put together gangs of track workers .
even these companies might not directly recruit their workers - often they are provided by specialised recruitment agencies .
this complicated string of arrangements has been regularly criticised by the transport select committee , which regards the use of contractors as one of the biggest problems caused by privatisation .
the crashes at hatfield and potters bar were both caused by faulty track which was maintained by private contractors .
raising standards newspaper reports have claimed that track workers break the safety rules by doing double shifts to earn extra money and that they 're more interested in getting home early than getting the job done .
railtrack has begun a full investigation .
a report by the health and safety executive this week accepts that contracting out work does not in itself result in poor safety standards .
others might disagree , but the health and safety executive -lrb- hse -rrb- does raise concerns about the commitment of the rail industry in general and railtrack in particular , to tighten up standards .
the report calls for " commitment and leadership from senior managers in the industry to ensure words on paper become reality " .
it will require an " acknowledgement of responsibility by railtrack " .
the hse was not impressed at the number of occasions that railtrack opposed attempts by inspectors to improve safety standards .
another big concern is the lack of any system to ensure that work done on the track is properly carried out .
staff training has so far been left to the contracting companies .
but railtrack is now developing plans for training track workers .
railway reform it is also trying to sign more long-term contracts , to ensure good staff are kept in a job .
the hse says " it is arguable that this should have happened sooner " .
railtrack is ultimately responsible for work done on its railway lines .
however , the hse has powers to prosecute when things go wrong .
it is currently carrying out an inquiry into the death of a student , michael mungovan , while working on business rail lines near waterloo station in south london .
he was hit by a train .
the verdict of an inquiry jury was that he was unlawfully killed .
it is clear that the rail industry is under pressure to tighten up the system of contractors .
before he resigned as transport secretary , stephen byers , said just " tinkering at the edges " was not enough - a complete reform of the system was needed .
soon railtrack will be taken over as the custodian of the nation 's rail lines .
it will be replaced most likely by a government backed consortium called network rail .
the question is whether this newcomer will decide that if you want a job done , it 's worth doing it yourself .

easyjet on tuesday said it carried 898,080 passengers in may , 43 % more than in the same period last year .
the airline 's load factor - the average number of occupied seats per flight as a proportion of the total number of seats available - fell to 82.1 % from 83.6 % in may last year .
separately , former ba subsidiary go said it carried just over 500,000 passengers in may , 89 % more than it did one year earlier .
the increase in passenger numbers is good news for easyjet , mid-way through a planned £ 374m takeover of go .
flying high easyjet and other no-frills carriers have been luring passengers away from flag carriers by offering cheap fares in the european short-haul market .
this tactic has insulated the budget airline sector from a sharp decline in passenger numbers linked to the 11 september attacks and last year 's economic downturn .
on monday , easyjet 's dublin-based rival ryanair posted a 40 % increase in profits , to a record 172m euros -lrb- £ 110m ; $ 161m -rrb- , during the last financial year .
the proposed tie-up between easyjet and go , which easyjet shareholders are expected to approve at their annual meeting next week , could put ryanair under added competitive pressure .
the easyjet-go combination will create europe 's biggest no-frills airline , knocking ryanair off the number one spot .

the proposal to strip the hospital in omagh of its acute facilities is contained in a consultation document due to be issued on wednesday last year , when the hayes team reported on acute hospitals they said a new hospital should be built in enniskillen and that acute services in omagh should be withdrawn .
wednesday 's report is expected to accept that finding .
in 1996 , northern ireland had 19 acute hospitals which had full accident and emergency units and the facilities to carry out life-saving surgery .
in the years since then there have been a series of reports from the department of health and from the health boards , all recommending the number should be cut .
in that time four acute hospitals have closed - ards , banbridge , south tyrone in dungannon , which was supposedly a temporary measure , and the route in ballymoney which shut when the new causeway hospital opened at coleraine .
wednesday 's report is also expected to agree with the hayes suggestion for the downgrading of a number of other hospitals .
the department of health is expected to emphasise that these hospitals will continue to provide a range of services for their local populations , such as diagnostic tests , out-patient clinics and accident and emergency departments .
however , in many places these will be run by nurses instead of doctors .

speaking during a visit to the south of the country , where the military is still pursuing the rebels , she insisted that her troops had exercised good judgment .
mrs arroyo noted that some media reports had described friday 's operation - which succeeded in rescuing one of the hostages , american missionary gracia burnham - as a " botched job " . "
our military commanders made the right call " philippines president gloria arroyo mrs burnham has since returned to her home in wichita , kansas .
her husband , martin , and a filipina nurse , ediborah yap , were killed in the rescue attempt .
" our military commanders made the right call .
they made the correct call , " president arroyo told a news conference .
the philippines leader noted that both the us government and the rescued hostage herself had refused to criticise the operation .
" we especially want to thank the military men ... who risked and even gave their lives to rescue us , " gracia burnham said , on being freed .
it is still not clear whether martin burnham was killed by his captors or in crossfire during the rescue mission .
mrs arroyo said she was planning to name a hospital after the nurse who was killed , and that the military was planning to enlist one of her sons , jonathan yap , " because he wants to help " in the fight against the abu sayyaf .
fight continues the philippines leader stressed that the operation against the rebels was far from over .
but mrs arroyo said there was also a more fundamental fight to be won - the battle against poverty .
unless that is won , she said , " we will have another generation , another outburst sometime in the future " .
she has already declared that the military will unleash its full military arsenal on the rebels now they are no longer holding hostages .
us ambassador to the philippines , francis ricciardone , has said that mrs burnham had given the troops fresh information on the personalities and methods of the abu sayyaf .
surveillance has been stepped up at philippine ports , to prevent the rebels ' escape abroad , and bloodhounds are also helping about 1,000 troops to hunt for the abu sayyaf .

it seems we just ca n't escape those trying to sell us stuff .
you may not know it but your lifestyle is causing all kinds of problems for people who want to sell you stuff .
sophisticated 21st century consumers get information from so many sources that advertisers find it hard to target those who might be interested in their products .
on the box spending on tv ads in 2001 was down 11 % on 2000 world advertising research centre and television advertising is losing its place as the best way to reach consumers .
when there were only three channels in the uk , prime-time adverts would be seen by enough of the people the marketers wanted to reach .
now with tens of tv channels and increasing competition from the web , radio , newspapers and magazines , the adverts on commercial television channels are simply not being seen by the right people .
as analyst firm verdict research put it : " the scattergun of old must be replaced by a collection of rifles aimed at more segmented customer groups . "
so now attention has turned to places that host captive audiences with roughly the same interests .
for instance , many railway stations see crowds of commuters pass through every morning and evening .
also doctors ' surgeries are host to regular clinics when particular groups , such as expectant mothers , are present .
and those who patronise some shops are from a very tightly defined demographic , much more so than the audience for any tv advert .
it is these places that advertisers and brand owners are starting to target - and they are using technology to get their messages across .
watch your back the prada mega-boutique in new york has cameras and large screens in its changing rooms to let shoppers see what they look like from behind in one of the designer 's creations .
the same system can also show the same outfit in different colours and display possible accessories .
the image-conscious shopper can also adjust the lighting in the changing room to check what they might look like in daylight , harsh office lighting or in the evening .
prada is using the technology in only a few of its stores but others are more wholeheartedly adopting it .
selfridges has put 50 screens in its flagship store on london 's oxford street , and wh smith 's and debenhams plan to follow suit .
with good reason .
it is much easier to influence the buying behaviour of a shopper than someone sat on the sofa at home .
bob clarke , founder of the instrumental media group which builds and manages in-store networks , says three-quarters of all buying decisions are made four feet from the counter .
" consumers are notorious for getting to the point of sale and being seduced by what they see in front of them , " he says .
power of persuasion and we are particularly susceptible while out shopping for items we want rather than need .
we all need fluid to survive , but a bottle of alpine spring water glimpsed in david beckham 's hand can be much more desirable - and a timely reminder may help open your wallet .
shops can also tie the adverts and programmes they are showing to what they are selling .
if demand for a product is down , an in-store advertising blitz could up sales .
importantly for retailers , the adverts and messages shown are not policed by the independent television commission .
editorial and advertising are free to mix .
and the shops can sell advertising slots to brand owners and charge more for busy times , just as tv channels do .
selfridges , for instance , stocks more than 3,000 brands and each company will want their product to stand out .
it 's not just shops installing screens .
instrumental media is working on plans to put screens in doctors ' surgeries and working men 's clubs .
these will show programmes tailored to these very specific - and sometimes very large - audiences .
it seems that soon we just wo n't be able to avoid adverts .
some of your comments so far : viewrinals - little tv screens set into urinals .
you watch adverts while going to the toilet .
matty , uk the local grocery store placed a small screen with motion detector advertising a popular drink .
but the noise level was much to high and ended up surprising customers into dissatisfaction - even to the point of making small children cry .
it was pulled after just two weeks .
paul , hong kong last year my gym showed get fit quick weight loss programs every morning , on screens in front of the running machines and exercise bikes .
i changed gym .
liam , norway whenever someone sends me junk mail by post i return it with any other pizza leaflets , estate agent blurb , etc in their pre-paid envelope .
ann , england in a club i was mildly annoyed to find that in the gents toilets there were small video screens playing x-box adverts - i no longer have any desrie to own one .
jamie , uk in a supermarket in toronto i picked up a moisturiser , and an ad for a competing product played on a small monitor above the bottles .
so i put back the first bottle and picked up another brand - and the screen started playing an ad for the first one !
i could n't make a decision , so i bought one bottle of each and then felt bad about it .
amelia , uk at a petrol station recently i was almost deafened by the adverts being projected across the forecourt .
it was very unpleasant but not as unpleasant as for the man who lived opposite and was asking for the din to be turned down to reasonable levels - only to be told that this was not possible .
ellen , uk in japan there are little -lrb- and not so little -rrb- screens everywhere .
one of my personal favourites is a little video screen in the supermarket , running an ad about a shampoo , just next to said shampoo .
trains and subways have television screens with useful information -lrb- like the weather -rrb- interspersed with ads .
it made journeys more interesting .
anon , england several petrol stations have recently installed large screens so they can bombard you with ads for credit-repair scams and " make money by claiming compensation " legal services .
i tend to go elsewhere .
david moran , scotland / australia have you seen ads screening in places you do n't expect - and have you been persuaded to buy ?
