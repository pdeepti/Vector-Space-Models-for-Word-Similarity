after weeks of hovering around the us dollar , but always stopping short of reaching parity with it , europe ’ s common currency finally made the breakthrough .
on monday the euro soared almost a cent above the dollar . for the first time in two and a half years one euro can buy more than one us dollar .
it closed in on its monday peak of $ 1.0089 and edged back to $ 1.0032 by late afternoon .
the news is music to the ears of currency traders and a vindication for european politicians who are likely to feel that the much-mocked euro has finally come of age .
the euro parity with the dollar has also restored some credibility to the single european currency and the european central bank .
the high euro will help keep the price of imported goods low .
and it 's also good news for the beleaguered travel industry as trips outside the eurozone will become cheaper .
a boost after months of shakiness but the euro is still far below its launching price .
three years ago europe 's common currency was born at a value of one dollar and 18 cents .
in late 2000 europe ’ s floundering infant currency badly crashed to below $ 0.85 , sending shock waves around the continent .
it has been up and down - mostly down - ever since .
only since the beginning of this year did the euro begin its uphill climb , though always playing second fiddle to a strong us dollar .
dollar-driven euro rise ?
but despite the jubilation , most currency experts are still saying the return to parity has been primarily a dollar story and that it has all been fuelled by continuing concerns over us corporate earnings statements .
the large us current account deficit and alarm over us accounting practices have all led to falling investor confidence in the us economy .
several experts feel that for the us , the fall back through parity is the final sign that markets have lost faith in the strength of the us economy , which has been the motor of the world economy for the past decade .
" this is the final nail in the coffin of the new economy " , david bloom , currency strategist at hsbc in london told the financial times .
" the us has spent years telling the rest of the world how to run their economies and now markets are finally awakening to the problems of the us economy " .
everything is n't hunky-dory at the same time europe will begin worrying about the problems that a rising euro brings with it .
there is little doubt that the higher the euro goes , the more economic growth will suffer , mainly because it will be harder for european exporters to stay competitive outside the eurozone .

today , düsseldorf is mostly known for its exclusive fashion boutiques along the famous königsallee .
but 25 years ago , punk ruled the streets of this western german city , as a new exhibit there shows . along with hamburg and berlin , düsseldorf was a center for the early punk and new wave scene in germany between 1977 and 1982 .
bands such as kfc , mittagspause , daf , zk or fehlfarben came from düsseldorf .
although these groups represented many different kinds of music , styles and attitudes , they had one thing in common : the urge to break out of the political and social molds of the late 1970s .
these bands wanted to oppose the sentimental images of hippies bent on improving the world .
a phenomenon of the times famous songs of the time included " verschwende deine jugend " -lrb- " waste your youth " -rrb- by daf or " zurück zum beton " -lrb- " back to concrete " -rrb- by s.y.p.h.
" zurück zum beton " is also the title of a new exhibit dealing with the early years of punk and new wave at the kunsthalle in düsseldorf .
the museum says a variety of original objects intend to show the multi-faceted aspects of the punk and new wave phenomenon .
the exhibit is divided into still and moving images .
one room is covered wall-to-wall with record covers , concert photos and posters .
cd players blast out sounds by the legendary bands to accompany the visuals .
another room shows non-stop slides and short documentary films .
the exhibit is rounded off by some hardware , including the drum set built out of junk used by the einstürzende neubauten .
the children 's keyboard " casio vl tone " – played by new wave gurus trio on their hit " da da da " – is displayed , as well .
the crossover of music and art technical developments in the late 1970s played a central role in punk .
new affordable copying and production methods , such as photocopiers , super 8 , polaroid , and the first video cameras , double cassette decks and home studios were the tools for a self-organized counter culture .
they marked the asthetics of the " brilliant dilettantes " , as the stars called themselves at the time .
this did not go unnoticed by the art scene , which crossed punk bands at clubs such as the ratinger hof in düsseldorf or so 36 in berlin .
artists played in bands , designed record covers , documented many punk concerts , and organized exhibitions with band performances .
" zurück zum beton " would n't have worked without the help of music journalist jürgen teipel .
over the past three years , teipel conversed with protagonists of the early punk and new wave generation , editing almost 1,000 hours ’ worth of interviews into a type of documentary novel , verschwende deine jugend .
his connections – and the participants ’ willingness to cooperate - helped to put together a show whose representatives are now either in or approaching their forties . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 dw-tv europe live typisch deutsch we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.07.2002 deutsche telekom chief steps down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after seven tempestuous years , deutsche telekom ceo ron sommer is stepping down .
ron sommer announced on tuesday he is resigning from the top spot at deutsche telekom .
the ceo had lost the support of the government and many small shareholders as telekom ’ s debt ballooned and its share price plummeted . citing a breakdown in trust with the supervisory board and a desire to avoid further damage to the company , deutsche telekom ’ s ceo ron sommer announced his resignation on tuesday .
the move caps a week of intense speculation and rumours about the future of beleaguered telecoms boss .
" when a chief executive can not really on the full confidence of the supervisory board , resignation is the only responsible step left open , " sommer said at a press conference at deutsche telekom ’ s headquarters in bonn .
the supervisory board later announced it has named helmut sihler , a 72-year-old former board chair , as the company ’ s caretaker ceo for the next six months .
gerd tenzer , the german government ’ s favored candidate for the top job but seen by many analysts as colorless , will act as sihler ’ s deputy .
hans-dietrich winkhaus , chair of the supervisory board , said europe ’ s largest telecommunications company would now set itself on a radical course to reduce the 67 billion euro -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- debt on the telekom books .
on tuesday evening , telekom stocks were up 4.62 percent to 11.09 euro .
loss of critical support sommer ’ s future was anything but certain even in the hours leading up to his resignation , despite the pressure from many quarters over the last week for change at the top .
the israeli-born sommer , 53 , took over the telekom reigns in 1995 and presided over the company ’ s partial privatization in 1996 , convincing millions of stock-shy germans to buy shares in the company with his smooth sales pitch .
but those stocks proved a key element in his eventual downfall .
after the explosive telecoms boom of the late 1990 ’ s came the equally dramatic bust of 2001 , leaving the german giant saddled with debt and pushing its " t-shares " into the basement .
the shares lost 90 percent of their value in the last two years .
that development robbed the often-criticized sommer of one important pillar of support he had always counted on , that of german chancellor gerhard schröder .
the current social democratic government , which owns 43 percent of telekom , is facing an election in september and is behind in the polls .
it has been trying to woo the three million small telekom investors angry that the company ’ s stock has hit rock bottom .
a change at the top , the government ’ s thinking went , might change the ailing company ’ s fortunes and last week it went about looking for a replacement for sommer .
allies rallied around but sommer did not go easy .
the charismatic one-time mathematician had some powerful allies on his side .
henry m. paulson , head of the us bank goldman , sachs , wrote a letter to the chairman of telecom ’ s advisory board stating that sacking sommer would have " negative consequences " on its business .
last friday , more than 18,000 telekom employees put ads in newspapers across germany telling the government to keep out of telekom ’ s internal affairs .
on tuesday , 300 staff gathered in front of company headquarters in bonn , again demanding that the government stop meddling in their company ’ s business .
" most of us are behind sommer .
after all , there ’ s no suitable replacement , " frank klann , a telekom employee who also owns company stock , told reuters .
" of course i ’ m disappointed -lrb- about the share price -rrb- , but i also own other shares and let ’ s not pretend that they aren ’ t all dogs . "
but in the end , sommer ’ s renowned charisma and self-confidence could not beat a government plotting his overthrow .
even before the supervisory board , gathered for a special meeting to decide sommer ’ s fate , had cast its vote , sommer announced he was stepping down .
political reaction the german finance ministry welcomed sommer ’ s decision , saying deutsche telekom would benefit from the move .
but the opposition was quick to pounce , decrying the government ’ s role in the affair and calling the development " catastrophic for the german economy . "
general secretary of the christian democrats , laurenz meyer , said while the federal budget had profited from deutsche telekom , the government had turned around and damaged the company through its interference .
the free democrats called the resignation a " disaster , " accusing the government of playing political football with telekom .
political scientists tended to agree , saying schröder did himself no favors with his maneuverings to oust sommer .

ron sommer announced on tuesday he is resigning from the top spot at deutsche telekom .
the ceo had lost the support of the government and many small shareholders as telekom ’ s debt ballooned and its share price plummeted . citing a breakdown in trust with the supervisory board and a desire to avoid further damage to the company , deutsche telekom ’ s ceo ron sommer announced his resignation on tuesday .
the move caps a week of intense speculation and rumours about the future of beleaguered telecoms boss .
" when a chief executive can not really on the full confidence of the supervisory board , resignation is the only responsible step left open , " sommer said at a press conference at deutsche telekom ’ s headquarters in bonn .
the supervisory board later announced it has named helmut sihler , a 72-year-old former board chair , as the company ’ s caretaker ceo for the next six months .
gerd tenzer , the german government ’ s favored candidate for the top job but seen by many analysts as colorless , will act as sihler ’ s deputy .
hans-dietrich winkhaus , chair of the supervisory board , said europe ’ s largest telecommunications company would now set itself on a radical course to reduce the 67 billion euro -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- debt on the telekom books .
on tuesday evening , telekom stocks were up 4.62 percent to 11.09 euro .
loss of critical support sommer ’ s future was anything but certain even in the hours leading up to his resignation , despite the pressure from many quarters over the last week for change at the top .
the israeli-born sommer , 53 , took over the telekom reigns in 1995 and presided over the company ’ s partial privatization in 1996 , convincing millions of stock-shy germans to buy shares in the company with his smooth sales pitch .
but those stocks proved a key element in his eventual downfall .
after the explosive telecoms boom of the late 1990 ’ s came the equally dramatic bust of 2001 , leaving the german giant saddled with debt and pushing its " t-shares " into the basement .
the shares lost 90 percent of their value in the last two years .
that development robbed the often-criticized sommer of one important pillar of support he had always counted on , that of german chancellor gerhard schröder .
the current social democratic government , which owns 43 percent of telekom , is facing an election in september and is behind in the polls .
it has been trying to woo the three million small telekom investors angry that the company ’ s stock has hit rock bottom .
a change at the top , the government ’ s thinking went , might change the ailing company ’ s fortunes and last week it went about looking for a replacement for sommer .
allies rallied around but sommer did not go easy .
the charismatic one-time mathematician had some powerful allies on his side .
henry m. paulson , head of the us bank goldman , sachs , wrote a letter to the chairman of telecom ’ s advisory board stating that sacking sommer would have " negative consequences " on its business .
last friday , more than 18,000 telekom employees put ads in newspapers across germany telling the government to keep out of telekom ’ s internal affairs .
on tuesday , 300 staff gathered in front of company headquarters in bonn , again demanding that the government stop meddling in their company ’ s business .
" most of us are behind sommer .
after all , there ’ s no suitable replacement , " frank klann , a telekom employee who also owns company stock , told reuters .
" of course i ’ m disappointed -lrb- about the share price -rrb- , but i also own other shares and let ’ s not pretend that they aren ’ t all dogs . "
but in the end , sommer ’ s renowned charisma and self-confidence could not beat a government plotting his overthrow .
even before the supervisory board , gathered for a special meeting to decide sommer ’ s fate , had cast its vote , sommer announced he was stepping down .
political reaction the german finance ministry welcomed sommer ’ s decision , saying deutsche telekom would benefit from the move .
but the opposition was quick to pounce , decrying the government ’ s role in the affair and calling the development " catastrophic for the german economy . "
general secretary of the christian democrats , laurenz meyer , said while the federal budget had profited from deutsche telekom , the government had turned around and damaged the company through its interference .
the free democrats called the resignation a " disaster , " accusing the government of playing political football with telekom .
political scientists tended to agree , saying schröder did himself no favors with his maneuverings to oust sommer .
frank decker , professor at the university of bonn , said schröder showed a lack of good political instinct in the matter .

today , düsseldorf is mostly known for its exclusive fashion boutiques along the famous königsallee .
but 25 years ago , punk ruled the streets of this western german city , as a new exhibit there shows . along with hamburg and berlin , düsseldorf was a center for the early punk and new wave scene in germany between 1977 and 1982 .
bands such as kfc , mittagspause , daf , zk or fehlfarben came from düsseldorf .
although these groups represented many different kinds of music , styles and attitudes , they had one thing in common : the urge to break out of the political and social molds of the late 1970s .
these bands wanted to oppose the sentimental images of hippies bent on improving the world .
a phenomenon of the times famous songs of the time included " verschwende deine jugend " -lrb- " waste your youth " -rrb- by daf or " zurück zum beton " -lrb- " back to concrete " -rrb- by s.y.p.h.
" zurück zum beton " is also the title of a new exhibit dealing with the early years of punk and new wave at the kunsthalle in düsseldorf .
the museum says a variety of original objects intend to show the multi-faceted aspects of the punk and new wave phenomenon .
the exhibit is divided into still and moving images .
one room is covered wall-to-wall with record covers , concert photos and posters .
cd players blast out sounds by the legendary bands to accompany the visuals .
another room shows non-stop slides and short documentary films .
the exhibit is rounded off by some hardware , including the drum set built out of junk used by the einstürzende neubauten .
the children 's keyboard " casio vl tone " – played by new wave gurus trio on their hit " da da da " – is displayed , as well .
the crossover of music and art technical developments in the late 1970s played a central role in punk .
new affordable copying and production methods , such as photocopiers , super 8 , polaroid , and the first video cameras , double cassette decks and home studios were the tools for a self-organized counter culture .
they marked the asthetics of the " brilliant dilettantes " , as the stars called themselves at the time .
this did not go unnoticed by the art scene , which crossed punk bands at clubs such as the ratinger hof in düsseldorf or so 36 in berlin .
artists played in bands , designed record covers , documented many punk concerts , and organized exhibitions with band performances .
" zurück zum beton " would n't have worked without the help of music journalist jürgen teipel .

today , düsseldorf is mostly known for its exclusive fashion boutiques along the famous königsallee .
but 25 years ago , punk ruled the streets of this western german city , as a new exhibit there shows . along with hamburg and berlin , düsseldorf was a center for the early punk and new wave scene in germany between 1977 and 1982 .
bands such as kfc , mittagspause , daf , zk or fehlfarben came from düsseldorf .
although these groups represented many different kinds of music , styles and attitudes , they had one thing in common : the urge to break out of the political and social molds of the late 1970s .
these bands wanted to oppose the sentimental images of hippies bent on improving the world .
a phenomenon of the times famous songs of the time included " verschwende deine jugend " -lrb- " waste your youth " -rrb- by daf or " zurück zum beton " -lrb- " back to concrete " -rrb- by s.y.p.h.
" zurück zum beton " is also the title of a new exhibit dealing with the early years of punk and new wave at the kunsthalle in düsseldorf .
the museum says a variety of original objects intend to show the multi-faceted aspects of the punk and new wave phenomenon .
the exhibit is divided into still and moving images .
one room is covered wall-to-wall with record covers , concert photos and posters .
cd players blast out sounds by the legendary bands to accompany the visuals .
another room shows non-stop slides and short documentary films .
the exhibit is rounded off by some hardware , including the drum set built out of junk used by the einstürzende neubauten .
the children 's keyboard " casio vl tone " – played by new wave gurus trio on their hit " da da da " – is displayed , as well .
the crossover of music and art technical developments in the late 1970s played a central role in punk .
new affordable copying and production methods , such as photocopiers , super 8 , polaroid , and the first video cameras , double cassette decks and home studios were the tools for a self-organized counter culture .
they marked the asthetics of the " brilliant dilettantes " , as the stars called themselves at the time .
this did not go unnoticed by the art scene , which crossed punk bands at clubs such as the ratinger hof in düsseldorf or so 36 in berlin .
artists played in bands , designed record covers , documented many punk concerts , and organized exhibitions with band performances .
" zurück zum beton " would n't have worked without the help of music journalist jürgen teipel .
over the past three years , teipel conversed with protagonists of the early punk and new wave generation , editing almost 1,000 hours ’ worth of interviews into a type of documentary novel , verschwende deine jugend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.07.2002 euro surges past greenback großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro hit parity with the u.s. dollar on monday , rising to an exchange rate of $ 1.0032 - its highest value since february 2000 .
after weeks of hovering around the us dollar , but always stopping short of reaching parity with it , europe ’ s common currency finally made the breakthrough .
on monday the euro soared almost a cent above the dollar . for the first time in two and a half years one euro can buy more than one us dollar .
it closed in on its monday peak of $ 1.0089 and edged back to $ 1.0032 by late afternoon .
the news is music to the ears of currency traders and a vindication for european politicians who are likely to feel that the much-mocked euro has finally come of age .
the euro parity with the dollar has also restored some credibility to the single european currency and the european central bank .
the high euro will help keep the price of imported goods low .
and it 's also good news for the beleaguered travel industry as trips outside the eurozone will become cheaper .
a boost after months of shakiness but the euro is still far below its launching price .
three years ago europe 's common currency was born at a value of one dollar and 18 cents .
in late 2000 europe ’ s floundering infant currency badly crashed to below $ 0.85 , sending shock waves around the continent .
it has been up and down - mostly down - ever since .
only since the beginning of this year did the euro begin its uphill climb , though always playing second fiddle to a strong us dollar .
dollar-driven euro rise ?
but despite the jubilation , most currency experts are still saying the return to parity has been primarily a dollar story and that it has all been fuelled by continuing concerns over us corporate earnings statements .
the large us current account deficit and alarm over us accounting practices have all led to falling investor confidence in the us economy .
several experts feel that for the us , the fall back through parity is the final sign that markets have lost faith in the strength of the us economy , which has been the motor of the world economy for the past decade .
" this is the final nail in the coffin of the new economy " , david bloom , currency strategist at hsbc in london told the financial times .
" the us has spent years telling the rest of the world how to run their economies and now markets are finally awakening to the problems of the us economy " .
everything is n't hunky-dory at the same time europe will begin worrying about the problems that a rising euro brings with it .
there is little doubt that the higher the euro goes , the more economic growth will suffer , mainly because it will be harder for european exporters to stay competitive outside the eurozone .
in germany for instance , which accounts for almost a third of eurozone economic output , gross domestic product grew only by 0.6 percent last year .
economist say the poor performance would have been even worse , if it wasn ’ t for the spurt in exports , which in turn owed much to the competitive edge provided by the euro ’ s weakness .
jürgen pfister of the commerzbank says " what unsettles us is the speed of the change .
there 's a danger that it will go up even more in the short term .
this will make businesses nervous .
they may cancel investment projects because they can no longer calculate if they can make any money on exporting their goods . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

ron sommer announced on tuesday he is resigning from the top spot at deutsche telekom .
the ceo had lost the support of the government and many small shareholders as telekom ’ s debt ballooned and its share price plummeted . citing a breakdown in trust with the supervisory board and a desire to avoid further damage to the company , deutsche telekom ’ s ceo ron sommer announced his resignation on tuesday .
the move caps a week of intense speculation and rumours about the future of beleaguered telecoms boss .
" when a chief executive can not really on the full confidence of the supervisory board , resignation is the only responsible step left open , " sommer said at a press conference at deutsche telekom ’ s headquarters in bonn .
the supervisory board later announced it has named helmut sihler , a 72-year-old former board chair , as the company ’ s caretaker ceo for the next six months .
gerd tenzer , the german government ’ s favored candidate for the top job but seen by many analysts as colorless , will act as sihler ’ s deputy .
hans-dietrich winkhaus , chair of the supervisory board , said europe ’ s largest telecommunications company would now set itself on a radical course to reduce the 67 billion euro -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- debt on the telekom books .
on tuesday evening , telekom stocks were up 4.62 percent to 11.09 euro .
loss of critical support sommer ’ s future was anything but certain even in the hours leading up to his resignation , despite the pressure from many quarters over the last week for change at the top .
the israeli-born sommer , 53 , took over the telekom reigns in 1995 and presided over the company ’ s partial privatization in 1996 , convincing millions of stock-shy germans to buy shares in the company with his smooth sales pitch .
but those stocks proved a key element in his eventual downfall .
after the explosive telecoms boom of the late 1990 ’ s came the equally dramatic bust of 2001 , leaving the german giant saddled with debt and pushing its " t-shares " into the basement .
the shares lost 90 percent of their value in the last two years .
that development robbed the often-criticized sommer of one important pillar of support he had always counted on , that of german chancellor gerhard schröder .
the current social democratic government , which owns 43 percent of telekom , is facing an election in september and is behind in the polls .
it has been trying to woo the three million small telekom investors angry that the company ’ s stock has hit rock bottom .
a change at the top , the government ’ s thinking went , might change the ailing company ’ s fortunes and last week it went about looking for a replacement for sommer .
allies rallied around but sommer did not go easy .
the charismatic one-time mathematician had some powerful allies on his side .
henry m. paulson , head of the us bank goldman , sachs , wrote a letter to the chairman of telecom ’ s advisory board stating that sacking sommer would have " negative consequences " on its business .
last friday , more than 18,000 telekom employees put ads in newspapers across germany telling the government to keep out of telekom ’ s internal affairs .
on tuesday , 300 staff gathered in front of company headquarters in bonn , again demanding that the government stop meddling in their company ’ s business .
" most of us are behind sommer .
after all , there ’ s no suitable replacement , " frank klann , a telekom employee who also owns company stock , told reuters .
" of course i ’ m disappointed -lrb- about the share price -rrb- , but i also own other shares and let ’ s not pretend that they aren ’ t all dogs . "
but in the end , sommer ’ s renowned charisma and self-confidence could not beat a government plotting his overthrow .
even before the supervisory board , gathered for a special meeting to decide sommer ’ s fate , had cast its vote , sommer announced he was stepping down .
political reaction the german finance ministry welcomed sommer ’ s decision , saying deutsche telekom would benefit from the move .
but the opposition was quick to pounce , decrying the government ’ s role in the affair and calling the development " catastrophic for the german economy . "
general secretary of the christian democrats , laurenz meyer , said while the federal budget had profited from deutsche telekom , the government had turned around and damaged the company through its interference .
the free democrats called the resignation a " disaster , " accusing the government of playing political football with telekom .
political scientists tended to agree , saying schröder did himself no favors with his maneuverings to oust sommer .
frank decker , professor at the university of bonn , said schröder showed a lack of good political instinct in the matter .
" he used populist measures that hadn ’ t been well thought out , just to ingratiate himself to small shareholders , " he told reuters .
the opposition will benefit from it , he added . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de closing in on deutsche telekom 's beleaguered boss this weekend , telekom 's board is reported to have found a replacement for telekom chief ron sommer .

and researchers report that the scheme is having a positive effect .
the research , conducted by the center for the advancement of health in washington dc , us , involved almost 300 people with sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy diets .
doctors want all of these people to do a little exercise - perhaps half an hour of walking a day - and eat more healthily .
it might work better because people would rather share their deepest thoughts with a computer than a real person professor sarah hampton , university of surrey however , instead of a real , human counsellor ringing them up for a chat , or inviting them to come to a clinic for a face-to-face session , they were instructed to ring a number linked to an automated answering service .
this computer-controlled system quizzes the patients about their habits , and they can reply by pressing a number on their phone .
at the end , the computer , having assessed their motivation , or lack of it , offered them a task or goal .
success rate despite the normal human aversion to talking to computers rather than real people , in this case the programme seems to have been popular .
after three months , more than a quarter of the participants had achieved the recommended levels of exercise - compared with fewer than one in five of a group given no contact with the computer .
the experiment relied on the patients choosing to ring in when they felt like it .
now it has been upgraded to make the computer ring the patient at set times to chase up their compliance with their exercise or diet scheme .
lead researcher bernardine pinto said : " like telephone counselling offered by human counsellors , we expected that the system would overcome problems with scheduling and attending face-to-face meetings .
" unlike human counsellors , the system would be accessible at any time and less likely to be perceived as judgemental . "
the patient 's doctors received regular monthly reports from the computer , detailing their progress .
hard work professor sarah hampton , an expert in health psychology from the university of surrey at guildford , uk , told bbc news online that the machine offered valuable support to the patients .
she said : " people do need ongoing support because it 's terribly hard to keep to an exercise regime .
" the nearest thing to it in this country is the smoking quitline .
" it might work better because people would rather share their deepest thoughts with a computer than a real person . "

lead researcher bernardine pinto said : " like telephone counselling offered by human counsellors , we expected that the system would overcome problems with scheduling and attending face-to-face meetings .
" unlike human counsellors , the system would be accessible at any time and less likely to be perceived as judgemental . "
the patient 's doctors received regular monthly reports from the computer , detailing their progress .
hard work professor sarah hampton , an expert in health psychology from the university of surrey at guildford , uk , told bbc news online that the machine offered valuable support to the patients .
she said : " people do need ongoing support because it 's terribly hard to keep to an exercise regime .
" the nearest thing to it in this country is the smoking quitline .
" it might work better because people would rather share their deepest thoughts with a computer than a real person . "
