on sunday austrians will vote for a new parliament .
jörg haider 's right-wing freedom party appears on the road to major losses , while the conservative people 's party and the social democrats are running neck and neck . austrian voters are going to the polls on sunday , nov .
24 , after chancellor wolfgang schüssel called for elections a year before the government 's official term ends .
now observers are speculating whether austria will return to a coalition of the two main parties that determined post-war politics there : the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spö -rrb- . the people 's party and the social democratic party ruled the country together for the 12 years before the surprising success of the right-wing populist freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- in the 1999 elections . although the social democrats garnered 33.2 percent of the votes in 1999 , the party was unable to find a coalition partner .
since then the övp and the fpö , each of which brought in 26.9 percent of austrians ' votes , have been ruling the country in an unstable coalition . an impossible governing situation chancellor schüssel -lrb- övp -rrb- did his best to avoid criticism of the antics of his coalition partner , the fpö . the recent visit of fpö founder jörg haider with saddam hussein and the party 's anti-foreigner and anti-semitic propaganda during the vienna election campaign - made going the course with the current government politically untenable . in september the crisis in the freedom party escalated .
at the fpö 's party congress in knittelfeld , the long-divided party broke into two wings : a more liberal wing supportive of then-fpö leader susanne riess-passer and the followers of party-leader haider .
four freedom party ministers , including riess-passer , resigned from their posts in the government . chancellor schüssel was forced to call for new elections . though he remains the de facto head of the fpö and the state governor of carinthia , haider does n't officially hold a position in the top echelons of the party .
he gave up the party chairmanship in march 2000 amid intense international criticism of his ultra-conservative views .
since october herbert haupt , a veterinarian and current minister for social security has been the party 's official leader . mobile voters now , six million austrian voters have to decide who will run the country .
due to the implosion in the fpö , the party is expected to loose at least every second voter .
pollsters predict that the people 's party and the social democrats will bring in nearly 40 percent of the ballots each .
the övp , in particular , is expected to benefit from voters ' loss of confidence in the freedom party , which may only bring in around 10 percent .
the green party too is pegged to receive around 10 percent of the vote . three coalition scenarios are possible .
firstly , he status quo - övp and fpö - could be confirmed - an unlikely scenario according to the austrian press . secondly , the people 's party and the social democrats could enter into another coalition .
the austrian media and political experts , however , say the two parties ' reign from 1987 to 1999 was characterized by political deadlock , horse trading and constitutional breaches - not the most appealing revival . thirdly , austria could end up with the second red-green coalition in europe between social democrats and greens .
