some 5,300 power workers at korea electric power corp -lrb- kepco -rrb- went on strike on 25 february to protest against the privatisation of the industry which could lead to massive job losses .
the government has said it will not back down on the plans , which have already been approved by parliament .
the strike has been declared illegal , with those taking part being warned they face strong action . "
it is pretty doubtful how long the power plants can be kept in operation without the workers " union spokesman on wednesday , kepco said it would sack all striking workers unless they returned to work by monday .
but unions dismissed the threat as " reckless judgement " saying it was a gamble that would not pay off .
" it is pretty doubtful how long the power plants can be kept in operation without the workers .
then , the government should take the responsibility , " said union spokesman lee byung-chul .
about 30 union leaders , including union chief lee ho-dong , have started an indefinite hunger strike at their refuge at myongdong cathedral in central seoul .
several of them shaved their heads .
limited impact kepco has turned to replacement workers and is training soldiers to relieve non-union workers who have kept electricity flowing .
so far , the impact of the strike has been limited because most power facilities are automated and being maintained by non-union workers .
non-union staff make up a third of the total 8,400-strong workforce at the affected 31 power stations .
the planned asset sale is a key policy aim for president kim dae-jung 's government in a presidential election year .

environmental objections have centred on the damage it could do to the gwent levels , which is an important wetland wildlife habitat .
and the project would also be relatively expensive , costing an estimated £ 300m to £ 400m .

work on the £ 60m project could start within five years .
in february , the uk government announced that it is spending £ 22m on roads around deeside in north wales to cut congestion , delays and accidents .
the money will be spent on improving links between deeside industrial park and the m56 over the border in england .

the conclusions are drawn from data gathered from 608 women treated for early breast cancer in glasgow between october 1995 and march 2001 .
we found a poorer outcome for women with breast cancer from deprived backgrounds catherine sharp catherine sharp , a senior house officer at southern general hospital in glasgow , who carried out the study , found that women from deprived backgrounds were significantly more likely to have higher grade three tumours .
she also identified a trend for them to have oestrogen-receptor -lrb- er -rrb- negative tumours , which are not fed by the oestrogen hormone .
these are more difficult to treat and do not respond to anti-oestrogen drugs such as tamoxifen .
they also had cancer that spread to the lymph vessels .
mystery cause miss sharp said she did not know why these women had such aggressive tumours - those that grow very rapidly - but it could be due to lifestyle factors , although further research would need to be completed to establish any recurring patterns .
she said : " we found a poorer outcome for women with breast cancer from deprived backgrounds , which means they may die or have recurrence sooner .
" treatment for affluent and deprived patients seems to be the same , from studies done in glasgow , however , these women may have a poorer response to the treatments due to lifestyle-related issues . "
these lifestyle issues could be a poor diet or the prevalence of smoking , miss sharp suggests .
breast tumours are graded from one to three .
grade three tumours are more difficult to treat than grade one type .
miss sharp said : " the higher incidence of cancer which had spread to the lymph vessels in these deprived patients reflects the higher incidence of grade three tumours as they are more aggressive and therefore more likely to spread . "
wider studies of patients , at all stages of breast cancer , show women from deprived backgrounds usually have larger tumours when they first present themselves to their gp .
leaving it late it is not clear why this is the case , but miss sharp said it could be that they go to their doctor later than those from affluent and intermediate backgrounds .
however , it could be that they tend to have tumours which grow more rapidly .
of the 608 women studied , 135 were classified as affluent , 293 intermediate and 180 deprived .
the study found 11.1 % of affluent women , 15.4 % of intermediate and 21.7 % of deprived women had grade three tumours .

the phone operator revealed a 10.2bn euro -lrb- £ 6.3bn ; £ 9bn -rrb- write-down to cover the slump in value of stakes in cable group ntl and german mobile operator mobilcom .
the firm , which owns mobile phone operator orange , has debts of about 65bn euros .
it has pledged to reduce its net debt to between 37bn and 47bn euros by the end of 2003 through the sale of some non-core assets .
orange profits soar excluding the write down , france telecom made a net profit of 1.9bn euros , with operating profit at 5.2bn euros , up from 4.86bn in 2000 , largely driven by its orange business .
orange posted an 86 % rise in core earnings on thursday , with underlying pre-tax profit up 386m euros .
on wednesday , it was reported that france telecom was planning to sell its 26.6 % stake in wind - its joint venture with italian utilities group enel - as part of efforts to trim debts .
both companies declined to comment on the reports .
it was also reported that france telecom 's german partner in mobilcom was attempting to exercise a so-called " put " option which it said allowed it to force the french firm to buy it out .
the report followed a public dispute between the two sides over capital investment and sale of shares in the company .
