in the wake of a published report that germany 's defense minister , rudolf scharping , accepted payments from a public relations executive , the chancellor has called for his resignation . german chancellor gerhard schröder has sacked his defense minister rudolf scharping .
schröder announced that the social democrats parliamentary party leader , peter struck , would replace him .
this was after an emergency meeting that chancellor gerhard schröder called on thursday afternoon .
scharping had become the subject of allegations concerning his dealings with a public relations consultant , who also has clients in the arms industry .
it has been alleged the relationship may have involved a conflict of interest .
reports in the media revealed that scharping had received 71,600 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- from moritz hunzinger , a public relations consultant in frankfurt , for lectures and book rights just before he became defense minister .
scharping , however , denied any wrongdoing , saying the fees were from the time before he was defense minister , although the money entered his bank account after his posting .
" arbitrary assertions in the media are no reason for a resignation , " scharping told reuters .
" all payments were reported to the tax authorities and taxed .
large parts of the claims against me are false and deliberately defamatory . "
the final straw but this scandal turned out to be the proverbial straw that broke the camel ’ s back .
scharping , 54 , had been dogged by several high-profile scandals over the past year .
his troubles really began with a photo spread he allowed a magazine to print of him frolicking in a swimming pool in spain with his new fiancée , just as german troops were preparing for a dangerous mission in macedonia .
" randy rudi , " as he was dubbed , was ridiculed for " making love , not war " and the headlines were full of derision for the hapless minister .
but when it was revealed that he had also used a military plane for quick visits to his fiancée , the scandal took on a more serious tone .
scharping was called before a special parliamentary committee to answer for the flights and his future in office appeared to be in jeopardy .
but the next day two jets plowed into the world trade center and the political landscape changed .
the reprieve didn ’ t last long , however , and by the end of the year the minister was back in the headlines when he made statements interpreted as predicting a us attack on somalia .
at that point , the message coming out of his own party was : " one more mistake , and he ’ s out . "
in february , the chairman of the german armed forces association , bernhard gertz , said scharping had become a " joke figure " with declining authority that was " fatal for the armed forces . "
those sentiments were thought to be shared by many of the nation ’ s soldiers .
add to that a new scandal with allegations of conflict of interest , using public office for personal gain , and spending 28,000 euro -lrb- $ 28,170 -rrb- on luxury clothes , and rudolph scharping had become too big of a liability for chancellor schröder , who has an election in two months and flagging poll numbers to worry about .
" the necessary preconditions for working together are no longer given , " schröder said in an impromptu news conference on thursday afternoon .
defiant to the end refusing to be put off by the mounting allegations , scharping had stuck to his schedule on thursday morning , visiting a military installation in the state of lower saxony .
while scharping watched the presentation , the allegations raised against him in berlin were turning into a full-blown scandal .
the allegations surround payments scharping received from public relations executive moritz hunzinger .
half of the 72,000 euro was the rights to his unpublished memoirs , and the other half was reportedly for lectures he held before being appointed as germany 's defense minister .
scharping confirmed that he had received payments in the past , but said all were taxed and proceeds used mostly more charitable activities .
he denied that he had been the recipient of reward for contacts with the defense ministry .
" i have done everything in line with the law , " scharping said .
" therefore i don ’ t see any grounds to resign . "
as allegations flew , hunzinger defended scharping .
" he is a very noble individual who is in no way at fault , particularly not on this point , " he said .
but in the end , the government decided scharping had to go and schröder tapped social democratic parliamentary floor leader peter struck to step in as defense minister , never before in germany has there been a change in a ministerial post been so close to an election .
german voters go the polls on september 22 .
damage to the party the scharping case is just one more bit of bad news for schröder , who has watched his already floundering social democratic party dogged down further with corruption scandals involving undeclared party donations .
the opposition is hoping to make political hay of the sacking .
edmund stoiber , the conservative union block ’ s candidate for chancellor said scharping ’ s dismissal was " long overdue " and would be a relief for germany ’ s troops .
guido westerwelle , head of the free democrats , described the current governing coalition as " staggering to the elections like a pummeled boxer just before the final knockout .

in the wake of a published report that germany 's defense minister , rudolf scharping , accepted payments from a public relations executive , the chancellor has called for his resignation . german chancellor gerhard schröder has sacked his defense minister rudolf scharping .
schröder announced that the social democrats parliamentary party leader , peter struck , would replace him .
this was after an emergency meeting that chancellor gerhard schröder called on thursday afternoon .
scharping had become the subject of allegations concerning his dealings with a public relations consultant , who also has clients in the arms industry .
it has been alleged the relationship may have involved a conflict of interest .
reports in the media revealed that scharping had received 71,600 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- from moritz hunzinger , a public relations consultant in frankfurt , for lectures and book rights just before he became defense minister .
scharping , however , denied any wrongdoing , saying the fees were from the time before he was defense minister , although the money entered his bank account after his posting .
" arbitrary assertions in the media are no reason for a resignation , " scharping told reuters .
" all payments were reported to the tax authorities and taxed .
large parts of the claims against me are false and deliberately defamatory . "
the final straw but this scandal turned out to be the proverbial straw that broke the camel ’ s back .
scharping , 54 , had been dogged by several high-profile scandals over the past year .
his troubles really began with a photo spread he allowed a magazine to print of him frolicking in a swimming pool in spain with his new fiancée , just as german troops were preparing for a dangerous mission in macedonia .
" randy rudi , " as he was dubbed , was ridiculed for " making love , not war " and the headlines were full of derision for the hapless minister .
but when it was revealed that he had also used a military plane for quick visits to his fiancée , the scandal took on a more serious tone .
scharping was called before a special parliamentary committee to answer for the flights and his future in office appeared to be in jeopardy .
but the next day two jets plowed into the world trade center and the political landscape changed .
the reprieve didn ’ t last long , however , and by the end of the year the minister was back in the headlines when he made statements interpreted as predicting a us attack on somalia .
at that point , the message coming out of his own party was : " one more mistake , and he ’ s out . "
in february , the chairman of the german armed forces association , bernhard gertz , said scharping had become a " joke figure " with declining authority that was " fatal for the armed forces . "
those sentiments were thought to be shared by many of the nation ’ s soldiers .
add to that a new scandal with allegations of conflict of interest , using public office for personal gain , and spending 28,000 euro -lrb- $ 28,170 -rrb- on luxury clothes , and rudolph scharping had become too big of a liability for chancellor schröder , who has an election in two months and flagging poll numbers to worry about .
" the necessary preconditions for working together are no longer given , " schröder said in an impromptu news conference on thursday afternoon .
defiant to the end refusing to be put off by the mounting allegations , scharping had stuck to his schedule on thursday morning , visiting a military installation in the state of lower saxony .
while scharping watched the presentation , the allegations raised against him in berlin were turning into a full-blown scandal .
the allegations surround payments scharping received from public relations executive moritz hunzinger .
half of the 72,000 euro was the rights to his unpublished memoirs , and the other half was reportedly for lectures he held before being appointed as germany 's defense minister .
scharping confirmed that he had received payments in the past , but said all were taxed and proceeds used mostly more charitable activities .
he denied that he had been the recipient of reward for contacts with the defense ministry .
" i have done everything in line with the law , " scharping said .
" therefore i don ’ t see any grounds to resign . "
as allegations flew , hunzinger defended scharping .
" he is a very noble individual who is in no way at fault , particularly not on this point , " he said .
but in the end , the government decided scharping had to go and schröder tapped social democratic parliamentary floor leader peter struck to step in as defense minister , never before in germany has there been a change in a ministerial post been so close to an election .

in the wake of a published report that germany 's defense minister , rudolf scharping , accepted payments from a public relations executive , the chancellor has called for his resignation . german chancellor gerhard schröder has sacked his defense minister rudolf scharping .
schröder announced that the social democrats parliamentary party leader , peter struck , would replace him .
this was after an emergency meeting that chancellor gerhard schröder called on thursday afternoon .
scharping had become the subject of allegations concerning his dealings with a public relations consultant , who also has clients in the arms industry .
it has been alleged the relationship may have involved a conflict of interest .
reports in the media revealed that scharping had received 71,600 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- from moritz hunzinger , a public relations consultant in frankfurt , for lectures and book rights just before he became defense minister .
scharping , however , denied any wrongdoing , saying the fees were from the time before he was defense minister , although the money entered his bank account after his posting .
" arbitrary assertions in the media are no reason for a resignation , " scharping told reuters .
" all payments were reported to the tax authorities and taxed .
large parts of the claims against me are false and deliberately defamatory . "
the final straw but this scandal turned out to be the proverbial straw that broke the camel ’ s back .
scharping , 54 , had been dogged by several high-profile scandals over the past year .
his troubles really began with a photo spread he allowed a magazine to print of him frolicking in a swimming pool in spain with his new fiancée , just as german troops were preparing for a dangerous mission in macedonia .
" randy rudi , " as he was dubbed , was ridiculed for " making love , not war " and the headlines were full of derision for the hapless minister .
but when it was revealed that he had also used a military plane for quick visits to his fiancée , the scandal took on a more serious tone .
scharping was called before a special parliamentary committee to answer for the flights and his future in office appeared to be in jeopardy .
but the next day two jets plowed into the world trade center and the political landscape changed .
the reprieve didn ’ t last long , however , and by the end of the year the minister was back in the headlines when he made statements interpreted as predicting a us attack on somalia .
at that point , the message coming out of his own party was : " one more mistake , and he ’ s out . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.07.2002 the bad news keeps coming for schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's put an exasperating week behind him , but the biggest fight is yet to come for gerhard schröder .
with the eighth replacement of a cabinet minister in four years and criticism over deutsche telekom 's ceo 's ouster , chancellor gerhard schröder is entering the final stretch of the election more besieged than ever . one thing german chancellor gerhard schröder probably was n't bargaining for was a winter of discontent in the middle of the summer .
but that 's exactly what happened this week with the stormy resignation of deutsche telekom chief ron sommer and schröder ’ s sacking of defense minister rudolf scharping .
both were sacrificed for their bad judgement – but , more to the point – for jeopardizing schröder 's hopes of reelection on september 22 .
schröder has plenty to worry about – unemployment continues to rise , the ecomomy is still stagnating and his election campaign is flagging .
slipping out of favor according to the weekly emnid public opinion poll , voters still prefer schröder over his challenger , bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the christian social union .
but during the past month , schröder ’ s support slipped from 54 percent to 47 percent as one bad headline after another emerged .
unfortunate for schröder is that germany ’ s chancellor is elected by the parliament and not directly by the people .
in that regard , schröder 's prospects look far less promising .
according to emnid , the opposition union bloc - which is comprised of the csu and the christian democratic union - is set to win 41 percent of the vote , with schröder ’ s social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- clearing 35 percent .
the poll 's numbers also show that the union bloc , with its likely coalition partner the free democrats , would together win 50 percent of the vote – enough to build a government .
the figures are far less rosy for the current spd and alliance ' 90 / the greens government , who would together garner just 41 percent of the votes . even if schröder tried to string together a coalition with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - a step the social democrats have said they would not take with the successor party to east germany 's communists - he would still fall four points shy of a majority in parliament based on sunday 's poll .
damage control aware that any further scandal or economic development could end his reelection effort , schröder quickly fired scharping last week .
the move hardly came as a surprise - it was only one in a long string of scandals the minister had been involved in .
more schocking was that it was the eighth minister schröder has sacked during his nearly four years in office .
last summer , photos were published of scharping splashing about in a pool , carefree , as german soldiers risked their lives on a dangerous and politically sensitive mission in the balkans .
he also used german military jets to shuttle between berlin and majorca , spain , where he bronzes his skin in the summer with girlfriend countess kristina pilati .
then , this summer , members of parliament accused him of signing on to a deal with the european union for the purchase of airbus military cargo planes for the bundeswehr that had only been given partial blessing .
the last straw came last week with the publication of an article in the weekly magazine " stern " revealing that scharping had received 71,600 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- from moritz hunzinger , a public relations consultant in frankfurt , for lectures and book rights just before he became defense minister .
enough was enough , the chancellor decided , and scharping was let go .
the decision enjoyed wide public support .
" two-thirds of germans didn ’ t feel that scharping should continue to be in the cabinet after september 22 , " said manfred güllner , chief pollster for the forsa institute .
" he was really the most disliked minister , and even spd supporters said with a clear majority , ‘ scharping is no longer acceptable as a minister . ’ "
a magnet for bad economic news meanwhile , schröder ’ s favorite role of the shining frontman of german industry seems like a distant memory this week , as does his image as rescuer of threatened corporations like the frankfurt-based construction giant holtzmann .
worse yet , schröder ’ s party is also embroiled in corruption and campaign finance scandals and is the subject of criticism each time a new round of negative business reports emerge – from the insolvencies of important companies like engineering giant babcock borsig to the perpetually climbing unemployment figures , which is unusual for summer , when season factors typically lead to decreases in the rate .
additionally , key market indices and blue chip stocks are falling and little is to be seen of the promised economic upswing in germany .
" schröder ’ s economic competency has certainly suffered in recent weeks and months , " said güllner .
critics : telekom firing " hectic and unnecessary " but the most damaging incident for schröder ’ s election chances appeared to be his instigating sommer ’ s ouster at deutsche telekom .
critics described his backstage role as hectic and unnecessary .
just six months earlier , schröder loved to be seen publicly with the savvy and smart sommer , who came to represent the new economy in germany .
but last week , he let sommer fall , hastily , without offering a convincing alternative to replace him as telekom ’ s chief executive .
combined , the events came as a huge blow to schröder ’ s reelection chances , especially coming less than two months before election day , with the spd at least three points behind the opposition union bloc in most public opinion polls .
" it has become highly unlikely the spd and green coalition government will be able to attain the votes they got in 1998 , " güllner forecasted .
" it ’ s not unthinkable , but it ’ s highly unlikely .
but it ’ s still plausible that the spd could come in ahead of the union . "
but that can only happen if schröder is able to win over more voters in the final stretch of the election .

with the eighth replacement of a cabinet minister in four years and criticism over deutsche telekom 's ceo 's ouster , chancellor gerhard schröder is entering the final stretch of the election more besieged than ever . one thing german chancellor gerhard schröder probably was n't bargaining for was a winter of discontent in the middle of the summer .
but that 's exactly what happened this week with the stormy resignation of deutsche telekom chief ron sommer and schröder ’ s sacking of defense minister rudolf scharping .
both were sacrificed for their bad judgement – but , more to the point – for jeopardizing schröder 's hopes of reelection on september 22 .
schröder has plenty to worry about – unemployment continues to rise , the ecomomy is still stagnating and his election campaign is flagging .
slipping out of favor according to the weekly emnid public opinion poll , voters still prefer schröder over his challenger , bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the christian social union .
but during the past month , schröder ’ s support slipped from 54 percent to 47 percent as one bad headline after another emerged .
unfortunate for schröder is that germany ’ s chancellor is elected by the parliament and not directly by the people .
in that regard , schröder 's prospects look far less promising .
according to emnid , the opposition union bloc - which is comprised of the csu and the christian democratic union - is set to win 41 percent of the vote , with schröder ’ s social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- clearing 35 percent .
the poll 's numbers also show that the union bloc , with its likely coalition partner the free democrats , would together win 50 percent of the vote – enough to build a government .
the figures are far less rosy for the current spd and alliance ' 90 / the greens government , who would together garner just 41 percent of the votes . even if schröder tried to string together a coalition with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - a step the social democrats have said they would not take with the successor party to east germany 's communists - he would still fall four points shy of a majority in parliament based on sunday 's poll .
damage control aware that any further scandal or economic development could end his reelection effort , schröder quickly fired scharping last week .
the move hardly came as a surprise - it was only one in a long string of scandals the minister had been involved in .
more schocking was that it was the eighth minister schröder has sacked during his nearly four years in office .
last summer , photos were published of scharping splashing about in a pool , carefree , as german soldiers risked their lives on a dangerous and politically sensitive mission in the balkans .
he also used german military jets to shuttle between berlin and majorca , spain , where he bronzes his skin in the summer with girlfriend countess kristina pilati .
then , this summer , members of parliament accused him of signing on to a deal with the european union for the purchase of airbus military cargo planes for the bundeswehr that had only been given partial blessing .
the last straw came last week with the publication of an article in the weekly magazine " stern " revealing that scharping had received 71,600 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- from moritz hunzinger , a public relations consultant in frankfurt , for lectures and book rights just before he became defense minister .
enough was enough , the chancellor decided , and scharping was let go .
the decision enjoyed wide public support .
" two-thirds of germans didn ’ t feel that scharping should continue to be in the cabinet after september 22 , " said manfred güllner , chief pollster for the forsa institute .
" he was really the most disliked minister , and even spd supporters said with a clear majority , ‘ scharping is no longer acceptable as a minister . ’ "
a magnet for bad economic news meanwhile , schröder ’ s favorite role of the shining frontman of german industry seems like a distant memory this week , as does his image as rescuer of threatened corporations like the frankfurt-based construction giant holtzmann .
worse yet , schröder ’ s party is also embroiled in corruption and campaign finance scandals and is the subject of criticism each time a new round of negative business reports emerge – from the insolvencies of important companies like engineering giant babcock borsig to the perpetually climbing unemployment figures , which is unusual for summer , when season factors typically lead to decreases in the rate .
additionally , key market indices and blue chip stocks are falling and little is to be seen of the promised economic upswing in germany .
" schröder ’ s economic competency has certainly suffered in recent weeks and months , " said güllner .
critics : telekom firing " hectic and unnecessary " but the most damaging incident for schröder ’ s election chances appeared to be his instigating sommer ’ s ouster at deutsche telekom .
critics described his backstage role as hectic and unnecessary .
just six months earlier , schröder loved to be seen publicly with the savvy and smart sommer , who came to represent the new economy in germany .
but last week , he let sommer fall , hastily , without offering a convincing alternative to replace him as telekom ’ s chief executive .
combined , the events came as a huge blow to schröder ’ s reelection chances , especially coming less than two months before election day , with the spd at least three points behind the opposition union bloc in most public opinion polls .
" it has become highly unlikely the spd and green coalition government will be able to attain the votes they got in 1998 , " güllner forecasted .
" it ’ s not unthinkable , but it ’ s highly unlikely .
but it ’ s still plausible that the spd could come in ahead of the union . "
but that can only happen if schröder is able to win over more voters in the final stretch of the election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.07.2002 schröder sacks defense minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf scharping found himself at the center of one scandal too many .
in the wake of a published report that germany 's defense minister , rudolf scharping , accepted payments from a public relations executive , the chancellor has called for his resignation . german chancellor gerhard schröder has sacked his defense minister rudolf scharping .
schröder announced that the social democrats parliamentary party leader , peter struck , would replace him .
this was after an emergency meeting that chancellor gerhard schröder called on thursday afternoon .
scharping had become the subject of allegations concerning his dealings with a public relations consultant , who also has clients in the arms industry .
it has been alleged the relationship may have involved a conflict of interest .
reports in the media revealed that scharping had received 71,600 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- from moritz hunzinger , a public relations consultant in frankfurt , for lectures and book rights just before he became defense minister .
scharping , however , denied any wrongdoing , saying the fees were from the time before he was defense minister , although the money entered his bank account after his posting .
" arbitrary assertions in the media are no reason for a resignation , " scharping told reuters .
" all payments were reported to the tax authorities and taxed .
large parts of the claims against me are false and deliberately defamatory . "
the final straw but this scandal turned out to be the proverbial straw that broke the camel ’ s back .
scharping , 54 , had been dogged by several high-profile scandals over the past year .
his troubles really began with a photo spread he allowed a magazine to print of him frolicking in a swimming pool in spain with his new fiancée , just as german troops were preparing for a dangerous mission in macedonia .
" randy rudi , " as he was dubbed , was ridiculed for " making love , not war " and the headlines were full of derision for the hapless minister .
but when it was revealed that he had also used a military plane for quick visits to his fiancée , the scandal took on a more serious tone .
scharping was called before a special parliamentary committee to answer for the flights and his future in office appeared to be in jeopardy .
but the next day two jets plowed into the world trade center and the political landscape changed .
the reprieve didn ’ t last long , however , and by the end of the year the minister was back in the headlines when he made statements interpreted as predicting a us attack on somalia .
at that point , the message coming out of his own party was : " one more mistake , and he ’ s out . "
in february , the chairman of the german armed forces association , bernhard gertz , said scharping had become a " joke figure " with declining authority that was " fatal for the armed forces . "
those sentiments were thought to be shared by many of the nation ’ s soldiers .
add to that a new scandal with allegations of conflict of interest , using public office for personal gain , and spending 28,000 euro -lrb- $ 28,170 -rrb- on luxury clothes , and rudolph scharping had become too big of a liability for chancellor schröder , who has an election in two months and flagging poll numbers to worry about .
" the necessary preconditions for working together are no longer given , " schröder said in an impromptu news conference on thursday afternoon .
defiant to the end refusing to be put off by the mounting allegations , scharping had stuck to his schedule on thursday morning , visiting a military installation in the state of lower saxony .
while scharping watched the presentation , the allegations raised against him in berlin were turning into a full-blown scandal .
the allegations surround payments scharping received from public relations executive moritz hunzinger .
half of the 72,000 euro was the rights to his unpublished memoirs , and the other half was reportedly for lectures he held before being appointed as germany 's defense minister .
scharping confirmed that he had received payments in the past , but said all were taxed and proceeds used mostly more charitable activities .
he denied that he had been the recipient of reward for contacts with the defense ministry .
" i have done everything in line with the law , " scharping said .
" therefore i don ’ t see any grounds to resign . "
as allegations flew , hunzinger defended scharping .
" he is a very noble individual who is in no way at fault , particularly not on this point , " he said .
but in the end , the government decided scharping had to go and schröder tapped social democratic parliamentary floor leader peter struck to step in as defense minister , never before in germany has there been a change in a ministerial post been so close to an election .
german voters go the polls on september 22 .
damage to the party the scharping case is just one more bit of bad news for schröder , who has watched his already floundering social democratic party dogged down further with corruption scandals involving undeclared party donations .
the opposition is hoping to make political hay of the sacking .
edmund stoiber , the conservative union block ’ s candidate for chancellor said scharping ’ s dismissal was " long overdue " and would be a relief for germany ’ s troops .
guido westerwelle , head of the free democrats , described the current governing coalition as " staggering to the elections like a pummeled boxer just before the final knockout .

in the wake of a published report that germany 's defense minister , rudolf scharping , accepted payments from a public relations executive , the chancellor has called for his resignation . german chancellor gerhard schröder has sacked his defense minister rudolf scharping .
schröder announced that the social democrats parliamentary party leader , peter struck , would replace him .
this was after an emergency meeting that chancellor gerhard schröder called on thursday afternoon .
scharping had become the subject of allegations concerning his dealings with a public relations consultant , who also has clients in the arms industry .
it has been alleged the relationship may have involved a conflict of interest .
reports in the media revealed that scharping had received 71,600 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- from moritz hunzinger , a public relations consultant in frankfurt , for lectures and book rights just before he became defense minister .
scharping , however , denied any wrongdoing , saying the fees were from the time before he was defense minister , although the money entered his bank account after his posting .
" arbitrary assertions in the media are no reason for a resignation , " scharping told reuters .
" all payments were reported to the tax authorities and taxed .
large parts of the claims against me are false and deliberately defamatory . "
the final straw but this scandal turned out to be the proverbial straw that broke the camel ’ s back .
scharping , 54 , had been dogged by several high-profile scandals over the past year .
his troubles really began with a photo spread he allowed a magazine to print of him frolicking in a swimming pool in spain with his new fiancée , just as german troops were preparing for a dangerous mission in macedonia .
" randy rudi , " as he was dubbed , was ridiculed for " making love , not war " and the headlines were full of derision for the hapless minister .
but when it was revealed that he had also used a military plane for quick visits to his fiancée , the scandal took on a more serious tone .
scharping was called before a special parliamentary committee to answer for the flights and his future in office appeared to be in jeopardy .
but the next day two jets plowed into the world trade center and the political landscape changed .
the reprieve didn ’ t last long , however , and by the end of the year the minister was back in the headlines when he made statements interpreted as predicting a us attack on somalia .

reports in the media revealed that scharping had received 71,600 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- from moritz hunzinger , a public relations consultant in frankfurt , for lectures and book rights just before he became defense minister .
scharping , however , denied any wrongdoing , saying the fees were from the time before he was defense minister , although the money entered his bank account after his posting .
" arbitrary assertions in the media are no reason for a resignation , " scharping told reuters .
" all payments were reported to the tax authorities and taxed .
large parts of the claims against me are false and deliberately defamatory . "
the final straw but this scandal turned out to be the proverbial straw that broke the camel ’ s back .
scharping , 54 , had been dogged by several high-profile scandals over the past year .
his troubles really began with a photo spread he allowed a magazine to print of him frolicking in a swimming pool in spain with his new fiancée , just as german troops were preparing for a dangerous mission in macedonia .
" randy rudi , " as he was dubbed , was ridiculed for " making love , not war " and the headlines were full of derision for the hapless minister .
but when it was revealed that he had also used a military plane for quick visits to his fiancée , the scandal took on a more serious tone .
scharping was called before a special parliamentary committee to answer for the flights and his future in office appeared to be in jeopardy .
but the next day two jets plowed into the world trade center and the political landscape changed .
the reprieve didn ’ t last long , however , and by the end of the year the minister was back in the headlines when he made statements interpreted as predicting a us attack on somalia .
at that point , the message coming out of his own party was : " one more mistake , and he ’ s out . "
in february , the chairman of the german armed forces association , bernhard gertz , said scharping had become a " joke figure " with declining authority that was " fatal for the armed forces . "
those sentiments were thought to be shared by many of the nation ’ s soldiers .
add to that a new scandal with allegations of conflict of interest , using public office for personal gain , and spending 28,000 euro -lrb- $ 28,170 -rrb- on luxury clothes , and rudolph scharping had become too big of a liability for chancellor schröder , who has an election in two months and flagging poll numbers to worry about .
" the necessary preconditions for working together are no longer given , " schröder said in an impromptu news conference on thursday afternoon .
defiant to the end refusing to be put off by the mounting allegations , scharping had stuck to his schedule on thursday morning , visiting a military installation in the state of lower saxony .
while scharping watched the presentation , the allegations raised against him in berlin were turning into a full-blown scandal .
the allegations surround payments scharping received from public relations executive moritz hunzinger .
half of the 72,000 euro was the rights to his unpublished memoirs , and the other half was reportedly for lectures he held before being appointed as germany 's defense minister .
scharping confirmed that he had received payments in the past , but said all were taxed and proceeds used mostly more charitable activities .
he denied that he had been the recipient of reward for contacts with the defense ministry .
" i have done everything in line with the law , " scharping said .
" therefore i don ’ t see any grounds to resign . "
as allegations flew , hunzinger defended scharping .
" he is a very noble individual who is in no way at fault , particularly not on this point , " he said .
but in the end , the government decided scharping had to go and schröder tapped social democratic parliamentary floor leader peter struck to step in as defense minister , never before in germany has there been a change in a ministerial post been so close to an election .
german voters go the polls on september 22 .
damage to the party the scharping case is just one more bit of bad news for schröder , who has watched his already floundering social democratic party dogged down further with corruption scandals involving undeclared party donations .
the opposition is hoping to make political hay of the sacking .
edmund stoiber , the conservative union block ’ s candidate for chancellor said scharping ’ s dismissal was " long overdue " and would be a relief for germany ’ s troops .

in the wake of a published report that germany 's defense minister , rudolf scharping , accepted payments from a public relations executive , the chancellor has called for his resignation . german chancellor gerhard schröder has sacked his defense minister rudolf scharping .
schröder announced that the social democrats parliamentary party leader , peter struck , would replace him .
this was after an emergency meeting that chancellor gerhard schröder called on thursday afternoon .
scharping had become the subject of allegations concerning his dealings with a public relations consultant , who also has clients in the arms industry .
it has been alleged the relationship may have involved a conflict of interest .
reports in the media revealed that scharping had received 71,600 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- from moritz hunzinger , a public relations consultant in frankfurt , for lectures and book rights just before he became defense minister .
scharping , however , denied any wrongdoing , saying the fees were from the time before he was defense minister , although the money entered his bank account after his posting .
" arbitrary assertions in the media are no reason for a resignation , " scharping told reuters .
" all payments were reported to the tax authorities and taxed .
large parts of the claims against me are false and deliberately defamatory . "
the final straw but this scandal turned out to be the proverbial straw that broke the camel ’ s back .
scharping , 54 , had been dogged by several high-profile scandals over the past year .
his troubles really began with a photo spread he allowed a magazine to print of him frolicking in a swimming pool in spain with his new fiancée , just as german troops were preparing for a dangerous mission in macedonia .
" randy rudi , " as he was dubbed , was ridiculed for " making love , not war " and the headlines were full of derision for the hapless minister .
but when it was revealed that he had also used a military plane for quick visits to his fiancée , the scandal took on a more serious tone .
scharping was called before a special parliamentary committee to answer for the flights and his future in office appeared to be in jeopardy .
but the next day two jets plowed into the world trade center and the political landscape changed .
the reprieve didn ’ t last long , however , and by the end of the year the minister was back in the headlines when he made statements interpreted as predicting a us attack on somalia .
at that point , the message coming out of his own party was : " one more mistake , and he ’ s out . "
in february , the chairman of the german armed forces association , bernhard gertz , said scharping had become a " joke figure " with declining authority that was " fatal for the armed forces . "
those sentiments were thought to be shared by many of the nation ’ s soldiers .
add to that a new scandal with allegations of conflict of interest , using public office for personal gain , and spending 28,000 euro -lrb- $ 28,170 -rrb- on luxury clothes , and rudolph scharping had become too big of a liability for chancellor schröder , who has an election in two months and flagging poll numbers to worry about .
" the necessary preconditions for working together are no longer given , " schröder said in an impromptu news conference on thursday afternoon .
defiant to the end refusing to be put off by the mounting allegations , scharping had stuck to his schedule on thursday morning , visiting a military installation in the state of lower saxony .
while scharping watched the presentation , the allegations raised against him in berlin were turning into a full-blown scandal .
the allegations surround payments scharping received from public relations executive moritz hunzinger .
half of the 72,000 euro was the rights to his unpublished memoirs , and the other half was reportedly for lectures he held before being appointed as germany 's defense minister .
scharping confirmed that he had received payments in the past , but said all were taxed and proceeds used mostly more charitable activities .
he denied that he had been the recipient of reward for contacts with the defense ministry .
" i have done everything in line with the law , " scharping said .
" therefore i don ’ t see any grounds to resign . "
as allegations flew , hunzinger defended scharping .
" he is a very noble individual who is in no way at fault , particularly not on this point , " he said .
but in the end , the government decided scharping had to go and schröder tapped social democratic parliamentary floor leader peter struck to step in as defense minister , never before in germany has there been a change in a ministerial post been so close to an election .
german voters go the polls on september 22 .
damage to the party the scharping case is just one more bit of bad news for schröder , who has watched his already floundering social democratic party dogged down further with corruption scandals involving undeclared party donations .
the opposition is hoping to make political hay of the sacking .
edmund stoiber , the conservative union block ’ s candidate for chancellor said scharping ’ s dismissal was " long overdue " and would be a relief for germany ’ s troops .
guido westerwelle , head of the free democrats , described the current governing coalition as " staggering to the elections like a pummeled boxer just before the final knockout .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.07.2002 the bad news keeps coming for schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's put an exasperating week behind him , but the biggest fight is yet to come for gerhard schröder .
with the eighth replacement of a cabinet minister in four years and criticism over deutsche telekom 's ceo 's ouster , chancellor gerhard schröder is entering the final stretch of the election more besieged than ever . one thing german chancellor gerhard schröder probably was n't bargaining for was a winter of discontent in the middle of the summer .
but that 's exactly what happened this week with the stormy resignation of deutsche telekom chief ron sommer and schröder ’ s sacking of defense minister rudolf scharping .
both were sacrificed for their bad judgement – but , more to the point – for jeopardizing schröder 's hopes of reelection on september 22 .
schröder has plenty to worry about – unemployment continues to rise , the ecomomy is still stagnating and his election campaign is flagging .
slipping out of favor according to the weekly emnid public opinion poll , voters still prefer schröder over his challenger , bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the christian social union .
but during the past month , schröder ’ s support slipped from 54 percent to 47 percent as one bad headline after another emerged .
unfortunate for schröder is that germany ’ s chancellor is elected by the parliament and not directly by the people .
in that regard , schröder 's prospects look far less promising .
according to emnid , the opposition union bloc - which is comprised of the csu and the christian democratic union - is set to win 41 percent of the vote , with schröder ’ s social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- clearing 35 percent .
the poll 's numbers also show that the union bloc , with its likely coalition partner the free democrats , would together win 50 percent of the vote – enough to build a government .
the figures are far less rosy for the current spd and alliance ' 90 / the greens government , who would together garner just 41 percent of the votes . even if schröder tried to string together a coalition with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - a step the social democrats have said they would not take with the successor party to east germany 's communists - he would still fall four points shy of a majority in parliament based on sunday 's poll .
damage control aware that any further scandal or economic development could end his reelection effort , schröder quickly fired scharping last week .
the move hardly came as a surprise - it was only one in a long string of scandals the minister had been involved in .
more schocking was that it was the eighth minister schröder has sacked during his nearly four years in office .
last summer , photos were published of scharping splashing about in a pool , carefree , as german soldiers risked their lives on a dangerous and politically sensitive mission in the balkans .
he also used german military jets to shuttle between berlin and majorca , spain , where he bronzes his skin in the summer with girlfriend countess kristina pilati .
then , this summer , members of parliament accused him of signing on to a deal with the european union for the purchase of airbus military cargo planes for the bundeswehr that had only been given partial blessing .
the last straw came last week with the publication of an article in the weekly magazine " stern " revealing that scharping had received 71,600 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- from moritz hunzinger , a public relations consultant in frankfurt , for lectures and book rights just before he became defense minister .
enough was enough , the chancellor decided , and scharping was let go .
the decision enjoyed wide public support .
" two-thirds of germans didn ’ t feel that scharping should continue to be in the cabinet after september 22 , " said manfred güllner , chief pollster for the forsa institute .
" he was really the most disliked minister , and even spd supporters said with a clear majority , ‘ scharping is no longer acceptable as a minister . ’ "
a magnet for bad economic news meanwhile , schröder ’ s favorite role of the shining frontman of german industry seems like a distant memory this week , as does his image as rescuer of threatened corporations like the frankfurt-based construction giant holtzmann .
worse yet , schröder ’ s party is also embroiled in corruption and campaign finance scandals and is the subject of criticism each time a new round of negative business reports emerge – from the insolvencies of important companies like engineering giant babcock borsig to the perpetually climbing unemployment figures , which is unusual for summer , when season factors typically lead to decreases in the rate .
additionally , key market indices and blue chip stocks are falling and little is to be seen of the promised economic upswing in germany .
" schröder ’ s economic competency has certainly suffered in recent weeks and months , " said güllner .
critics : telekom firing " hectic and unnecessary " but the most damaging incident for schröder ’ s election chances appeared to be his instigating sommer ’ s ouster at deutsche telekom .
critics described his backstage role as hectic and unnecessary .
just six months earlier , schröder loved to be seen publicly with the savvy and smart sommer , who came to represent the new economy in germany .
but last week , he let sommer fall , hastily , without offering a convincing alternative to replace him as telekom ’ s chief executive .
combined , the events came as a huge blow to schröder ’ s reelection chances , especially coming less than two months before election day , with the spd at least three points behind the opposition union bloc in most public opinion polls .
" it has become highly unlikely the spd and green coalition government will be able to attain the votes they got in 1998 , " güllner forecasted .
" it ’ s not unthinkable , but it ’ s highly unlikely .
but it ’ s still plausible that the spd could come in ahead of the union . "
but that can only happen if schröder is able to win over more voters in the final stretch of the election .

with the eighth replacement of a cabinet minister in four years and criticism over deutsche telekom 's ceo 's ouster , chancellor gerhard schröder is entering the final stretch of the election more besieged than ever . one thing german chancellor gerhard schröder probably was n't bargaining for was a winter of discontent in the middle of the summer .
but that 's exactly what happened this week with the stormy resignation of deutsche telekom chief ron sommer and schröder ’ s sacking of defense minister rudolf scharping .
both were sacrificed for their bad judgement – but , more to the point – for jeopardizing schröder 's hopes of reelection on september 22 .
schröder has plenty to worry about – unemployment continues to rise , the ecomomy is still stagnating and his election campaign is flagging .
slipping out of favor according to the weekly emnid public opinion poll , voters still prefer schröder over his challenger , bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the christian social union .
but during the past month , schröder ’ s support slipped from 54 percent to 47 percent as one bad headline after another emerged .
unfortunate for schröder is that germany ’ s chancellor is elected by the parliament and not directly by the people .
in that regard , schröder 's prospects look far less promising .
according to emnid , the opposition union bloc - which is comprised of the csu and the christian democratic union - is set to win 41 percent of the vote , with schröder ’ s social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- clearing 35 percent .
the poll 's numbers also show that the union bloc , with its likely coalition partner the free democrats , would together win 50 percent of the vote – enough to build a government .
the figures are far less rosy for the current spd and alliance ' 90 / the greens government , who would together garner just 41 percent of the votes . even if schröder tried to string together a coalition with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - a step the social democrats have said they would not take with the successor party to east germany 's communists - he would still fall four points shy of a majority in parliament based on sunday 's poll .
damage control aware that any further scandal or economic development could end his reelection effort , schröder quickly fired scharping last week .
the move hardly came as a surprise - it was only one in a long string of scandals the minister had been involved in .
more schocking was that it was the eighth minister schröder has sacked during his nearly four years in office .
last summer , photos were published of scharping splashing about in a pool , carefree , as german soldiers risked their lives on a dangerous and politically sensitive mission in the balkans .
he also used german military jets to shuttle between berlin and majorca , spain , where he bronzes his skin in the summer with girlfriend countess kristina pilati .

with the eighth replacement of a cabinet minister in four years and criticism over deutsche telekom 's ceo 's ouster , chancellor gerhard schröder is entering the final stretch of the election more besieged than ever . one thing german chancellor gerhard schröder probably was n't bargaining for was a winter of discontent in the middle of the summer .
but that 's exactly what happened this week with the stormy resignation of deutsche telekom chief ron sommer and schröder ’ s sacking of defense minister rudolf scharping .
both were sacrificed for their bad judgement – but , more to the point – for jeopardizing schröder 's hopes of reelection on september 22 .
schröder has plenty to worry about – unemployment continues to rise , the ecomomy is still stagnating and his election campaign is flagging .
slipping out of favor according to the weekly emnid public opinion poll , voters still prefer schröder over his challenger , bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the christian social union .
but during the past month , schröder ’ s support slipped from 54 percent to 47 percent as one bad headline after another emerged .
unfortunate for schröder is that germany ’ s chancellor is elected by the parliament and not directly by the people .
in that regard , schröder 's prospects look far less promising .
according to emnid , the opposition union bloc - which is comprised of the csu and the christian democratic union - is set to win 41 percent of the vote , with schröder ’ s social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- clearing 35 percent .
the poll 's numbers also show that the union bloc , with its likely coalition partner the free democrats , would together win 50 percent of the vote – enough to build a government .
the figures are far less rosy for the current spd and alliance ' 90 / the greens government , who would together garner just 41 percent of the votes . even if schröder tried to string together a coalition with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - a step the social democrats have said they would not take with the successor party to east germany 's communists - he would still fall four points shy of a majority in parliament based on sunday 's poll .
damage control aware that any further scandal or economic development could end his reelection effort , schröder quickly fired scharping last week .
the move hardly came as a surprise - it was only one in a long string of scandals the minister had been involved in .
more schocking was that it was the eighth minister schröder has sacked during his nearly four years in office .
last summer , photos were published of scharping splashing about in a pool , carefree , as german soldiers risked their lives on a dangerous and politically sensitive mission in the balkans .
he also used german military jets to shuttle between berlin and majorca , spain , where he bronzes his skin in the summer with girlfriend countess kristina pilati .
then , this summer , members of parliament accused him of signing on to a deal with the european union for the purchase of airbus military cargo planes for the bundeswehr that had only been given partial blessing .
the last straw came last week with the publication of an article in the weekly magazine " stern " revealing that scharping had received 71,600 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- from moritz hunzinger , a public relations consultant in frankfurt , for lectures and book rights just before he became defense minister .
enough was enough , the chancellor decided , and scharping was let go .
the decision enjoyed wide public support .
" two-thirds of germans didn ’ t feel that scharping should continue to be in the cabinet after september 22 , " said manfred güllner , chief pollster for the forsa institute .
" he was really the most disliked minister , and even spd supporters said with a clear majority , ‘ scharping is no longer acceptable as a minister . ’ "

with the eighth replacement of a cabinet minister in four years and criticism over deutsche telekom 's ceo 's ouster , chancellor gerhard schröder is entering the final stretch of the election more besieged than ever . one thing german chancellor gerhard schröder probably was n't bargaining for was a winter of discontent in the middle of the summer .
but that 's exactly what happened this week with the stormy resignation of deutsche telekom chief ron sommer and schröder ’ s sacking of defense minister rudolf scharping .
both were sacrificed for their bad judgement – but , more to the point – for jeopardizing schröder 's hopes of reelection on september 22 .
schröder has plenty to worry about – unemployment continues to rise , the ecomomy is still stagnating and his election campaign is flagging .
slipping out of favor according to the weekly emnid public opinion poll , voters still prefer schröder over his challenger , bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the christian social union .
but during the past month , schröder ’ s support slipped from 54 percent to 47 percent as one bad headline after another emerged .
unfortunate for schröder is that germany ’ s chancellor is elected by the parliament and not directly by the people .
in that regard , schröder 's prospects look far less promising .
according to emnid , the opposition union bloc - which is comprised of the csu and the christian democratic union - is set to win 41 percent of the vote , with schröder ’ s social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- clearing 35 percent .
the poll 's numbers also show that the union bloc , with its likely coalition partner the free democrats , would together win 50 percent of the vote – enough to build a government .
the figures are far less rosy for the current spd and alliance ' 90 / the greens government , who would together garner just 41 percent of the votes . even if schröder tried to string together a coalition with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - a step the social democrats have said they would not take with the successor party to east germany 's communists - he would still fall four points shy of a majority in parliament based on sunday 's poll .
damage control aware that any further scandal or economic development could end his reelection effort , schröder quickly fired scharping last week .
the move hardly came as a surprise - it was only one in a long string of scandals the minister had been involved in .
more schocking was that it was the eighth minister schröder has sacked during his nearly four years in office .
last summer , photos were published of scharping splashing about in a pool , carefree , as german soldiers risked their lives on a dangerous and politically sensitive mission in the balkans .
he also used german military jets to shuttle between berlin and majorca , spain , where he bronzes his skin in the summer with girlfriend countess kristina pilati .
then , this summer , members of parliament accused him of signing on to a deal with the european union for the purchase of airbus military cargo planes for the bundeswehr that had only been given partial blessing .
the last straw came last week with the publication of an article in the weekly magazine " stern " revealing that scharping had received 71,600 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- from moritz hunzinger , a public relations consultant in frankfurt , for lectures and book rights just before he became defense minister .
enough was enough , the chancellor decided , and scharping was let go .
the decision enjoyed wide public support .
" two-thirds of germans didn ’ t feel that scharping should continue to be in the cabinet after september 22 , " said manfred güllner , chief pollster for the forsa institute .
" he was really the most disliked minister , and even spd supporters said with a clear majority , ‘ scharping is no longer acceptable as a minister . ’ "
a magnet for bad economic news meanwhile , schröder ’ s favorite role of the shining frontman of german industry seems like a distant memory this week , as does his image as rescuer of threatened corporations like the frankfurt-based construction giant holtzmann .
worse yet , schröder ’ s party is also embroiled in corruption and campaign finance scandals and is the subject of criticism each time a new round of negative business reports emerge – from the insolvencies of important companies like engineering giant babcock borsig to the perpetually climbing unemployment figures , which is unusual for summer , when season factors typically lead to decreases in the rate .
additionally , key market indices and blue chip stocks are falling and little is to be seen of the promised economic upswing in germany .
" schröder ’ s economic competency has certainly suffered in recent weeks and months , " said güllner .
critics : telekom firing " hectic and unnecessary " but the most damaging incident for schröder ’ s election chances appeared to be his instigating sommer ’ s ouster at deutsche telekom .
critics described his backstage role as hectic and unnecessary .
just six months earlier , schröder loved to be seen publicly with the savvy and smart sommer , who came to represent the new economy in germany .
but last week , he let sommer fall , hastily , without offering a convincing alternative to replace him as telekom ’ s chief executive .
combined , the events came as a huge blow to schröder ’ s reelection chances , especially coming less than two months before election day , with the spd at least three points behind the opposition union bloc in most public opinion polls .

with the eighth replacement of a cabinet minister in four years and criticism over deutsche telekom 's ceo 's ouster , chancellor gerhard schröder is entering the final stretch of the election more besieged than ever . one thing german chancellor gerhard schröder probably was n't bargaining for was a winter of discontent in the middle of the summer .
but that 's exactly what happened this week with the stormy resignation of deutsche telekom chief ron sommer and schröder ’ s sacking of defense minister rudolf scharping .
both were sacrificed for their bad judgement – but , more to the point – for jeopardizing schröder 's hopes of reelection on september 22 .
schröder has plenty to worry about – unemployment continues to rise , the ecomomy is still stagnating and his election campaign is flagging .
slipping out of favor according to the weekly emnid public opinion poll , voters still prefer schröder over his challenger , bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the christian social union .
but during the past month , schröder ’ s support slipped from 54 percent to 47 percent as one bad headline after another emerged .
unfortunate for schröder is that germany ’ s chancellor is elected by the parliament and not directly by the people .
in that regard , schröder 's prospects look far less promising .
according to emnid , the opposition union bloc - which is comprised of the csu and the christian democratic union - is set to win 41 percent of the vote , with schröder ’ s social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- clearing 35 percent .
the poll 's numbers also show that the union bloc , with its likely coalition partner the free democrats , would together win 50 percent of the vote – enough to build a government .
the figures are far less rosy for the current spd and alliance ' 90 / the greens government , who would together garner just 41 percent of the votes . even if schröder tried to string together a coalition with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - a step the social democrats have said they would not take with the successor party to east germany 's communists - he would still fall four points shy of a majority in parliament based on sunday 's poll .
damage control aware that any further scandal or economic development could end his reelection effort , schröder quickly fired scharping last week .
the move hardly came as a surprise - it was only one in a long string of scandals the minister had been involved in .
more schocking was that it was the eighth minister schröder has sacked during his nearly four years in office .
last summer , photos were published of scharping splashing about in a pool , carefree , as german soldiers risked their lives on a dangerous and politically sensitive mission in the balkans .
he also used german military jets to shuttle between berlin and majorca , spain , where he bronzes his skin in the summer with girlfriend countess kristina pilati .
then , this summer , members of parliament accused him of signing on to a deal with the european union for the purchase of airbus military cargo planes for the bundeswehr that had only been given partial blessing .
the last straw came last week with the publication of an article in the weekly magazine " stern " revealing that scharping had received 71,600 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- from moritz hunzinger , a public relations consultant in frankfurt , for lectures and book rights just before he became defense minister .
enough was enough , the chancellor decided , and scharping was let go .
the decision enjoyed wide public support .
" two-thirds of germans didn ’ t feel that scharping should continue to be in the cabinet after september 22 , " said manfred güllner , chief pollster for the forsa institute .
" he was really the most disliked minister , and even spd supporters said with a clear majority , ‘ scharping is no longer acceptable as a minister . ’ "
a magnet for bad economic news meanwhile , schröder ’ s favorite role of the shining frontman of german industry seems like a distant memory this week , as does his image as rescuer of threatened corporations like the frankfurt-based construction giant holtzmann .
worse yet , schröder ’ s party is also embroiled in corruption and campaign finance scandals and is the subject of criticism each time a new round of negative business reports emerge – from the insolvencies of important companies like engineering giant babcock borsig to the perpetually climbing unemployment figures , which is unusual for summer , when season factors typically lead to decreases in the rate .
additionally , key market indices and blue chip stocks are falling and little is to be seen of the promised economic upswing in germany .
" schröder ’ s economic competency has certainly suffered in recent weeks and months , " said güllner .
critics : telekom firing " hectic and unnecessary " but the most damaging incident for schröder ’ s election chances appeared to be his instigating sommer ’ s ouster at deutsche telekom .
critics described his backstage role as hectic and unnecessary .
just six months earlier , schröder loved to be seen publicly with the savvy and smart sommer , who came to represent the new economy in germany .
but last week , he let sommer fall , hastily , without offering a convincing alternative to replace him as telekom ’ s chief executive .
combined , the events came as a huge blow to schröder ’ s reelection chances , especially coming less than two months before election day , with the spd at least three points behind the opposition union bloc in most public opinion polls .
" it has become highly unlikely the spd and green coalition government will be able to attain the votes they got in 1998 , " güllner forecasted .
" it ’ s not unthinkable , but it ’ s highly unlikely .
but it ’ s still plausible that the spd could come in ahead of the union . "
but that can only happen if schröder is able to win over more voters in the final stretch of the election .

in the wake of a published report that germany 's defense minister , rudolf scharping , accepted payments from a public relations executive , the chancellor has called for his resignation . german chancellor gerhard schröder has sacked his defense minister rudolf scharping .
schröder announced that the social democrats parliamentary party leader , peter struck , would replace him .
this was after an emergency meeting that chancellor gerhard schröder called on thursday afternoon .
scharping had become the subject of allegations concerning his dealings with a public relations consultant , who also has clients in the arms industry .
it has been alleged the relationship may have involved a conflict of interest .
reports in the media revealed that scharping had received 71,600 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- from moritz hunzinger , a public relations consultant in frankfurt , for lectures and book rights just before he became defense minister .
scharping , however , denied any wrongdoing , saying the fees were from the time before he was defense minister , although the money entered his bank account after his posting .
" arbitrary assertions in the media are no reason for a resignation , " scharping told reuters .
" all payments were reported to the tax authorities and taxed .
large parts of the claims against me are false and deliberately defamatory . "
the final straw but this scandal turned out to be the proverbial straw that broke the camel ’ s back .
scharping , 54 , had been dogged by several high-profile scandals over the past year .
his troubles really began with a photo spread he allowed a magazine to print of him frolicking in a swimming pool in spain with his new fiancée , just as german troops were preparing for a dangerous mission in macedonia .
" randy rudi , " as he was dubbed , was ridiculed for " making love , not war " and the headlines were full of derision for the hapless minister .
but when it was revealed that he had also used a military plane for quick visits to his fiancée , the scandal took on a more serious tone .
scharping was called before a special parliamentary committee to answer for the flights and his future in office appeared to be in jeopardy .
but the next day two jets plowed into the world trade center and the political landscape changed .
the reprieve didn ’ t last long , however , and by the end of the year the minister was back in the headlines when he made statements interpreted as predicting a us attack on somalia .
at that point , the message coming out of his own party was : " one more mistake , and he ’ s out . "
in february , the chairman of the german armed forces association , bernhard gertz , said scharping had become a " joke figure " with declining authority that was " fatal for the armed forces . "
those sentiments were thought to be shared by many of the nation ’ s soldiers .
add to that a new scandal with allegations of conflict of interest , using public office for personal gain , and spending 28,000 euro -lrb- $ 28,170 -rrb- on luxury clothes , and rudolph scharping had become too big of a liability for chancellor schröder , who has an election in two months and flagging poll numbers to worry about .
" the necessary preconditions for working together are no longer given , " schröder said in an impromptu news conference on thursday afternoon .
defiant to the end refusing to be put off by the mounting allegations , scharping had stuck to his schedule on thursday morning , visiting a military installation in the state of lower saxony .
while scharping watched the presentation , the allegations raised against him in berlin were turning into a full-blown scandal .
the allegations surround payments scharping received from public relations executive moritz hunzinger .
half of the 72,000 euro was the rights to his unpublished memoirs , and the other half was reportedly for lectures he held before being appointed as germany 's defense minister .
scharping confirmed that he had received payments in the past , but said all were taxed and proceeds used mostly more charitable activities .
he denied that he had been the recipient of reward for contacts with the defense ministry .
" i have done everything in line with the law , " scharping said .
" therefore i don ’ t see any grounds to resign . "
as allegations flew , hunzinger defended scharping .
" he is a very noble individual who is in no way at fault , particularly not on this point , " he said .
but in the end , the government decided scharping had to go and schröder tapped social democratic parliamentary floor leader peter struck to step in as defense minister , never before in germany has there been a change in a ministerial post been so close to an election .
german voters go the polls on september 22 .
damage to the party the scharping case is just one more bit of bad news for schröder , who has watched his already floundering social democratic party dogged down further with corruption scandals involving undeclared party donations .
the opposition is hoping to make political hay of the sacking .
edmund stoiber , the conservative union block ’ s candidate for chancellor said scharping ’ s dismissal was " long overdue " and would be a relief for germany ’ s troops .
guido westerwelle , head of the free democrats , described the current governing coalition as " staggering to the elections like a pummeled boxer just before the final knockout .

in the wake of a published report that germany 's defense minister , rudolf scharping , accepted payments from a public relations executive , the chancellor has called for his resignation . german chancellor gerhard schröder has sacked his defense minister rudolf scharping .
schröder announced that the social democrats parliamentary party leader , peter struck , would replace him .
this was after an emergency meeting that chancellor gerhard schröder called on thursday afternoon .
scharping had become the subject of allegations concerning his dealings with a public relations consultant , who also has clients in the arms industry .
it has been alleged the relationship may have involved a conflict of interest .
reports in the media revealed that scharping had received 71,600 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- from moritz hunzinger , a public relations consultant in frankfurt , for lectures and book rights just before he became defense minister .
scharping , however , denied any wrongdoing , saying the fees were from the time before he was defense minister , although the money entered his bank account after his posting .
" arbitrary assertions in the media are no reason for a resignation , " scharping told reuters .
" all payments were reported to the tax authorities and taxed .
large parts of the claims against me are false and deliberately defamatory . "
the final straw but this scandal turned out to be the proverbial straw that broke the camel ’ s back .
scharping , 54 , had been dogged by several high-profile scandals over the past year .
his troubles really began with a photo spread he allowed a magazine to print of him frolicking in a swimming pool in spain with his new fiancée , just as german troops were preparing for a dangerous mission in macedonia .
" randy rudi , " as he was dubbed , was ridiculed for " making love , not war " and the headlines were full of derision for the hapless minister .
but when it was revealed that he had also used a military plane for quick visits to his fiancée , the scandal took on a more serious tone .
scharping was called before a special parliamentary committee to answer for the flights and his future in office appeared to be in jeopardy .
but the next day two jets plowed into the world trade center and the political landscape changed .
the reprieve didn ’ t last long , however , and by the end of the year the minister was back in the headlines when he made statements interpreted as predicting a us attack on somalia .
at that point , the message coming out of his own party was : " one more mistake , and he ’ s out . "
in february , the chairman of the german armed forces association , bernhard gertz , said scharping had become a " joke figure " with declining authority that was " fatal for the armed forces . "
those sentiments were thought to be shared by many of the nation ’ s soldiers .
add to that a new scandal with allegations of conflict of interest , using public office for personal gain , and spending 28,000 euro -lrb- $ 28,170 -rrb- on luxury clothes , and rudolph scharping had become too big of a liability for chancellor schröder , who has an election in two months and flagging poll numbers to worry about .
" the necessary preconditions for working together are no longer given , " schröder said in an impromptu news conference on thursday afternoon .

with the eighth replacement of a cabinet minister in four years and criticism over deutsche telekom 's ceo 's ouster , chancellor gerhard schröder is entering the final stretch of the election more besieged than ever . one thing german chancellor gerhard schröder probably was n't bargaining for was a winter of discontent in the middle of the summer .
but that 's exactly what happened this week with the stormy resignation of deutsche telekom chief ron sommer and schröder ’ s sacking of defense minister rudolf scharping .
both were sacrificed for their bad judgement – but , more to the point – for jeopardizing schröder 's hopes of reelection on september 22 .
schröder has plenty to worry about – unemployment continues to rise , the ecomomy is still stagnating and his election campaign is flagging .
slipping out of favor according to the weekly emnid public opinion poll , voters still prefer schröder over his challenger , bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the christian social union .
but during the past month , schröder ’ s support slipped from 54 percent to 47 percent as one bad headline after another emerged .
unfortunate for schröder is that germany ’ s chancellor is elected by the parliament and not directly by the people .
in that regard , schröder 's prospects look far less promising .
according to emnid , the opposition union bloc - which is comprised of the csu and the christian democratic union - is set to win 41 percent of the vote , with schröder ’ s social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- clearing 35 percent .
the poll 's numbers also show that the union bloc , with its likely coalition partner the free democrats , would together win 50 percent of the vote – enough to build a government .
the figures are far less rosy for the current spd and alliance ' 90 / the greens government , who would together garner just 41 percent of the votes . even if schröder tried to string together a coalition with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - a step the social democrats have said they would not take with the successor party to east germany 's communists - he would still fall four points shy of a majority in parliament based on sunday 's poll .
damage control aware that any further scandal or economic development could end his reelection effort , schröder quickly fired scharping last week .
the move hardly came as a surprise - it was only one in a long string of scandals the minister had been involved in .
more schocking was that it was the eighth minister schröder has sacked during his nearly four years in office .
last summer , photos were published of scharping splashing about in a pool , carefree , as german soldiers risked their lives on a dangerous and politically sensitive mission in the balkans .
he also used german military jets to shuttle between berlin and majorca , spain , where he bronzes his skin in the summer with girlfriend countess kristina pilati .
then , this summer , members of parliament accused him of signing on to a deal with the european union for the purchase of airbus military cargo planes for the bundeswehr that had only been given partial blessing .
the last straw came last week with the publication of an article in the weekly magazine " stern " revealing that scharping had received 71,600 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- from moritz hunzinger , a public relations consultant in frankfurt , for lectures and book rights just before he became defense minister .
enough was enough , the chancellor decided , and scharping was let go .
the decision enjoyed wide public support .
" two-thirds of germans didn ’ t feel that scharping should continue to be in the cabinet after september 22 , " said manfred güllner , chief pollster for the forsa institute .
" he was really the most disliked minister , and even spd supporters said with a clear majority , ‘ scharping is no longer acceptable as a minister . ’ "
a magnet for bad economic news meanwhile , schröder ’ s favorite role of the shining frontman of german industry seems like a distant memory this week , as does his image as rescuer of threatened corporations like the frankfurt-based construction giant holtzmann .
worse yet , schröder ’ s party is also embroiled in corruption and campaign finance scandals and is the subject of criticism each time a new round of negative business reports emerge – from the insolvencies of important companies like engineering giant babcock borsig to the perpetually climbing unemployment figures , which is unusual for summer , when season factors typically lead to decreases in the rate .
additionally , key market indices and blue chip stocks are falling and little is to be seen of the promised economic upswing in germany .
" schröder ’ s economic competency has certainly suffered in recent weeks and months , " said güllner .
critics : telekom firing " hectic and unnecessary " but the most damaging incident for schröder ’ s election chances appeared to be his instigating sommer ’ s ouster at deutsche telekom .
critics described his backstage role as hectic and unnecessary .
just six months earlier , schröder loved to be seen publicly with the savvy and smart sommer , who came to represent the new economy in germany .
but last week , he let sommer fall , hastily , without offering a convincing alternative to replace him as telekom ’ s chief executive .
combined , the events came as a huge blow to schröder ’ s reelection chances , especially coming less than two months before election day , with the spd at least three points behind the opposition union bloc in most public opinion polls .
" it has become highly unlikely the spd and green coalition government will be able to attain the votes they got in 1998 , " güllner forecasted .
" it ’ s not unthinkable , but it ’ s highly unlikely .
but it ’ s still plausible that the spd could come in ahead of the union . "
but that can only happen if schröder is able to win over more voters in the final stretch of the election .

with the eighth replacement of a cabinet minister in four years and criticism over deutsche telekom 's ceo 's ouster , chancellor gerhard schröder is entering the final stretch of the election more besieged than ever . one thing german chancellor gerhard schröder probably was n't bargaining for was a winter of discontent in the middle of the summer .
but that 's exactly what happened this week with the stormy resignation of deutsche telekom chief ron sommer and schröder ’ s sacking of defense minister rudolf scharping .
both were sacrificed for their bad judgement – but , more to the point – for jeopardizing schröder 's hopes of reelection on september 22 .
schröder has plenty to worry about – unemployment continues to rise , the ecomomy is still stagnating and his election campaign is flagging .
slipping out of favor according to the weekly emnid public opinion poll , voters still prefer schröder over his challenger , bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the christian social union .
but during the past month , schröder ’ s support slipped from 54 percent to 47 percent as one bad headline after another emerged .
unfortunate for schröder is that germany ’ s chancellor is elected by the parliament and not directly by the people .
in that regard , schröder 's prospects look far less promising .
according to emnid , the opposition union bloc - which is comprised of the csu and the christian democratic union - is set to win 41 percent of the vote , with schröder ’ s social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- clearing 35 percent .
the poll 's numbers also show that the union bloc , with its likely coalition partner the free democrats , would together win 50 percent of the vote – enough to build a government .
the figures are far less rosy for the current spd and alliance ' 90 / the greens government , who would together garner just 41 percent of the votes . even if schröder tried to string together a coalition with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - a step the social democrats have said they would not take with the successor party to east germany 's communists - he would still fall four points shy of a majority in parliament based on sunday 's poll .
damage control aware that any further scandal or economic development could end his reelection effort , schröder quickly fired scharping last week .
the move hardly came as a surprise - it was only one in a long string of scandals the minister had been involved in .
more schocking was that it was the eighth minister schröder has sacked during his nearly four years in office .
last summer , photos were published of scharping splashing about in a pool , carefree , as german soldiers risked their lives on a dangerous and politically sensitive mission in the balkans .
he also used german military jets to shuttle between berlin and majorca , spain , where he bronzes his skin in the summer with girlfriend countess kristina pilati .
then , this summer , members of parliament accused him of signing on to a deal with the european union for the purchase of airbus military cargo planes for the bundeswehr that had only been given partial blessing .
the last straw came last week with the publication of an article in the weekly magazine " stern " revealing that scharping had received 71,600 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- from moritz hunzinger , a public relations consultant in frankfurt , for lectures and book rights just before he became defense minister .
enough was enough , the chancellor decided , and scharping was let go .
the decision enjoyed wide public support .
" two-thirds of germans didn ’ t feel that scharping should continue to be in the cabinet after september 22 , " said manfred güllner , chief pollster for the forsa institute .
" he was really the most disliked minister , and even spd supporters said with a clear majority , ‘ scharping is no longer acceptable as a minister . ’ "
a magnet for bad economic news meanwhile , schröder ’ s favorite role of the shining frontman of german industry seems like a distant memory this week , as does his image as rescuer of threatened corporations like the frankfurt-based construction giant holtzmann .
worse yet , schröder ’ s party is also embroiled in corruption and campaign finance scandals and is the subject of criticism each time a new round of negative business reports emerge – from the insolvencies of important companies like engineering giant babcock borsig to the perpetually climbing unemployment figures , which is unusual for summer , when season factors typically lead to decreases in the rate .
additionally , key market indices and blue chip stocks are falling and little is to be seen of the promised economic upswing in germany .
" schröder ’ s economic competency has certainly suffered in recent weeks and months , " said güllner .
critics : telekom firing " hectic and unnecessary " but the most damaging incident for schröder ’ s election chances appeared to be his instigating sommer ’ s ouster at deutsche telekom .
critics described his backstage role as hectic and unnecessary .
just six months earlier , schröder loved to be seen publicly with the savvy and smart sommer , who came to represent the new economy in germany .
but last week , he let sommer fall , hastily , without offering a convincing alternative to replace him as telekom ’ s chief executive .
combined , the events came as a huge blow to schröder ’ s reelection chances , especially coming less than two months before election day , with the spd at least three points behind the opposition union bloc in most public opinion polls .
" it has become highly unlikely the spd and green coalition government will be able to attain the votes they got in 1998 , " güllner forecasted .
" it ’ s not unthinkable , but it ’ s highly unlikely .
but it ’ s still plausible that the spd could come in ahead of the union . "
but that can only happen if schröder is able to win over more voters in the final stretch of the election .

with the eighth replacement of a cabinet minister in four years and criticism over deutsche telekom 's ceo 's ouster , chancellor gerhard schröder is entering the final stretch of the election more besieged than ever . one thing german chancellor gerhard schröder probably was n't bargaining for was a winter of discontent in the middle of the summer .
but that 's exactly what happened this week with the stormy resignation of deutsche telekom chief ron sommer and schröder ’ s sacking of defense minister rudolf scharping .
both were sacrificed for their bad judgement – but , more to the point – for jeopardizing schröder 's hopes of reelection on september 22 .
schröder has plenty to worry about – unemployment continues to rise , the ecomomy is still stagnating and his election campaign is flagging .
slipping out of favor according to the weekly emnid public opinion poll , voters still prefer schröder over his challenger , bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the christian social union .
but during the past month , schröder ’ s support slipped from 54 percent to 47 percent as one bad headline after another emerged .
unfortunate for schröder is that germany ’ s chancellor is elected by the parliament and not directly by the people .
in that regard , schröder 's prospects look far less promising .
according to emnid , the opposition union bloc - which is comprised of the csu and the christian democratic union - is set to win 41 percent of the vote , with schröder ’ s social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- clearing 35 percent .
the poll 's numbers also show that the union bloc , with its likely coalition partner the free democrats , would together win 50 percent of the vote – enough to build a government .
the figures are far less rosy for the current spd and alliance ' 90 / the greens government , who would together garner just 41 percent of the votes . even if schröder tried to string together a coalition with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - a step the social democrats have said they would not take with the successor party to east germany 's communists - he would still fall four points shy of a majority in parliament based on sunday 's poll .
damage control aware that any further scandal or economic development could end his reelection effort , schröder quickly fired scharping last week .
the move hardly came as a surprise - it was only one in a long string of scandals the minister had been involved in .
more schocking was that it was the eighth minister schröder has sacked during his nearly four years in office .
last summer , photos were published of scharping splashing about in a pool , carefree , as german soldiers risked their lives on a dangerous and politically sensitive mission in the balkans .
he also used german military jets to shuttle between berlin and majorca , spain , where he bronzes his skin in the summer with girlfriend countess kristina pilati .
then , this summer , members of parliament accused him of signing on to a deal with the european union for the purchase of airbus military cargo planes for the bundeswehr that had only been given partial blessing .
the last straw came last week with the publication of an article in the weekly magazine " stern " revealing that scharping had received 71,600 euro -lrb- $ 72,000 -rrb- from moritz hunzinger , a public relations consultant in frankfurt , for lectures and book rights just before he became defense minister .
enough was enough , the chancellor decided , and scharping was let go .
the decision enjoyed wide public support .
" two-thirds of germans didn ’ t feel that scharping should continue to be in the cabinet after september 22 , " said manfred güllner , chief pollster for the forsa institute .
" he was really the most disliked minister , and even spd supporters said with a clear majority , ‘ scharping is no longer acceptable as a minister . ’ "
a magnet for bad economic news meanwhile , schröder ’ s favorite role of the shining frontman of german industry seems like a distant memory this week , as does his image as rescuer of threatened corporations like the frankfurt-based construction giant holtzmann .
worse yet , schröder ’ s party is also embroiled in corruption and campaign finance scandals and is the subject of criticism each time a new round of negative business reports emerge – from the insolvencies of important companies like engineering giant babcock borsig to the perpetually climbing unemployment figures , which is unusual for summer , when season factors typically lead to decreases in the rate .
additionally , key market indices and blue chip stocks are falling and little is to be seen of the promised economic upswing in germany .
" schröder ’ s economic competency has certainly suffered in recent weeks and months , " said güllner .
critics : telekom firing " hectic and unnecessary " but the most damaging incident for schröder ’ s election chances appeared to be his instigating sommer ’ s ouster at deutsche telekom .
critics described his backstage role as hectic and unnecessary .
just six months earlier , schröder loved to be seen publicly with the savvy and smart sommer , who came to represent the new economy in germany .
but last week , he let sommer fall , hastily , without offering a convincing alternative to replace him as telekom ’ s chief executive .
combined , the events came as a huge blow to schröder ’ s reelection chances , especially coming less than two months before election day , with the spd at least three points behind the opposition union bloc in most public opinion polls .
" it has become highly unlikely the spd and green coalition government will be able to attain the votes they got in 1998 , " güllner forecasted .
" it ’ s not unthinkable , but it ’ s highly unlikely .
but it ’ s still plausible that the spd could come in ahead of the union . "

we need to recreate symbols of the american spirit matt , us to read more of your comments , click here some 5,000 people , representing a cross-section of new york society , gathered for the " listening to the city " meeting - billed as the largest town gathering ever to take place .
using electronic keypads , participants - including relatives of those who died in the 11 september attacks that destroyed the twin towers - responded to six formal redevelopment proposals .
they also debated what form a memorial to the 3,000 people who lost their lives should take .
the six competing plans have met with uniform disappointment the six schemes , unveiled earlier this week , were criticised for lacking ambition and for the amount of space given over to offices .
a majority of the participants wanted to ban any building at all on the foundations of the twin towers .
the planners said they would take into account the opinions as they narrow the number of projects down to three by september .
business interests however , the port authority , which owns the site , wants 11 million square feet of commercial office space and 600,000 square feet of retail space incorporated in any redevelopment .
correspondents said the majority of people at the meeting were not convinced that their suggestions would be acted upon .
the lower manhattan development corporation -lrb- lmdc -rrb- , which is overseeing the redevelopment of the site , says it hopes to have a final plan by the end of this year after further public meetings are held .
construction is not expected to get under way for at least another two years , and it is estimated that the project will not be finished before 2010 . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's jane standley in new york " every kind of interest group is here " the four hijacks trade center disaster in pictures twin towers tenants timeline eyewitness talking point ground zero your reaction to the rebuilding designs see also : 21 jul 02 -pipe- americas new yorkers have their say 16 jul 02 -pipe- americas in pictures : ground zero plans 15 jul 02 -pipe- americas ceremony concludes search for wtc dead internet links : lower manhattan development corporation images from ground zero new york city new york state listening to the city the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top americas stories now : us draws up second iraq resolution chicago club owners face charges peru 's ex-spy chief on public trial venezuela signs non-violence pact us plays down n korean threat us struggles to clear snow hacker breaches credit card security bolivian cabinet resigns links to more americas stories are at the foot of the page .

the animals depend on slow moving rivers , lakes and canals to build burrows in steep grassy banks .

" he was a very controversial figure in his day , " john marriott , from the critics ' circle , told us .
" he was never satisfied with his silent film success , he always wanted to direct films - and they were left-leaning and pacifist influenced .
" he enjoyed poking fun at the establishment , " said marriott .
chaplin 's private life was also colourful , by the standards of the day .
he married four times - and two of his wives were just 16 years old , half his own age .
" chaplin ended his days in peace , but he was a disappointed man .
after leaving the united states in the early 50s , he was n't allowed back in .
" they resented the fact that he 'd never applied for american citizenship , although he 'd made his career there , " says marriott. click here to watch our interview with john marriott in full more details from bbc news online 's world affairs correspondent paul reynolds .
confidential foreign office papers just released by the public record office reveal how for years charlie chaplin was denied a knighthood .
the papers are being put on the record office website from monday , 22 july .
they include a hostile report on chaplin by the foreign office research department in 1956 .
this drew attention to his " communist " sympathies and to his morals - his marriages included two to girls aged sixteen and he had once lost a paternity suit .
mr chaplin has alienated many of his former champions and admirers foreign office memo it was n't until 1971 that an official remarked that " a good deal of water has flowed under the bridge since then " and that " there may be a feeling that it is time to let bygones be bygones " .
chaplin was eventually knighted in 1975 .
the episode shows the deep sensitivity of the issue , with views being sought from the british ambassadors in washington and switzerland -lrb- where chaplin , still a british citizen , moved to in 1952 after leaving the united states -rrb- .
the damning research department memorandum is headed the united states ' case against mr charles s chaplin .
' lurid ' paternity suit indeed much of the british reluctance to give charlie chaplin a knighthood stemmed from concern that the americans , then in strong anti-communist mood , would not approve and the british honours system would therefore be " brought into disrepute " .
the memo says : " mr chaplin has alienated many of his former champions and admirers by allowing himself to be played up in certain european countries as a martyr to " hyper-americanism " .
he has also added grist to his opponents ' mill by his acceptance of public marks of favour from the communist orbit - e.g. his consenting to receive the " peace prize " of the communist-sponsored world peace council in june 1954 " .
the documents have been kept secret the report points out : " mr chaplin managed to shock even the more broad-minded in the 1920s - e.g. his two marriages to 16-year-olds .
nor has the press allowed its readers to forget the joan barry paternity suit , the lurid details of which dominated headlines in 1943 and 1944 before mr chaplin was finally declared the legal father of miss barry 's child . "
so keen was one official to point out the supposed moral lapse in his marriages that in another document the phrase " 16-year-old women " was changed .
the word " women " was crossed out and " girls " written in by hand .
in 1969 , the foreign office still opposed a knighthood and even by 1971 after the swinging sixties had redefined sexual and political views , it was very sniffy .
chaplin 's politics provoked suspicion in the us there was a lot of bureaucratic buck passing .
from the north america department r a vining -lrb- miss -rrb- writes that an honour " would do no harm to our relations with the us " .
but she hands the final word to the washington embassy with a classic piece of official weaselling : " but if washington thinks otherwise , i would not venture to disagree " .
in washington the british ambassador lord cromer is a bit doubtful .
special honour he thinks bob hope , born in britain but a us citizen , might be a better candidate .
" i would just question whether such tardy recognition of mr chaplin 's talents displayed so very long ago would really be desirable now " , he comments without making a clear recommendation .
but pressure on the british government was kept up .
one letter to the queen in 1972 is preserved .
it was from fergus horsburgh in canada .
he , too , uses the phrase " let bygones be bygones " .
and times were a 'changin ' .
in 1972 , charlie was given a special oscar .
the long delayed knighthood came three years later , just two years before chaplin died . watch / listen on this story chaplin : john marrriott on breakfast home when we are on air recent forums programme archive studio tour today 's information meet the team presenters reporters your say contact us your comments see also : 16 may 02 -pipe- entertainment chaplin colour footage unearthed 24 jan 02 -pipe- entertainment chaplin family to attend berlinale 02 jan 02 -pipe- entertainment chaplin building damaged in fire internet links : public record office foreign office the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites e-mail this story to a friend links to more breakfast stories in this section running the red soak the rich metrosexual man casualty 's big day rail passengers face above inflation rise the truth about nanotechnology hoover street revival hitchcock blonde when violence begins at home more children suffering from eating disorders calling time on licensing laws the lessons of the trupti patel case open all hours ^ ^ back to top news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point -pipe- country profiles -pipe- in depth -pipe- programmes - to bbc sport > > -pipe- to bbc weather > > -pipe- to bbc world service > > - © mmiii -pipe- news sources -pipe- privacy

the conflict between the mainly muslim north and non-muslim south has plagued the country for much of its history since independence from britain in 1956 .
uk foreign secretary jack straw welcomed reports that the sudanese government and rebels of the sudan people 's liberation movement -lrb- splm -rrb- had reached a deal on key issues aimed at ending the civil war .
but there are a good number of old diplomatic hands in africa experienced in the ways of sudanese negotiations who will react to the positive noises coming from the machakos talks in kenya with a healthy measure of skepticism .
change of policy suddenly it seems the government in khartoum is indicating its preparedness to go down a political route that would have been anathema during the last two decades of civil war .
agreement on the two key issues of self-determination for the people of south sudan , and state and religion , is a significant breakthrough jack straw uk foreign secretary as the rebel splm see it , khartoum has relented on its intended policy to impose islamic law in areas of the country that are patently un-islamic in nature .
there is talk too of allowing the predominantly non-muslim people of southern sudan to vote in a referendum in six years in which secession will be an option .
but six years is a long time away and anything can happen .
in the meantime , the rebels have agreed tentatively to discuss proposals that imply a measure of national political integration - this may establish a process that becomes a foundation for a new united sudan .
the question being asked is whether the bashir administration means what it says , and recognises the need for a solution to this desperate prolonged war - or whether this is a ploy destined to go the way of all earlier peace plans .
