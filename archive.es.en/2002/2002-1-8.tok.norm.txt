mr berlusconi took over the foreign affairs portfolio on sunday , after the resignation of pro-european renato ruggiero .
we are firmly convinced that the future of our country lies in a europe that is stronger and knows how to speak with one voice silvio berlusconi mr ruggiero quit in a row over italy 's unenthusiastic adoption of the new euro currency , prompting expressions of concern about the situation from senior ministers in france , germany and belgium .
in a newspaper interview , mr berlusconi said that italy did fully support a united and integrated europe .
" we are firmly convinced that the future of our country lies in a europe that is stronger and knows how to speak with one voice and knows how to follow up economic integration with political integration , with a new constitution , " he told corierre della serra .
mr berlusconi told the newspaper he expected to remain as both prime minister and foreign minister for some time .
" i intend to keep the interim -lsb- portfolio -rsb- for at least six months , maybe more , " he said .
bbc rome correspondent david willey says it is unclear how the prime minister will manage to do both jobs .
mr berlusconi said mr ruggiero 's repeated questioning of italy 's european policies had made life impossible .
" it was no longer possible for us to go forward like this , with us being forced to have our europeanism tested every day , " mr berlusconi said .
italy is one of the pillars of europe and one could be quite worried french finance minister laurent fabius france 's questioning of italy 's euro-credentials came in a radio interview given by finance minister laurent fabius on europe 1 radio station .
" italy is one of the pillars of europe and one could be quite worried , " he said .
" i think there is a need for a clarification at the level of the heads of government .
" there needs to be an explanation .
i think there needs to be a confirmation of the european commitment . "
french foreign minister hubert vedrine also expressed his concern - calling mr ruggiero a " great european who enjoyed a very strong reputation across europe " .
all governments should have a favourable attitude towards the euro spanish foreign minister josep pique germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer , telephoned mr ruggiero to express his regret at his departure .
meanwhile , spanish foreign minister josep pique , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , has postponed a planned trip to rome for a week , at mr berlusconi 's request , diplomatic sources said .
mr pique , whose original visit had been scheduled to include a meeting with mr ruggiero , had expressed the hope to meet mr berlusconi as soon as possible .
" all governments should have a favourable attitude to the euro , " mr pique had told reporters .
mr berlusconi has faced continued criticism from inside italy , where the euro hit a further hitch when bank workers went on strike on monday .
former prime minister massimo d 'alema said mr berlusconi had done a " stupid thing " by demanding mr ruggiero 's resignation .
mr ruggiero , one of the strongest pro-european voices in mr berlusconi 's centre-right team , strongly criticised his cabinet colleagues last thursday , for negative attitudes towards the european union .
euro 's quiet arrival the following day , mr berlusconi retorted that he was in charge of italy 's foreign policy , and mr ruggiero was merely a " technical " functionary carrying out his policies .
italy was the only country participating in the currency not to organise celebrations for the advent of the currency at the new year .
one italian minister has said he " could n't care a hoot " about the single currency , and others have cast doubts over further european integration .
on saturday , the european commission said italy was still trailing in last place in terms of euro cash transactions .

the 20-storey intourist , which occupies prime real estate in the centre of the capital , is due to be knocked down in the spring to make room for a western-style hotel .
from the very beginning it was alien , it has distorted the view of the kremlin architect aleksandr kudryavtsev built in 1970 , the slab-like edifice symbolised communist aesthetics and standards of service in western eyes .
with its mediocre food and rumours of comprehensive bugging , the intourist found its way into many foreign travellers ' anecdotes of holidays in the soviet union .
it was renowned for cockroach and rat infestations , and its broken showers .
it also became famous for its nightlife , with numerous prostitutes plying their trade on the street outside .
but it provided thousands of westerners with cheap holidays , and a base just two minutes ' walk from the kremlin and red square .
eyesore architects say the hotel will not be missed , as it distorted the view of the kremlin from the city 's main tverskaya street .
the intourist will be replaced by a more upmarket hotel " from the very beginning it was alien , " said russian academy of architecture president aleksandr kudryavtsev .
the moscow city authorities announced the hotel 's demolition three years ago .
in 1999 it was sold to a french company , superior ventures , which plans to replace it with a five-star hotel by 2004 .
but demolition will be a tricky business , because of the intourist 's proximity to the refurbished national hotel and other historic buildings .

bbc news -pipe- oscars 2002 -pipe- the importance of being iris categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : in depth : oscars 2002 front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics tuesday , 8 january , 2002 , 06:30 gmt the importance of being iris kate winslet plays iris murdoch in her mid 30s kate winslet plays the young iris murdoch in the acclaimed british film about the novelist and philosopher 's life - and tells bbc news online 's ian youngs about the role .
you can keep your awards and rave reviews , kate winslet says , because after filming her latest role , she has found the highest accolade of them all .
winslet plays a young iris murdoch , who died in 1999 , while judi dench portrays the old iris in the grip of alzheimer 's disease .
the real iris was described as one of the greatest minds of the century winslet says an article by john bayley , murdoch 's widower , made her sure she had done a good job .
" there was one thing he said that was just fantastic , the best compliment an actor can ever have , " she says .
" when he watched this film , although judi dench and myself were obviously not iris , in some way actually we were , and he did feel as though he was watching iris again . "
bayley " definitely saw strains of the iris that he knew " while watching winslet 's portrayal of the young iris , she says .
judi dench and jim broadbent play the old iris and john " that made me cry .
i just thought , that 's better than any review , any award , any nomination , any anything .
that is fantastic . "
winslet plays murdoch when she was teaching at oxford university - where she met bayley and had her first novel published - during the 1950s .
murdoch was an " absolute stick of dynamite " , as winslet puts it - one of the sharpest minds of the century , surrounded by friends and lovers .
the tragedy of her story - and the film - is that during old age , her once-great mind is gradually eaten away by alzheimer 's until she is reduced to staring vacantly at the teletubbies on tv .
when you 're asked to play the young judi dench , you do not , under any circumstances , say no kate winslet dench gives a superb performance as murdoch in the late 1990s , with an intense and transparent portrayal of the mental ravages , confusions and emptiness of the disease .
and it was the chance to star with dench , now regarded as a living legend of current cinema , that attracted winslet to the role .
" when you 're asked to play the young judi dench , you do not , under any circumstances , say no , " she says .
" i was n't going to say no when it was such a watertight , fantastic script and such a brilliant story and an amazing female role .
" that does n't come along that often , especially out of the uk - a little british gem . "
but she did not get together with dench to make sure their different portrayals seemed like the same person - and was relieved that she did not need to .
winslet only " dipped into " some of murdoch 's novels " when i first saw the film , i remember thinking , thank god we pulled it off , because we did feel very similar , " she says .
" she seemed like the older me and i did seem like the younger her . "
to research her part , winslet read bayley 's memoirs about life with murdoch several times and watched tv interviews murdoch gave when she was about 60 over and over again .
it was " incredibly useful " to hear the sound of her voice and get a feeling for her body language , she says .
" that really did help , not because i wanted to mimic those things , but to give me the sense and the essence of her . "
-lsb- iris -rsb- loved people , she loved things and she had an incredible zest for life kate winslet winslet did " dip into " some of her novels , she says , but just to get a feeling for what motivated murdoch .
" it just confirmed things that i already felt from john 's books , which was that she loved people , she loved things and she had an incredible zest for life , " she says .
one advantage of her role was that her part of the shoot was only four weeks long , and she could take her daughter mia , who was six months old at the time , with her .
she admitted that she and mia - like murdoch before her death - enjoy the teletubbies , but that she pays more attention to housework than the philosopher , whose messy house is recreated in the film .
" there were a few similarities between iris and i , " winslet says .
" but i would n't say that was one of them .
she obviously had better things to think about . "
if anyone is used to taking their clothes off , it 's me kate winslet winslet speaks enthusiastically about having to swim naked in a big , heated tank for the film - murdoch and bayley often went skinny-dipping in the summer .
" if anyone is used to taking their clothes off , it 's me , " winslet jokes about her past roles .
but she decides that her enthusiasm may be giving the wrong impression .
" i never particularly enjoy -lsb- doing nude scenes -rsb- and certainly do n't look forward to it .
but this was something that was very , very key in john and iris 's relationship , " she says .
' a joy ' winslet , who has been nominated for a golden globe for her supporting role , is not worried about whether the same recognition will come from the oscars jury - but would not complain if it did .
" i never enter into a filming experience thinking , right , this is going to be my academy award-nominated performance .
i think that 's completely back to front .
" i just felt so blessed to be part of something that was truly a joy to shoot , and happens to be film that i really love and i 'm incredibly proud of . "
