hong kong 's economy is likely to under-achieve for the next four years , its top finance official has warned .
in a briefing to legislators delivered on monday , financial secretary anthony leung said that sky-high unemployment and falling retail sales were playing havoc with economic forecasts .
" march 's forecast for 2003 to 2006 of nominal gdp growth of 4.4 % may not be attainable , " he said .
the prediction had been made in mr leung 's budget speech , before the current predicament took hold .
mainland trade the bright spot in hong kong 's situation is its relationship with china , which reacquired the territory from the uk in 1997 .
hong kong has long been a conduit for trade with the mainland .
its role as a financial centre has also made it a convenient location for chinese state firms to seek international finance , often through stock market listings .
swelling exports arriving from china are propping up growth , which was 3.3 % up in the third quarter from the level a year earlier .
exports of goods and services were both up more than 11 % over 2001 .
jobless record but that still falls short of targets , as hong kong 's trade-dependent economy suffers from the general world slowdown .
weakness in the us , a key destination for exports , is a particular worry .
unemployment is now at record levels of more than 7 % of the workforce , while more than 10 % of the population is on welfare , also a record .
meanwhile , the government 's budget deficit is ballooning .
the seven months to october produced a shortfall in government spending more than 60 % higher than the hk $ 45.2bn -lrb- $ 5.8bn ; £ 3.6bn -rrb- the government had predicted .

matthias kelly qc warned david blunkett 's proposals to abolish the double jeopardy rule , restrict jury trials and reveal defendants ' convictions would lead to innocent people being jailed .

' tough on rights ' if the double jeopardy law was scrapped a defendant could be tried again for the same crime if compelling new evidence arose .
criminal justice bill click here for key points also under the new proposals , judges would be allowed to sit without juries in complex cases such as fraud trials , and where there is a danger of intimidation or bribery , such as in major drugs or gangland violence cases .
mr kelly said the public would choose more policemen over reform of the criminal justice system .
" there is something about the home office that brings out these really penal instincts in people .
mr blunkett is profoundly illiberal , " he said .
he is expected to use his inaugural speech to the bar council on tuesday to attack ministers .
according to the paper he will say : " the government is neither tough on crime nor tough on the causes of crime .
" it is tough on people 's rights . "

mr sukardi said restricting travel around the world was like offering extra rewards for terrorists the minister , laksamana sukardi , was speaking as bali staged a music concert , part of a new initiative to promote the island as a safe tourist destination .
some of indonesia 's most popular bands gave their time for free to try to encourage people back to bali .
the concert was the first in a planned series of events , from boxing to art exhibitions , all organised by a group calling itself bali for the world .
rebuilding its reputation the aim is to try to rebuild the island , physically and psychologically .
the chairman of bali for the world , the indonesian cabinet minister , laksamana sukardi , said that without international hope bali was facing an uphill struggle .
in particular , he said , the advice issued by some governments , warning against non-essential travel to indonesia , should be lifted immediately .
" travelling everywhere involves some risk .
it 's universal .
so you give some sort of guidance to the travellers .
but not promoting indonesia as a dangerous place .
it 's a wrong assumption , " he said .
early days mr sukardi said that restricting travel around the world was like offering extra rewards for terrorists .
paranoia , he said , does not help anyone .
extra police are now patrolling the streets of bali .
but it has only been two months since the bombings , and memories of the tragedy , in which more than 180 people lost their lives , are still fresh .
despite the best efforts of groups like bali for the world , it is likely to be a good while before bali regains its reputation as a peaceful paradise .

but this year , the long list of musical stars and novelty acts have failed to put themselves up for the ultimate chart battle thanks to the full-blooded onslaught of a reality television show .
popstars : the rivals has shaped the birth of a boy band and a girl group , who have been primed to slug it out for the seasonal chart-topper , hijacking the traditional chart race and making it a two-horse affair .
we dive straight into the mire of boy band balladry , which is as sickening as too much plum duff and brandy butter the five members of male vocal harmony group one true voice were finalised a whole week before their female counterparts , and their contender sacred trust follows a path deeply rutted by boy outfits before them .
a lesser-known bee gees cover leave them on safe ground tackling a well-loved song could leave such a fresh outfit open to criticism .
their opening gambit is a jaunty , mid-paced number that could become a toe-tapper after a few too many christmas egg nogs .
it has had some very smooth production values slapped on it , so the rawness of the boys ' live television performances is nowhere to be found .
flip-side after you 're gone is a self-penned effort - but that does not make it any more original .
energetic effort we dive straight into the mire of boy band balladry , which is as sickening as too much plum duff and brandy butter .
girls aloud pitch in with a pleasantly surprising antidote to all the worst post-office party hangovers , with enough oomph to blow those cobwebs away .
the females win hands down in the musical stakes with a decent stab at pop-rock their offering sound of the underground is a fresh tune that has no intentions of following the road to seasonal schmaltzville .
