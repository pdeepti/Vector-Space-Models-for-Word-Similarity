an investigation for the bbc discovered that private home owners are keeping some or all of the money intended for the care themselves .
the homes say many of them have already been driven out of business because current fees are too low to maintain standards .
in october the government launched a scheme to assess patients in homes in england according to the level of care they needed .
the real disaster is that care homes are going out of business at a time when many patients are waiting in hospital with nowhere to go oliver heald , conservative spokesman only medical care was assessed .
residents must still pay for personal care .
those requiring the most nursing were to be given £ 110 a week , the middle group £ 70 and those requiring the least care £ 35 a week .
furious the money is paid to homes with the intention that it is passed on to their residents .
but the bbc investigation discovered that in many cases the homes ' owners simply keep some or all of it for themselves by putting up their fees .
relatives are furious .
ann , whose mother-in-law olive kay is in a southern cross care home near wigan , criticised the system and its impact on the elderly .
the government assessed mrs kay needed just £ 35 worth of nursing care a week .
her fees were £ 362 a week .
case study - mrs kay assessed as needing £ 35 nursing care per week fees are £ 362 nursing home is keeping the extra - meaning a total cost of £ 397 for mrs kay 's care but in a letter from southern cross , the family was told the fee would be going directly to the home , meaning the fees are effectively going up to £ 397 a week .
her daughter-in-law said mrs kay needed high levels of care .
" she would n't remember to dress herself in the morning if no-one told her .
she does n't even understand her husband died 18 months ago , " said .
she said even the £ 35 would have been welcome and added : " this money should be going to the people it 's intended for . "
however some owners claim they have no choice but to charge more for care .
they say the minimum wage and new care standards introduced by the government have increased costs and forced some homes to shut .
dr chai patel of westminster healthcare , which has 100 homes said the tiered funding scheme had not been thought through and did not reimburse the homes for the money they spent on care .
every patient in the company 's homes will see their fees cut by £ 35 - whatever their assessed level of care .
he warned care homes were at crisis point because of all the financial pressures on them .
" this could be the straw that breaks the camel 's back . "
" all the investment that 's going into the health service will fail .
the social care sector wo n't able to support older people because it will probably not exist in years to come in the way we know it now . "
government response the department of health said it has only just become aware that some nursing home chains may not be operating the system properly .
it is planning to write to the homes involved , asking for clarification of their practices .
but conservative spokesman oliver heald said : " the real disaster is that care homes are going out of business at a time when many patients are waiting in hospital with nowhere to go . "
he said 47,000 care home places had been lost because the sector was under such pressure .
and he said the government scheme was so badly organised that care home had to charge residents for the balance of their nursing fees . "
paul burstow , liberal democrat spokesperson for older people , said : " free nursing care is a cruel hoax .
it is nothing of the sort ; it is not what nursing care you need , but who provides it that determines what band , if any , you are in .
" the scheme has been poorly planned and badly implemented .
as a result thousands of nursing home residents have yet to see a penny piece . "

the firm unveiled plans on friday to list its shares in london and new york in march in a bid to raise its international profile .
ntt docomo is highly successful in its home market where its i-mode mobile internet technology has taken off .
this is primarily aimed at raising ntt docomo 's visibility overseas and expand -lrb- ing -rrb- its investment opportunities keiji tachikawa ntt docomo i-mode allows users to download crisp pictures to their handsets , as well as access a range of web-like services .
it also offers service providers easy ways of charging small amounts for their services .
shares in the mobile operator - the biggest component of the tokyo stock exchange by market capitalisation - closed up 7.25 % at 1.48m yen -lrb- $ 11,058 -rrb- on monday .
worries on sony the benchmark nikkei 225 average closed only marginally higher , up 0.75 % at 10,220.85 , curbed by a fall of 2.5 % in consumer electronics giant sony 's shares .
sony 's share price fall was reportedly due to continuing worries among investors about the sector despite the firm 's better-than-expected third quarter profits last week .
ntt docomo is winning the race among mobile phone firms to get third-generation , or 3g , mobile networks up and running .
the international listing , set for march after months of speculation , will not involve the sale of any new shares .
" this is primarily aimed at raising ntt docomo 's visibility overseas and expand -lrb- ing -rrb- its investment opportunities , " said chief executive keiji tachikawa .
the company is also doing a share-split to increase liquidity in its closely held stock .
stronger framework the japanese mobile phone firm is 64 % owned by its parent company ntt .
it has relatively few freely traded shares , making those that are available very expensive .
by contrast , uk mobile phone giant vodafone is the biggest single constituent of the ftse 100 .
the international listing will create a framework to make it easier for foreign buyers to invest in the stock .
risk of big swings with relatively few freely traded shares , the implications of a sharp swing in the share price is daunting .
for example , the stock closed in tokyo on friday at 1.38m yen per share - a staggering $ 10,240 each .
to solve this problem , ntt docomo will carry out a five-for-one share split , giving existing shareholders five new shares for every one they hold .
the result will be to lower the price of individual shares without damaging the value of investors ' holdings .
" it 's very good to increase the stock 's liquidity , " said kirk boodry , a telecoms analyst at dresdner kleinwort wasserstein in tokyo .
possible sell-off ?
the move is also being seen as a prelude to ntt reducing its own holding from 64 % in future , telecoms analysts said .
furthermore , they expect ntt docomo to finance future overseas expansion plans by raising funds on the london and new york markets .
i-mode has acquired 30 million subscribers in three years .
in europe , ntt docomo signed deals last autumn licensing its high-speed picture download technology to the netherlands ' kpn mobile , belgium 's kpn orange and germany 's e-plus .
kpn was the natural partner for docomo as the japanese firm holds a 15 % stake in the dutch company , the result of a three-way deal also involving orange to collaborate on third-generation phone networks .
ntt docomo also has a relationship with aol japan .

john actie was cleared of the murder of lynette white in cardiff bay after a trial in 1990 which saw three men jailed for her death , only to be released on appeal two years later .
lynette white was murdered in 1988 police have reopened the case into the murder of 20-year-old ms white , whose mutilated body was found on st valentine 's day 1988 at her flat above a betting shop in butetown in cardiff .
tony paris , one of the men dubbed the cardiff three jailed in 1990 , visited a solictor 's office on friday , 25 january , to give a mouth swab for use by detectives and mr actie is reported to want to do the same thing .
the men want to see themselves ruled out of the investigation completely .
speaking after the dna testing on friday , mr paris said : " it 's like a third trial - that 's what it seems like .
i do n't like it but it 's got to be done , " he said .
" this is what i 've got to do to show that i 've got nothing to do with it . "
anthony paris offered detectives a dna sample ms white 's killing became one of the highest-profile murder investigations of the era .
no arrests have been made since the cardiff three trial , although police launched a new inquiry in september 2000 and have built up a profile of her killer .
south wales police - who have 20 officers working on the inquiry - say a number of people have already contacted them offering to provide a dna sample following their appeal .
officers will now have to trawl through a database of 5,000 people who were previously close to the inquiry .
they say they will attempt to contact people on a priority basis and ask them if they willing to give a sample of dna .
the shopfront below ms white 's cardiff bay flat samples must be given voluntarily and take the form of a swab from the mouth .
south wales police assistant chief constable tony rogers said the screening process was entirely confidential .
" we know there were some people who were lawfully at lynette 's flat around the time she was killed who need to be eliminated from the enquiry . "
" we would appeal to them to come forward and contact the incident room , " he said .
he added that a review of all undetected murders using dna technology had led to the move and to the identification of the suspected killer of three teenage girls from neath in 1973 .
the latest inquiry followed a 15-month study by senior officers brought in from lancashire and an independent panel of lay people into the original investigation .
it was on the recommendations of their report that the police ordered a fresh inquiry .
chief constable tony burden announced police would follow new lines of inquiry and use new dna technology to investigate the case .
