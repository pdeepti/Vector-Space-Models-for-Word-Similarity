but the present levels discovered by a team of researchers at the university of hokkaido in japan have taken experts by surprise .
the british science magazine new scientist reports in its latest issue that two of the 26 liver samples examined contained over 1970 micrograms of mercury per gram of liver .
that is nearly 5000 times the japanese government 's allowed limit for mercury contamination – 0.4 micrograms per gram .
researchers warn that with these concentrations , an adult weighing 60 kilograms would exceed the weekly mercury intake deemed safe by the world health organisation by eating just 0.15 grams of liver .
the new scientist quotes from the researchers ’ work , that " acute intoxication could result from a single ingestion . "
keeping in mind the health risk involved , researchers are now calling on the japanese government to impose tighter regulations on the consumption of whale organs .
pregnant women are particularly at risk , they warn and could jeopardise the lives of their unborn children by consuming whalemeat .
the new scientist reports grave health problems in the 1950s and early 1960s when hundreds of children around japan ’ s minamata bay were born with horrific birth defects and brain damage after their mothers ate seafood contaminated with mercury compounds , which had been poured raw into the bay since the 1930s .
meanwhile in another as yet unpublished study , the research team from the university of hokkaido showed that rats suffered acute kidney poisoning after a single mouthful of the most highly contaminated liver .
researchers told the new scientist that while levels were lower in muscle , on an average it still contained 2.5 to 25 times the limit .
the samples were taken from small-toothed whales and dolphins – catches of which are not restricted by the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- , the international body that regulates whaling .

but the present levels discovered by a team of researchers at the university of hokkaido in japan have taken experts by surprise .
the british science magazine new scientist reports in its latest issue that two of the 26 liver samples examined contained over 1970 micrograms of mercury per gram of liver .
that is nearly 5000 times the japanese government 's allowed limit for mercury contamination – 0.4 micrograms per gram .
researchers warn that with these concentrations , an adult weighing 60 kilograms would exceed the weekly mercury intake deemed safe by the world health organisation by eating just 0.15 grams of liver .
the new scientist quotes from the researchers ’ work , that " acute intoxication could result from a single ingestion . "
keeping in mind the health risk involved , researchers are now calling on the japanese government to impose tighter regulations on the consumption of whale organs .

but the present levels discovered by a team of researchers at the university of hokkaido in japan have taken experts by surprise .
the british science magazine new scientist reports in its latest issue that two of the 26 liver samples examined contained over 1970 micrograms of mercury per gram of liver .
that is nearly 5000 times the japanese government 's allowed limit for mercury contamination – 0.4 micrograms per gram .
researchers warn that with these concentrations , an adult weighing 60 kilograms would exceed the weekly mercury intake deemed safe by the world health organisation by eating just 0.15 grams of liver .
the new scientist quotes from the researchers ’ work , that " acute intoxication could result from a single ingestion . "
keeping in mind the health risk involved , researchers are now calling on the japanese government to impose tighter regulations on the consumption of whale organs .
pregnant women are particularly at risk , they warn and could jeopardise the lives of their unborn children by consuming whalemeat .
the new scientist reports grave health problems in the 1950s and early 1960s when hundreds of children around japan ’ s minamata bay were born with horrific birth defects and brain damage after their mothers ate seafood contaminated with mercury compounds , which had been poured raw into the bay since the 1930s .
meanwhile in another as yet unpublished study , the research team from the university of hokkaido showed that rats suffered acute kidney poisoning after a single mouthful of the most highly contaminated liver .
researchers told the new scientist that while levels were lower in muscle , on an average it still contained 2.5 to 25 times the limit .
the samples were taken from small-toothed whales and dolphins – catches of which are not restricted by the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- , the international body that regulates whaling .
japan has been leading the drive for the resumption of commercial whaling , which was banned in 1986 .

but the present levels discovered by a team of researchers at the university of hokkaido in japan have taken experts by surprise .
the british science magazine new scientist reports in its latest issue that two of the 26 liver samples examined contained over 1970 micrograms of mercury per gram of liver .
that is nearly 5000 times the japanese government 's allowed limit for mercury contamination – 0.4 micrograms per gram .
researchers warn that with these concentrations , an adult weighing 60 kilograms would exceed the weekly mercury intake deemed safe by the world health organisation by eating just 0.15 grams of liver .
the new scientist quotes from the researchers ’ work , that " acute intoxication could result from a single ingestion . "
keeping in mind the health risk involved , researchers are now calling on the japanese government to impose tighter regulations on the consumption of whale organs .
pregnant women are particularly at risk , they warn and could jeopardise the lives of their unborn children by consuming whalemeat .
the new scientist reports grave health problems in the 1950s and early 1960s when hundreds of children around japan ’ s minamata bay were born with horrific birth defects and brain damage after their mothers ate seafood contaminated with mercury compounds , which had been poured raw into the bay since the 1930s .
meanwhile in another as yet unpublished study , the research team from the university of hokkaido showed that rats suffered acute kidney poisoning after a single mouthful of the most highly contaminated liver .
researchers told the new scientist that while levels were lower in muscle , on an average it still contained 2.5 to 25 times the limit .
the samples were taken from small-toothed whales and dolphins – catches of which are not restricted by the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- , the international body that regulates whaling .

martin sixsmith told friends he had been subjected to intimidation and attempts to make his life a misery , according to the independent on sunday .
the clause reportedly stops mr sixsmith from speaking about his time working for the government .
he has already agreed not to talk about his pay-off - reported to be £ 180,000 .
mr sixsmith was asked to resign following the row over an email sent by mr byer 's spin doctor jo moore that suggested 11 september was a " good day " to bury bad news .
he agreed not to reveal details of his pay-off and the negotiations surrounding them in a legally-binding severance contract signed on 25 april .
' draconian ' but on 31 may , when mr sixsmith was due to receive the money , government officials and lawyers reportedly told him he must sign a new clause preventing him from talking about his five years in whitehall .
his legal team is said to believe the " very draconian " new clause is unconstitutional and breaches the european convention on human rights .
a legal challenge could see the prime minister 's director of communications alistair campbell and other senior civil servants asked to give evidence .
the observer newspaper suggests the leaking of e-mails asking about the political affiliations of key members of the paddington survivors group has made the government " paranoid " that more secrets may be revealed .
a source involved in the negotiations also claimed the government is trying to smear the former bbc journalist .
his former colleagues had received calls asking if he had tried to undermine ex-director general lord birt - now in charge of " blue-skies thinking " on transport for the prime minister , the source told the newspaper .

aliyev : due to hold talks with russian president vladimir putin azeri president heydar aliyev said there were no unresolved issues , but that a few " little nuances " needed to be agreed on .
mr aliyev is due to hold two days of talks with russian prime minister vladimir putin , but it is not clear if the deal will be signed during such talks .
russian foreign minister igor ivanov was also vague , indicating only that there were no conflicts on either side and stressing there was " common understanding " between the two parties .
long-running dispute the deal clarifies the two countries ' joint border with the caspian sea and is seen as a crucial step towards resolving the long-running dispute over who owns which part of the sea .
three other countries - iran , turkmenistan and kazakhstan - also lay claim to the caspian sea , whose status has been debated since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 led to a scramble to take advantage of the landlocked sea 's fuel supplies .
prior to the collapse the sea was governed by an agreement between the then-soviet union and iran .
compromise at present boundaries are drawn according to the countries ' respective coastlines .
however iran and turkmenistan , which have the shortest coastlines out of the five , want them to be changed .
talks held in turkmenistan in april this year failed to resolve the dispute , mainly because each country was keen to defend its national interests .
the deal between russia and azerbaijan is widely expected to isolate iran and turkmenistan and force them to compromise .
the caspian sea is thought to hold about a third of the world 's oil and gas reserves .

the properties , which include some lavish palaces , are worth an estimated £ 65m and cost hundreds of thousands of pounds to maintain .
there is also a fear that the image of bishops living in splendour is damaging people 's perception of the church , especially as some parishes struggle to finance themselves .
the church commission will consider each of more than 100 buildings in a review expected next year .
the bishop 's home in bath has many visitors successive bishops of durham have lived at the spectacular auckland palace for 900 years , which has 50 rooms , a banqueting hall and 30 acres of parkland .
estate agents have estimated it would cost about £ 2m on the housing market .
the present bishop , the right rev michael turnbull , told bbc news : " wherever the bishop was , he would need a fair amount of space , for office space , to house his staff and that kind of thing .
" so it would be a difficult decision to make , especially bearing in mind the history tied up in this place and the affection in county durham for which it 's held . "
' hypocrisy ' some of the palaces have a great influence on the community because they attract many visitors .
and in bath , there is resistance to any moves to sell the bishop 's palace , for this reason .
the present bishop of bath and wells , the right rev peter price , helps out with repairs and maintenance .
rt rev peter price helps with repairs he said : " it 's a very busy place and part of all that is to try to create an income that will enable us to continue to maintain this beautiful heritage property , but with minimum cost to the church itself . "
critics claim some clergy abuse the wealth at their disposal , in contrary to the christian message .
norman baker , liberal democrat mp for lewes , said : " there are some who understand the teachings of the bible , but others who appear to revel in the wealth which surrounds them .
" they appear to be very happy to employ chauffeurs and gardeners and others , and whose lifestyle is very much at odds with the teachings they propound . "
there were reports last month that patrick o 'donoghue , roman catholic bishop of lancaster , planned to sell his £ 1m home and give most of the proceeds to the poor .
