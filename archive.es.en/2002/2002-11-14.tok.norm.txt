one of the most talked about appointment sagas in recent german corporate history has been concluded as deutsche telekom reveals its new chief executive officer . the person who has stepped into the rather troubled shoes of former deutsche telekom boss ron sommer and will tackle the company 's financial problems is kai-uwe ricke , the head of the company ’ s mobile phone and online division , until recently .
a vote by the board of directors on thursday ended the sweepstake on who becomes the company 's new ceo as they handed the 41-year old the reins of one of europe 's biggest telecommunications concerns .
ricke 's father was former telekom chief born in 1961 , ricke was immediately immersed in the family business .
his father helmut was a former head of germany 's once state-owned telecom and postal service monopoly and kai-uwe was destined to follow in his footsteps .
following bank training and studies at the european business school at schloss reichartshasen , ricke started his professional career as assistant to the board of bertelsmann ag in gütersloh , and went on to become head of sales and marketing for its subsidiary , scandinavian music club ag , in malmö , sweden .
from 1990 until june 1995 , ricke was managing director of talkline and talkline ps phone service , both of elmshorn near hamburg .
until december 1997 , ricke guided the affairs of talkline as its managing director and board spokesman .

he has a good reputation amongst colleagues who regard him as competent , and analysts believe ricke is also popular among the workers ’ representatives , who comprise half of the supervisory board ’ s members and who are well known to an internal candidate .
ricke has seen off competition from a number of top european candidates including the head of deutsche post ag , klaus zumwinkel , the head of porsche ag wendelin wiedeking and swisscom boss jens alder .
however , ricke 's appointment may cause some ripples within the company .
his philosophy is considered by many of the investors ’ representatives on the board as being too close to that of former ceo ron sommer , the man who hand-picked ricke to head the mobile operation .
critics point to support of ill-fated voicestream deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer 's departure left a huge question mark hanging over telekom his critics are also quick to raise the point that ricke firmly supported sommer ’ s ill-fated acquisition of u.s. mobile operator voicestream in 2001 .
the voicestream deal is regarded as one of the main contributors to the company ’ s huge debt and the recently reported record loss of 28 billion euro -lrb- $ 28.29 billion -rrb- .
many wanted the dead wood of the sommer era to be cut away to give the company a clean sheet as it works towards recovery .
sommer was ousted under pressure from the german government last july .
at the time , chancellor gerhard schröder had raised concern about the partially state-owned company ’ s debt and growth strategy .

the brain of ulrike meinhof , which has sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years following scientific research , will be buried along with her body in a berlin cemetery . the brain of germany ’ s most well-known postwar urban guerrilla will be laid to rest in the same berlin cemetery her body was buried in 26 years ago . the announcement on thursday by ulrike meinhof ’ s daughter bettina röhl avoided a brewing controversy over the custody of the brain , prompted by an article by röhl herself on nov .
8 .
meinhof was fund hanged in her jail cell where she was awaiting trial in 1976 . meinhof , an accomplished journalist before she turned to violence , was buried in may 1976 in a berlin cemetery .
her brain didn ’ t join her body , a fact that only came to light following röhl ’ s article in the magdeburg volksstimme last week . she wrote that a scientist at the university of tübingen removed her brain from her body to find out why meinhof , a crusading leftist journalist could turn into one of germany ’ s most notorious urban guerrillas . the brain behind baader-meinhof meinhof , 41 when she died , provided the ideological framework behind the most controversial terrorism movement in germany .
the baader-meinhof group , led by meinhof , andreas baader and gudrun ensslin , had its roots in the famous 1968 student movement , which sought to radically alter germany ’ s conservative society and government . it was also the first generation to confront the country ’ s nazi past and sought to weed out the nazis that had take positions in germany ’ s postwar governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an april 7 , 1977 photo showing police officers covering the body of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , killed by raf terrorists the baader group , later called the red army faction , was the radicalized form of that movement .
it terrorized law enforcement with killings and robberies in the early 1970s while working towards their political goals .
in june 1972 , meinhof was captured and arrested by the police and charged with murder in five cases . an unusual journey of the mind four years later , she was found dead in her jail cell .
her brain , röhl wrote , was given to professor jürgen peiffer , a neurologist at the university .
after study , he found that the portion of her brain responsible for emotion was weakened , most likely the result of a brain tumor operation she underwent in 1962 . röhl wrote that her grandmother and father confirmed that meinhof had changed following the operation . peiffer ’ s revelation was an important one .
it proved , that “ ulrike meinhof was because of pathological reasons unfit to stand trial and as a result should have been let free before the baader-meinhof trial . ” but the brain wasn ’ t returned following peiffer ’ s analysis .
he kept it in a plastic container filled with formaldehyde on a shelf until 1997 , when he brought it to a colleague at the university of magdeburg for analysis .
the colleague came to a similar conclusion . since then , wrote röhl , it ’ s been on a shelf in the university .
now , with help from prosecutors , she ’ s getting it back . " you can only say there has been a proper funeral if the brain is buried with the body , ” she wrote last friday .

the brain of ulrike meinhof , which has sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years following scientific research , will be buried along with her body in a berlin cemetery . the brain of germany ’ s most well-known postwar urban guerrilla will be laid to rest in the same berlin cemetery her body was buried in 26 years ago . the announcement on thursday by ulrike meinhof ’ s daughter bettina röhl avoided a brewing controversy over the custody of the brain , prompted by an article by röhl herself on nov .
8 .
meinhof was fund hanged in her jail cell where she was awaiting trial in 1976 . meinhof , an accomplished journalist before she turned to violence , was buried in may 1976 in a berlin cemetery .
her brain didn ’ t join her body , a fact that only came to light following röhl ’ s article in the magdeburg volksstimme last week . she wrote that a scientist at the university of tübingen removed her brain from her body to find out why meinhof , a crusading leftist journalist could turn into one of germany ’ s most notorious urban guerrillas . the brain behind baader-meinhof meinhof , 41 when she died , provided the ideological framework behind the most controversial terrorism movement in germany .
the baader-meinhof group , led by meinhof , andreas baader and gudrun ensslin , had its roots in the famous 1968 student movement , which sought to radically alter germany ’ s conservative society and government . it was also the first generation to confront the country ’ s nazi past and sought to weed out the nazis that had take positions in germany ’ s postwar governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an april 7 , 1977 photo showing police officers covering the body of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , killed by raf terrorists the baader group , later called the red army faction , was the radicalized form of that movement .
it terrorized law enforcement with killings and robberies in the early 1970s while working towards their political goals .
in june 1972 , meinhof was captured and arrested by the police and charged with murder in five cases . an unusual journey of the mind four years later , she was found dead in her jail cell .
her brain , röhl wrote , was given to professor jürgen peiffer , a neurologist at the university .
after study , he found that the portion of her brain responsible for emotion was weakened , most likely the result of a brain tumor operation she underwent in 1962 . röhl wrote that her grandmother and father confirmed that meinhof had changed following the operation . peiffer ’ s revelation was an important one .
it proved , that “ ulrike meinhof was because of pathological reasons unfit to stand trial and as a result should have been let free before the baader-meinhof trial . ” but the brain wasn ’ t returned following peiffer ’ s analysis .
he kept it in a plastic container filled with formaldehyde on a shelf until 1997 , when he brought it to a colleague at the university of magdeburg for analysis .
the colleague came to a similar conclusion . since then , wrote röhl , it ’ s been on a shelf in the university .

kai-uwe ricke is the new boss at deutsche telekom .
his appointment , announced early on thursday , ends four months of searching which had left the company in embarrassing limbo . the board of deutsche telekom has ended months of speculation by confirming on thursday that the head of its mobile operation , kai-uwe ricke , is the telecommunications company 's new chief executive .
the former state-owned monopoly can now officially pass the reins of power onto the son of past ceo helmut ricke and entrust him with revitalizing the heavily indebted german giant .
new chief starts work with 28 billion euro loss to recover deutsche telekom recently posted results showing a 28 billion euro -lrb- $ 28.29 billion -rrb- corporate loss - the biggest in german history .
ricke 's primary task will be to find ways of cutting the group 's debt to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 50.3 billion -rrb- from 64 billion by the end of next year .
" deutsche telekom 's supervisory board has unanimously elected kai-uwe ricke as the company 's chief executive officer at today 's meeting with effect from november 15 , 2002 , " the company said in its official statement .
the meeting of the telekom group 's supervisory board at 0900 gmt at the company 's central headquarters in bonn approved the appointment of ricke , ending an awkward hunt that had involved speculation and denial surrounding a number of managers from top german companies and others from abroad .
the meeting was also convened to address the group 's unhealthy third quarter figures .
unanimous vote in favour by board hands mantle to ricke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut sihler passes the baton of leadership to the new ceo .
representation at the meeting was made up mostly of employee members who currently command the majority on the board .
shareholder votes were reduced to nine due to the fact that caretaker chief executive helmut sihler 's vote was suspended from affecting the final decision .
in the end , it did n't matter as the motion was carried without hindrance .
sihler took over as caretaker chief in july after former boss ron sommer was ousted after the company 's share price collapse by 90 percent while telekom was under his command .
he will now return to his singular role as member of the board .
the new chief has many hard decisions to make in the coming months if he is to stabilize the corporate ship .
deutsche telekom has been leaking money ever since sommer rubber stamped the 34 billion euro -lrb- $ 34.2 billion -rrb- in takeover of u.s. mobile phone concern voicestream in 2001 , a deal supported by ricke at the time .
t-mobile usa decision raises questions about future ricke 's appointment is seen to be linked with the decision taken by deutsche telekom on wednesday to shelve the idea of an outright sale of voicestream , now known as t-mobile usa , but could still merge it with a rival in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are rough seas ahead for the german telecommunication giant .
if the decision is made to keep t-mobile usa within the group , deutsche telekom will need to find four to seven billion euro to match its self imposed debt target of three times annual core earnings by the end of 2003 .
this would lead to the dividend payment for this year being scrapped , allowing the company to re-cooperate 1.6 billion of badly needed revenue .
however , this would not be enough and deutsche telekom would have to follow this drastic action with more deep cuts in capital expenditure , a measure it has already addressed .
the company released information on thursday stating that it intends to reduce its planned capital expenditure by 6.7 - 7.7 billion euro as its net debt looks set to climb to as high as 52.3 billion euro in 2003 .
previous forecasts put the number at around 50 billion .
action has already been planned according to the announcement that followed the appointment of kai-uwe ricke as ceo .
telekom plans to raise 6.2 - 8.5 billion euro by selling strategic business interests including real estate and cable television amongst others .

this first step means a tax increase on natural gas , liquid gas , heating oil and off-peak electricity .
the government estimates that the increase will generate $ 1.4 billion in additional revenue .
however , this is little more than drop in the ocean given the massive economic problems facing the government and the opposition lost little time in reminding the ruling coalition of the mess the country was in .
the leader of the opposition christian democratic union , angela merkel , her confidence sky high after a successful party conference at the beginning of the week , laid into chancellor gerhard schröder and his policies , saying this was a " black day " for germany as it headed into a " depression and deflationary cycle .

merz criticized the government 's approach saying that dabbling superficially with fiscal instruments would not solve the fundamental economic problems .

and in thursday 's parliamentary vote on a number of measures of the coalition 's savings package , the social democrats and greens managed to pull off a minor victory by pushing through the first part of their environment tax reform .
this first step means a tax increase on natural gas , liquid gas , heating oil and off-peak electricity .
the government estimates that the increase will generate $ 1.4 billion in additional revenue .
however , this is little more than drop in the ocean given the massive economic problems facing the government and the opposition lost little time in reminding the ruling coalition of the mess the country was in .
the leader of the opposition christian democratic union , angela merkel , her confidence sky high after a successful party conference at the beginning of the week , laid into chancellor gerhard schröder and his policies , saying this was a " black day " for germany as it headed into a " depression and deflationary cycle . "
the cdu , its sister party the christian social union and the smaller free democrats all called for the resignation of finance minister hans eichel .

merz said the cdu / csu would not offer their support for further tax hikes .
the bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber , is dominated by the cdu / csu , giving them the power to block government legislation .
merz criticized the government 's approach saying that dabbling superficially with fiscal instruments would not solve the fundamental economic problems .
what was needed , he said , was more flexibility on the labor market .
some € 350 billion -lrb- $ 352 billion -rrb- , merz said , were generated in germany 's black economy which showed that the country did indeed possess economic dynamism , but that rules and conditions on the labor market were driving people into the black economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.11.2002 telekom appointment answers the 28 billion euro question großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kai-uwe ricke - stepping into ron sommer 's troubled shoes the wait is over .
one of the most talked about appointment sagas in recent german corporate history has been concluded as deutsche telekom reveals its new chief executive officer . the person who has stepped into the rather troubled shoes of former deutsche telekom boss ron sommer and will tackle the company 's financial problems is kai-uwe ricke , the head of the company ’ s mobile phone and online division , until recently .
a vote by the board of directors on thursday ended the sweepstake on who becomes the company 's new ceo as they handed the 41-year old the reins of one of europe 's biggest telecommunications concerns .
ricke 's father was former telekom chief born in 1961 , ricke was immediately immersed in the family business .
his father helmut was a former head of germany 's once state-owned telecom and postal service monopoly and kai-uwe was destined to follow in his footsteps .
following bank training and studies at the european business school at schloss reichartshasen , ricke started his professional career as assistant to the board of bertelsmann ag in gütersloh , and went on to become head of sales and marketing for its subsidiary , scandinavian music club ag , in malmö , sweden .
from 1990 until june 1995 , ricke was managing director of talkline and talkline ps phone service , both of elmshorn near hamburg .
until december 1997 , ricke guided the affairs of talkline as its managing director and board spokesman .
respected , competent colleague joined telekom in 1998 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricke will be expected to put telekom 's name back up in lights he joined deutsche telekom in 1998 and served as chief operating officer for the company ’ s mobile phone and online activities .
he has a good reputation amongst colleagues who regard him as competent , and analysts believe ricke is also popular among the workers ’ representatives , who comprise half of the supervisory board ’ s members and who are well known to an internal candidate .
ricke has seen off competition from a number of top european candidates including the head of deutsche post ag , klaus zumwinkel , the head of porsche ag wendelin wiedeking and swisscom boss jens alder .
however , ricke 's appointment may cause some ripples within the company .
his philosophy is considered by many of the investors ’ representatives on the board as being too close to that of former ceo ron sommer , the man who hand-picked ricke to head the mobile operation .
critics point to support of ill-fated voicestream deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer 's departure left a huge question mark hanging over telekom his critics are also quick to raise the point that ricke firmly supported sommer ’ s ill-fated acquisition of u.s. mobile operator voicestream in 2001 .
the voicestream deal is regarded as one of the main contributors to the company ’ s huge debt and the recently reported record loss of 28 billion euro -lrb- $ 28.29 billion -rrb- .
many wanted the dead wood of the sommer era to be cut away to give the company a clean sheet as it works towards recovery .
sommer was ousted under pressure from the german government last july .
at the time , chancellor gerhard schröder had raised concern about the partially state-owned company ’ s debt and growth strategy .
shares were at an all-time low , and sommer was seen by many as the source of the problem .
it was n't long after that sommer vacated the position and prompted the search for a replacement that is ended on thursday with the appointment of ricke as ceo . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche telekom faces biggest-ever loss deutsche telekom is reportedly preparing to record the largest-ever loss recorded by a company on the german stock exchange .

kai-uwe ricke is the new boss at deutsche telekom .
his appointment , announced early on thursday , ends four months of searching which had left the company in embarrassing limbo . the board of deutsche telekom has ended months of speculation by confirming on thursday that the head of its mobile operation , kai-uwe ricke , is the telecommunications company 's new chief executive .
the former state-owned monopoly can now officially pass the reins of power onto the son of past ceo helmut ricke and entrust him with revitalizing the heavily indebted german giant .
new chief starts work with 28 billion euro loss to recover deutsche telekom recently posted results showing a 28 billion euro -lrb- $ 28.29 billion -rrb- corporate loss - the biggest in german history .
ricke 's primary task will be to find ways of cutting the group 's debt to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 50.3 billion -rrb- from 64 billion by the end of next year .
" deutsche telekom 's supervisory board has unanimously elected kai-uwe ricke as the company 's chief executive officer at today 's meeting with effect from november 15 , 2002 , " the company said in its official statement .
the meeting of the telekom group 's supervisory board at 0900 gmt at the company 's central headquarters in bonn approved the appointment of ricke , ending an awkward hunt that had involved speculation and denial surrounding a number of managers from top german companies and others from abroad .
the meeting was also convened to address the group 's unhealthy third quarter figures .
unanimous vote in favour by board hands mantle to ricke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut sihler passes the baton of leadership to the new ceo .
representation at the meeting was made up mostly of employee members who currently command the majority on the board .
shareholder votes were reduced to nine due to the fact that caretaker chief executive helmut sihler 's vote was suspended from affecting the final decision .
in the end , it did n't matter as the motion was carried without hindrance .
sihler took over as caretaker chief in july after former boss ron sommer was ousted after the company 's share price collapse by 90 percent while telekom was under his command .
he will now return to his singular role as member of the board .
the new chief has many hard decisions to make in the coming months if he is to stabilize the corporate ship .
deutsche telekom has been leaking money ever since sommer rubber stamped the 34 billion euro -lrb- $ 34.2 billion -rrb- in takeover of u.s. mobile phone concern voicestream in 2001 , a deal supported by ricke at the time .
t-mobile usa decision raises questions about future ricke 's appointment is seen to be linked with the decision taken by deutsche telekom on wednesday to shelve the idea of an outright sale of voicestream , now known as t-mobile usa , but could still merge it with a rival in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are rough seas ahead for the german telecommunication giant .
if the decision is made to keep t-mobile usa within the group , deutsche telekom will need to find four to seven billion euro to match its self imposed debt target of three times annual core earnings by the end of 2003 .
this would lead to the dividend payment for this year being scrapped , allowing the company to re-cooperate 1.6 billion of badly needed revenue .
however , this would not be enough and deutsche telekom would have to follow this drastic action with more deep cuts in capital expenditure , a measure it has already addressed .
the company released information on thursday stating that it intends to reduce its planned capital expenditure by 6.7 - 7.7 billion euro as its net debt looks set to climb to as high as 52.3 billion euro in 2003 .

kai-uwe ricke is the new boss at deutsche telekom .
his appointment , announced early on thursday , ends four months of searching which had left the company in embarrassing limbo . the board of deutsche telekom has ended months of speculation by confirming on thursday that the head of its mobile operation , kai-uwe ricke , is the telecommunications company 's new chief executive .
the former state-owned monopoly can now officially pass the reins of power onto the son of past ceo helmut ricke and entrust him with revitalizing the heavily indebted german giant .
new chief starts work with 28 billion euro loss to recover deutsche telekom recently posted results showing a 28 billion euro -lrb- $ 28.29 billion -rrb- corporate loss - the biggest in german history .
ricke 's primary task will be to find ways of cutting the group 's debt to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 50.3 billion -rrb- from 64 billion by the end of next year .
" deutsche telekom 's supervisory board has unanimously elected kai-uwe ricke as the company 's chief executive officer at today 's meeting with effect from november 15 , 2002 , " the company said in its official statement .
the meeting of the telekom group 's supervisory board at 0900 gmt at the company 's central headquarters in bonn approved the appointment of ricke , ending an awkward hunt that had involved speculation and denial surrounding a number of managers from top german companies and others from abroad .
the meeting was also convened to address the group 's unhealthy third quarter figures .
unanimous vote in favour by board hands mantle to ricke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut sihler passes the baton of leadership to the new ceo .
representation at the meeting was made up mostly of employee members who currently command the majority on the board .
shareholder votes were reduced to nine due to the fact that caretaker chief executive helmut sihler 's vote was suspended from affecting the final decision .
in the end , it did n't matter as the motion was carried without hindrance .
sihler took over as caretaker chief in july after former boss ron sommer was ousted after the company 's share price collapse by 90 percent while telekom was under his command .
he will now return to his singular role as member of the board .
the new chief has many hard decisions to make in the coming months if he is to stabilize the corporate ship .
deutsche telekom has been leaking money ever since sommer rubber stamped the 34 billion euro -lrb- $ 34.2 billion -rrb- in takeover of u.s. mobile phone concern voicestream in 2001 , a deal supported by ricke at the time .
t-mobile usa decision raises questions about future ricke 's appointment is seen to be linked with the decision taken by deutsche telekom on wednesday to shelve the idea of an outright sale of voicestream , now known as t-mobile usa , but could still merge it with a rival in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are rough seas ahead for the german telecommunication giant .
if the decision is made to keep t-mobile usa within the group , deutsche telekom will need to find four to seven billion euro to match its self imposed debt target of three times annual core earnings by the end of 2003 .
this would lead to the dividend payment for this year being scrapped , allowing the company to re-cooperate 1.6 billion of badly needed revenue .
however , this would not be enough and deutsche telekom would have to follow this drastic action with more deep cuts in capital expenditure , a measure it has already addressed .
the company released information on thursday stating that it intends to reduce its planned capital expenditure by 6.7 - 7.7 billion euro as its net debt looks set to climb to as high as 52.3 billion euro in 2003 .
previous forecasts put the number at around 50 billion .
action has already been planned according to the announcement that followed the appointment of kai-uwe ricke as ceo .
telekom plans to raise 6.2 - 8.5 billion euro by selling strategic business interests including real estate and cable television amongst others .
whatever steps are taken to steady the good ship telekom , the new man at the helm is likely to be required to make unpopular decisions .

the brain of ulrike meinhof , which has sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years following scientific research , will be buried along with her body in a berlin cemetery . the brain of germany ’ s most well-known postwar urban guerrilla will be laid to rest in the same berlin cemetery her body was buried in 26 years ago . the announcement on thursday by ulrike meinhof ’ s daughter bettina röhl avoided a brewing controversy over the custody of the brain , prompted by an article by röhl herself on nov .
8 .
meinhof was fund hanged in her jail cell where she was awaiting trial in 1976 . meinhof , an accomplished journalist before she turned to violence , was buried in may 1976 in a berlin cemetery .
her brain didn ’ t join her body , a fact that only came to light following röhl ’ s article in the magdeburg volksstimme last week . she wrote that a scientist at the university of tübingen removed her brain from her body to find out why meinhof , a crusading leftist journalist could turn into one of germany ’ s most notorious urban guerrillas . the brain behind baader-meinhof meinhof , 41 when she died , provided the ideological framework behind the most controversial terrorism movement in germany .
the baader-meinhof group , led by meinhof , andreas baader and gudrun ensslin , had its roots in the famous 1968 student movement , which sought to radically alter germany ’ s conservative society and government . it was also the first generation to confront the country ’ s nazi past and sought to weed out the nazis that had take positions in germany ’ s postwar governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an april 7 , 1977 photo showing police officers covering the body of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , killed by raf terrorists the baader group , later called the red army faction , was the radicalized form of that movement .
it terrorized law enforcement with killings and robberies in the early 1970s while working towards their political goals .
in june 1972 , meinhof was captured and arrested by the police and charged with murder in five cases . an unusual journey of the mind four years later , she was found dead in her jail cell .
her brain , röhl wrote , was given to professor jürgen peiffer , a neurologist at the university .
after study , he found that the portion of her brain responsible for emotion was weakened , most likely the result of a brain tumor operation she underwent in 1962 . röhl wrote that her grandmother and father confirmed that meinhof had changed following the operation . peiffer ’ s revelation was an important one .
it proved , that “ ulrike meinhof was because of pathological reasons unfit to stand trial and as a result should have been let free before the baader-meinhof trial . ” but the brain wasn ’ t returned following peiffer ’ s analysis .
he kept it in a plastic container filled with formaldehyde on a shelf until 1997 , when he brought it to a colleague at the university of magdeburg for analysis .
the colleague came to a similar conclusion . since then , wrote röhl , it ’ s been on a shelf in the university .
now , with help from prosecutors , she ’ s getting it back . " you can only say there has been a proper funeral if the brain is buried with the body , ” she wrote last friday .
“ a dead terrorist has a right to be treated fairly and the right to a decent burial .

" the november shipment is the last one , " a senior us official said , speaking on the condition of anonymity .
1994 agreed framework west to supply fuel oil and build 2 nuclear reactors n korea to freeze suspected nuclear weapons programme n korea still has to allow in un weapons inspectors us fears n korea had extracted plutonium for 2 nuclear bombs before 1994 but south korea , which is thought to favour continuing shipments to the impoverished north over the winter , said the subject needed further consultation between the us and its allies .
the shipments , which are sent as aid under a 1994 accord designed to limit north korea 's nuclear ambitions , have been thrown into doubt by pyongyang 's admission last month that it was enriching uranium .
the administration 's announcement puts it at odds with south korea , only hours ahead of a crucial meeting on the issue .
mr bush 's decision came at a meeting with his national security advisers on wednesday .
in contrast , south korea has called for us oil shipments to the impoverished north to continue .
the issue is expected to dominate talks between the members of the korean peninsula energy development organisation -lrb- kedo -rrb- - the us , japan , south korea and the european union - when they meet in new york later on thursday .
1994 agreement the us sends approximately 500,000 tonnes of oil to north korea each year .
the shipment is part of the 1994 deal known as the agreed framework , in which the us promised to provide the country with fuel as well as two nuclear reactors , in return for a freeze on its nuclear weapons programme .
but washington considers that pyongyang nullified the pact , after confessing to a us envoy last month that it was trying to build nuclear weapons with enriched uranium .
there is now almost no support in the us congress for continuing the fuel deliveries , because of the violation of the agreement .
south korea 's fears but both south korea and japan doubt that stopping oil deliveries would persuade north korea to terminate its nuclear weapons programme .
they fear it would instead lead to a revival of an earlier , plutonium-based nuclear programme .
" oil shipments to north korea must continue until january , " said south korean unification minister jeong se-hyun on wednesday .
" i have keenly felt that a hard-line only policy towards north korea would leave us little to manoeuvre , " he said .
meanwhile , north korea has repeated its call for the us to sign a non-aggression pact before it considers scrapping its weapons programme .
" we want the united states to legally guarantee a non-aggression treaty , then our side is ready to address the us security concerns , " the north 's consul-general in hong kong , ri to-sop , told reuters news agency on wednesday .

the change marks the wildfire growth of a market economy in china , and the party wants to make sure the evolution of market forces does not challenge its power base .
the outgoing president , jiang zemin , has been keen to make sure that the party keeps the growing influence of entrepreneurs in china in check .
his theory of who the party stands for - known by the rather awkward name " three represents " , one of which is representing so-called " advanced production forces " - is now enshrined in party doctrine .
that puts mr jiang 's ideas officially on a par with those of mao zedong , the founder of the people 's republic of china , and deng xiaoping , the leader credited with kicking off china 's " socialist capitalism " .
no opposition the change to the charter met , as do most resolutions at the communist party congress , with unanimous approval .
the resolution enshrining the new theory said it was a " powerful weapon " to underpin the " socialist market economy " .
the three represents enabled the party to " keep pace with the times , maintain its progressiveness and exercise state power in the interests of the people " , it continued .
the shift towards allowing more private business in china has been eagerly supported by western governments and businesses keen to find new ways into a massive potential market .
but it also forms part of a two-decade effort to tap the benefits of private business without giving up the party 's iron grip on the country 's political system .
entrepreneurs who make sure they cultivate links with officialdom have been welcomed .
those who have gone off-message , or embarrassed the party in any way , have suffered .

in the first incident , army green goddesses were called to a house in briercliffe , lancashire , at 2220 gmt on wednesday .
an 83-year-old man , who has not been named , was rescued but died en route to burnley general hospital .
in the west midlands , green goddesses were called out to flat fire in halesowen just after 0100 gmt on thursday .
hoax calls a 70-year-old man was rescued from his third floor flat and taken to russell 's hall hospital in dudley but later died .
the cause of the fire is believed to have been electrical .
thousands of armed forces personnel throughout the country spent the night attending emergency call-outs , with some areas hampered by streams of hoax calls and minor arson attacks .
the 48-hour industrial action began when firefighters , demanding a 40 % pay rise , walked out at 1800 gmt on wednesday .
as the strike enters its second day , local authority employers will be meeting to discuss how to break the deadlock .
the fire brigades union has already rejected as " derisory " an offer of 11 % over two years combined with modernisation , but insists it wants a settlement .
tube closure firefighters in oxfordshire crossed the picket line on thursday morning to help rescue a man trapped in a kitchen fire .

the man , believed to have collapsed after being overcome by fumes , was treated at the scene by an ambulance crew .
at teesside airport , one of its own fire engines was first on the scene of a road accident outside in which one person died .
paramedics and an ambulance crew treated four people who were injured , two seriously .
negotiations in london , some tube stations closed and a " handful " of drivers refused to drive trains , apparently because of safety fears .
general secretary of the fire brigades union , andy gilchrist , has accused the bain review - commissioned by the government - of scuppering the talks with local authority employers .
he said the firefighters ' pay claims were neither " unrealistic " nor " unreasonable " and they were not prepared to risk their lives for " £ 6 an hour . "
if agreement can not be reached three other eight-day strikes are planned before christmas .

the discussions on a bilateral agreement are separate from the world trade organisation talks currently under way in sydney and beset by angry protesters .
for years efforts to get a trade deal have foundered on resistance from the us 's powerful farm lobby .
but the need to get key allies on board has been seen as adding urgency to the talks .
earlier this week several us farming lobby groups dropped opposition to a deal .
allowing for the 90-day notice the white house must give the us congress before entering trade negotiations , that means talks could kick off as early as february 2003 .
politics and economics the us is the second-ranking destination , after japan , for australian exports .
the us also provides 20 % of australian imports .
a free trade deal , prime minister john howard said , could boost the economy by more than a $ 4bn -lrb- us $ 2.2bn ; £ 1.4bn -rrb- a year .
among the main sticking points are strong quarantine rules in place in australia , as well as a recent boost to us farming subsidies .
but the us is hoping that it can extract valuable concessions on telecoms and tv market access .
and australia 's role as one of the most vocal backers of president george w bush 's so-called " war on terror " has strengthened its hand .
as many as 90 australians died in the bali bombing last month .
" i see this agreement as a building block to a stronger economic and political relationship , " said robert zoellick , the us trade representative .
