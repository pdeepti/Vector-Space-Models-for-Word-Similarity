the us government - using its preferred weapons of pressure and blackmail and with the humiliating servility of some governments in the region - seeks to execute a new manoeuvre against cuba " communist party daily granma cuba 's human rights record has come under repeated scrutiny at the annual meetings of the un human rights commission in geneva .
but this is the first time a resolution has been sponsored and supported by latin american nations who were formerly cuban allies .
the outcome prompted an angry and indignant response from the authorities in cuba .
it is frequently criticised for repressing freedom of expression and jailing opposition activists .
' judases ' the un resolution , sponsored by uruguay , was supported by 23 votes , with 21 against and nine abstentions .
the motion urged cuba to put as much effort into strengthening human rights as it had into improving social policies and asked the un high commissioner for refugees to send a representative to the island state to monitor its progress .
regional votes those for : argentina , chile , costa rica , guatemala , mexico , peru and uruguay abstained : brazil and ecuador voted against : venezuela and cuba ahead of the vote , cuba called regional states supporting the motion " judases " who lacked the moral authority to judge human rights in other countries .
in the region , only venezuela sided with cuba , its other support coming from asia , the middle east and africa .
an official statement claimed cuba had won a moral victory despite the vote .
cuba also repeated its accusation that the us had pressured countries to vote for the resolution .
" the government of the us - using its preferred weapons of pressure and blackmail and with the humiliating servility of some governments in the region - seeks to execute a new manoeuvre against cuba in geneva " , the communist party daily granma said .
cuba , a one-party state , insists it respects human rights better than most countries by guaranteeing its people broad social services such as free health care and education .
but the un human rights commission has now voted in 10 of the past 11 years to criticise cuba 's human rights record .
the us was unable to vote on the motion this year , having lost its seat on the commission in 2001 .

the resolution , which was sponsored by the european union , called for an end to fighting in the region and asked russia to set up an inquiry into alleged human-rights violations there .
the vote was applauded by delegates the proposal condemned the russian security forces and army for " torture , ill treatment and for the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of military force against civilians " .
it also outlawed all terrorist attacks committed in the republic of chechnya as well as the violations of humanitarian law perpetrated by chechen fighters .
but the 53-member commission meeting in geneva rejected the eu resolution - by just 16 to 15 votes , with a further 22 states abstaining .
the result has broken the traditional voting pattern on russia .
for the last two years , the commission has passed resolutions condemning russia 's human-rights record , making russia the only permanent member of the un security council to be censured for human-rights abuses .
the defeat has disappointed non-governmental organisations like human rights watch , which claims that the vote sends a message to russia that it can now " intimidate the international community into silence " .
