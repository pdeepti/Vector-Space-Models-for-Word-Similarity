that 's what a bbc programme has just done , using a replica of captain cook 's ship , the endeavour .
they spent six weeks sailing part of the route followed by captain cook , on his historic voyage to australia .
for the people of the time , the journey was as tremendous and arduous as a moon-shot would be now .
this morning on breakfast , we talked to the programme 's director - and one of the volunteer crew. click here to watch our interview in full on the ship details forty one volunteers joined 15 working crew on the endeavour - a perfect replica of cook 's original ship - where they get to grips with the rigours of life on an 18th century tall-ship .
also on board were british and australian historians and scientific specialists including a botanist , botanical artist and astronomer .
cook 's voyages had a major impact on the native peoples of australia and new zealand .
their side of the story unfolds on board the endeavour through the aborigine and maori crew members and their exchanges with native people on land and sea .
" the ship is a fresh new concept in the history documentary genre which i believe will make compelling viewing , not only for those already fascinated by history , but also those new to the genre , " says the ship 's bafta award-winning executive producer , laurence rees .
" this is not a case of trying to replicate the past .
it is about how the past can illuminate the present and vice versa .
both the specialists and the volunteer recruits on board learn something new about themselves and about our century , but they also learn about the psychology and the sheer physical hardships of life for the 18th century sailor . "
the ship interweaves drama reconstruction of key moments in captain cook 's original voyage with the 21st century adventure , exploring the similarities , but also the wide gulf between the past and present .

continental 's recall is the largest since the 2000 recall of 6.5 million tyres by its competitor bridgestone / firestone after a series of fatal accidents involving the ford explorer sport utility vehicle .
at the time , neither the tyre maker nor the car maker admitted any wrongdoing and both tried to place the blame on the other in lengthy law suits .
in all , ford voluntarily replaced 13 million tyres on its explorers , in addition to 3.5 million tyres which were replaced by bridgestone / firestone .
threatened image continental tire north america said the cost of the latest recall should reach about $ 20m -lrb- £ 13m -rrb- .
but beyond that , it could add further damage if it dents consumer confidence , both in the tyres and in the cars .
in april , both continental and ford discovered a rise in claims , and the two companies held discussions about this .
the following month , six people died in an accident where a ford expedition fitted with continental general grabber tyres rolled over .
" we have no indication this is related to -lsb- the ford expedition -rsb- design , " a ford spokesman said .
continental said its contitrac aw and general grabber aw tyres have been producing vibrations and noise and they have been wearing irregularly .
in addition , 3,500 bus tyres which were found to wear down fast with heavy use have been withdrawn .

using a mobile has been compared to drink driving the government has confirmed it 's considering banning drivers from using mobile phones , even when they 're stopped at traffic lights or stuck in a jam .
motoring organisations are outraged - but many road safety campaigners argue it 's the only way to prevent serious accidents .
we debated the proposals on breakfast this morning .
and we had a large number of e-mails on the subject too. click here to go straight to our your say page sheila 's son was killed by a motorist using a mobile we talked first to some members of the public .
then we heard from a woman whose son was knocked down and killed by a driver using a mobile phone .
and we also heard from the aa , who are against a ban on mobiles. click here to watch our coverage of the debate on mobile phones sheila bunker 's son was knocked down as he crossed the road , by a motorist using a mobile phone .
" the driver initially said he was n't on his mobile - but when the police checked his phone records , the line was open for twenty minutes , " she told breakfast this morning .
the driver was eventually given nine penalty points on his licence and fined £ 500 .
" my son lost his life .
that man failed to stop even to check .
my son could have been alive .
to me that was a deliberate act , " she told us .
the aa believes that mobile phones are only part of the problem : there should be a review of the whole issue of driver distraction , whether it 's reaching for a sweet while driving or swigging from a bottle of water .
" the best laws are those that self-enforce , like wearing seat belts or not drinking and driving " said the aa 's bert massey .
" the vast majority of people obey those laws without the heavy handedness of the law . "
details the law currently prosecutes motorists using mobiles only if they fail to keep proper control of their vehicle - there is no actual law specifically prohibiting the use of mobiles while driving .
yet research suggests that people using mobile phones behind the wheel are four times more likely to have an accident than other motorists .
the aa say smoking and applying make-up should also be banned the new regulations would also target employers who let their employees use mobiles in company cars .
but the legislation would stop short of banning hands-free phones , which would still be permitted .
consultation will take place over a 12-week period , with motoring organisations and road accident lobby groups among those taking part .
the new offence could leave drivers subject to a £ 30 fixed penalty or a conviction of up to £ 1,000 .
the transport department said it estimated that any changes to regulations could see the issuing of 100,000 fixed penalty notices a year and about 5,000 prosecutions in court a year .
the number of drivers using mobiles has grown from 1.5 % in november 2000 to 2.2 % in april this year , according to the department .
hands-free danger the royal society for the prevention of accidents -lrb- rospa -rrb- is backing efforts to make mobile phone driving a criminal offence .
it says mobile phone bans exist in 35 other countries and should be introduced in the uk .

the government has confirmed it 's considering banning drivers from using mobile phones , even when they 're stopped at traffic lights or stuck in a jam .
motoring organisations are outraged - but many road safety campaigners argue it 's the only way to prevent serious accidents .
we debated the proposals on breakfast this morning .
and we had a large number of e-mails on the subject too .
we talked first to some members of the public .
then we heard from a woman whose son was knocked down and killed by a driver using a mobile phone .
and we also heard from the aa , who are against a ban on mobiles .
sheila bunker 's son was knocked down as he crossed the road , by a motorist using a mobile phone .
" the driver initially said he was n't on his mobile - but when the police checked his phone records , the line was open for twenty minutes , " she told breakfast this morning .
the driver was eventually given nine penalty points on his licence and fined £ 500 .
" my son lost his life .
that man failed to stop even to check .
my son could have been alive .
to me that was a deliberate act , " she told us .
the aa believes that mobile phones are only part of the problem : there should be a review of the whole issue of driver distraction , whether it 's reaching for a sweet while driving or swigging from a bottle of water .
" the best laws are those that self-enforce , like wearing seat belts or not drinking and driving " said the aa 's bert massey .
" the vast majority of people obey those laws without the heavy handedness of the law . "
details the law currently prosecutes motorists using mobiles only if they fail to keep proper control of their vehicle - there is no actual law specifically prohibiting the use of mobiles while driving .
yet research suggests that people using mobile phones behind the wheel are four times more likely to have an accident than other motorists .
the new regulations would also target employers who let their employees use mobiles in company cars .
but the legislation would stop short of banning hands-free phones , which would still be permitted .
consultation will take place over a 12-week period , with motoring organisations and road accident lobby groups among those taking part .
the new offence could leave drivers subject to a £ 30 fixed penalty or a conviction of up to £ 1,000 .
the transport department said it estimated that any changes to regulations could see the issuing of 100,000 fixed penalty notices a year and about 5,000 prosecutions in court a year .
the number of drivers using mobiles has grown from 1.5 % in november 2000 to 2.2 % in april this year , according to the department .
hands-free danger the royal society for the prevention of accidents -lrb- rospa -rrb- is backing efforts to make mobile phone driving a criminal offence .
it says mobile phone bans exist in 35 other countries and should be introduced in the uk .
distance before braking response at 70mph normal driving - 31m drunk-driving - 35m using mobile - 45m at its conference earlier this year the british medical association also called for a ban .
members quoted research carried out in canada which showed a substantial increase in the number of accidents at times when mobile phones were being used .
it also showed little difference in the potential danger of hands-free phones and mobiles .

the peer also said conservative chief executive mark macgregor and strategy director dominic cummings should be sacked .
iain duncan smith needs to clear the squabbling children out of central office lord tebbit lord tebbit 's outburst follows a spate of apparent in-fighting surrounding the controversial sacking of david davis as party chairman .
a split within the party has pitted so-called modernisers - who want to make the tories more inclusive - against traditionalists who want to keep fighting labour on taxation .
writing in the sunday telegraph , lord tebbit warned that the tory leader was being undermined by " spotty youths , researchers , assistants and party apparatchiks " .
' good team ' " iain duncan smith needs to clear the squabbling children out of central office , " lord tebbit writes .
it appears , if anything , to be a battle about personalities lord fowler mr macgregor , ex-leader of the federation of conservative students which was shut down by lord tebbit during his time as party chairman , was singled out for particular criticism .
but lord tebbit also attacked the calibre of staff employed in central office .
he told bbc radio 4 's today programme they were too willing to " gossip to reporters ... with their critical analysis based on two years of experience . "
' virtue of loyalty ' mr duncan smith should get a " higher calibre of more experienced people " in central office and " make it very plain that their job is to obey orders and not go off out criticising people who have appointed them , " lord tebbit said .
dominic cummings insists he is not behind in-fighting " iain , as a former army officer , should know the virtues of loyalty in a chain of command , " he added .
lord tebbit blamed what he called the " loony right " libertarian wing of the party for the in-fighting .
but he said the tories ' current lack of concrete policies meant there was nothing to talk about but factionalism .
' nose-diving ' party former tory minister and party chairman lord fowler called for an end to the internal feuding , which was causing the party " tremendous damage " .
" most of the party are completely puzzled by what is taking place .
" it obviously is n't a battle in the sense of a political battle about causes , it appears , if anything , to be a battle about personalities , " he told bbc radio 4 's the world at one .
he added : " i think that we have n't been able to come out of a nose-dive that we did through the 1990s .
" we lost two elections in a row by massive majorities , we still do n't seem to actually learn the lesson of it . "
' half-pregnant with policies ' but , speaking earlier , tunbridge wells mp archie norman , who is on the modernising wing of the party , denied the conservatives were riven by in-fighting .
we have got to stop boring people about irrelevant issues nicholas soames , conservative mp " in the last year we have seen relatively little factionalism in the party .
with one or two exceptions , it has been at peace with itself . "
but he conceded the lack of firm policies was creating tension .
" at the moment the party is half-pregnant with policies and a lot of people are impatient with that process . "
' intelligent people ' francis maude , another leading figures on the modernising wing of the party , said lord tebbit was plain " wrong " to criticise tory hq .
he said voters wanted " thoughtful intelligent people who seem to be living on the same planet " .
he also defended mr cummings and mr macgregor .
" i think these are good people who are doing a good job . "
' islington weirdos ' he said mr duncan smith was " doing the right things " to revive tory fortunes and should be given time to prove himself .
mr cummings , who joined the tories earlier this year from the anti-euro no campaign , has categorically denied being behind the in-fighting which led to the sacking of david davies as party chairman .
but former minister nicholas soames backed lord tebbit by saying central office was in need of a shake-up .
" iain -lrb- duncan smith -rrb- is a decent , honourable man but central office is full of idiotic minor functionaries who have n't got the foggiest idea how to run a serious party , " mr soames said .
" we have got to stop boring people about irrelevant issues , like how many gay candidates we have , and concentrate on issues that matter to ordinary decent people instead of a few weirdos in islington . "

the news emerged in a filing with the us stock market regulator , the securities and exchange commission , after a meeting between the carrier and its creditors .
in the filing , the carrier said the extra commitments related to operating leases for aircraft with an estimated value of $ 4bn .
in addition , us airways has made commitments to buy aircraft for $ 1.5bn.
deep trouble us airways filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month .
in the bankruptcy filing , there was no mention of the cash commitments .
over the past financial year , the airline is reported to have lost more than $ 2.1bn.
last month , us airways pilots agreed to pay cuts amounting to $ 465m a year , in an effort to keep the company afloat .
the airline recently asked the government to back a $ 1bn loan .
it is also seeking to save $ 1.3bn in annual expenses from its workers , suppliers , lenders and creditors .
failed merger in 2000 , us airways was set to be taken over by ual corporation , owner of united airlines .
but the deal was called off the following year because of indications that regulators would block it and concerns about a slump in the economy .
both airlines have since reported heavy losses , and united has warned that it might face bankruptcy as well .
us airways had said a merger with united was its best chance for remaining profitable in an increasingly competitive industry .
analysts expressed doubt whether the carrier would survive , saying its best prospects were either finding another merger deal or selling itself off in pieces .
a spokesman for the company said : " many analysts in the us have given us very positive feedback about our chapter 11 filing , stating that we could emerge as a much leaner and more formidable competitor .
" the company has adequate cash resources to fund our business during the restructuring period and to fulfil all obligations to our employees , customers and vendors .
we anticipate emergence from chapter 11 in the first quarter of 2003 . "

he said labour was overdrawn by £ 5m and had a £ 5.5m mortgage on its new head office in westminster .
we are about £ 5m overdrawn and we have a £ 5.5m mortgage david triesman mr triesman acknowledged that cash was tight and the party was doing all it could to sort out its finances .
he accepted that a fall in party membership - down to less than 300,000 from more than 400,000 in 1997 - was partly to blame for the shortfall .
cutbacks by the unions , in response to labour 's support for public private partnerships , had also contributed to the rise in debt .
bail out however , earlier this month the unions agreed to give labour £ 100,000 to help cover its summer bills .
delaying last year 's general election by a month because of the foot and mouth crisis is thought to have cost an extra £ 3m .
bernie ecclestone 's £ 1m gift caused trouble for labour mr triesman told bbc radio 4 's westminster hour : " we are about £ 5m overdrawn and we have a £ 5.5m mortgage . "
he said labour 's overdraft had " never been very much over £ 5m " , but stressed : " that is bad enough - do n't get me wrong . "
mr triesman said there was " still some leakage " of party membership , " particularly among people who are not paying us by direct debit " .
likes and dislikes big corporate donors have reportedly been scared away by sleaze scandals , such as the one involving formula one boss , bernie ecclestone , who returned a £ 1m donation to labour after claims he had tried to influence policy .
but the general secretary said : " i do n't think there is any evidence that ordinary members cease to give money on the basis that they do n't like individual donors .
" i can tell you that certainly people are disquieted about it .
" there are people who write in and say they are uncomfortable about it , but that has not changed in any respect the money that comes from individual members of the party . "
triesman : fall in party membership partly responsible for cash flow problems mr triesman defended labour 's decision to accept £ 100,000 from adult magazine publisher richard desmond .
" in the contemporary circumstances , you have to hope that some wealthy people whose values coincide with yours will give you money . "
mr triesman insisted that the party 's spending was normal .
" the ordinary costs of running a party really does require a quite significant amount of money without being wasteful at all , " he said .

daryl john allison was 13 when he shot his friend matthew sheffield in the head on 29 april last year in the garden of his home in croft road , eaglescliffe in stockton-on-tees .
the dead boy 's parents called for tighter controls on the use of air weapons after their son 's killer was convicted on monday .
mark and wendy sheffield said : " this case clearly shows the government should introduce stricter controls over air weapons .
the conviction followed a four-day trial " people may think that air weapons are not dangerous but matthew 's death demonstrates that they are . "
during the four-day trial , a jury at newcastle crown court heard how allison and his older brother trevor got their hands on their father 's airgun after a search in the attic .
matthew and friends simon howard and harry keane went round to the house and joined in playing with the gun .
prosecutor david robson qc said some " increasingly dangerous behaviour began to occur . "
matthew had his cap snatched from his head and it was hung up in the garden as a target .
one shot was fired at the cap , missing it , before matthew went down the garden path to retrieve it .
as he returned , allison shot him - the pellet penetrating his skull just above the eyes .
reports ' essential ' matthew died the following day in hospital after his life-support machine was switched off .
allison , who will be 15 on sunday , was convicted of manslaughter but pleaded not guilty from the outset and an earlier trial jury at teesside crown court failed to reach a verdict .
judge peter fox qc , who lifted an order banning the naming allison , said it was " essential " that pre-sentence reports be compiled before deciding his punishment .
sentencing will take place at a later date .

mr dalyell , the commons ' longest-serving mp , made his call following reports of the palestinian terror mastermind 's death in baghdad .
the mp for linlithgow has led calls for a fresh investigation of the 1988 bombing of pan-am flight 103 over the scottish town , in which 270 people died .
abu nidal 's name has regularly been linked with the atrocity , but no hard evidence has ever been produced to prove his responsibility .
abu nidal : " suicide " last year , libyan agent abdelbaset al-megrahi was jailed for life for the atrocity and his appeal against the verdict was rejected in march .
the verdicts were questioned by mr dalyell .
al megrahi is currently serving a life sentence in a scottish jail .
nidal , 65 , is reported to have committed suicide in baghdad , where he lived under saddam 's protection .
mr dalyell made a formal request to the iraqi government to ask " as a matter of the utmost urgency " if it has any evidence that abu nidal had any connection with the bombing .
the father of the house of commons said : " i have always believed that abu nidal and his organisation were the instruments of that atrocity . "

members of carmarthenshire county council 's planning committee viewed the area to assess the £ 4.5m proposal - which could create about 130 jobs .
it is the main topic of conversation ... people are looking forward to the jobs already jack done , community association member the council is waiting to hear whether the welsh assembly will want to call in the plans for further examination before it reaches a decision on the site 's future .
concerns have been raised over the plans by conservationists who fear there could be a detrimental impact on the environment .
the application includes a 300-pond development on marshy land near the coastal area of pendine .
some fear the project could increase pollution and reduce the natural habitat for protected species in the area .
' well-paid ' however , local community representatives have pledged their full support for the scheme .
chairman of the llanmiloe community association in carmarthenshire , jack done said : " we have lost hundreds of jobs over the last 10 years with the rundown of the ministry of defence testing establishments .
" the 127 jobs are well-paid and they are n't seasonal , which is basically all that is on offer in this community .
" it is the main topic of conversation ... people are looking forward to the jobs already . "
following the site visit carmarthenshire councillors have said they will consider the planning application at the end of the month .
dragon baits limited , based in port talbot , south wales , wants to create ponds to rear ragworms at a 160-acre site .
pollution fears the land adjoins an old weapons testing range , which employed about 800 people until the 1960s .
but opposers claimed the area - adjacent to a site of special scientific interest -lrb- sssi -rrb- - would be adversely affected by the scheme .
they said they feared the ponds could pollute beaches in pendine and the estuary , affecting cockle beds in carmarthen bay .
the company behind the scheme has already developed an aquaculture enterprise at baglan to supply the fishing industry with live bait .
ragworms are used by millions of sea anglers .
they also provide a highly nutritious feed used for fish and shrimp brood stocks in aquaculture .
the proposed facility at pendine would be to rear young ragworms - allowing the firm to expand into the shrimp and prawn feed sector .
the royal society for protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- , the countryside council for wales have raised concerns over the plans .

members of carmarthenshire county council 's planning committee viewed the area to assess the £ 4.5m proposal - which could create about 130 jobs . "
it is the main topic of conversation ... people are looking forward to the jobs already " jack done , community association member the council is waiting to hear whether the welsh assembly will want to call in the plans for further examination before it reaches a decision on the site 's future .
concerns have been raised over the plans by conservationists who fear there could be a detrimental impact on the environment .
the application includes a 300-pond development on marshy land near the coastal area of pendine .
some fear the project could increase pollution and reduce the natural habitat for protected species in the area .
' well-paid ' however , local community representatives have pledged their full support for the scheme .
chairman of the llanmiloe community association in carmarthenshire , jack done said : " we have lost hundreds of jobs over the last 10 years with the rundown of the ministry of defence testing establishments .
" the 127 jobs are well-paid and they are n't seasonal , which is basically all that is on offer in this community .
" it is the main topic of conversation ... people are looking forward to the jobs already . "
following the site visit carmarthenshire councillors have said they will consider the planning application at the end of the month .
dragon baits limited , based in port talbot , south wales , wants to create ponds to rear ragworms at a 160-acre site .
pollution fears the land adjoins an old weapons testing range , which employed about 800 people until the 1960s .
but opposers claimed the area - adjacent to a site of special scientific interest -lrb- sssi -rrb- - would be adversely affected by the scheme .
they said they feared the ponds could pollute beaches in pendine and the estuary , affecting cockle beds in carmarthen bay .
the company behind the scheme has already developed an aquaculture enterprise at baglan to supply the fishing industry with live bait .
ragworms are used by millions of sea anglers .
they also provide a highly nutritious feed used for fish and shrimp brood stocks in aquaculture .
the proposed facility at pendine would be to rear young ragworms - allowing the firm to expand into the shrimp and prawn feed sector .
the royal society for protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- , the countryside council for wales have raised concerns over the plans .

the company wrote down the value of some of its foreign mobile assets , reflecting the poor performance of its third generation mobile phone operations in germany and belgium .
kpn is one of several european telecoms operators which borrowed heavily to buy third generation mobile phone licences , but who have yet to see returns on their investments .
the company has been particularly hard hit by the poor performance of its german subsidiary e-plus , which alone counted for a 6.6bn euro hit on earnings in the second quarter .
future brighter ?
kpn has , however , forecast that it expects its earnings to grow by at least 14 % this year .
" once more , we have been able to revise positively the outlook for the year as a whole , " kpn chief executive ad scheepbouwer said in a statement .
" the write down mainly concerns umts licences and goodwill related to the mobile operators e-plus in germany and base in belgium , " the operator said in a statement .
kpn also had to take a charge for the bankruptcy of its joint venture kpnqwest .
kpn has itself skirted with collapse in the past and has engaged in long process of restructuring , which analysts now hope will start to benefit the company 's bottom line .
it has cut more than 6,000 jobs and has sold some assets to help reduce its debt , expected to be 13.9bn euros by the end of the year .
