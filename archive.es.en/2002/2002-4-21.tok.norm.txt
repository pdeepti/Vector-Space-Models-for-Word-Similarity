a similar visit last year sparked a furious reaction from china and the two koreas , which suffered from japanese aggression and imperialism in the first half of the 20th century .
after careful consideration , i thought i could honestly express my genuine feelings by visiting the shrine today in line with the spring peace festival junichiro koizumi the yasukuni shrine honours the 2.5 million japanese who died in wars , including a number of convicted war criminals .
there had been much debate over whether mr koizumi would repeat last year 's highly controversial visit to the war shrine , which is seen as a potent symbol of japanese militarism .
relations with china and south korea were poisoned for several months afterwards , and japanese liberals accused mr koizumi of trying to stir up nationalist sentiment .
provocative since then , the prime minister has worked hard to repair relations with beijing and seoul .
fourteen war criminals are among those honoured but now , just over a month before japan co-hosts the football world cup with south korea , he has done it again .
before leaving for the shrine to pay his respects to the war dead he said simply that the timing was good .
that is probably a hint that he will not visit the shrine on 15 august for the annual war memorial .
mr koizumi seems to have accepted that that would be unduly provocative .
assertive by going four months early and keeping his visit low-profile , he feels he is making a concession to his critics .
koizumi is only the third japanese prime minister to visit since 1978 clearly mr koizumi is taking a diplomatic gamble .
but he believes that the japanese prime minister has a right to visit the shrine even if it does honour war criminals and there are compelling political reasons as well .
mr koizumi is popular with conservatives for his more assertive foreign and defence policies .
backing down in the face of criticism from china and south korea would make him look weak .

the study for the observer newspaper , suggests 13 million adults - 28 % of the adult population - have used drugs including cannabis and ecstasy .
it also revealed two million people say they took drugs while under the age of 14 and more than half of 16 to 24-year-olds have tried illegal substances .
roger howard , chief executive of drugscope , said the findings did not surprise him .
reclassification " the threat of criminal sanctions is simply not stopping large numbers of young people experimenting with drugs , " he told the paper .
the figures come as the government prepares to significantly relax the laws on cannabis .
the paper claims home secretary david blunkett plans to lay fresh legislation before parliament in june to allow the reclassification of cannabis from class b to class c , a move widely seen as effective decriminalisation .
government officials are quoted as saying two of mr blunkett 's three " tests " for relaxing the laws have been met .
lambeth experiment one hurdle was passed when a report earlier this year from the advisory council on the misuse of drugs came down in favour of the reclassification of cannabis .
another was the success of an experiment by police in lambeth in london , which was well received by the public , under which users have their cannabis seized rather than face prosecution .

the survey suggests more than five million people regularly used cannabis , 2.4 million ecstasy and two million amphetamines and cocaine .
men are twice as likely as women to have taken drugs , with the majority saying cannabis was their drug of choice .

d 'rosario : do citizens want online services ?

mr d 'rosario spent 20 years as a civil servant , first in the treasury and for the last 10 years at the telecommunications agency on major government projects .
fed up with pushing his point internally , mr d 'rosario decided to move into private industry .
nextiraone , formerly alcatel 's e-business arm , works closely with government on its communication projects .
money wasted ?
the government has come in for scathing criticism about its plans to put all services online by 2005 .
head of the national audit office , sir john bourn , said earlier this month that there was " much to do " to realise the full potential of using internet technology .
if you are looking to find out how much your council tax will cost you , it will take a computer-literate person 10 to 15 minutes to get there ken d 'rosario , nextiraone he was concerned that taxpayers ' money was being wasted on delivering electronic services .
another of the government 's private sector partners , novell , has cast doubt on the targets set for e-government and analyst firm forrester published a critical report on the progress of projects .
currently , around 11 % of the population connect with the government online .
mr d 'rosario is adamant that the government will not achieve its target .
" it wo n't and it is already paving the way to admitting that .
it is now hoping to achieve about 70 % but i think even that is optimistic , " he said .
the government says it is still very much on target .
" our projection is to have 99.9 % of services online by the end of 2005 , " said a spokesperson for the office of the e-envoy .
test schemes the government has piloted all sorts of schemes to allow better interaction with the citizen .
an e-voting scheme in liverpool is planned that will let residents register their vote via text messages from a mobile phone .
a self assessment website which allows self-employed citizens to submit their tax forms online has been hailed as an excellent example of using the web .
it has , however , only been used by a tiny percentage of people .
" what people really need is someone to talk them through how to fill in the form , " commented mr d 'rosario .
even the government 's flagship portal , uk online , was failing to connect citizens to the information they want , said mr d 'rosario .
" if you are looking to find out how much your council tax will cost you it will take an it-literate person 10 to 15 minutes to get there , " he said .

but , as bbc news online 's simon pipe reports , some critics say st george 's day is best ignored .
lord baden-powell told his boy scouts they should always be prepared to slay dragons - or words to that effect .
scouting , like england , has moved on since then , but both still look to st george as their patron saint .
the dragon was about to eat a princess on 23 april , the boys remember the scout promise , and nearly everyone else in england quietly forgets all about st george 's day .
in a survey this month , young people said they thought st george was a pub .
the truth is that the old dragon-slayer was not english - he may have been a turk - and he certainly never supped ale in an english tavern .
and england has to share its patron saint with moscow , georgia , aragon , barcelona , bavaria , beirut , czechoslovakia , serbia , lithuania and hungary .
bold charger shockingly , the story of him conquering a dragon with only a spear may not be entirely accurate .
but it was because of that mythical chivalry that a foreign soldier was adopted by england , inspiring leaders from the early kings to the founder of the boy scouts .
the cross is offensive to arabs and muslims , including many from non-arab countries chris doyle , council for the advancement of arab-british understanding " he charged in , did his best , and finally succeeded , " wrote baden-powell .
" this is exactly the way in which a scout should face a difficulty or danger , no matter how great or terrifying it may appear . "
over the centuries , george and his red cross have become associated with many causes - some admirable , others not .
in legend , he was the figurehead of king arthur 's knights .
edward iii chose him as patron when he founded the knights of the garter in 1348 .
red ensign st george 's chapel at windsor castle was built as the order 's spiritual home .
the red cross has been used on the flags of the royal navy and the church of england - and on the official seal of lyme regis .
st george was probably martyred in palestine richard ii ordered every man in his army to wear the cross when he invaded scotland .
now the scots have to fly their invaders ' mark on the union flag .
crucially , it was also the emblem of the crusades against the islam .
richard the lionheart wore it , and legend tells how st george appeared to his knights during the siege of antioch , inspiring them to victory .
centuries have passed since , but the crusades are still a cause of resentment among some muslims .
holy war chris doyle , of the council for the advancement of arab-british understanding , says the red cross is an insensitive reminder of the crusades .
he said : " it is offensive to arabs and muslims , including many from non-arab countries .
what i enjoy and value is that we do n't bother to honour his day professor ronald hutton , bristol university " they see the crusades as christendom launching a brutal holy war against islam .
" because of what has happened in the 20th century , when most of the arab world was colonised , the memory of the crusades has resurfaced . "
on the other hand , the saint - if not his sign - is revered in palestine for his courageous martyrdom .
in england , festivities have come and gone .
snap dragon in the middle ages , st george 's feast was celebrated with grand processions at leicester , reading , chester and king 's lynn .
norwich had giant mock dragons that survive today - all called snap .
a dragon named skip still fights st george but it was all too roman catholic for henry viii , who suppressed the festivities .
" protestantism reacted against everything the medieval church did , " says professor ronald hutton , historian at bristol university .
" he came back with king arthur and the round table in the 19th century , when the victorians revived interest in the age of chivalry . "
today , a number of british army regiments mark 23 april .
it is celebrated outside tewkesbury abbey in gloucestershire with a re-enactment of the dragon slaying .
tewkesbury 's 16-feet-high smoke-breathing dragon is called skip , because most of its components were found in one .
st george 's day celebrations are held at bewdley , worcestershire penrith , cumbria hatfield , hertfordshire lichfield , staffordshire .
but professor hutton , who devotes a chapter to st george in the stations of the sun , his book on traditional customs , is no champion of the cause .
" what i enjoy and value is that we do n't bother to honour his day , " he says .
" it would be a sure sign of a loss of nerve if we did .
" the english do n't need to affirm their identity within the british isles , the way the scots and welsh and irish do . "

as last year drew to a close , a host of companies claimed the battered and bruised tech sector would pick up towards the end of 2002 .
but following this year 's slew of first quarter results , analysts are convinced that it simply will not happen . "
companies are not going to invest in technology until the green shoots of recovery are apparent elsewhere " steve prentice gartner many of the firms themselves are highlighting the seeds of recovery that they see .
intel , for example , is ever hopeful that companies will be keen to upgrade their computers three years after the millennium .
and mobile phone makers continually emphasise the appeal of colour screens and data services as the catalyst for replacement sales .
but such statements - coupled with weak results and warnings of lowered revenue and profit expectations - have a definite air of clutching at straws .
" inevitably , vendors will be talking up whatever signs of a recovery they see , " steve prentice , vice president and director of research at gartner , told bbc news online .
" but it 's not going to happen this year . "
trailing behind some of the vendors have been trying to persuade the world that technology is the way to lift the economic gloom . "
we believe technology is a trailing rather than a leading indicator " steve prentice gartner but many analysts are convinced it is going to be the other way round .
" companies are not going to invest in technology until the green shoots of recovery are apparent elsewhere , " mr prentice said .
" we believe technology is a trailing rather than a leading indicator . "
confessions the trading updates for the first three months of 2002 have been the first real indication of the tech sector 's health so far this year .
the movers and shakers of the industry - microsoft , sap , ibm , nokia , nortel and co - have all lined up to make a progress report , some of them even managing to boost their bottom lines .
but almost all have confessed that the key indicator - how much money big companies are prepared to spend on it - has been disappointing .
and without renewed investment from the big corporate spenders , a true tech sector revival can be ruled out .
time out companies are subconsciously taking a ' gap year ' from it spending , gartner wrote in a recent research note .
it says the firms are suffering from " tech indigestion " where companies have failed to absorb the benefits of the investments made two or three years ago . "
the naivety has not dropped out of this sector yet " sean maher nomura that means they are much less prepared to invest in upgrades , especially against a backdrop of wider economic gloom .
and it leaves the technology firms languishing in somewhat of a void .
part of the problem is that there is no new technology to take the world by storm and lift the whole sector , says nomura 's sean maher .
empty horizon the 1980s was the era of the pc while the 1990s boasted mobile phones .
the horizon is looking pretty empty so far this decade , putting all the emphasis on upgrading existing products rather than investing in anything new . "
people have comfort blankets , and every now and then the comfort blankets catch on fire " sean maher nomura many tech firms have been trying to bridge the gap by concentrating on services .
europe 's largest software giant , sap , managed to offset a continuing fall in license sales with consulting fees .
but analysts know that that 's not a long term solution for the industry .
" clever , but rather sad , " was one analyst 's comment on such a strategy .
telecom transition telecom firms are also stuck in a period of nothingness .
the mobile handset market is already saturated in most developed countries .
but the new generation of wireless technology - which allows mobile users to watch video clips on their handsets - has yet to take off .
" the industry remains in transition , " nokia said , warning of a drop in sales for the rest of the year .
" the speed of this transition has been slower than we anticipated . "
perhaps even more worrying is the growing concern that the new wireless technologies will not be as popular - or profitable - as once presumed .
and that leaves a huge question mark hanging over the telecoms industry as it waits for the new phase to kick in .
chip hopes the chip sector is the one bright spot amongst the wider gloom , and there are definite signs that things are picking up .
initial estimates suggest that worldwide demand for chips grew by about 10-15 % during the first three months of the year . "
i 'm out of the business of predicting " larry ellison oracle but analysts are still cynical , saying the industry is taking its lead from consumer electronics - new items like portable dvd players - which have stayed popular due to strong consumer spending .
and many think a chip recovery is unsustainable without corporate enthusiasm for personal computers .
" the naivety has not dropped out of this sector yet , " mr maher said .
" people have comfort blankets , and every now and then the comfort blankets catch on fire , " he said , sounding a warning note about the reality of a chip sector recovery .
dangerous predictions 2000 was the year of high drama for the technology sector , and 2001 quickly became the horrific year to forget .
2002 is looking increasingly likely to be the year that the tech sector bounces along the bottom .
meanwhile , the bulls are saying the fall was too steep and too fast , while the bears fear a double dip .
" i 'm out of the business of predicting , " oracle 's usually outspoken chief larry ellison said recently .
presumably because technology sector predictions or revival have a nasty habit of not coming true .
