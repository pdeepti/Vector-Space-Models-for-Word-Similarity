on wednesday morning , a spokesman for skyguide , the swiss air traffic controllers body , confirmed that the alarm system used by swiss controllers to prevent collisions was being serviced at the time of the accident .
the system must undergo maintenance occasionally , and this is usually done during hours when there is little air traffic .

monday night , a bashkirian airlines charter jet carrying 71 people , including 52 children , collided with a dhl boeing 757 cargo jet 36,000 feet above lake constance near the german-swiss border .
the children , from the russian republic of bashkortostan , were en route to a two-week beach vacation near barcelona .

the corpses are being delivered to a facility in nearby friedrichshafen for identification .
the surviving families of the children are also starting to arrive at the site .
finger pointing over response time the investigation has spurred recriminations from the german , swiss and russian officials who are all pointing fingers at each other .
the swiss say the 50-second warning given to the russian pilot was sufficient , but the germans say it was hastier than the usual warning .
at a press conference , a spokesman for the german pilots ' association said that five to ten minutes ' warning is normally expected by pilots .
speaking to german public broadcaster ard , flug review -lrb- flight review -rrb- editor-in-chief volker thomalla described the order for the russian plane to change its course as " very short notice . "
foreign investigators given observer status german authorities are cautioning people not to draw hasty conclusions .
german transportation minister kurt bodewig said german investigators would carry out their probe as " precisely " and " quick as possible . "
experts from all of the countries involved in the crash will be given observer status in the investigation - including russia , switzerland , the united states , where the boeing jet was manufactured , and bahrain , the point of origin of the dhl jet .
authorities from the german federal bureau of aircraft accidents investigation -lrb- bfu -rrb- will review the contents of the jets ' four black boxes , which have all been recovered from the scene .
the first data from the study of the flight voice and data recorders is not expected for several days , if not weeks .

" the airliner was equipped with all necessary communication instruments , " said nikolai ogedov , " the pilot was very experienced in international aviation . "
a group of russian aviation experts arrived in friedrichshafen on lake constance tuesday to assist german investigators in the inquiry into the cause of the accident .
swiss aviation authorities say the pilot of the russian plane was ordered to lower altitude about 50 seconds before impact .
the russian pilot took action 25 seconds before the crash .
by then , the internal warning system that was designed to prevent accidents had prompted the boeing to reduce altitude - a move that placed the two planes on a collision course .

on wednesday morning , a spokesman for skyguide , the swiss air traffic controllers body , confirmed that the alarm system used by swiss controllers to prevent collisions was being serviced at the time of the accident .
the system must undergo maintenance occasionally , and this is usually done during hours when there is little air traffic .
at 11:35 p.m.
monday night , a bashkirian airlines charter jet carrying 71 people , including 52 children , collided with a dhl boeing 757 cargo jet 36,000 feet above lake constance near the german-swiss border .
the children , from the russian republic of bashkortostan , were en route to a two-week beach vacation near barcelona .
surviving families arrive in germany so far , workers have recovered 28 bodies from the wreckage , including the two pilots of the dhl plane .
the corpses are being delivered to a facility in nearby friedrichshafen for identification .
the surviving families of the children are also starting to arrive at the site .
finger pointing over response time the investigation has spurred recriminations from the german , swiss and russian officials who are all pointing fingers at each other .
the swiss say the 50-second warning given to the russian pilot was sufficient , but the germans say it was hastier than the usual warning .
at a press conference , a spokesman for the german pilots ' association said that five to ten minutes ' warning is normally expected by pilots .
speaking to german public broadcaster ard , flug review -lrb- flight review -rrb- editor-in-chief volker thomalla described the order for the russian plane to change its course as " very short notice . "
foreign investigators given observer status german authorities are cautioning people not to draw hasty conclusions .
german transportation minister kurt bodewig said german investigators would carry out their probe as " precisely " and " quick as possible . "
experts from all of the countries involved in the crash will be given observer status in the investigation - including russia , switzerland , the united states , where the boeing jet was manufactured , and bahrain , the point of origin of the dhl jet .
authorities from the german federal bureau of aircraft accidents investigation -lrb- bfu -rrb- will review the contents of the jets ' four black boxes , which have all been recovered from the scene .
the first data from the study of the flight voice and data recorders is not expected for several days , if not weeks .
meanwhile , residents along the shores of lake constance , a popular tourist destination surrounded by the alps , turned out tuesday night for a vigil service - a show of sympathy in the aftermath of monday night 's tragic events .
many are all too aware of how narrowly they themselves escaped injury .
indeed , a school and several buildings caught fire after being struck by burning debris monday .
experienced pilots , quality equipment the russian airline whose passengers were casualties in the crash is defending the pilots of the plane , who had logged thousands of hours of flight time , and the safety equipment on board the jet .
" the airliner was equipped with all necessary communication instruments , " said nikolai ogedov , " the pilot was very experienced in international aviation . "
a group of russian aviation experts arrived in friedrichshafen on lake constance tuesday to assist german investigators in the inquiry into the cause of the accident .
swiss aviation authorities say the pilot of the russian plane was ordered to lower altitude about 50 seconds before impact .
the russian pilot took action 25 seconds before the crash .
by then , the internal warning system that was designed to prevent accidents had prompted the boeing to reduce altitude - a move that placed the two planes on a collision course .
schröder : we 're all shaken like the families of victims left behind in russia , german politicians are also mourning the tragedy .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he was " disconcerted " by the collision of the two aircraft .

the system must undergo maintenance occasionally , and this is usually done during hours when there is little air traffic .

monday night , a bashkirian airlines charter jet carrying 71 people , including 52 children , collided with a dhl boeing 757 cargo jet 36,000 feet above lake constance near the german-swiss border .
the children , from the russian republic of bashkortostan , were en route to a two-week beach vacation near barcelona .
surviving families arrive in germany so far , workers have recovered 28 bodies from the wreckage , including the two pilots of the dhl plane .
the corpses are being delivered to a facility in nearby friedrichshafen for identification .
the surviving families of the children are also starting to arrive at the site .
finger pointing over response time the investigation has spurred recriminations from the german , swiss and russian officials who are all pointing fingers at each other .
the swiss say the 50-second warning given to the russian pilot was sufficient , but the germans say it was hastier than the usual warning .
at a press conference , a spokesman for the german pilots ' association said that five to ten minutes ' warning is normally expected by pilots .
speaking to german public broadcaster ard , flug review -lrb- flight review -rrb- editor-in-chief volker thomalla described the order for the russian plane to change its course as " very short notice . "
foreign investigators given observer status german authorities are cautioning people not to draw hasty conclusions .
german transportation minister kurt bodewig said german investigators would carry out their probe as " precisely " and " quick as possible . "
experts from all of the countries involved in the crash will be given observer status in the investigation - including russia , switzerland , the united states , where the boeing jet was manufactured , and bahrain , the point of origin of the dhl jet .
authorities from the german federal bureau of aircraft accidents investigation -lrb- bfu -rrb- will review the contents of the jets ' four black boxes , which have all been recovered from the scene .
the first data from the study of the flight voice and data recorders is not expected for several days , if not weeks .

a group of russian aviation experts arrived in friedrichshafen on lake constance tuesday to assist german investigators in the inquiry into the cause of the accident .
swiss aviation authorities say the pilot of the russian plane was ordered to lower altitude about 50 seconds before impact .
the russian pilot took action 25 seconds before the crash .

monday night , a bashkirian airlines charter jet carrying 71 people , including 52 children , collided with a dhl boeing 757 cargo jet 36,000 feet above lake constance near the german-swiss border .

the swiss say the 50-second warning given to the russian pilot was sufficient , but the germans say it was hastier than the usual warning .
at a press conference , a spokesman for the german pilots ' association said that five to ten minutes ' warning is normally expected by pilots .

a group of russian aviation experts arrived in friedrichshafen on lake constance tuesday to assist german investigators in the inquiry into the cause of the accident .
swiss aviation authorities say the pilot of the russian plane was ordered to lower altitude about 50 seconds before impact .

on wednesday morning , a spokesman for skyguide , the swiss air traffic controllers body , confirmed that the alarm system used by swiss controllers to prevent collisions was being serviced at the time of the accident .
the system must undergo maintenance occasionally , and this is usually done during hours when there is little air traffic .
at 11:35 p.m.
monday night , a bashkirian airlines charter jet carrying 71 people , including 52 children , collided with a dhl boeing 757 cargo jet 36,000 feet above lake constance near the german-swiss border .
the children , from the russian republic of bashkortostan , were en route to a two-week beach vacation near barcelona .
surviving families arrive in germany so far , workers have recovered 28 bodies from the wreckage , including the two pilots of the dhl plane .
the corpses are being delivered to a facility in nearby friedrichshafen for identification .
the surviving families of the children are also starting to arrive at the site .
finger pointing over response time the investigation has spurred recriminations from the german , swiss and russian officials who are all pointing fingers at each other .
the swiss say the 50-second warning given to the russian pilot was sufficient , but the germans say it was hastier than the usual warning .
at a press conference , a spokesman for the german pilots ' association said that five to ten minutes ' warning is normally expected by pilots .
speaking to german public broadcaster ard , flug review -lrb- flight review -rrb- editor-in-chief volker thomalla described the order for the russian plane to change its course as " very short notice . "
foreign investigators given observer status german authorities are cautioning people not to draw hasty conclusions .
german transportation minister kurt bodewig said german investigators would carry out their probe as " precisely " and " quick as possible . "
experts from all of the countries involved in the crash will be given observer status in the investigation - including russia , switzerland , the united states , where the boeing jet was manufactured , and bahrain , the point of origin of the dhl jet .

a group of russian aviation experts arrived in friedrichshafen on lake constance tuesday to assist german investigators in the inquiry into the cause of the accident .
swiss aviation authorities say the pilot of the russian plane was ordered to lower altitude about 50 seconds before impact .
the russian pilot took action 25 seconds before the crash .

six men are taken in for fingerprinting , eight under suspcion of forming a terror cell . hamburg police took six people suspected of being members of an islamic fundamentalist terror cell into custody early wednesday morning and searched buildings they believed housed members of the cell , according to german law enforcement .
police said the federal prosecution 's office had been observing eight men , between the ages of 28 and 51 , since early february .
italian police searched the apartment of an additional suspect living in italy and fingerprinted him , according to hamburg police .
the focus of the investigation was a book store called attawhid , which was near the al quds mosque visited by sept .
11 suicide bombers mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah .
law enforcement and federal prosecutors said the book store had been a focal meeting point for the group , which included men from afghanistan , morocco and egypt .
the men took " conspiratorial and special security measures " to ensure their meetings remained a secret .
the federal prosecutor 's office said they did n't have evidence the group was planning attacks .
officials said they believed one of the eight had " supported " atta , al-shehhi and jarrah , who international investigators say planned and carried out the airline hijackings and attacks on the world trade center and pentagon .

on wednesday morning , a spokesman for skyguide , the swiss air traffic controllers body , confirmed that the alarm system used by swiss controllers to prevent collisions was being serviced at the time of the accident .
the system must undergo maintenance occasionally , and this is usually done during hours when there is little air traffic .
at 11:35 p.m.
monday night , a bashkirian airlines charter jet carrying 71 people , including 52 children , collided with a dhl boeing 757 cargo jet 36,000 feet above lake constance near the german-swiss border .
the children , from the russian republic of bashkortostan , were en route to a two-week beach vacation near barcelona .
surviving families arrive in germany so far , workers have recovered 28 bodies from the wreckage , including the two pilots of the dhl plane .
the corpses are being delivered to a facility in nearby friedrichshafen for identification .
the surviving families of the children are also starting to arrive at the site .
finger pointing over response time the investigation has spurred recriminations from the german , swiss and russian officials who are all pointing fingers at each other .
the swiss say the 50-second warning given to the russian pilot was sufficient , but the germans say it was hastier than the usual warning .
at a press conference , a spokesman for the german pilots ' association said that five to ten minutes ' warning is normally expected by pilots .
speaking to german public broadcaster ard , flug review -lrb- flight review -rrb- editor-in-chief volker thomalla described the order for the russian plane to change its course as " very short notice . "
foreign investigators given observer status german authorities are cautioning people not to draw hasty conclusions .
german transportation minister kurt bodewig said german investigators would carry out their probe as " precisely " and " quick as possible . "
experts from all of the countries involved in the crash will be given observer status in the investigation - including russia , switzerland , the united states , where the boeing jet was manufactured , and bahrain , the point of origin of the dhl jet .
authorities from the german federal bureau of aircraft accidents investigation -lrb- bfu -rrb- will review the contents of the jets ' four black boxes , which have all been recovered from the scene .
the first data from the study of the flight voice and data recorders is not expected for several days , if not weeks .
meanwhile , residents along the shores of lake constance , a popular tourist destination surrounded by the alps , turned out tuesday night for a vigil service - a show of sympathy in the aftermath of monday night 's tragic events .
many are all too aware of how narrowly they themselves escaped injury .
indeed , a school and several buildings caught fire after being struck by burning debris monday .
experienced pilots , quality equipment the russian airline whose passengers were casualties in the crash is defending the pilots of the plane , who had logged thousands of hours of flight time , and the safety equipment on board the jet .
" the airliner was equipped with all necessary communication instruments , " said nikolai ogedov , " the pilot was very experienced in international aviation . "
a group of russian aviation experts arrived in friedrichshafen on lake constance tuesday to assist german investigators in the inquiry into the cause of the accident .
swiss aviation authorities say the pilot of the russian plane was ordered to lower altitude about 50 seconds before impact .
the russian pilot took action 25 seconds before the crash .
by then , the internal warning system that was designed to prevent accidents had prompted the boeing to reduce altitude - a move that placed the two planes on a collision course .
schröder : we 're all shaken like the families of victims left behind in russia , german politicians are also mourning the tragedy .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he was " disconcerted " by the collision of the two aircraft .
he also called for caution in drawing conclusion about the cause of the crash .

on wednesday morning , a spokesman for skyguide , the swiss air traffic controllers body , confirmed that the alarm system used by swiss controllers to prevent collisions was being serviced at the time of the accident .
the system must undergo maintenance occasionally , and this is usually done during hours when there is little air traffic .

monday night , a bashkirian airlines charter jet carrying 71 people , including 52 children , collided with a dhl boeing 757 cargo jet 36,000 feet above lake constance near the german-swiss border .
the children , from the russian republic of bashkortostan , were en route to a two-week beach vacation near barcelona .
surviving families arrive in germany so far , workers have recovered 28 bodies from the wreckage , including the two pilots of the dhl plane .
the corpses are being delivered to a facility in nearby friedrichshafen for identification .
the surviving families of the children are also starting to arrive at the site .
finger pointing over response time the investigation has spurred recriminations from the german , swiss and russian officials who are all pointing fingers at each other .
the swiss say the 50-second warning given to the russian pilot was sufficient , but the germans say it was hastier than the usual warning .
at a press conference , a spokesman for the german pilots ' association said that five to ten minutes ' warning is normally expected by pilots .
speaking to german public broadcaster ard , flug review -lrb- flight review -rrb- editor-in-chief volker thomalla described the order for the russian plane to change its course as " very short notice . "
foreign investigators given observer status german authorities are cautioning people not to draw hasty conclusions .
german transportation minister kurt bodewig said german investigators would carry out their probe as " precisely " and " quick as possible . "
experts from all of the countries involved in the crash will be given observer status in the investigation - including russia , switzerland , the united states , where the boeing jet was manufactured , and bahrain , the point of origin of the dhl jet .
authorities from the german federal bureau of aircraft accidents investigation -lrb- bfu -rrb- will review the contents of the jets ' four black boxes , which have all been recovered from the scene .
the first data from the study of the flight voice and data recorders is not expected for several days , if not weeks .
meanwhile , residents along the shores of lake constance , a popular tourist destination surrounded by the alps , turned out tuesday night for a vigil service - a show of sympathy in the aftermath of monday night 's tragic events .
many are all too aware of how narrowly they themselves escaped injury .
indeed , a school and several buildings caught fire after being struck by burning debris monday .
experienced pilots , quality equipment the russian airline whose passengers were casualties in the crash is defending the pilots of the plane , who had logged thousands of hours of flight time , and the safety equipment on board the jet .
" the airliner was equipped with all necessary communication instruments , " said nikolai ogedov , " the pilot was very experienced in international aviation . "
a group of russian aviation experts arrived in friedrichshafen on lake constance tuesday to assist german investigators in the inquiry into the cause of the accident .
swiss aviation authorities say the pilot of the russian plane was ordered to lower altitude about 50 seconds before impact .
the russian pilot took action 25 seconds before the crash .
by then , the internal warning system that was designed to prevent accidents had prompted the boeing to reduce altitude - a move that placed the two planes on a collision course .

monday night , a bashkirian airlines charter jet carrying 71 people , including 52 children , collided with a dhl boeing 757 cargo jet 36,000 feet above lake constance near the german-swiss border .

on wednesday morning , a spokesman for skyguide , the swiss air traffic controllers body , confirmed that the alarm system used by swiss controllers to prevent collisions was being serviced at the time of the accident .
the system must undergo maintenance occasionally , and this is usually done during hours when there is little air traffic .

monday night , a bashkirian airlines charter jet carrying 71 people , including 52 children , collided with a dhl boeing 757 cargo jet 36,000 feet above lake constance near the german-swiss border .

the corpses are being delivered to a facility in nearby friedrichshafen for identification .
the surviving families of the children are also starting to arrive at the site .
finger pointing over response time the investigation has spurred recriminations from the german , swiss and russian officials who are all pointing fingers at each other .
the swiss say the 50-second warning given to the russian pilot was sufficient , but the germans say it was hastier than the usual warning .
at a press conference , a spokesman for the german pilots ' association said that five to ten minutes ' warning is normally expected by pilots .
speaking to german public broadcaster ard , flug review -lrb- flight review -rrb- editor-in-chief volker thomalla described the order for the russian plane to change its course as " very short notice . "

a group of russian aviation experts arrived in friedrichshafen on lake constance tuesday to assist german investigators in the inquiry into the cause of the accident .
swiss aviation authorities say the pilot of the russian plane was ordered to lower altitude about 50 seconds before impact .
the russian pilot took action 25 seconds before the crash .

under the plan , america and the other four permanent members of the un security council would have the right to veto any prosecution of their soldiers and policemen under the icc , of which washington is not a member .
international criminal court launched on 1 july and due to start work early in 2003 aims to prosecute for atrocities committed anywhere in the world shunned by washington but backed by most un security council members if accepted , the proposal would avoid a threatened halt to the un peacekeeping mission in bosnia .

" they do massive amounts of peacekeeping in the world and do n't want their peacekeepers to be subject to some political prosecution , " he told the uk 's channel four news .
but most of the 14 other permanent and rotating members of the un security council back the new court .
richard dicker , director of the international justice program at human rights watch , described the us compromise as " wholly and completely unacceptable " .
the icc came into being on 1 july and will start its work early next year .

but britain 's ambassador to the un , sir jeremy greenstock , is optimistic that some form of agreement will be reached by the deadline of midnight new york time on wednesday -lrb- 0400 gmt -rrb- .
he said it was " more likely than not " that a solution would be found to suit the us .
british foreign secretary jack straw played down the dispute , saying the impact of the us veto on peacekeeping in bosnia would be " limited " .
' very troubling ' the us has slapped a veto on the renewal of the bosnian mission , which involves over 1,500 un personnel , for another six months .
it fears that us troops serving overseas could be vulnerable to unjustified accusations by america 's enemies before the new court . "
as the united states works to bring peace around the world our diplomats and or soldiers can be dragged into the court " george w bush " as the united states works to bring peace around the world our diplomats and or soldiers can be dragged into the court , " said president george w bush .
" that 's very troubling . "
british prime minister tony blair has described us concerns as " perfectly legitimate " .
" they do massive amounts of peacekeeping in the world and do n't want their peacekeepers to be subject to some political prosecution , " he told the uk 's channel four news .
but most of the 14 other permanent and rotating members of the un security council back the new court .
richard dicker , director of the international justice program at human rights watch , described the us compromise as " wholly and completely unacceptable " .
the icc came into being on 1 july and will start its work early next year .
its aim is to bring to justice those responsible for the worst crimes - genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes - committed anywhere in the world related to this story : us pull-out threats fail to stir bosnians -lrb- 03 jul 02 -pipe- europe -rrb- q & a : the un 's bosnia mission -lrb- 01 jul 02 -pipe- europe -rrb- us peacekeepers ' to stay in bosnia ' -lrb- 01 jul 02 -pipe- americas -rrb- un ' not planning ' bosnia pull-out -lrb- 01 jul 02 -pipe- europe -rrb- us fears persecution -lrb- 01 jul 02 -pipe- americas -rrb- international court opens its doors -lrb- 01 jul 02 -pipe- in depth -rrb- us renounces world court treaty -lrb- 06 may 02 -pipe- americas -rrb- bosnian press voices new uncertainties -lrb- 01 jul 02 -pipe- media reports -rrb- internet links : rome statute of the international criminal court -pipe- us department of state -pipe- united nations -pipe- the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites ^ ^ back to top -pipe- bbc news home -pipe- bbc homepage -pipe- feedback -pipe- ©

mr blunkett , who faced a barrage of opposition after suggesting id cards in the wake of 11 september , is expected to announce a six month consultation process on the proposals .
this will allow the government to test the appetite for the new cards and try to come up with a way to meet critics ' concerns .

"
the brazilian government has reduced room to manoeuvre amid a challenging domestic and external environment " lisa schineller , s & p the ratings cut suggests to investors that lending money to the brazilian government and the country 's industry is now more risky .
this in turn pushes up the cost of taking out loans , hurting the economy .
the government in brasilia has to pay interest on an estimated $ 250bn of debt , and rates are now at their highest level in three years .
on tuesday , brazil 's currency , the real , hit a record low against the us dollar .
with the unemployment rate soaring , the economy stalling and debt levels rising , investors are additionally spooked by the prospect of a victory in october elections of the left-leaning leader of the workers party , lula da silva .
soothing words mr da silva has tried to reassure investors , promising that he would work with the international monetary fund and work to keep debt under control .
however , contradictory statements from his advisers have worried foreign investors .
" lula " , as he mr da silva is known , is the clear front runner in the presidential contest .
but wall street investors hope that the governing party 's candidate , jose serra , can pull through and continue the free market reforms begun by president fernando cardoso .
negative outlook brazil 's debt rating is now four grades below " investment grade " - the rating that is considered to be safe for risk-averse investors .
standard & poor 's is the last of the big ratings agencies to cut back to this level , and topped its move by saying its outlook on brazil was " negative " , suggesting that further cuts could be in the offing .
lisa schineller , analyst with s & p , said her company believed that the brazilian government had " reduced room to manoeuvre amid a challenging domestic and external environment " .

the uk standard is the best approach to pensions accounting " mary keegan asb companies including british airways and bt have said the accounting rule - known as frs17 - has forced them to change their pension schemes .
the new accounting standard was being phased in gradually , with companies having to adopt it fully for accounting periods ending in june .
but now the deadline for the new system has been delayed until 2005 .
less generous businesses do not like the rule because it forces them to report annual changes in the value of their pension funds . "
-lrb- the decision -rrb- should staunch the flow of final salary pension schemes being closed and give us all a breathing space " roger lyons , amicus union this means that when stock markets are falling , the schemes can show big losses , even though payments will not be due for many years or even decades .
as a result many firms have closed their final salary pension schemes , which guarantee workers a set level of income on retirement depending on length of service and final salary .
in place of such schemes , companies are switching to " money purchase " plans under which workers bear the investment risk and their retirement income is uncertain .
no change in heart the uk 's accounting standards board -lrb- asb -rrb- said it was proposing to delay the deadline for the new rule following an announcement from the international accounting standards board -lrb- iasb -rrb- .
it is planning a new international standard for pensions and the asb said it wanted to avoid companies having to change their accounting practices twice .
asb chairman mary keegan said the decision should not be seen as a change of heart .
" this proposal to defer the mandatory full adoption of frs17 reflects no weakening of the asb 's view that the uk standard is the best approach to pensions accounting . "
' breathing space ' the decision was welcomed by both industry and unions .
susan andersen , director of human resources policy at the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- , said it was " good news " .
" we still need to rethink the frs17 standard , which can give the impression of sudden hikes in pension scheme costs , " ms anderson added .
" smoothing asset values over a short period would prevent this and give companies with final salary pension schemes some helpful breathing space . "
roger lyons , general secretary of the union amicus , said : " this is a serious concession and should relieve pressure on firms , allowing them to re-finance their pension schemes over the long term .
" it should staunch the flow of final salary pension schemes being closed and give us all a breathing space . "
but brendan barber , deputy general secretary at the tuc , said he did not think it would stop the closure of final salary schemes .
" employers will simply look for another excuse to make these cuts , " mr barber said .
legal action workers have become increasingly angry at the closure of final salary schemes , and some are reportedly threatening legal action .
the daily telegraph said on wednesday that the big food group , the food retailer previously known as iceland , could be sued over its decision to shut its scheme to existing members .
the paper said 904 of the 4,400 workers in the scheme have formed an action group to sue the company for breach of contract .
contributions gap despite recent warnings that people are not contributing enough towards their retirement income , a new survey has found that fewer than one-in-three britons are paying into a pension scheme .
the study , by the alliance & leicester , found that just 30 % of people contribute to pension schemes , down from 32 % last year .
women were less likely to have a pension than men , with one-in-four paying into a scheme , while 35 % of men did .
it has been estimated that workers in britain need in total to pay an extra £ 27bn a year in order to secure an adequate pension on retirement .

the brazilian government has reduced room to manoeuvre amid a challenging domestic and external environment lisa schineller , s & p the ratings cut suggests to investors that lending money to the brazilian government and the country 's industry is now more risky .
this in turn pushes up the cost of taking out loans , hurting the economy .
the government in brasilia has to pay interest on an estimated $ 250bn of debt , and rates are now at their highest level in three years .
on tuesday , brazil 's currency , the real , hit a record low against the us dollar .
with the unemployment rate soaring , the economy stalling and debt levels rising , investors are additionally spooked by the prospect of a victory in october elections of the left-leaning leader of the workers party , lula da silva .
soothing words presidential candidate lula da silva promises to continue economic reforms mr da silva has tried to reassure investors , promising that he would work with the international monetary fund and work to keep debt under control .
however , contradictory statements from his advisers have worried foreign investors .
" lula " , as he mr da silva is known , is the clear front runner in the presidential contest .
but wall street investors hope that the governing party 's candidate , jose serra , can pull through and continue the free market reforms begun by president fernando cardoso .
negative outlook brazil 's debt rating is now four grades below " investment grade " - the rating that is considered to be safe for risk-averse investors .
standard & poor 's is the last of the big ratings agencies to cut back to this level , and topped its move by saying its outlook on brazil was " negative " , suggesting that further cuts could be in the offing .
lisa schineller , analyst with s & p , said her company believed that the brazilian government had " reduced room to manoeuvre amid a challenging domestic and external environment " .

the research project - which gets under way on wednesday , has been jointly commissioned by mps for the constituencies of aberavon , ogmore , rhondda , merthyr and rhymney , and caerphilly - all areas affected by high unemployment , crime , and drug abuse .
the politicians have asked the bevan foundation think-tank to find out what people in the valleys really want from their elected representatives .
they have said there has been too much focus on rural areas during the past two years and it is now time to look at the needs of the more heavily-populated valley communities .
aberavon mp dr hywel francis said the project would look at people 's visions and aspirations .
the think-tank - originally set up to promote the ideas of health service founder aneurin bevan - will hold community hearings and online discussions to give local people a say .

last month a multi-agency summit was held in rhondda following a string of drug-related deaths .
six people had died in as many weeks , and estimates suggest that as many as 12 people a week in the rhondda cynon taff area overdose on heroin .
similar problems have been witnessed in numerous valleys towns .
islwyn mp don touhig began the proceedings at portcullis house on wednesday , and he will introduce the key areas to be covered .

" the time is ripe for some fresh thinking about the future of valleys communities , " dr winckler said .
" many communities are searching for a role and an identity , but with the right support and facilities they have a bright future .
report back " the bevan foundation will be working closely with the communities on their aspirations , as well as liaising with local authorities , the welsh assembly , wda , and the uk government . "
the study is due to report back in december .
two years ago , a major study by a leading youth charity warned of serious problems with youth deprivation in three areas of south wales .
the report by the prince 's trust named blaenau gwent as one of the worst problem hot-spots in britain .
it also warned that youngsters in caerphilly and merthyr tydfil were seriously disadvantaged .
blaenau gwent was described as one of 12 districts in the uk where young people were least likely to succeed and face a problematic transition from adolescence to adulthood .
the report said that , despite wales 's relatively small population , it had high levels of disadvantage in terms of income , education , and crime .

the 58-year-old chicago millionaire flew into the record books on tuesday when his balloon crossed east of 117 degrees longitude , off the coast of australia , to completely circumnavigate the globe .
mr fossett had some bad weather , but much of the flight was smooth now mr fossett is trying to land his towering balloon , the spirit of freedom , and recent reports suggest that strong winds and dangerous terrain in the australian outback could force him to keep flying overnight and delay his return to earth until thursday .
it is now anyone 's guess just where he will touch down , according to bbc sydney correspondent phil mercer .
his support team has moved from his planned landing site near kalgoorlie in western australia to ceduna on the coast of south australia , but there is speculation he may be forced to land in the northern state of queensland .
" balloon landings are messy , " said joe ritchie , head of mr fossett 's mission control at washington university in st louis , missouri .
" unless you have no wind , you 're going to get dragged . "
sixth time lucky mr fossett 's record-breaking achievement closes the chapter on a personal marathon which began a decade ago .
it is a case of sixth time lucky for mr fossett , who has come close to death in his previous attempts to break the solo circumnavigation record .
he sounded calm when he called his mission control at the finish line , saying simply : " it is a wonderful time for me . "
click here to see a map of the flight " it is hard to describe the feeling that i have now , " the 58-year-old tycoon told a press conference via satellite phone .
" i am just so happy . "
" it has been a long trip and i am really glad to have arrived .
finally after six flights i have succeeded and it is a very satisfying experience . "
mr fossett completed the circumnavigation during darkness , after covering nearly 32,000 kilometres -lrb- 20,000 miles -rrb- around the southern hemisphere .
during the flight in the silvery balloon , mr fossett often hurtled along at speeds up to 322 km / h -lrb- 200 mph -rrb- , at an altitude more familiar to jetliners .
the weather has mostly been kind , though the balloon was caught in a dangerous " yo-yo phenomenon " near the andes when the craft went into a series of uncontrollable leaps and dives .
he faced fewer difficulties than on his previous aborted attempts and still has oxygen to spare .
mr fossett is said to be already planning his next adventure - flying a glider up to the stratosphere 18,288 metres -lrb- 60,000 feet -rrb- above southern new zealand .
he could launch that attempt later this month .
the irrepressible adventurer already holds world records in ballooning , sailing and flying airplanes .
he also swam the english channel in 1985 , was placed 47th in the iditarod dog sled race in 1992 and participated in the 24 hours le mans car race in 1996 .

the company recorded a pre-tax profit of £ 22.2m for the year to 27 april , compared with a loss of £ 13.1m last year .
the company also said it would pay a dividend of one penny a share - its first dividend for two years .
but sales figures since the end of the financial year show business slowing , suggesting that the supermarket 's recovery remains fragile .
sales in stores in the core somerfield chain open at least 12 months fell 1.8 % in the first eight weeks of the new financial year .
meanwhile sales at kwik save stores fell 3.5 % over the same period .
sprucing up the stores somerfield 's chief executive , alan smith , said the weaker sales showed the importance of the company 's store refurbishment programme .
" i think -lsb- the sales slowdown is -rsb- partly the market , certainly the market has been soft in the first eight or nine weeks of the year , and we would expect that to improve slightly as the year goes on , " he told bbc breakfast news .
" in particular we need to get the investment into the stores very quickly and that is why for example we are saying we will be investing in over 100 somerfield stores over the next 11 or 12 months . "
somerfield is currently in the second year of a five-year turnaround which has seen many of its stores getting a face-lift .
the company said £ 50.5m was invested on store revamps last year , with 24 stores undergoing a full refit , and 98 having a minor refit .
it is planning to spend a further £ 75m this year on opening five new stores and refurbishing more than 100 existing stores .
on the london market , shares in somerfield slipped 2p to 112p in early trade .

even though their menstrual cycle may appear normal after cancer treatment , the women may be able to produce fewer eggs than normal .
experts are advising that such women should receive fertility counselling so that they are made fully aware that their reproductive life may be shortened .
dr elisabeth larsen , from the fertility clinic at copenhagen university hospital , denmark , studied 26 long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia -lrb- all -rrb- .
they should not postpone childbearing , and it might be that they should consider becoming mothers before pursuing a career dr elisabeth larsen , copenhagen university hospital she found that they tended to have smaller ovaries with fewer follicles -lrb- the group of cells containing the female egg -rrb- available in each menstrual cycle .
however , the good news was that their ovaries appeared to be functioning normally in all other respects , she told the annual conference of the european society of human reproduction and embryology .
longer term effects she said : " multi-agent chemotherapy has radically increased long-term survival of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia , but the treatment can induce late effects .
" it is well known that a proportion of the patients experience ovarian failure and infertility .
" the new finding is that female childhood cancer survivors with an apparently normal menstrual cycle might have a shortened reproductive span . "
eight of the 26 women who took part in the study became pregnant naturally , resulting in 12 babies , one abortion and two ongoing pregnancies .
one woman , aged 33 , had tried to become pregnant without success for five years , but many of the women were young and 17 of the 26 had not even tried to conceive yet .
reassurance dr larsen said : " although these long-term survivors of childhood leukaemia have an apparently normal ovarian function , our results suggest that the chemotherapy has reduced the numbers of follicles in the ovaries .
" therefore it is important that women who have survived childhood leukaemia should receive careful and individual fertility counselling as their reproductive life may be shortened . "
she said that it was not possible to give a precise estimate of how much shorter the women 's reproductive life might be .
however , she recommends that all female survivors of childhood cancer with normal ovarian function that they should try to have their first child before they are 30 .
" the important message to come from this research is women who have survived all can become pregnant and have babies and they are doing so .

if you were to take a look across the english channel from the continent it might seem a little strange that the uk does not have a national id card system in place .
after all , citizens from 11 out of the 15 nations of the european union carry id cards as a part of everyday life .
in belgium id cards have been in use since 1919 , and in france , where it is not even compulsory to carry them more than 90 % of people do anyway , their usefulness making them almost indispensable .
but putting europe to one side , countries such as japan feel no need to use id cards , while australia and new zealand both came close to introducing them in the 1980s and 1990s , but the politicians backed off after strong public protests .
not even the genuine fear of terrorism after the horrors of the 11 september attacks have convinced politicians in the us that they need to curb their devotion to privacy and personal freedom to bring in what republicans and democrats alike would see as an unacceptable infringement on the rights of the individual .
carrying the card where different countries have opted to carry a card it can often be put down to one of the following reasons .
firstly an id card is often seen as a useful document to the authorities in countries where war , state repression , or military rule is taking place .
in that case they take the role of an internal passport .
it was while facing the nightmare of the second world war that the uk last had a national id card system , which was scrapped by 1952 .
secondly , they are useful in enabling citizens to access government services .
this is the reason why cards have become so ingrained across much of europe .
in eu countries that have id card schemes they can be used for cross border travel to other states within the union .
card curbs but even in nations where cards have been issued by enthusiastic politicians strict limits have still been put in place .
for example in germany the principle of " information self-determination " saw the federal constitutional court rule that although id cards are in use , the public would not be given unique identity numbers that could be accessed by all government departments .
however even in germany research has found that the police are more likely to stop people from ethnic minority groups to check their id cards than the rest of the population .
thus creating more potential for racial harassment and bad feeling between the police and ethnic groups .
ultimately , whether the uk decides to go down the road of entitlement cards or a wider national id card system , the time involved in setting up a system for 60 million people means it will be years before it could become a reality .

a little thing like death wo n't stop the elvis hit machine by james arnold bbc news online business staff to his more zealous fans , elvis presley makes regular appearances in shopping malls all over the world .
now , he 's starting to do it to the rest of us .
elvis merchandising is in full swing the 25th anniversary of the king 's death - 16 august this year - will be accompanied by a marketing barrage unprecedented even by the bombastic standards of the us music industry .
already the most intensively merchandised artist in music history , elvis is branching out into all sorts of new markets this summer , including coffee-table books , an animated cartoon , his beloved cheeseburgers , and even furniture .
there may even be a bit of music along the way , too .
record player at the forefront of the anniversary celebrations this year is something of a surprise - elvis 's first number-one single since 1977 .
a little less conversation , a little more football a little less conversation , an obscure track which failed to chart when it was released in 1968 , was remixed by dutch dj jxl for a nike advertisement .
released as a casual attempt to cash in on world cup fever , the single has gone ballistic in europe , hitting number one in the uk , ireland , norway , the czech republic and half a dozen other countries .
-lrb- in slovenia , for some reason , it only reached number two . -rrb-
the single is now being released in the us , and record company bmg is preparing a compilation album of 30 elvis number ones .
elvis adulation varies by country , but in the uk , he has now officially overtaken the beatles , with 18 number-one hits .
happy anniversary the semi-unexpected success of a little less conversation has persuaded elvis marketers to crank their anniversary plans up a notch .
lilo : a fictional fan for a dead rock star fearing perhaps that the remix might smell too much of football for the us market , elvis has also teamed up with disney to produce a joint-venture cartoon .
lilo & stitch , released on 21 june , features an alien creature and a hawaiian girl who loves to lip-sync to elvis songs .
half-a-dozen of the king 's singles are performed during the film , and it culminates with a trip to graceland , his uber-tacky memphis mansion .
the next step is a series of branded happy meals at mcdonald 's , and free elvis cd-roms distributed by internet giant aol .
at some point this year , there are plans to launch elvis furniture , a surprisingly restrained range of wooden beds , cupboards and chests of drawers .
image problems all this is music to the ears of elvis presley enterprises -lrb- epe -rrb- , the firm created to oversee the rock star 's estate .
the fact that elvis continues to be a more powerful brand dead than most artists ever were alive is testimony to epe 's almost obsessive control .
not a purple satin sheet in sight terrified of seeing the elvis name watered down by sub-standard exploitation , epe has been famously niggardly in its licensing policy .
a little less conversation was elvis 's first release of new material since his death , and epe reportedly rejected hundreds of proposed alternatives .
for critics , this has a sinister side .
in the early 1980s , epe pressured the tennessee legislature to adopt some of strictest copyright protection laws in the world , covering not just elvis 's musical and film works , but anything even remotely pertaining to his image .
rights and wrongs these so-called " rights of publicity " have already been invoked to shut down a string of rivals seeking to piggy-back on the presley name , including a string of elvis impersonators .
beware of imitations at present , epe is locked in battle with jp stacy , an atlanta property magnate , who is planning to construct a rival elvis theme park eight miles from the baroque gates of graceland .
and while " rights of publicity " are a quirk of tennessee law , they could be spreading .
an opinion from the european court of justice in mid-june supported a claim from britain 's arsenal football club that it should be able to control its image .
" this potentially opens the door to every pop star in the business to do the same , " says dominic free , a music industry lawyer at the simkins partnership .
grey market epe has far bigger things to worry about , however .
its most pressing problem is what marketers call its " core demographic " .
i need to get a better agent as the living elvis recedes ever further into the past , his genuine fans are starting to collect their pensions .
elvis himself would have turned 67 this year , and epe is starting to become concerned that his mix of rockabilly , bluegrass , hawaiian and vegas cheese has little to say to the teenage market .
dressing up old songs with remixed backing tracks can help inject some life into the corpse , but the balance of a little less conversation - where the king 's voice is almost drowned out - is telling .
and elvis 's slightly comic image - the product of his jowly , karate-kicking twilight years - will also stand in the way of his reinvention as a credible rock god .
dead or alive but as the world cup summer swelters on , shoppers seem happy enough to buy the dream for now .
whatever their innermost feelings about elvis presley , record-buyers find nothing weird in new releases from long-dead artists .
elvis could teach today 's hepcats a thing or two about swingin ' this year has seen something of a peak , with ex-beatle george harrison and r & b artist aaliyah also scoring posthumous number ones in the uk .
a string of dead singers , including freddie mercury , john lennon , bob marley , jackie wilson and buddy holly , have achieved the same feat .
in a record industry increasingly keen on safe bankable hits , and unwilling to risk investing in new talent , the appeal of rehashing old material is compelling - especially where the artist is dead , so can not misbehave .
to paraphrase another posthumous success story , live fast , die young and hire a ball-breaking executor .

stephan x , usa when the who took the stage at the hollywood bowl nobody knew what was going to happen .
