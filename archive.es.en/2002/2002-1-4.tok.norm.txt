newly-appointed interim president eduardo duhalde is expected to announce a package of emergency economic measures to try to end the country 's four-year recession , blamed for causing the social unrest which has seen argentina go through five presidents in two weeks .
a member of mr duhalde 's economic team told the bbc that argentina was on the edge of a precipice , but that the crisis was also a chance to rebuild .
mr duhalde is struggling to garner support but for millions of ordinary argentines , the emergency measures are likely to mean the economic situation gets worse before it gets better .
" argentina will suffer major changes that are necessary in this time of crisis , " said cordoba provincial governor jose de la sota .
many observers are fearful of the reaction to the measures expected to be announced on friday .
mr duhalde 's newly-appointed economy minister , jorge remes lenicov , is reported to be preparing to end argentina 's policy of pegging its national currency , the peso , at one-to-one to the us dollar .
the peso would then be allowed to fall in value to a target range of 1.30 to 1.40 to the dollar , a devaluation of about 30 % .
it would then be pegged to a basket of currencies including the brazilian real , the japanese yen and the euro .
debt default devaluation would help argentina 's exporters and , in time , the economy .

" it 's very simply , i 'm screwed , " oswaldo hernandez told reuters news agency .
mr hernandez , who owns a small metal shop , explained that his sales were in pesos but his debts in dollars .
bigger businesses were preparing for the new measures , too , amid reports that shops selling imported goods had already hiked prices in anticipation of a more expensive dollar .
some medicines were also reported to be running low as wholesalers held back their stocks , preferring to sell them at higher prices after devaluation .
details of the new economic measures " may arrive " in congress on friday , said incoming treasury secretary oscar lamberto .
some protesters want elections now " the idea would be to work -lsb- on friday -rsb- and saturday , so that the law can be approved before markets open on monday , " he said .
the new measures were being finalised as argentina officially defaulted on its $ 141bn public debt after missing a $ 28m payment on a bond on thursday .
" we are now in default .
the bond payment was not made , " a government source told reuters .
the official default , which followed last month 's suspension of payments , will cut argentina off from fresh international loans .
" the real issue is going to become how private lenders are treated vis a vis multilaterals and the paris club , " hans hume , spokesman of the argentine bondholders committee told the bbc 's world business report .
shares soar ahead of the official default and the anticipated devaluation , argentine citizens continued to invest their cash in shares to protect themselves against a fall in their currency 's purchasing power .
my commitment is to do away with an exhausted economic model president eduardo duhalde the benchmark valmer index rose 5 % on thursday , building further on the 9 % rise on wednesday .
demand for other assets , such as property and jewellery , has also risen sharply due to the devaluation speculation among mr duhalde 's promises is to protect billions of dollars locked in bank accounts since strict limits were put on cash withdrawals in the run-up to and during christmas .
but many people were this week still lining up outside the banks to withdraw their cash .
leap in the dark martin redrado , chief economist at the buenos aires think-tank fundacion capital , said mr duhalde 's economic plan was " a leap into the unknown " .
it was likely to entail a more protectionist approach than his predecessors , mr redrado added .
the president has already commented that the free-market policies have left argentina " without a peso " .
mr duhalde is the second president elected by congress since fernando de la rua resigned on 20 december , forced from office by rioting and looting which left 27 people dead . watch / listen on this story roger nightingale , saracens ' bank " the option is devaluation and i am sure that is the one we are going to see " hans hume , argentine bondholders committee " the real issue is going to become how private lenders are treated " the bbc 's daniel schweimler " those who have money are spending wildly " analysis q & a : why argentina ?

he has said he hopes he can be a calming influence by helping to defuse the tension that has led to india and pakistan being close to war over kashmir .
mr blair is due to meet the indian prime minister , atal behari vajpayee , over the weekend .
mr vajpayee and president musharraf of pakistan are currently in the nepalese capital , kathmandu , for a regional summit , but both sides say they will not use the meeting for face-to-face talks .
mr blair 's visit was planned before the crisis in kashmir brought india and pakistan to the brink of war and threatened to undermine the international coalition against terrorism .
the situation has overshadowed mr blair 's week-long south asia tour , though other pressing issues remain on the agenda .
ahead of flying to india , mr blair and his wife cherie visited a village run by an aid project in bangladesh on friday .
they met women in the village of kelia , west of dhaka , who had been able to buy their own homes , thanks to a cheap loan scheme from the bangladeshi rural advancement committee -lrb- brac -rrb- .
on thursday mr blair appeared close to securing an agreement for bangladeshi troops to eventually join the multi-national force in the afghan capital .
later on friday he will arrive in india where issues like aid and trade will be on the agenda .
eventually he will meet his indian counterpart in delhi where the kashmir conflict is expected to be discussed .
according to the bbc 's political correspondent , john pienaar , mr blair 's officials say he will demonstrate respect for india 's position in the conflict .
restraint " that means soothing indian resentment at the way its great rival has found acceptance in the international community thanks to pakistan 's support for the international coalition against terrorism , while at the same time regarding those india sees as terrorists as freedom fighters , " he added .
british officials have played down any suggestion that mr blair might play a peace-making role in the current confrontation .
but mr blair urged india and pakistan to show calm and restraint on thursday during his visit to the bangladeshi capital of dhaka .
mr blair told journalists travelling with him that he and us president george bush had discussed at length the crisis over kashmir .
' peace ' he said he had no blueprint for peace in the country , but added that he and mr bush believed it a " very serious issue with potentially far reaching and damaging consequences if the tension gets out of hand " .
the leaders of the two nuclear rivals say they are trying to avert war .
speaking from kathmandu , mr vajpayee said : " efforts are being made to avoid war through diplomatic channels . "
pakistan 's president pervez musharraf said his country " wants peace and de-escalation " .
tensions have soared between the two nuclear powers since a gun attack on the indian parliament last month , which india blamed on islamic militants it says have been supported by pakistan .
both sides have massed thousands of troops along their border , with more gunfire traded overnight on thursday .

but despite the deal , the two firms still appear dead set on suing each other for billions of dollars over the breakdown of their $ 8.4bn merger talks .
the northern natural gas pipeline , which runs more than 25,000km and joins the texas gas fields to the mid-west of the us , was one of the main reasons for dynegy 's attempts to buy out enron .
dynegy had put $ 1.5bn into enron in return for which , it claimed , enron had signed away its rights over the pipeline .
but dynegy walked away from the merger talks just days before enron was forced to petition the courts for bankruptcy protection as the scale of its troubles became clearer .
that , said enron , rendered its rights over the pipeline void .
now , though , the two have agreed that dynegy will pay $ 23m to exercise its option over the pipeline - although the date before which enron is allowed to buy it back has been extended to 30 june from 23 may .
that leaves the way clear for the two to get on with suing one another .
under the spotlight enron still stands accused of questionable accounting practices contributing to the company 's downfall , which saw its share price implode from $ 90 to under a dollar in less than a year .

the company gave millions of dollars to the republican party in the 2000 election campaign , and its executives are known to have very close relations with senior bush administration officials .

we may have to actually act to cause -lrb- consumer spending -rrb- to moderate if it does n't happen of its own accord sir edward george , governor , bank of england sir edward george , speaking in an interview with bbc television 's world business report , said spending levels in the medium term were unsustainable .
" consumer demand will have to moderate , " sir edward said .
" i think there 's a good possibility that it will begin to moderate of its own accord , " he continued , adding that when " i say moderate , i do n't mean it falls off a cliff , but it slows down " .
natural slowdown the " most desirable outcome " would be for market forces alone to quell the trend to spend , sir edward said .
" but we may have to actually act to cause it to moderate if it does n't happen of its own accord , and that 's when we will be putting up interest rates , " he said .
the comments represent a clear signal that the bank of england is more concerned about the uk economy growing too fast than of following economies such as those of the us and japan into recession .
they also followed the release on thursday of reports showing strong high street trade in the run-up to christmas , and a renewed surge in house prices .
i do n't know anyone who thinks it would be sensible or sustainable for the uk to join -lsb- the euro -rsb- at this kind of level sir edward george and sir edward 's deputy , mervyn king , warned the financial times of the dangers of a uk economy where the plight of retailers was so out of step with those of the country 's recession-hit manufacturers .
however , in a separate interview with the bbc world service radio 's world business report he said there was a " small chance " that britain could enter recession .
euro considerations he also told the programme that the task ahead for the government , in deciding whether britain adopted the euro would be to determine whether the uk economy was moving in step with those in the eurozone .
while noting that it may be easier for business to operate with just one currency , he promoted an awareness that operating a single interest within several countries would present challenges unless they had achieved " sustainable -lsb- economic -rsb- convergence " .
the euro 's weakness was also a " significant obstacle " to uk adoption of the currency in the short term .
" i do n't know anyone who thinks it would be sensible or sustainable for the uk to join at this kind of level , " sir edward said .
