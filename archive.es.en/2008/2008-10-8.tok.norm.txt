the environment committee said such industries that were vulnerable to a global economic slowdown should pay for only 15 percent of permits in 2013 , rising to 100 percent by 2020 .
avril doyle , the irish conservative member of the eu parliament who led the legislation through the committee , said the decision was taken with an eye on protecting vulnerable industries from competitors in rival countries with more lax emissions trading regulations .
" the crisis in liquidity is not a helpful backdrop , but it does not mean my colleagues or i should drop the ball , " said doyle .
the good news , however , was that eu power generators would be made to pay for all their carbon emissions from 2013 - a " polluter pays " scheme that has pleased green groups .

" troops from five -lrb- of six -rrb- posts are already in south ossetia , and the last column with peacekeepers from the sixth observation post is on its way to tskhinvali , " marat kulakhmetov , commander of russian peacekeeping forces , was quoted by news agency interfax as saying in the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian president dmitry medvedev said all of russia 's forces would quit the security zones extending into georgia from its rebel regions by midnight wednesday .
medvedev shows regard for eu role medvedev hailed the role of eu observers in the post conflict zone , speaking at a summit in the french town of evian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian president has offered his thanks to the eu for its role in the georgia crisis " i want to stress the constructive role of the european union in finding a peaceful option for overcoming the caucasus crisis , " he said .
" when other forces in the world were reluctant or incapable of doing this , it was in the european union that we found a ... responsible and pragmatic partner . "
moscow has until friday under an eu-brokered ceasefire to withdraw from the georgian checkpoints occupied since its brief but violent war with the post-soviet republic in august .
russia honored its word : sarkozy french president nicolas sarkozy paid tribute to the russian president for keeping his word in promising to pull troops out of the georgia proper " buffer zones . "
sarkozy acknowledged " the withdrawal confirmed by president medvedev , who in doing so has kept his word , " in a speech to a conference in eastern france , where he was to hold talks with medvedev .
" both sides must now refrain from any provocation on the ground , " sarkozy added .
the russian withdrawal precedes a peace conference set for oct .
15 in geneva , where the broader issue of georgia 's long-term security is to be debated .
the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy says russia lived up to its word by withdrawing france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday , aug .
12 to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the two breakaway georgian provinces .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow was to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
russia insists it will keep nearly 4,000 troops in each of the separatist zones , a plan which the us , eu and nato have said contravenes the french-brokered ceasefire .
russian president chastises us as his country 's troops rolled out of georgia proper , medvedev said europe 's security system , which was still based around nato and the us , needed an overhaul , as highlighted by russia 's war with georgia .
he proposed a new european security pact that would negate the possibility of any one country having a monopoly on the safety of the continent .
" a desire by the united states to consolidate its global domination led to it missing a historical chance ... to build a truly democratic world order , " medvedev said . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the committee did , however , vote to have carbon emissions cut by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 , with possibly deeper cuts - up to 30 percent - should an international global warming agreement be reached which involves developing countries .
" keeping the 30 percent target alive sends an encouraging signal to our international partners in the run-up to poznan and copenhagen , " said tomas wyns , climate action network europe 's emissions trading senior policy officer , as quoted on can europe 's web site .
" all eyes now are on europe 's environment ministers .
the ball is now in their court .

the votes will likely set the parliament 's agenda in energy and climate negotiations with eu leaders ahead of a final agreement later this year .

the environment committee said such industries that were vulnerable to a global economic slowdown should pay for only 15 percent of permits in 2013 , rising to 100 percent by 2020 .

" the crisis in liquidity is not a helpful backdrop , but it does not mean my colleagues or i should drop the ball , " said doyle .
the good news , however , was that eu power generators would be made to pay for all their carbon emissions from 2013 - a " polluter pays " scheme that has pleased green groups .

the committee did , however , vote to have carbon emissions cut by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 , with possibly deeper cuts - up to 30 percent - should an international global warming agreement be reached which involves developing countries .
" keeping the 30 percent target alive sends an encouraging signal to our international partners in the run-up to poznan and copenhagen , " said tomas wyns , climate action network europe 's emissions trading senior policy officer , as quoted on can europe 's web site .
" all eyes now are on europe 's environment ministers .
the ball is now in their court .
will they show the climate commitment needed by developed countries to make an international deal possible by 2009 ? "
the votes will likely set the parliament 's agenda in energy and climate negotiations with eu leaders ahead of a final agreement later this year .
respite for industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , german environment minister , and other eu leaders will agree on the eu 's climate position late this year but in what green groups have labelled a reprieve for industry , eu sectors such as steel , aluminium and cement have slightly benefited from tuesday 's vote .
the environment committee said such industries that were vulnerable to a global economic slowdown should pay for only 15 percent of permits in 2013 , rising to 100 percent by 2020 .
avril doyle , the irish conservative member of the eu parliament who led the legislation through the committee , said the decision was taken with an eye on protecting vulnerable industries from competitors in rival countries with more lax emissions trading regulations .
" the crisis in liquidity is not a helpful backdrop , but it does not mean my colleagues or i should drop the ball , " said doyle .
the good news , however , was that eu power generators would be made to pay for all their carbon emissions from 2013 - a " polluter pays " scheme that has pleased green groups .
" this was a slap in the face to all the forces that want to weaken eu climate and energy policy , " said sanjeev kumar of environment group wwf . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ecb dropped its interest rate to 3.75 percent . the decision was taken in coordination with central banks in britain , canada sweden , switzerland and the united states , the ecb said in a statement . the banks highlighted in a joint statement that they had cooperated in " unprecedented joint actions such as the provision of liquidity to reduce strains in financial markets " during the crisis . the ecb said " the bank of japan expresses its strong support of these policy actions " although tokyo did not take part in the joint action which followed unprecedented measures taken in washington and london to battle the international financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation did n't look good on wednesday morning " throughout the current financial crisis , central banks have engaged in continuous close consultation and have cooperated in unprecedented joint actions such as the provision of liquidity to reduce strains in financial markets , " the ecb statement said . the cuts followed days of calls for concerted action by economists and world leaders after repeated attempts by central banks to inject liquidity into world markets failed to halt a crisis of confidence . " the central banks of the world have finally woke up to the gravity of the current situation , " charles diebel , the head of interest rates strategy at nomura , told reuters news agency .
" this is a major step to convincing the world that they are serious about stabilizing . " share prices around the world were plunging ahead of the cuts despite britain announcement of a 50 billion pound -lrb- $ 87 billion , 64 billion euro -rrb- partial nationalization of the country 's eight main banks as well as a 200 billion pound credit line extended to banks . brown promotes eu-wide plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain announced a 250 billlion pound bank rescue backage when presenting his country 's bank rescue package , british prime minister gordon brown proposed a " european-wide funding plan " to ease the financial crisis ' effects .
though he did not give details on the proposal immediately , a pan-european bail-out fund was rejected by eu leaders over the weekend . addressing a press conference on the british rescue package , brown said he had spoken earlier wednesday to french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating european union presidency . " countries are tested in difficult times , " brown said .
" these problems certainly started in the united states of america but they are having a big impact on our and on others ' financial systems . " imf : more losses on the way the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- warned on tuesday that us financial sector losses could total $ 1.4 trillion as the housing crisis , adding that the center of the turmoil has yet to reach its peak . banks will go under , and financial institutions will face an " inevitable " restructuring period as they battle to raise the capital needed to bolster their own balance sheets , the imf wrote in its annual financial stability report . france blames us for banking crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde said the us was wrong to allow lehman brothers to fall french finance minister christine lagarde on wednesday traced the start of the global financial meltdown to the united states ' " dramatic " decision allow lehman brothers bank to go under . lehman sought bankruptcy protection last month , after failed talks to find a buyer for the $ 600 billion wall street investment giant .
the us government then decided not to step in and save it . " as far as i am concerned , that was a mistake , " lagarde said , in an interview with rtl radio , complaining that a government bail-out would have reassured markets .
" when you let one domino fall , the others follow . " the collapse of lehman brothers , one of wall street 's most established banks , sparked turmoil on financial markets across the world that has it roots in a wave of loans to us homebuyers with spotty credit histories . once people began to default on the subprime mortgages offered to them by banks , a chain reaction of chaos followed .
housing foreclosures sent home values plunging , and the us housing market fell apart .
meanwhile the loans themselves had been re-packaged as complicated investment products and resold . as banks saw the extent of their investments in these bad debts , they had less money for new loans and their share prices began to fall . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy also proposed a summit meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe to be held at the end of 2009 " to discuss -lrb- russian -rrb- proposals and those of the european union for new concepts of a pan-european defence . "
for his part , medvedev urged the convening of a " special forum " at which " the leaders of all european states and the leaders of key organisations in the euro-atlantic area could take part . "
the object of the forum would be to discuss the new european security treaty , which medvedev first suggested to german chancellor angela merkel in june , and which he elaborated on in evian .
" the euro-atlantic area needs a positive agenda today , " medvedev said .
" the events in the caucasus have merely confirmed the absolute correctness of the idea of a new european security treaty . "
russian proposal for european security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fiercely opposes expansion of nato the russian president said his proposed treaty consisted of five parts , including " a clear affirmation of the inadmissibility of the use of force - or the threat of force - in international relations . "
another clause would assert that " no single state or international organization may have the exclusive right to maintain peace and stability in the region .
this applies fully to russia too . "
sarkozy was receptive to the idea , saying , " we are ready to talk about it with the russians because security in europe and beyond is a common good . "
medvedev also used the occasion to protest against the expansion of nato to near russia 's borders .
" the alliance is moving its military infrastructure right up to our country 's borders , and drawing new ' dividing lines ' in europe , right along our western and southern borders , " he said .
" quite naturally , no matter what is being said , we regard these actions as directed against us . "
however , he said that moscow 's intentions were peaceful .
" we are absolutely not interested in confrontation .
russia 's successful development is possible only in conditions of transparent and equal international relations .
and this is the guarantee of the stability of the world , " medvedev said .

sarkozy also proposed a summit meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe to be held at the end of 2009 " to discuss -lrb- russian -rrb- proposals and those of the european union for new concepts of a pan-european defence . "
for his part , medvedev urged the convening of a " special forum " at which " the leaders of all european states and the leaders of key organisations in the euro-atlantic area could take part . "
the object of the forum would be to discuss the new european security treaty , which medvedev first suggested to german chancellor angela merkel in june , and which he elaborated on in evian .

8 . " our preliminary investigation and reports based on witnesses suggest that the plane belonging to yeti airlines crashed after hitting a higher ground near the airport , " said mohan adhikari , the director general of civil aviation authority of nepal . those killed were 12 germans , including six women , four nepalese and two australians he said .
adhikari corrected earlier reports that two swiss nationals were onboard the plane saying they were mistaken for the australians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lukla airport where the plane crashed is the gateway to nepal 's everest region " only the captain of the aircraft survived and he was airlifted to kathmandu for treatment and was in stable condition , " adhikari said , adding that severe burns were making identifying the victims difficult . the german government was working closely with nepalese authorities to confirm the identities of the germans reported to be onboard , a foreign ministry spokesman told reporters in berlin on wednesday . aviation officials in kathmandu said the plane burst into flames after it crashed and hit the airport sideways .
the afp news agency quoted suraj kunwar , a local journalist , who said the aircraft caught fire after it crash landed on the sloping airstrip . " it took locals and security forces about two hours to put out the fire , " kunwar said .
" officials at the airport here have said that bad weather was the reason for the crash .
there was heavy cloud when the accident occurred . " officials said the weather and visibility were good in the area when the plane took off early in the morning but clouds had moved in by the time of the crash . when the weather is clear , dozens of flights land daily at lukla 's tenzing-hillary airport , the gateway to nepal 's everest region , which is used by thousands of trekkers and mountaineers . the crash is the worst reported in nepal since march when a un-helicopter crashed and killed 10 people in stormy weather in the ramechhap district , east of kathmandu .
in 2002 , 18 people including 13 germans , died when a small plane crashed in bad weather near pokhara town in west nepal .
nine people died in a similar crash in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- sms / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy also proposed a summit meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe to be held at the end of 2009 " to discuss -lrb- russian -rrb- proposals and those of the european union for new concepts of a pan-european defence . "
for his part , medvedev urged the convening of a " special forum " at which " the leaders of all european states and the leaders of key organisations in the euro-atlantic area could take part . "
the object of the forum would be to discuss the new european security treaty , which medvedev first suggested to german chancellor angela merkel in june , and which he elaborated on in evian .
" the euro-atlantic area needs a positive agenda today , " medvedev said .
" the events in the caucasus have merely confirmed the absolute correctness of the idea of a new european security treaty . "
russian proposal for european security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fiercely opposes expansion of nato the russian president said his proposed treaty consisted of five parts , including " a clear affirmation of the inadmissibility of the use of force - or the threat of force - in international relations . "
another clause would assert that " no single state or international organization may have the exclusive right to maintain peace and stability in the region .
this applies fully to russia too . "
sarkozy was receptive to the idea , saying , " we are ready to talk about it with the russians because security in europe and beyond is a common good . "
medvedev also used the occasion to protest against the expansion of nato to near russia 's borders .
" the alliance is moving its military infrastructure right up to our country 's borders , and drawing new ' dividing lines ' in europe , right along our western and southern borders , " he said .
" quite naturally , no matter what is being said , we regard these actions as directed against us . "
however , he said that moscow 's intentions were peaceful .
" we are absolutely not interested in confrontation .
russia 's successful development is possible only in conditions of transparent and equal international relations .
and this is the guarantee of the stability of the world , " medvedev said .

the completed pull-out was later confirmed by georgian and eu officials on the ground .
sarkozy acknowledged the russian pullout as “ a highly important development , ” saying that medvedev had “ kept his word ” and that the move reopened the floor for discussions between russia and the eu .
" the full implementation of the -lrb- georgia peace -rrb- accords ... paves the way for the resumption of negotiations on an ambitious framework agreement " that would " lead the way towards a real human and economic common space , " sarkozy said .
" europe wants a strong russia , " he added , arguing that the world 's current financial turmoil rendered it " essential " for the bloc to have strong ties with russia .
the relationship - frozen by the 27-nation eu last month in protest over the georgia conflict - is up for review at an eu-russia summit in november in the southern french city of nice .

yet zur hausen said he was disappointed in the initial lack of interest from pharmaceutical companies in his team 's findings and the slow pace at which a vaccine was developed .
zur hausen also lamented the high cost of the vaccine , which he said keeps it out of the reach of most poor women .
vaccine cost prohibitive for poor women bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vaccine is " way too expensive , " zur hausen says each year 250,000 women die of cervical cancer , 83 percent of them in developing coutnries , zur hausen said .
yet a vaccine against cervical cancer , available in germany since 2006 , costs 500 euros -lrb- $ 682 -rrb- .
that is " much too expensive , " the scientist told germany 's frankfurter rundschau newspaper in an interview published wednesday , oct .
8 .
but zur hausen said he was hopeful that the price will eventually drop .
" i assume that countries such as india and china will begin producing it themselves and that there will be complete immunization programs in developing countries within a few years , " he told the newspaper .
calls for earlier immunization zur hausen worked as a professor , chairman and scientific director of the management board of the german cancer research center -lrb- dkfz -rrb- in heidelberg up to his retirement .
he shares the award , the highest for medicine , with two french researchers who studied the hiv virus which causes aids .
zur hausen dismissed the notion that regular pap smears make a vaccination unnecessary .
even though cervical cancer is often detected early and can be surgically removed , preventing it is a far better option , zur hausen said .
zur hausen also said he supports giving vaccinations to girls as young as nine .
currently , girls between the ages of 12 and 17 are vaccinated .
zur hausen said he would also advocate extending the age upwards for women who are not sexually active .
he also said that young men should be given the vaccine , since they can transmit the virus . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the movie is a ast-paced account of how a band of left-wing revolutionaries caused mayhem in west germany with a series of politically-motivated assassinations , bombings and kidnappings in the 1970s .

movie " all wrong " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ponto 's widow gave back her award in protest the ponto family is not alone in expressing displeasure with the movie .
the son of chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback , murdered in 1977 , said that he and other relatives had not been informed of the contents of the film .
the movie has been praised by some critics for showing members of the infamous urban guerrilla group founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof as brutal murderers rather than romantic desperadoes .
the movie disrespects ponto 's memory , his daughter corinna ponto told the internet site of the welt newspaper .
everything about the portrayal of juergen ponto 's murder was false , corinna ponto said in the interview .
juergen ponto , chairman of the dresdner bank board of directors , was shot at close range in a botched kidnapping attempt .
his wife , inges ponto , witnessed the shooting .
movie praised for not glorifying the terrorists director uli edel said he aimed to put the record straight by focusing on the carnage and human toll of the baader-meinhof gang , later the red army faction whose bloody exploits claimed dozens of lives .
the film went into general release in germany at the end of september .
it is believed to have been one of the most expensive german films ever made .
germany 's film export board has nominated the movie for the february 2009 oscars as best foreign film of the year and german judges said the work " gave a picture of the 1970s without glorifying " the terrorists . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 . " the ioc intends to retest the samples collected this summer during the olympic games in beijing , " ioc spokeswoman emmanuelle moreau told the german news agency dpa .
" substances that will be tested for across all sports include epo cera . " continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator , a new generation of doping drug that improves blood 's oxygen delivery system . the ioc 's move comes after a series of doping tests carried out on blood samples frozen after this summer 's tour de france came back positive .
german ioc vice-president thomas bach said the string of doping cases in men 's road racing could put the sport 's position as an olympic event at risk . olympic cycling ban possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's anti-doping agency confirmed two of schumacher 's samples were positive " an olympic break must be considered if those involved do n't make a joint effort against doping , " bach told dpa on tueseday .
" the credibility of cycling is at zero .
the riders have not used their chance for change . " the statement came after revelations that german rider stephan schumacher and italy 's leonardo piepoli tested positive for the third generation of the blood booster epo at the tour de france in july . the head of schumacher 's gerolsteiner team , hans-michael holczer , said on monday he was informed by tour boss christian prudhomme that a retest of schumacher 's samples for cera was positive . the german cycling federation bdr and the anti-doping agency nada have launched investigations into the doping claims .
schumacher , who has been linked with performance-enhancing drug use in the past , faces a two-year ban if he is found guilty of a doping offence . suspicious samples retested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more cyclists are being shown to have crossed the doping line retests were conducted on riders who returned abnormally high blood readings during this year 's tour .
seven other riders are reportedly still awaiting their fate . saunier duval 's piepoli and riccardo ricco also tested positive for cera , the french anti-doping agency afld said earlier this week . both men were kicked out of this summer 's tour de france .
piepoli is due to appear at an italian olympic committee hearing on friday , and ricco has been banned for 20 months . along with schumacher , the three riders combined for five stage wins at the 2008 tour , with schumacher winning both time trials . ioc boss jacques rogge told dpa earlier this year that cycling 's place at the olympics was not endangered as long as the sport fought doping in an efficient way . the dosb general secretary michael vesper said that cycling was committing suicide and there were also suggestions that the body would sue schumacher for the money the country spent on him to send him to the olympics . also on tuesday , german state networks ard and zdf were debating whether to continue tour de france broadcasts in the future in the wake of the latest cases .

"
the movie is a ast-paced account of how a band of left-wing revolutionaries caused mayhem in west germany with a series of politically-motivated assassinations , bombings and kidnappings in the 1970s .
ignes ponto was so upset that she sent back her federal cross of merit , germany 's highest civil award .

movie " all wrong " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ponto 's widow gave back her award in protest the ponto family is not alone in expressing displeasure with the movie .
the son of chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback , murdered in 1977 , said that he and other relatives had not been informed of the contents of the film .
the movie has been praised by some critics for showing members of the infamous urban guerrilla group founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof as brutal murderers rather than romantic desperadoes .
the movie disrespects ponto 's memory , his daughter corinna ponto told the internet site of the welt newspaper .
everything about the portrayal of juergen ponto 's murder was false , corinna ponto said in the interview .
juergen ponto , chairman of the dresdner bank board of directors , was shot at close range in a botched kidnapping attempt .
his wife , inges ponto , witnessed the shooting .
movie praised for not glorifying the terrorists director uli edel said he aimed to put the record straight by focusing on the carnage and human toll of the baader-meinhof gang , later the red army faction whose bloody exploits claimed dozens of lives .
the film went into general release in germany at the end of september .
it is believed to have been one of the most expensive german films ever made .
germany 's film export board has nominated the movie for the february 2009 oscars as best foreign film of the year and german judges said the work " gave a picture of the 1970s without glorifying " the terrorists . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 . " our preliminary investigation and reports based on witnesses suggest that the plane belonging to yeti airlines crashed after hitting a higher ground near the airport , " said mohan adhikari , the director general of civil aviation authority of nepal . those killed were 12 germans , including six women , four nepalese and two australians he said .
adhikari corrected earlier reports that two swiss nationals were onboard the plane saying they were mistaken for the australians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lukla airport where the plane crashed is the gateway to nepal 's everest region " only the captain of the aircraft survived and he was airlifted to kathmandu for treatment and was in stable condition , " adhikari said , adding that severe burns were making identifying the victims difficult . the german government was working closely with nepalese authorities to confirm the identities of the germans reported to be onboard , a foreign ministry spokesman told reporters in berlin on wednesday . aviation officials in kathmandu said the plane burst into flames after it crashed and hit the airport sideways .
the afp news agency quoted suraj kunwar , a local journalist , who said the aircraft caught fire after it crash landed on the sloping airstrip . " it took locals and security forces about two hours to put out the fire , " kunwar said .
" officials at the airport here have said that bad weather was the reason for the crash .
there was heavy cloud when the accident occurred . " officials said the weather and visibility were good in the area when the plane took off early in the morning but clouds had moved in by the time of the crash . when the weather is clear , dozens of flights land daily at lukla 's tenzing-hillary airport , the gateway to nepal 's everest region , which is used by thousands of trekkers and mountaineers . the crash is the worst reported in nepal since march when a un-helicopter crashed and killed 10 people in stormy weather in the ramechhap district , east of kathmandu .
in 2002 , 18 people including 13 germans , died when a small plane crashed in bad weather near pokhara town in west nepal .

moscow has until friday under an eu-brokered ceasefire to withdraw from the georgian checkpoints occupied since its brief but violent war with the post-soviet republic in august .
russia honored its word : sarkozy french president nicolas sarkozy paid tribute to the russian president for keeping his word in promising to pull troops out of the georgia proper " buffer zones . "

under the terms of the agreement , moscow was to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
russia insists it will keep nearly 4,000 troops in each of the separatist zones , a plan which the us , eu and nato have said contravenes the french-brokered ceasefire .

the committee did , however , vote to have carbon emissions cut by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 , with possibly deeper cuts - up to 30 percent - should an international global warming agreement be reached which involves developing countries .
" keeping the 30 percent target alive sends an encouraging signal to our international partners in the run-up to poznan and copenhagen , " said tomas wyns , climate action network europe 's emissions trading senior policy officer , as quoted on can europe 's web site .
" all eyes now are on europe 's environment ministers .
the ball is now in their court .
will they show the climate commitment needed by developed countries to make an international deal possible by 2009 ? "
the votes will likely set the parliament 's agenda in energy and climate negotiations with eu leaders ahead of a final agreement later this year .
respite for industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , german environment minister , and other eu leaders will agree on the eu 's climate position late this year but in what green groups have labelled a reprieve for industry , eu sectors such as steel , aluminium and cement have slightly benefited from tuesday 's vote .
the environment committee said such industries that were vulnerable to a global economic slowdown should pay for only 15 percent of permits in 2013 , rising to 100 percent by 2020 .
avril doyle , the irish conservative member of the eu parliament who led the legislation through the committee , said the decision was taken with an eye on protecting vulnerable industries from competitors in rival countries with more lax emissions trading regulations .
" the crisis in liquidity is not a helpful backdrop , but it does not mean my colleagues or i should drop the ball , " said doyle .
the good news , however , was that eu power generators would be made to pay for all their carbon emissions from 2013 - a " polluter pays " scheme that has pleased green groups .
" this was a slap in the face to all the forces that want to weaken eu climate and energy policy , " said sanjeev kumar of environment group wwf . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy says russia lived up to its word by withdrawing france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday , aug .

under the terms of the agreement , moscow was to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
russia insists it will keep nearly 4,000 troops in each of the separatist zones , a plan which the us , eu and nato have said contravenes the french-brokered ceasefire .
russian president chastises us as his country 's troops rolled out of georgia proper , medvedev said europe 's security system , which was still based around nato and the us , needed an overhaul , as highlighted by russia 's war with georgia .
he proposed a new european security pact that would negate the possibility of any one country having a monopoly on the safety of the continent .
" a desire by the united states to consolidate its global domination led to it missing a historical chance ... to build a truly democratic world order , " medvedev said . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mice have long been seen as little more than appetizers for the snakes living in the world 's zoos , but one taiwanese showed it 's capable of more .
zookeepers in stuttgart may want to invite the rodent to germany . a zookeeper had to be rescued in germany when a 12-foot snake began trying to eat her head .
renate klosse was cleaning its cage when the 126-pound -lrb- 57-kilogram -rrb- tiger python named antonia clamped its jaws on her face . she tried to relieve the pressure from its 70 teeth by sticking her thumbs into its jawbone , the sun newspaper reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you wo n't be half so tough when i get a water hose colleagues then sprayed it with hoses until it slithered off at uhldingen zoo near stuttgart .
klosse 's thumb-to-the-jaw technique would have hurt the snake and colleagues ' spraying it with water would have disorientated the creature , python expert jan knoll said . " its jaws opened so wide that it was able to completely cover the woman 's face , " said a police spokeswoman .
" she was in danger of slithering down its gullet . " while renate was treated at the hospital for bites and shocks , antonia had to settle for yet another dinner of mice . mouse : you look like lunch , mr. snake still , the german snake may want to be a bit more thankful next time renate comes in to the clean the cage or the stuttgart zoo 's reptile house may start making the beast work for her dinner like a viper in taiwan . firefighters who found the snake put it in a cage for safekeeping until they could locate a suitable snack and quickly came across a small mouse . but when they tossed a tiny rodent into the enclosure it turned out to be more than the 35-cm snake could handle . " it attacked the snake continuously , biting and scratching it , " a fire department spokesman told apple daily . after a 30-minute battle , the snake was dead and the mouse was left with hardly a scratch . " perhaps it used up its venom when we caught it , and perhaps it was a novice predator , " said fire chief lan sengqiu . whatever the cause of the mouse 's good fortune , the stuttgart zoo 's reptile house may want to get its hands on a few for the first aid kit . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the committee did , however , vote to have carbon emissions cut by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 , with possibly deeper cuts - up to 30 percent - should an international global warming agreement be reached which involves developing countries .
" keeping the 30 percent target alive sends an encouraging signal to our international partners in the run-up to poznan and copenhagen , " said tomas wyns , climate action network europe 's emissions trading senior policy officer , as quoted on can europe 's web site .
" all eyes now are on europe 's environment ministers .
the ball is now in their court .
will they show the climate commitment needed by developed countries to make an international deal possible by 2009 ? "
the votes will likely set the parliament 's agenda in energy and climate negotiations with eu leaders ahead of a final agreement later this year .
respite for industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , german environment minister , and other eu leaders will agree on the eu 's climate position late this year but in what green groups have labelled a reprieve for industry , eu sectors such as steel , aluminium and cement have slightly benefited from tuesday 's vote .
the environment committee said such industries that were vulnerable to a global economic slowdown should pay for only 15 percent of permits in 2013 , rising to 100 percent by 2020 .
avril doyle , the irish conservative member of the eu parliament who led the legislation through the committee , said the decision was taken with an eye on protecting vulnerable industries from competitors in rival countries with more lax emissions trading regulations .
" the crisis in liquidity is not a helpful backdrop , but it does not mean my colleagues or i should drop the ball , " said doyle .
the good news , however , was that eu power generators would be made to pay for all their carbon emissions from 2013 - a " polluter pays " scheme that has pleased green groups .
" this was a slap in the face to all the forces that want to weaken eu climate and energy policy , " said sanjeev kumar of environment group wwf . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the movie is a ast-paced account of how a band of left-wing revolutionaries caused mayhem in west germany with a series of politically-motivated assassinations , bombings and kidnappings in the 1970s .
ignes ponto was so upset that she sent back her federal cross of merit , germany 's highest civil award .
ponto was given the medal in 1988 for founding a society to aid the careers of talented young musicians .

the son of chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback , murdered in 1977 , said that he and other relatives had not been informed of the contents of the film .
the movie has been praised by some critics for showing members of the infamous urban guerrilla group founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof as brutal murderers rather than romantic desperadoes .
the movie disrespects ponto 's memory , his daughter corinna ponto told the internet site of the welt newspaper .
everything about the portrayal of juergen ponto 's murder was false , corinna ponto said in the interview .
juergen ponto , chairman of the dresdner bank board of directors , was shot at close range in a botched kidnapping attempt .
his wife , inges ponto , witnessed the shooting .
movie praised for not glorifying the terrorists director uli edel said he aimed to put the record straight by focusing on the carnage and human toll of the baader-meinhof gang , later the red army faction whose bloody exploits claimed dozens of lives .
the film went into general release in germany at the end of september .
it is believed to have been one of the most expensive german films ever made .
germany 's film export board has nominated the movie for the february 2009 oscars as best foreign film of the year and german judges said the work " gave a picture of the 1970s without glorifying " the terrorists . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy also proposed a summit meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe to be held at the end of 2009 " to discuss -lrb- russian -rrb- proposals and those of the european union for new concepts of a pan-european defence . "
for his part , medvedev urged the convening of a " special forum " at which " the leaders of all european states and the leaders of key organisations in the euro-atlantic area could take part . "
the object of the forum would be to discuss the new european security treaty , which medvedev first suggested to german chancellor angela merkel in june , and which he elaborated on in evian .
" the euro-atlantic area needs a positive agenda today , " medvedev said .
" the events in the caucasus have merely confirmed the absolute correctness of the idea of a new european security treaty . "
russian proposal for european security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fiercely opposes expansion of nato the russian president said his proposed treaty consisted of five parts , including " a clear affirmation of the inadmissibility of the use of force - or the threat of force - in international relations . "
another clause would assert that " no single state or international organization may have the exclusive right to maintain peace and stability in the region .
this applies fully to russia too . "
sarkozy was receptive to the idea , saying , " we are ready to talk about it with the russians because security in europe and beyond is a common good . "
medvedev also used the occasion to protest against the expansion of nato to near russia 's borders .
" the alliance is moving its military infrastructure right up to our country 's borders , and drawing new ' dividing lines ' in europe , right along our western and southern borders , " he said .
" quite naturally , no matter what is being said , we regard these actions as directed against us . "
however , he said that moscow 's intentions were peaceful .
" we are absolutely not interested in confrontation .
russia 's successful development is possible only in conditions of transparent and equal international relations .
and this is the guarantee of the stability of the world , " medvedev said .
georgia pullout honoured bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy recognized russia kept its word on georgia medvedev also used the conference to officially declare the withdrawal of russian troops from two “ buffer zones ” inside georgia proper , two days before a deadline set by an eu-brokered peace deal .
the completed pull-out was later confirmed by georgian and eu officials on the ground .
sarkozy acknowledged the russian pullout as “ a highly important development , ” saying that medvedev had “ kept his word ” and that the move reopened the floor for discussions between russia and the eu .
" the full implementation of the -lrb- georgia peace -rrb- accords ... paves the way for the resumption of negotiations on an ambitious framework agreement " that would " lead the way towards a real human and economic common space , " sarkozy said .

" troops from five -lrb- of six -rrb- posts are already in south ossetia , and the last column with peacekeepers from the sixth observation post is on its way to tskhinvali , " marat kulakhmetov , commander of russian peacekeeping forces , was quoted by news agency interfax as saying in the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian president dmitry medvedev said all of russia 's forces would quit the security zones extending into georgia from its rebel regions by midnight wednesday .
medvedev shows regard for eu role medvedev hailed the role of eu observers in the post conflict zone , speaking at a summit in the french town of evian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian president has offered his thanks to the eu for its role in the georgia crisis " i want to stress the constructive role of the european union in finding a peaceful option for overcoming the caucasus crisis , " he said .
" when other forces in the world were reluctant or incapable of doing this , it was in the european union that we found a ... responsible and pragmatic partner . "
moscow has until friday under an eu-brokered ceasefire to withdraw from the georgian checkpoints occupied since its brief but violent war with the post-soviet republic in august .
russia honored its word : sarkozy french president nicolas sarkozy paid tribute to the russian president for keeping his word in promising to pull troops out of the georgia proper " buffer zones . "
sarkozy acknowledged " the withdrawal confirmed by president medvedev , who in doing so has kept his word , " in a speech to a conference in eastern france , where he was to hold talks with medvedev .
" both sides must now refrain from any provocation on the ground , " sarkozy added .
the russian withdrawal precedes a peace conference set for oct .

the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy says russia lived up to its word by withdrawing france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday , aug .
12 to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the two breakaway georgian provinces .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow was to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
russia insists it will keep nearly 4,000 troops in each of the separatist zones , a plan which the us , eu and nato have said contravenes the french-brokered ceasefire .
russian president chastises us as his country 's troops rolled out of georgia proper , medvedev said europe 's security system , which was still based around nato and the us , needed an overhaul , as highlighted by russia 's war with georgia .
he proposed a new european security pact that would negate the possibility of any one country having a monopoly on the safety of the continent .
" a desire by the united states to consolidate its global domination led to it missing a historical chance ... to build a truly democratic world order , " medvedev said . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

china , the european central bank and central banks in britain , canada , sweden and switzerland also cut rates in the coordinated response that analysts had been demanding .
the ecb dropped its interest rate to 3.75 percent . the decision was taken in coordination with central banks in britain , canada sweden , switzerland and the united states , the ecb said in a statement . the banks highlighted in a joint statement that they had cooperated in " unprecedented joint actions such as the provision of liquidity to reduce strains in financial markets " during the crisis . the ecb said " the bank of japan expresses its strong support of these policy actions " although tokyo did not take part in the joint action which followed unprecedented measures taken in washington and london to battle the international financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation did n't look good on wednesday morning " throughout the current financial crisis , central banks have engaged in continuous close consultation and have cooperated in unprecedented joint actions such as the provision of liquidity to reduce strains in financial markets , " the ecb statement said . the cuts followed days of calls for concerted action by economists and world leaders after repeated attempts by central banks to inject liquidity into world markets failed to halt a crisis of confidence . " the central banks of the world have finally woke up to the gravity of the current situation , " charles diebel , the head of interest rates strategy at nomura , told reuters news agency .
" this is a major step to convincing the world that they are serious about stabilizing .

though he did not give details on the proposal immediately , a pan-european bail-out fund was rejected by eu leaders over the weekend . addressing a press conference on the british rescue package , brown said he had spoken earlier wednesday to french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating european union presidency . " countries are tested in difficult times , " brown said .

" imf : more losses on the way the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- warned on tuesday that us financial sector losses could total $ 1.4 trillion as the housing crisis , adding that the center of the turmoil has yet to reach its peak . banks will go under , and financial institutions will face an " inevitable " restructuring period as they battle to raise the capital needed to bolster their own balance sheets , the imf wrote in its annual financial stability report . france blames us for banking crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde said the us was wrong to allow lehman brothers to fall french finance minister christine lagarde on wednesday traced the start of the global financial meltdown to the united states ' " dramatic " decision allow lehman brothers bank to go under . lehman sought bankruptcy protection last month , after failed talks to find a buyer for the $ 600 billion wall street investment giant .
the us government then decided not to step in and save it . " as far as i am concerned , that was a mistake , " lagarde said , in an interview with rtl radio , complaining that a government bail-out would have reassured markets .
" when you let one domino fall , the others follow . " the collapse of lehman brothers , one of wall street 's most established banks , sparked turmoil on financial markets across the world that has it roots in a wave of loans to us homebuyers with spotty credit histories . once people began to default on the subprime mortgages offered to them by banks , a chain reaction of chaos followed .
housing foreclosures sent home values plunging , and the us housing market fell apart .
meanwhile the loans themselves had been re-packaged as complicated investment products and resold . as banks saw the extent of their investments in these bad debts , they had less money for new loans and their share prices began to fall . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet zur hausen said he was disappointed in the initial lack of interest from pharmaceutical companies in his team 's findings and the slow pace at which a vaccine was developed .
zur hausen also lamented the high cost of the vaccine , which he said keeps it out of the reach of most poor women .
vaccine cost prohibitive for poor women bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vaccine is " way too expensive , " zur hausen says each year 250,000 women die of cervical cancer , 83 percent of them in developing coutnries , zur hausen said .
yet a vaccine against cervical cancer , available in germany since 2006 , costs 500 euros -lrb- $ 682 -rrb- .
that is " much too expensive , " the scientist told germany 's frankfurter rundschau newspaper in an interview published wednesday , oct .

but zur hausen said he was hopeful that the price will eventually drop .

8 . " our preliminary investigation and reports based on witnesses suggest that the plane belonging to yeti airlines crashed after hitting a higher ground near the airport , " said mohan adhikari , the director general of civil aviation authority of nepal . those killed were 12 germans , including six women , four nepalese and two australians he said .
adhikari corrected earlier reports that two swiss nationals were onboard the plane saying they were mistaken for the australians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lukla airport where the plane crashed is the gateway to nepal 's everest region " only the captain of the aircraft survived and he was airlifted to kathmandu for treatment and was in stable condition , " adhikari said , adding that severe burns were making identifying the victims difficult . the german government was working closely with nepalese authorities to confirm the identities of the germans reported to be onboard , a foreign ministry spokesman told reporters in berlin on wednesday . aviation officials in kathmandu said the plane burst into flames after it crashed and hit the airport sideways .
the afp news agency quoted suraj kunwar , a local journalist , who said the aircraft caught fire after it crash landed on the sloping airstrip . " it took locals and security forces about two hours to put out the fire , " kunwar said .
" officials at the airport here have said that bad weather was the reason for the crash .
there was heavy cloud when the accident occurred .

sarkozy also proposed a summit meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe to be held at the end of 2009 " to discuss -lrb- russian -rrb- proposals and those of the european union for new concepts of a pan-european defence . "
for his part , medvedev urged the convening of a " special forum " at which " the leaders of all european states and the leaders of key organisations in the euro-atlantic area could take part . "
the object of the forum would be to discuss the new european security treaty , which medvedev first suggested to german chancellor angela merkel in june , and which he elaborated on in evian .
" the euro-atlantic area needs a positive agenda today , " medvedev said .
" the events in the caucasus have merely confirmed the absolute correctness of the idea of a new european security treaty . "
russian proposal for european security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fiercely opposes expansion of nato the russian president said his proposed treaty consisted of five parts , including " a clear affirmation of the inadmissibility of the use of force - or the threat of force - in international relations . "
another clause would assert that " no single state or international organization may have the exclusive right to maintain peace and stability in the region .
this applies fully to russia too . "
sarkozy was receptive to the idea , saying , " we are ready to talk about it with the russians because security in europe and beyond is a common good . "
medvedev also used the occasion to protest against the expansion of nato to near russia 's borders .
" the alliance is moving its military infrastructure right up to our country 's borders , and drawing new ' dividing lines ' in europe , right along our western and southern borders , " he said .
" quite naturally , no matter what is being said , we regard these actions as directed against us . "
however , he said that moscow 's intentions were peaceful .
" we are absolutely not interested in confrontation .
russia 's successful development is possible only in conditions of transparent and equal international relations .
and this is the guarantee of the stability of the world , " medvedev said .
georgia pullout honoured bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy recognized russia kept its word on georgia medvedev also used the conference to officially declare the withdrawal of russian troops from two “ buffer zones ” inside georgia proper , two days before a deadline set by an eu-brokered peace deal .
the completed pull-out was later confirmed by georgian and eu officials on the ground .
sarkozy acknowledged the russian pullout as “ a highly important development , ” saying that medvedev had “ kept his word ” and that the move reopened the floor for discussions between russia and the eu .
" the full implementation of the -lrb- georgia peace -rrb- accords ... paves the way for the resumption of negotiations on an ambitious framework agreement " that would " lead the way towards a real human and economic common space , " sarkozy said .
" europe wants a strong russia , " he added , arguing that the world 's current financial turmoil rendered it " essential " for the bloc to have strong ties with russia .
the relationship - frozen by the 27-nation eu last month in protest over the georgia conflict - is up for review at an eu-russia summit in november in the southern french city of nice .
in a united nations speech last month , sarkozy called for a common economic space uniting europe and russia . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy also proposed a summit meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe to be held at the end of 2009 " to discuss -lrb- russian -rrb- proposals and those of the european union for new concepts of a pan-european defence . "
for his part , medvedev urged the convening of a " special forum " at which " the leaders of all european states and the leaders of key organisations in the euro-atlantic area could take part . "
the object of the forum would be to discuss the new european security treaty , which medvedev first suggested to german chancellor angela merkel in june , and which he elaborated on in evian .
" the euro-atlantic area needs a positive agenda today , " medvedev said .
" the events in the caucasus have merely confirmed the absolute correctness of the idea of a new european security treaty . "
russian proposal for european security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fiercely opposes expansion of nato the russian president said his proposed treaty consisted of five parts , including " a clear affirmation of the inadmissibility of the use of force - or the threat of force - in international relations . "
another clause would assert that " no single state or international organization may have the exclusive right to maintain peace and stability in the region .
this applies fully to russia too . "
sarkozy was receptive to the idea , saying , " we are ready to talk about it with the russians because security in europe and beyond is a common good . "
medvedev also used the occasion to protest against the expansion of nato to near russia 's borders .
" the alliance is moving its military infrastructure right up to our country 's borders , and drawing new ' dividing lines ' in europe , right along our western and southern borders , " he said .
" quite naturally , no matter what is being said , we regard these actions as directed against us . "
however , he said that moscow 's intentions were peaceful .
" we are absolutely not interested in confrontation .
russia 's successful development is possible only in conditions of transparent and equal international relations .
and this is the guarantee of the stability of the world , " medvedev said .
georgia pullout honoured bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy recognized russia kept its word on georgia medvedev also used the conference to officially declare the withdrawal of russian troops from two “ buffer zones ” inside georgia proper , two days before a deadline set by an eu-brokered peace deal .
the completed pull-out was later confirmed by georgian and eu officials on the ground .
sarkozy acknowledged the russian pullout as “ a highly important development , ” saying that medvedev had “ kept his word ” and that the move reopened the floor for discussions between russia and the eu .
" the full implementation of the -lrb- georgia peace -rrb- accords ... paves the way for the resumption of negotiations on an ambitious framework agreement " that would " lead the way towards a real human and economic common space , " sarkozy said .
" europe wants a strong russia , " he added , arguing that the world 's current financial turmoil rendered it " essential " for the bloc to have strong ties with russia .
the relationship - frozen by the 27-nation eu last month in protest over the georgia conflict - is up for review at an eu-russia summit in november in the southern french city of nice .

sarkozy also proposed a summit meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe to be held at the end of 2009 " to discuss -lrb- russian -rrb- proposals and those of the european union for new concepts of a pan-european defence . "
for his part , medvedev urged the convening of a " special forum " at which " the leaders of all european states and the leaders of key organisations in the euro-atlantic area could take part . "
the object of the forum would be to discuss the new european security treaty , which medvedev first suggested to german chancellor angela merkel in june , and which he elaborated on in evian .
" the euro-atlantic area needs a positive agenda today , " medvedev said .
" the events in the caucasus have merely confirmed the absolute correctness of the idea of a new european security treaty . "
russian proposal for european security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fiercely opposes expansion of nato the russian president said his proposed treaty consisted of five parts , including " a clear affirmation of the inadmissibility of the use of force - or the threat of force - in international relations . "
another clause would assert that " no single state or international organization may have the exclusive right to maintain peace and stability in the region .
this applies fully to russia too . "
sarkozy was receptive to the idea , saying , " we are ready to talk about it with the russians because security in europe and beyond is a common good . "
medvedev also used the occasion to protest against the expansion of nato to near russia 's borders .
" the alliance is moving its military infrastructure right up to our country 's borders , and drawing new ' dividing lines ' in europe , right along our western and southern borders , " he said .
" quite naturally , no matter what is being said , we regard these actions as directed against us . "
however , he said that moscow 's intentions were peaceful .
" we are absolutely not interested in confrontation .
russia 's successful development is possible only in conditions of transparent and equal international relations .
and this is the guarantee of the stability of the world , " medvedev said .
georgia pullout honoured bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy recognized russia kept its word on georgia medvedev also used the conference to officially declare the withdrawal of russian troops from two “ buffer zones ” inside georgia proper , two days before a deadline set by an eu-brokered peace deal .
the completed pull-out was later confirmed by georgian and eu officials on the ground .
sarkozy acknowledged the russian pullout as “ a highly important development , ” saying that medvedev had “ kept his word ” and that the move reopened the floor for discussions between russia and the eu .
" the full implementation of the -lrb- georgia peace -rrb- accords ... paves the way for the resumption of negotiations on an ambitious framework agreement " that would " lead the way towards a real human and economic common space , " sarkozy said .
" europe wants a strong russia , " he added , arguing that the world 's current financial turmoil rendered it " essential " for the bloc to have strong ties with russia .
the relationship - frozen by the 27-nation eu last month in protest over the georgia conflict - is up for review at an eu-russia summit in november in the southern french city of nice .

mice have long been seen as little more than appetizers for the snakes living in the world 's zoos , but one taiwanese showed it 's capable of more .
zookeepers in stuttgart may want to invite the rodent to germany . a zookeeper had to be rescued in germany when a 12-foot snake began trying to eat her head .
renate klosse was cleaning its cage when the 126-pound -lrb- 57-kilogram -rrb- tiger python named antonia clamped its jaws on her face . she tried to relieve the pressure from its 70 teeth by sticking her thumbs into its jawbone , the sun newspaper reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you wo n't be half so tough when i get a water hose colleagues then sprayed it with hoses until it slithered off at uhldingen zoo near stuttgart .
klosse 's thumb-to-the-jaw technique would have hurt the snake and colleagues ' spraying it with water would have disorientated the creature , python expert jan knoll said . " its jaws opened so wide that it was able to completely cover the woman 's face , " said a police spokeswoman .
" she was in danger of slithering down its gullet . " while renate was treated at the hospital for bites and shocks , antonia had to settle for yet another dinner of mice . mouse : you look like lunch , mr. snake still , the german snake may want to be a bit more thankful next time renate comes in to the clean the cage or the stuttgart zoo 's reptile house may start making the beast work for her dinner like a viper in taiwan . firefighters who found the snake put it in a cage for safekeeping until they could locate a suitable snack and quickly came across a small mouse . but when they tossed a tiny rodent into the enclosure it turned out to be more than the 35-cm snake could handle .

" troops from five -lrb- of six -rrb- posts are already in south ossetia , and the last column with peacekeepers from the sixth observation post is on its way to tskhinvali , " marat kulakhmetov , commander of russian peacekeeping forces , was quoted by news agency interfax as saying in the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian president dmitry medvedev said all of russia 's forces would quit the security zones extending into georgia from its rebel regions by midnight wednesday .
medvedev shows regard for eu role medvedev hailed the role of eu observers in the post conflict zone , speaking at a summit in the french town of evian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian president has offered his thanks to the eu for its role in the georgia crisis " i want to stress the constructive role of the european union in finding a peaceful option for overcoming the caucasus crisis , " he said .
" when other forces in the world were reluctant or incapable of doing this , it was in the european union that we found a ... responsible and pragmatic partner . "
moscow has until friday under an eu-brokered ceasefire to withdraw from the georgian checkpoints occupied since its brief but violent war with the post-soviet republic in august .
russia honored its word : sarkozy french president nicolas sarkozy paid tribute to the russian president for keeping his word in promising to pull troops out of the georgia proper " buffer zones . "
sarkozy acknowledged " the withdrawal confirmed by president medvedev , who in doing so has kept his word , " in a speech to a conference in eastern france , where he was to hold talks with medvedev .
" both sides must now refrain from any provocation on the ground , " sarkozy added .
the russian withdrawal precedes a peace conference set for oct .
15 in geneva , where the broader issue of georgia 's long-term security is to be debated .
the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy says russia lived up to its word by withdrawing france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday , aug .
12 to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the two breakaway georgian provinces .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow was to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
russia insists it will keep nearly 4,000 troops in each of the separatist zones , a plan which the us , eu and nato have said contravenes the french-brokered ceasefire .
russian president chastises us as his country 's troops rolled out of georgia proper , medvedev said europe 's security system , which was still based around nato and the us , needed an overhaul , as highlighted by russia 's war with georgia .
he proposed a new european security pact that would negate the possibility of any one country having a monopoly on the safety of the continent .
" a desire by the united states to consolidate its global domination led to it missing a historical chance ... to build a truly democratic world order , " medvedev said . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the committee did , however , vote to have carbon emissions cut by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 , with possibly deeper cuts - up to 30 percent - should an international global warming agreement be reached which involves developing countries .
" keeping the 30 percent target alive sends an encouraging signal to our international partners in the run-up to poznan and copenhagen , " said tomas wyns , climate action network europe 's emissions trading senior policy officer , as quoted on can europe 's web site .
" all eyes now are on europe 's environment ministers .
the ball is now in their court .
will they show the climate commitment needed by developed countries to make an international deal possible by 2009 ? "
the votes will likely set the parliament 's agenda in energy and climate negotiations with eu leaders ahead of a final agreement later this year .
respite for industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , german environment minister , and other eu leaders will agree on the eu 's climate position late this year but in what green groups have labelled a reprieve for industry , eu sectors such as steel , aluminium and cement have slightly benefited from tuesday 's vote .
the environment committee said such industries that were vulnerable to a global economic slowdown should pay for only 15 percent of permits in 2013 , rising to 100 percent by 2020 .
avril doyle , the irish conservative member of the eu parliament who led the legislation through the committee , said the decision was taken with an eye on protecting vulnerable industries from competitors in rival countries with more lax emissions trading regulations .
" the crisis in liquidity is not a helpful backdrop , but it does not mean my colleagues or i should drop the ball , " said doyle .
the good news , however , was that eu power generators would be made to pay for all their carbon emissions from 2013 - a " polluter pays " scheme that has pleased green groups .
" this was a slap in the face to all the forces that want to weaken eu climate and energy policy , " said sanjeev kumar of environment group wwf . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 . " the ioc intends to retest the samples collected this summer during the olympic games in beijing , " ioc spokeswoman emmanuelle moreau told the german news agency dpa .
" substances that will be tested for across all sports include epo cera . " continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator , a new generation of doping drug that improves blood 's oxygen delivery system . the ioc 's move comes after a series of doping tests carried out on blood samples frozen after this summer 's tour de france came back positive .
german ioc vice-president thomas bach said the string of doping cases in men 's road racing could put the sport 's position as an olympic event at risk . olympic cycling ban possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's anti-doping agency confirmed two of schumacher 's samples were positive " an olympic break must be considered if those involved do n't make a joint effort against doping , " bach told dpa on tueseday .
" the credibility of cycling is at zero .
the riders have not used their chance for change . " the statement came after revelations that german rider stephan schumacher and italy 's leonardo piepoli tested positive for the third generation of the blood booster epo at the tour de france in july . the head of schumacher 's gerolsteiner team , hans-michael holczer , said on monday he was informed by tour boss christian prudhomme that a retest of schumacher 's samples for cera was positive . the german cycling federation bdr and the anti-doping agency nada have launched investigations into the doping claims .
schumacher , who has been linked with performance-enhancing drug use in the past , faces a two-year ban if he is found guilty of a doping offence . suspicious samples retested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more cyclists are being shown to have crossed the doping line retests were conducted on riders who returned abnormally high blood readings during this year 's tour .
seven other riders are reportedly still awaiting their fate . saunier duval 's piepoli and riccardo ricco also tested positive for cera , the french anti-doping agency afld said earlier this week . both men were kicked out of this summer 's tour de france .
piepoli is due to appear at an italian olympic committee hearing on friday , and ricco has been banned for 20 months . along with schumacher , the three riders combined for five stage wins at the 2008 tour , with schumacher winning both time trials . ioc boss jacques rogge told dpa earlier this year that cycling 's place at the olympics was not endangered as long as the sport fought doping in an efficient way . the dosb general secretary michael vesper said that cycling was committing suicide and there were also suggestions that the body would sue schumacher for the money the country spent on him to send him to the olympics . also on tuesday , german state networks ard and zdf were debating whether to continue tour de france broadcasts in the future in the wake of the latest cases .
ard and zdf last year terminated their broadcasts during the tour after several doping cases . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the central banks of the world have finally woke up to the gravity of the current situation , " charles diebel , the head of interest rates strategy at nomura , told reuters news agency .
" this is a major step to convincing the world that they are serious about stabilizing . " share prices around the world were plunging ahead of the cuts despite britain announcement of a 50 billion pound -lrb- $ 87 billion , 64 billion euro -rrb- partial nationalization of the country 's eight main banks as well as a 200 billion pound credit line extended to banks . brown promotes eu-wide plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain announced a 250 billlion pound bank rescue backage when presenting his country 's bank rescue package , british prime minister gordon brown proposed a " european-wide funding plan " to ease the financial crisis ' effects .
though he did not give details on the proposal immediately , a pan-european bail-out fund was rejected by eu leaders over the weekend . addressing a press conference on the british rescue package , brown said he had spoken earlier wednesday to french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating european union presidency . " countries are tested in difficult times , " brown said .
" these problems certainly started in the united states of america but they are having a big impact on our and on others ' financial systems . " imf : more losses on the way the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- warned on tuesday that us financial sector losses could total $ 1.4 trillion as the housing crisis , adding that the center of the turmoil has yet to reach its peak . banks will go under , and financial institutions will face an " inevitable " restructuring period as they battle to raise the capital needed to bolster their own balance sheets , the imf wrote in its annual financial stability report . france blames us for banking crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde said the us was wrong to allow lehman brothers to fall french finance minister christine lagarde on wednesday traced the start of the global financial meltdown to the united states ' " dramatic " decision allow lehman brothers bank to go under . lehman sought bankruptcy protection last month , after failed talks to find a buyer for the $ 600 billion wall street investment giant .
the us government then decided not to step in and save it . " as far as i am concerned , that was a mistake , " lagarde said , in an interview with rtl radio , complaining that a government bail-out would have reassured markets .
" when you let one domino fall , the others follow . " the collapse of lehman brothers , one of wall street 's most established banks , sparked turmoil on financial markets across the world that has it roots in a wave of loans to us homebuyers with spotty credit histories . once people began to default on the subprime mortgages offered to them by banks , a chain reaction of chaos followed .
housing foreclosures sent home values plunging , and the us housing market fell apart .
meanwhile the loans themselves had been re-packaged as complicated investment products and resold . as banks saw the extent of their investments in these bad debts , they had less money for new loans and their share prices began to fall . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy also proposed a summit meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe to be held at the end of 2009 " to discuss -lrb- russian -rrb- proposals and those of the european union for new concepts of a pan-european defence . "
for his part , medvedev urged the convening of a " special forum " at which " the leaders of all european states and the leaders of key organisations in the euro-atlantic area could take part . "
the object of the forum would be to discuss the new european security treaty , which medvedev first suggested to german chancellor angela merkel in june , and which he elaborated on in evian .
" the euro-atlantic area needs a positive agenda today , " medvedev said .
" the events in the caucasus have merely confirmed the absolute correctness of the idea of a new european security treaty . "
russian proposal for european security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fiercely opposes expansion of nato the russian president said his proposed treaty consisted of five parts , including " a clear affirmation of the inadmissibility of the use of force - or the threat of force - in international relations . "
another clause would assert that " no single state or international organization may have the exclusive right to maintain peace and stability in the region .
this applies fully to russia too . "
sarkozy was receptive to the idea , saying , " we are ready to talk about it with the russians because security in europe and beyond is a common good . "
medvedev also used the occasion to protest against the expansion of nato to near russia 's borders .
" the alliance is moving its military infrastructure right up to our country 's borders , and drawing new ' dividing lines ' in europe , right along our western and southern borders , " he said .
" quite naturally , no matter what is being said , we regard these actions as directed against us . "
however , he said that moscow 's intentions were peaceful .
" we are absolutely not interested in confrontation .
russia 's successful development is possible only in conditions of transparent and equal international relations .
and this is the guarantee of the stability of the world , " medvedev said .
georgia pullout honoured bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy recognized russia kept its word on georgia medvedev also used the conference to officially declare the withdrawal of russian troops from two “ buffer zones ” inside georgia proper , two days before a deadline set by an eu-brokered peace deal .
the completed pull-out was later confirmed by georgian and eu officials on the ground .
sarkozy acknowledged the russian pullout as “ a highly important development , ” saying that medvedev had “ kept his word ” and that the move reopened the floor for discussions between russia and the eu .
" the full implementation of the -lrb- georgia peace -rrb- accords ... paves the way for the resumption of negotiations on an ambitious framework agreement " that would " lead the way towards a real human and economic common space , " sarkozy said .
" europe wants a strong russia , " he added , arguing that the world 's current financial turmoil rendered it " essential " for the bloc to have strong ties with russia .
the relationship - frozen by the 27-nation eu last month in protest over the georgia conflict - is up for review at an eu-russia summit in november in the southern french city of nice .

mice have long been seen as little more than appetizers for the snakes living in the world 's zoos , but one taiwanese showed it 's capable of more .

klosse 's thumb-to-the-jaw technique would have hurt the snake and colleagues ' spraying it with water would have disorientated the creature , python expert jan knoll said . " its jaws opened so wide that it was able to completely cover the woman 's face , " said a police spokeswoman .
" she was in danger of slithering down its gullet . " while renate was treated at the hospital for bites and shocks , antonia had to settle for yet another dinner of mice . mouse : you look like lunch , mr. snake still , the german snake may want to be a bit more thankful next time renate comes in to the clean the cage or the stuttgart zoo 's reptile house may start making the beast work for her dinner like a viper in taiwan . firefighters who found the snake put it in a cage for safekeeping until they could locate a suitable snack and quickly came across a small mouse . but when they tossed a tiny rodent into the enclosure it turned out to be more than the 35-cm snake could handle . " it attacked the snake continuously , biting and scratching it , " a fire department spokesman told apple daily . after a 30-minute battle , the snake was dead and the mouse was left with hardly a scratch . " perhaps it used up its venom when we caught it , and perhaps it was a novice predator , " said fire chief lan sengqiu . whatever the cause of the mouse 's good fortune , the stuttgart zoo 's reptile house may want to get its hands on a few for the first aid kit . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy also proposed a summit meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe to be held at the end of 2009 " to discuss -lrb- russian -rrb- proposals and those of the european union for new concepts of a pan-european defence . "
for his part , medvedev urged the convening of a " special forum " at which " the leaders of all european states and the leaders of key organisations in the euro-atlantic area could take part . "
the object of the forum would be to discuss the new european security treaty , which medvedev first suggested to german chancellor angela merkel in june , and which he elaborated on in evian .
" the euro-atlantic area needs a positive agenda today , " medvedev said .
" the events in the caucasus have merely confirmed the absolute correctness of the idea of a new european security treaty . "
russian proposal for european security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fiercely opposes expansion of nato the russian president said his proposed treaty consisted of five parts , including " a clear affirmation of the inadmissibility of the use of force - or the threat of force - in international relations . "
another clause would assert that " no single state or international organization may have the exclusive right to maintain peace and stability in the region .
this applies fully to russia too . "
sarkozy was receptive to the idea , saying , " we are ready to talk about it with the russians because security in europe and beyond is a common good . "
medvedev also used the occasion to protest against the expansion of nato to near russia 's borders .
" the alliance is moving its military infrastructure right up to our country 's borders , and drawing new ' dividing lines ' in europe , right along our western and southern borders , " he said .
" quite naturally , no matter what is being said , we regard these actions as directed against us . "
however , he said that moscow 's intentions were peaceful .
" we are absolutely not interested in confrontation .
russia 's successful development is possible only in conditions of transparent and equal international relations .
and this is the guarantee of the stability of the world , " medvedev said .
georgia pullout honoured bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy recognized russia kept its word on georgia medvedev also used the conference to officially declare the withdrawal of russian troops from two “ buffer zones ” inside georgia proper , two days before a deadline set by an eu-brokered peace deal .
the completed pull-out was later confirmed by georgian and eu officials on the ground .
sarkozy acknowledged the russian pullout as “ a highly important development , ” saying that medvedev had “ kept his word ” and that the move reopened the floor for discussions between russia and the eu .
" the full implementation of the -lrb- georgia peace -rrb- accords ... paves the way for the resumption of negotiations on an ambitious framework agreement " that would " lead the way towards a real human and economic common space , " sarkozy said .
" europe wants a strong russia , " he added , arguing that the world 's current financial turmoil rendered it " essential " for the bloc to have strong ties with russia .
the relationship - frozen by the 27-nation eu last month in protest over the georgia conflict - is up for review at an eu-russia summit in november in the southern french city of nice .

sarkozy also proposed a summit meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe to be held at the end of 2009 " to discuss -lrb- russian -rrb- proposals and those of the european union for new concepts of a pan-european defence . "
for his part , medvedev urged the convening of a " special forum " at which " the leaders of all european states and the leaders of key organisations in the euro-atlantic area could take part . "
the object of the forum would be to discuss the new european security treaty , which medvedev first suggested to german chancellor angela merkel in june , and which he elaborated on in evian .
" the euro-atlantic area needs a positive agenda today , " medvedev said .
" the events in the caucasus have merely confirmed the absolute correctness of the idea of a new european security treaty . "
russian proposal for european security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fiercely opposes expansion of nato the russian president said his proposed treaty consisted of five parts , including " a clear affirmation of the inadmissibility of the use of force - or the threat of force - in international relations . "
another clause would assert that " no single state or international organization may have the exclusive right to maintain peace and stability in the region .
this applies fully to russia too . "
sarkozy was receptive to the idea , saying , " we are ready to talk about it with the russians because security in europe and beyond is a common good . "
medvedev also used the occasion to protest against the expansion of nato to near russia 's borders .
" the alliance is moving its military infrastructure right up to our country 's borders , and drawing new ' dividing lines ' in europe , right along our western and southern borders , " he said .
" quite naturally , no matter what is being said , we regard these actions as directed against us . "
however , he said that moscow 's intentions were peaceful .
" we are absolutely not interested in confrontation .
russia 's successful development is possible only in conditions of transparent and equal international relations .

the completed pull-out was later confirmed by georgian and eu officials on the ground .
sarkozy acknowledged the russian pullout as “ a highly important development , ” saying that medvedev had “ kept his word ” and that the move reopened the floor for discussions between russia and the eu .
" the full implementation of the -lrb- georgia peace -rrb- accords ... paves the way for the resumption of negotiations on an ambitious framework agreement " that would " lead the way towards a real human and economic common space , " sarkozy said .

now he wants the prime minister of turkey to return the goodwill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schramma wants erdogan to return a goodwill gesture schramma sent a letter to turkey 's recep tayyip erdogan this week reminding the prime minister of a promise to support building a turkish shrine in tarsus dedicated to the christian saint peter .
erdogan promised to support the project when he visited cologne in february , afp news agency reported .
tarsus a pilgrimage destination tarsus , the birth city of the apostle paul , is a pilgrimage destination for devout roman catholics .
in september , cardinal joachim meisner , the influential archbishop of cologne , led a delegation of 10 german bishops to turkey .
meisner called for a center for pilgrims to be built in tarsus .
now , it 's time for erdogan to support the project , mayor schramma said in a letter to erdogan made public this week .
" you said you would actively support the creation of a pilgrimage center as soon as the church approached you with this request , " schramma wrote , underlining that erdogan 's backing would be " invaluable " to the cause .
it 's unclear whether erdogan has responded to the letter . calls for religious tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's mosque will be one of europe 's largest schramma said erdogan 's active support would be a sign of " religious tolerance " and pointed out that he has strongly backed plans to build a highly controversial mosque in cologne .
" that is why i would be very pleased if turkey sent a similar message and if you as prime minister would spearhead this movement , " he said .
the apostle paul hailed from a jewish family in tarsus in what is now turkey .
according to the bible , he converted to christianity after having persecuted some of its followers .
in july , pope benedict xvi opened the year of saint paul to commemorate 2,000 years since his birth .
mosque plans move forward despite opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated in cologne last month against the far-right " anti-islamification " congress plans for building a mosque in cologne , where 12 percent of the population is muslim , were approved in august after germany 's main muslim group agreed to shorten the minarets .
far-right groups have seized on the project as proof of what they see as a creeping influence of islamism in germany and europe . extremists held an " anti-islamification " conference in cologne last month which sparked a counter protest attended by 40,000 people .
mayor schramma has called for a peaceful coexistence between muslims and non-muslims in germany .

" troops from five -lrb- of six -rrb- posts are already in south ossetia , and the last column with peacekeepers from the sixth observation post is on its way to tskhinvali , " marat kulakhmetov , commander of russian peacekeeping forces , was quoted by news agency interfax as saying in the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian president dmitry medvedev said all of russia 's forces would quit the security zones extending into georgia from its rebel regions by midnight wednesday .
medvedev shows regard for eu role medvedev hailed the role of eu observers in the post conflict zone , speaking at a summit in the french town of evian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian president has offered his thanks to the eu for its role in the georgia crisis " i want to stress the constructive role of the european union in finding a peaceful option for overcoming the caucasus crisis , " he said .
" when other forces in the world were reluctant or incapable of doing this , it was in the european union that we found a ... responsible and pragmatic partner . "
moscow has until friday under an eu-brokered ceasefire to withdraw from the georgian checkpoints occupied since its brief but violent war with the post-soviet republic in august .
russia honored its word : sarkozy french president nicolas sarkozy paid tribute to the russian president for keeping his word in promising to pull troops out of the georgia proper " buffer zones . "
sarkozy acknowledged " the withdrawal confirmed by president medvedev , who in doing so has kept his word , " in a speech to a conference in eastern france , where he was to hold talks with medvedev .
" both sides must now refrain from any provocation on the ground , " sarkozy added .
the russian withdrawal precedes a peace conference set for oct .
15 in geneva , where the broader issue of georgia 's long-term security is to be debated .
the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy says russia lived up to its word by withdrawing france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday , aug .
12 to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the two breakaway georgian provinces .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow was to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
russia insists it will keep nearly 4,000 troops in each of the separatist zones , a plan which the us , eu and nato have said contravenes the french-brokered ceasefire .
russian president chastises us as his country 's troops rolled out of georgia proper , medvedev said europe 's security system , which was still based around nato and the us , needed an overhaul , as highlighted by russia 's war with georgia .
he proposed a new european security pact that would negate the possibility of any one country having a monopoly on the safety of the continent .
" a desire by the united states to consolidate its global domination led to it missing a historical chance ... to build a truly democratic world order , " medvedev said . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the committee did , however , vote to have carbon emissions cut by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 , with possibly deeper cuts - up to 30 percent - should an international global warming agreement be reached which involves developing countries .
" keeping the 30 percent target alive sends an encouraging signal to our international partners in the run-up to poznan and copenhagen , " said tomas wyns , climate action network europe 's emissions trading senior policy officer , as quoted on can europe 's web site .
" all eyes now are on europe 's environment ministers .
the ball is now in their court .
will they show the climate commitment needed by developed countries to make an international deal possible by 2009 ? "
the votes will likely set the parliament 's agenda in energy and climate negotiations with eu leaders ahead of a final agreement later this year .
respite for industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , german environment minister , and other eu leaders will agree on the eu 's climate position late this year but in what green groups have labelled a reprieve for industry , eu sectors such as steel , aluminium and cement have slightly benefited from tuesday 's vote .
the environment committee said such industries that were vulnerable to a global economic slowdown should pay for only 15 percent of permits in 2013 , rising to 100 percent by 2020 .
avril doyle , the irish conservative member of the eu parliament who led the legislation through the committee , said the decision was taken with an eye on protecting vulnerable industries from competitors in rival countries with more lax emissions trading regulations .
" the crisis in liquidity is not a helpful backdrop , but it does not mean my colleagues or i should drop the ball , " said doyle .
the good news , however , was that eu power generators would be made to pay for all their carbon emissions from 2013 - a " polluter pays " scheme that has pleased green groups .
" this was a slap in the face to all the forces that want to weaken eu climate and energy policy , " said sanjeev kumar of environment group wwf . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet zur hausen said he was disappointed in the initial lack of interest from pharmaceutical companies in his team 's findings and the slow pace at which a vaccine was developed .
zur hausen also lamented the high cost of the vaccine , which he said keeps it out of the reach of most poor women .
vaccine cost prohibitive for poor women bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vaccine is " way too expensive , " zur hausen says each year 250,000 women die of cervical cancer , 83 percent of them in developing coutnries , zur hausen said .
yet a vaccine against cervical cancer , available in germany since 2006 , costs 500 euros -lrb- $ 682 -rrb- .
that is " much too expensive , " the scientist told germany 's frankfurter rundschau newspaper in an interview published wednesday , oct .
8 .
but zur hausen said he was hopeful that the price will eventually drop .
" i assume that countries such as india and china will begin producing it themselves and that there will be complete immunization programs in developing countries within a few years , " he told the newspaper .
calls for earlier immunization zur hausen worked as a professor , chairman and scientific director of the management board of the german cancer research center -lrb- dkfz -rrb- in heidelberg up to his retirement .
he shares the award , the highest for medicine , with two french researchers who studied the hiv virus which causes aids .
zur hausen dismissed the notion that regular pap smears make a vaccination unnecessary .
even though cervical cancer is often detected early and can be surgically removed , preventing it is a far better option , zur hausen said .
zur hausen also said he supports giving vaccinations to girls as young as nine .
currently , girls between the ages of 12 and 17 are vaccinated .
zur hausen said he would also advocate extending the age upwards for women who are not sexually active .
he also said that young men should be given the vaccine , since they can transmit the virus . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now he wants the prime minister of turkey to return the goodwill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schramma wants erdogan to return a goodwill gesture schramma sent a letter to turkey 's recep tayyip erdogan this week reminding the prime minister of a promise to support building a turkish shrine in tarsus dedicated to the christian saint peter .
erdogan promised to support the project when he visited cologne in february , afp news agency reported .
tarsus a pilgrimage destination tarsus , the birth city of the apostle paul , is a pilgrimage destination for devout roman catholics .
in september , cardinal joachim meisner , the influential archbishop of cologne , led a delegation of 10 german bishops to turkey .
meisner called for a center for pilgrims to be built in tarsus .
now , it 's time for erdogan to support the project , mayor schramma said in a letter to erdogan made public this week .
" you said you would actively support the creation of a pilgrimage center as soon as the church approached you with this request , " schramma wrote , underlining that erdogan 's backing would be " invaluable " to the cause .
it 's unclear whether erdogan has responded to the letter . calls for religious tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's mosque will be one of europe 's largest schramma said erdogan 's active support would be a sign of " religious tolerance " and pointed out that he has strongly backed plans to build a highly controversial mosque in cologne .
" that is why i would be very pleased if turkey sent a similar message and if you as prime minister would spearhead this movement , " he said .
the apostle paul hailed from a jewish family in tarsus in what is now turkey .
according to the bible , he converted to christianity after having persecuted some of its followers .
in july , pope benedict xvi opened the year of saint paul to commemorate 2,000 years since his birth .
mosque plans move forward despite opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated in cologne last month against the far-right " anti-islamification " congress plans for building a mosque in cologne , where 12 percent of the population is muslim , were approved in august after germany 's main muslim group agreed to shorten the minarets .
far-right groups have seized on the project as proof of what they see as a creeping influence of islamism in germany and europe . extremists held an " anti-islamification " conference in cologne last month which sparked a counter protest attended by 40,000 people .
mayor schramma has called for a peaceful coexistence between muslims and non-muslims in germany .

" the crisis in liquidity is not a helpful backdrop , but it does not mean my colleagues or i should drop the ball , " said doyle .
the good news , however , was that eu power generators would be made to pay for all their carbon emissions from 2013 - a " polluter pays " scheme that has pleased green groups .
" this was a slap in the face to all the forces that want to weaken eu climate and energy policy , " said sanjeev kumar of environment group wwf . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the biggest concern is that banks will start issuing fewer loans , " johann stiegler of the " mittelstand " federation , as the class of small and medium-sized companies -lrb- smes -rrb- is known , told the afp news agency . often family-run businesses with a few dozen employees , smes tend to operate in market niches .
but stiegler said the companies have limited financing options when they want to expand , adding that several institutions that specialized in issuing credit to small companies are struggling through the financial crisis . lenders swept up in crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german lender ikb was rescued by the state then carried away by a us investment fund a major german lender , commercial lending bank ikb , invested heavily in the us subprime mortgage market and required a bailout that cost the government over a billion euros before the bank was sold to the us investment fund lone star . " it will be harder and more expensive for companies to obtain credit , " werner schnappauf , head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , told the financial times deutschland on tuesday , oct .
7 . he also it was certain that the financial crisis would hit the general economy in the coming months . in addition to increasing raw material prices and a highly valued euro that makes exports more expensive , the current financial crisis led the bdi to estimate german growth would fall to 3.9 percent in 2008 and just 1.9 percent in 2009 .
last year german exports grew by 8.5 percent . situation could be worse while business owners may have to wait and see if the banking crisis expands to their industries , they 're also being confronted with a set of contradictory messages from their banks .
the local cooperative banks smes which tend to use loans and credit have so far been unaffected by the current financial turmoil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plunging markets have so far had only a moderate effect on german smes " it has not become more difficult to give loans , " werner reuter , who deals with business clients at the volksbank credit union in the southwestern city of karlsruhe , told afp .
" there is a certain insecurity ... but there is no sense of panic . " since the co-ops are invested only in local ventures , they have been sheltered from global crisis that brought international institutions to their knees , he added . only two percent of the 4,000 companies that requested credit were denied by their banks , according to a study released monday by the creditreform economic research group . but a growing number of german smes said they are pessimistic about future business . the number of companies that labeled their prospects as " good " or " very good " dropped 4.9 percent to 47 percent and the number who saw the coming year as unsatisfactory grew by 1.4 percent to 5.4 percent .

yet zur hausen said he was disappointed in the initial lack of interest from pharmaceutical companies in his team 's findings and the slow pace at which a vaccine was developed .
zur hausen also lamented the high cost of the vaccine , which he said keeps it out of the reach of most poor women .
vaccine cost prohibitive for poor women bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vaccine is " way too expensive , " zur hausen says each year 250,000 women die of cervical cancer , 83 percent of them in developing coutnries , zur hausen said .
yet a vaccine against cervical cancer , available in germany since 2006 , costs 500 euros -lrb- $ 682 -rrb- .
that is " much too expensive , " the scientist told germany 's frankfurter rundschau newspaper in an interview published wednesday , oct .
8 .
but zur hausen said he was hopeful that the price will eventually drop .
" i assume that countries such as india and china will begin producing it themselves and that there will be complete immunization programs in developing countries within a few years , " he told the newspaper .
calls for earlier immunization zur hausen worked as a professor , chairman and scientific director of the management board of the german cancer research center -lrb- dkfz -rrb- in heidelberg up to his retirement .
he shares the award , the highest for medicine , with two french researchers who studied the hiv virus which causes aids .
zur hausen dismissed the notion that regular pap smears make a vaccination unnecessary .
even though cervical cancer is often detected early and can be surgically removed , preventing it is a far better option , zur hausen said .
zur hausen also said he supports giving vaccinations to girls as young as nine .
currently , girls between the ages of 12 and 17 are vaccinated .
zur hausen said he would also advocate extending the age upwards for women who are not sexually active .
he also said that young men should be given the vaccine , since they can transmit the virus . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet zur hausen said he was disappointed in the initial lack of interest from pharmaceutical companies in his team 's findings and the slow pace at which a vaccine was developed .
zur hausen also lamented the high cost of the vaccine , which he said keeps it out of the reach of most poor women .
vaccine cost prohibitive for poor women bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vaccine is " way too expensive , " zur hausen says each year 250,000 women die of cervical cancer , 83 percent of them in developing coutnries , zur hausen said .
yet a vaccine against cervical cancer , available in germany since 2006 , costs 500 euros -lrb- $ 682 -rrb- .
that is " much too expensive , " the scientist told germany 's frankfurter rundschau newspaper in an interview published wednesday , oct .
8 .
but zur hausen said he was hopeful that the price will eventually drop .
" i assume that countries such as india and china will begin producing it themselves and that there will be complete immunization programs in developing countries within a few years , " he told the newspaper .
calls for earlier immunization zur hausen worked as a professor , chairman and scientific director of the management board of the german cancer research center -lrb- dkfz -rrb- in heidelberg up to his retirement .
he shares the award , the highest for medicine , with two french researchers who studied the hiv virus which causes aids .
zur hausen dismissed the notion that regular pap smears make a vaccination unnecessary .
even though cervical cancer is often detected early and can be surgically removed , preventing it is a far better option , zur hausen said .
zur hausen also said he supports giving vaccinations to girls as young as nine .
currently , girls between the ages of 12 and 17 are vaccinated .
zur hausen said he would also advocate extending the age upwards for women who are not sexually active .
he also said that young men should be given the vaccine , since they can transmit the virus . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" substances that will be tested for across all sports include epo cera . " continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator , a new generation of doping drug that improves blood 's oxygen delivery system . the ioc 's move comes after a series of doping tests carried out on blood samples frozen after this summer 's tour de france came back positive .

schumacher , who has been linked with performance-enhancing drug use in the past , faces a two-year ban if he is found guilty of a doping offence . suspicious samples retested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more cyclists are being shown to have crossed the doping line retests were conducted on riders who returned abnormally high blood readings during this year 's tour .
seven other riders are reportedly still awaiting their fate . saunier duval 's piepoli and riccardo ricco also tested positive for cera , the french anti-doping agency afld said earlier this week . both men were kicked out of this summer 's tour de france .
piepoli is due to appear at an italian olympic committee hearing on friday , and ricco has been banned for 20 months . along with schumacher , the three riders combined for five stage wins at the 2008 tour , with schumacher winning both time trials . ioc boss jacques rogge told dpa earlier this year that cycling 's place at the olympics was not endangered as long as the sport fought doping in an efficient way . the dosb general secretary michael vesper said that cycling was committing suicide and there were also suggestions that the body would sue schumacher for the money the country spent on him to send him to the olympics . also on tuesday , german state networks ard and zdf were debating whether to continue tour de france broadcasts in the future in the wake of the latest cases .

8 . " our preliminary investigation and reports based on witnesses suggest that the plane belonging to yeti airlines crashed after hitting a higher ground near the airport , " said mohan adhikari , the director general of civil aviation authority of nepal . those killed were 12 germans , including six women , four nepalese and two australians he said .
adhikari corrected earlier reports that two swiss nationals were onboard the plane saying they were mistaken for the australians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lukla airport where the plane crashed is the gateway to nepal 's everest region " only the captain of the aircraft survived and he was airlifted to kathmandu for treatment and was in stable condition , " adhikari said , adding that severe burns were making identifying the victims difficult . the german government was working closely with nepalese authorities to confirm the identities of the germans reported to be onboard , a foreign ministry spokesman told reporters in berlin on wednesday . aviation officials in kathmandu said the plane burst into flames after it crashed and hit the airport sideways .
the afp news agency quoted suraj kunwar , a local journalist , who said the aircraft caught fire after it crash landed on the sloping airstrip . " it took locals and security forces about two hours to put out the fire , " kunwar said .
" officials at the airport here have said that bad weather was the reason for the crash .
there was heavy cloud when the accident occurred .

" troops from five -lrb- of six -rrb- posts are already in south ossetia , and the last column with peacekeepers from the sixth observation post is on its way to tskhinvali , " marat kulakhmetov , commander of russian peacekeeping forces , was quoted by news agency interfax as saying in the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian president dmitry medvedev said all of russia 's forces would quit the security zones extending into georgia from its rebel regions by midnight wednesday .
medvedev shows regard for eu role medvedev hailed the role of eu observers in the post conflict zone , speaking at a summit in the french town of evian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian president has offered his thanks to the eu for its role in the georgia crisis " i want to stress the constructive role of the european union in finding a peaceful option for overcoming the caucasus crisis , " he said .
" when other forces in the world were reluctant or incapable of doing this , it was in the european union that we found a ... responsible and pragmatic partner . "
moscow has until friday under an eu-brokered ceasefire to withdraw from the georgian checkpoints occupied since its brief but violent war with the post-soviet republic in august .
russia honored its word : sarkozy french president nicolas sarkozy paid tribute to the russian president for keeping his word in promising to pull troops out of the georgia proper " buffer zones . "
sarkozy acknowledged " the withdrawal confirmed by president medvedev , who in doing so has kept his word , " in a speech to a conference in eastern france , where he was to hold talks with medvedev .
" both sides must now refrain from any provocation on the ground , " sarkozy added .
the russian withdrawal precedes a peace conference set for oct .
15 in geneva , where the broader issue of georgia 's long-term security is to be debated .
the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy says russia lived up to its word by withdrawing france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday , aug .
12 to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the two breakaway georgian provinces .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow was to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
russia insists it will keep nearly 4,000 troops in each of the separatist zones , a plan which the us , eu and nato have said contravenes the french-brokered ceasefire .
russian president chastises us as his country 's troops rolled out of georgia proper , medvedev said europe 's security system , which was still based around nato and the us , needed an overhaul , as highlighted by russia 's war with georgia .
he proposed a new european security pact that would negate the possibility of any one country having a monopoly on the safety of the continent .
" a desire by the united states to consolidate its global domination led to it missing a historical chance ... to build a truly democratic world order , " medvedev said . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mice have long been seen as little more than appetizers for the snakes living in the world 's zoos , but one taiwanese showed it 's capable of more .
zookeepers in stuttgart may want to invite the rodent to germany . a zookeeper had to be rescued in germany when a 12-foot snake began trying to eat her head .
renate klosse was cleaning its cage when the 126-pound -lrb- 57-kilogram -rrb- tiger python named antonia clamped its jaws on her face . she tried to relieve the pressure from its 70 teeth by sticking her thumbs into its jawbone , the sun newspaper reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you wo n't be half so tough when i get a water hose colleagues then sprayed it with hoses until it slithered off at uhldingen zoo near stuttgart .
klosse 's thumb-to-the-jaw technique would have hurt the snake and colleagues ' spraying it with water would have disorientated the creature , python expert jan knoll said . " its jaws opened so wide that it was able to completely cover the woman 's face , " said a police spokeswoman .
" she was in danger of slithering down its gullet . " while renate was treated at the hospital for bites and shocks , antonia had to settle for yet another dinner of mice . mouse : you look like lunch , mr. snake still , the german snake may want to be a bit more thankful next time renate comes in to the clean the cage or the stuttgart zoo 's reptile house may start making the beast work for her dinner like a viper in taiwan . firefighters who found the snake put it in a cage for safekeeping until they could locate a suitable snack and quickly came across a small mouse . but when they tossed a tiny rodent into the enclosure it turned out to be more than the 35-cm snake could handle . " it attacked the snake continuously , biting and scratching it , " a fire department spokesman told apple daily . after a 30-minute battle , the snake was dead and the mouse was left with hardly a scratch . " perhaps it used up its venom when we caught it , and perhaps it was a novice predator , " said fire chief lan sengqiu . whatever the cause of the mouse 's good fortune , the stuttgart zoo 's reptile house may want to get its hands on a few for the first aid kit . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" substances that will be tested for across all sports include epo cera .

" the biggest concern is that banks will start issuing fewer loans , " johann stiegler of the " mittelstand " federation , as the class of small and medium-sized companies -lrb- smes -rrb- is known , told the afp news agency . often family-run businesses with a few dozen employees , smes tend to operate in market niches .
but stiegler said the companies have limited financing options when they want to expand , adding that several institutions that specialized in issuing credit to small companies are struggling through the financial crisis . lenders swept up in crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german lender ikb was rescued by the state then carried away by a us investment fund a major german lender , commercial lending bank ikb , invested heavily in the us subprime mortgage market and required a bailout that cost the government over a billion euros before the bank was sold to the us investment fund lone star . " it will be harder and more expensive for companies to obtain credit , " werner schnappauf , head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , told the financial times deutschland on tuesday , oct .
7 . he also it was certain that the financial crisis would hit the general economy in the coming months . in addition to increasing raw material prices and a highly valued euro that makes exports more expensive , the current financial crisis led the bdi to estimate german growth would fall to 3.9 percent in 2008 and just 1.9 percent in 2009 .
last year german exports grew by 8.5 percent . situation could be worse while business owners may have to wait and see if the banking crisis expands to their industries , they 're also being confronted with a set of contradictory messages from their banks .
the local cooperative banks smes which tend to use loans and credit have so far been unaffected by the current financial turmoil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plunging markets have so far had only a moderate effect on german smes " it has not become more difficult to give loans , " werner reuter , who deals with business clients at the volksbank credit union in the southwestern city of karlsruhe , told afp .
" there is a certain insecurity ... but there is no sense of panic . " since the co-ops are invested only in local ventures , they have been sheltered from global crisis that brought international institutions to their knees , he added . only two percent of the 4,000 companies that requested credit were denied by their banks , according to a study released monday by the creditreform economic research group . but a growing number of german smes said they are pessimistic about future business . the number of companies that labeled their prospects as " good " or " very good " dropped 4.9 percent to 47 percent and the number who saw the coming year as unsatisfactory grew by 1.4 percent to 5.4 percent .

the committee did , however , vote to have carbon emissions cut by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 , with possibly deeper cuts - up to 30 percent - should an international global warming agreement be reached which involves developing countries .
" keeping the 30 percent target alive sends an encouraging signal to our international partners in the run-up to poznan and copenhagen , " said tomas wyns , climate action network europe 's emissions trading senior policy officer , as quoted on can europe 's web site .
" all eyes now are on europe 's environment ministers .
the ball is now in their court .
will they show the climate commitment needed by developed countries to make an international deal possible by 2009 ? "
the votes will likely set the parliament 's agenda in energy and climate negotiations with eu leaders ahead of a final agreement later this year .
respite for industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , german environment minister , and other eu leaders will agree on the eu 's climate position late this year but in what green groups have labelled a reprieve for industry , eu sectors such as steel , aluminium and cement have slightly benefited from tuesday 's vote .
the environment committee said such industries that were vulnerable to a global economic slowdown should pay for only 15 percent of permits in 2013 , rising to 100 percent by 2020 .
avril doyle , the irish conservative member of the eu parliament who led the legislation through the committee , said the decision was taken with an eye on protecting vulnerable industries from competitors in rival countries with more lax emissions trading regulations .
" the crisis in liquidity is not a helpful backdrop , but it does not mean my colleagues or i should drop the ball , " said doyle .
the good news , however , was that eu power generators would be made to pay for all their carbon emissions from 2013 - a " polluter pays " scheme that has pleased green groups .
" this was a slap in the face to all the forces that want to weaken eu climate and energy policy , " said sanjeev kumar of environment group wwf . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the committee did , however , vote to have carbon emissions cut by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 , with possibly deeper cuts - up to 30 percent - should an international global warming agreement be reached which involves developing countries .
" keeping the 30 percent target alive sends an encouraging signal to our international partners in the run-up to poznan and copenhagen , " said tomas wyns , climate action network europe 's emissions trading senior policy officer , as quoted on can europe 's web site .
" all eyes now are on europe 's environment ministers .
the ball is now in their court .
will they show the climate commitment needed by developed countries to make an international deal possible by 2009 ? "
the votes will likely set the parliament 's agenda in energy and climate negotiations with eu leaders ahead of a final agreement later this year .
respite for industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , german environment minister , and other eu leaders will agree on the eu 's climate position late this year but in what green groups have labelled a reprieve for industry , eu sectors such as steel , aluminium and cement have slightly benefited from tuesday 's vote .
the environment committee said such industries that were vulnerable to a global economic slowdown should pay for only 15 percent of permits in 2013 , rising to 100 percent by 2020 .
avril doyle , the irish conservative member of the eu parliament who led the legislation through the committee , said the decision was taken with an eye on protecting vulnerable industries from competitors in rival countries with more lax emissions trading regulations .
" the crisis in liquidity is not a helpful backdrop , but it does not mean my colleagues or i should drop the ball , " said doyle .

the committee did , however , vote to have carbon emissions cut by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 , with possibly deeper cuts - up to 30 percent - should an international global warming agreement be reached which involves developing countries .
" keeping the 30 percent target alive sends an encouraging signal to our international partners in the run-up to poznan and copenhagen , " said tomas wyns , climate action network europe 's emissions trading senior policy officer , as quoted on can europe 's web site .
" all eyes now are on europe 's environment ministers .
the ball is now in their court .
will they show the climate commitment needed by developed countries to make an international deal possible by 2009 ? "
the votes will likely set the parliament 's agenda in energy and climate negotiations with eu leaders ahead of a final agreement later this year .
respite for industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , german environment minister , and other eu leaders will agree on the eu 's climate position late this year but in what green groups have labelled a reprieve for industry , eu sectors such as steel , aluminium and cement have slightly benefited from tuesday 's vote .
the environment committee said such industries that were vulnerable to a global economic slowdown should pay for only 15 percent of permits in 2013 , rising to 100 percent by 2020 .
avril doyle , the irish conservative member of the eu parliament who led the legislation through the committee , said the decision was taken with an eye on protecting vulnerable industries from competitors in rival countries with more lax emissions trading regulations .
" the crisis in liquidity is not a helpful backdrop , but it does not mean my colleagues or i should drop the ball , " said doyle .
the good news , however , was that eu power generators would be made to pay for all their carbon emissions from 2013 - a " polluter pays " scheme that has pleased green groups .

" troops from five -lrb- of six -rrb- posts are already in south ossetia , and the last column with peacekeepers from the sixth observation post is on its way to tskhinvali , " marat kulakhmetov , commander of russian peacekeeping forces , was quoted by news agency interfax as saying in the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian president dmitry medvedev said all of russia 's forces would quit the security zones extending into georgia from its rebel regions by midnight wednesday .
medvedev shows regard for eu role medvedev hailed the role of eu observers in the post conflict zone , speaking at a summit in the french town of evian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian president has offered his thanks to the eu for its role in the georgia crisis " i want to stress the constructive role of the european union in finding a peaceful option for overcoming the caucasus crisis , " he said .
" when other forces in the world were reluctant or incapable of doing this , it was in the european union that we found a ... responsible and pragmatic partner . "
moscow has until friday under an eu-brokered ceasefire to withdraw from the georgian checkpoints occupied since its brief but violent war with the post-soviet republic in august .
russia honored its word : sarkozy french president nicolas sarkozy paid tribute to the russian president for keeping his word in promising to pull troops out of the georgia proper " buffer zones . "
sarkozy acknowledged " the withdrawal confirmed by president medvedev , who in doing so has kept his word , " in a speech to a conference in eastern france , where he was to hold talks with medvedev .
" both sides must now refrain from any provocation on the ground , " sarkozy added .
the russian withdrawal precedes a peace conference set for oct .

under the terms of the agreement , moscow was to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
russia insists it will keep nearly 4,000 troops in each of the separatist zones , a plan which the us , eu and nato have said contravenes the french-brokered ceasefire .
russian president chastises us as his country 's troops rolled out of georgia proper , medvedev said europe 's security system , which was still based around nato and the us , needed an overhaul , as highlighted by russia 's war with georgia .
he proposed a new european security pact that would negate the possibility of any one country having a monopoly on the safety of the continent .

the committee did , however , vote to have carbon emissions cut by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 , with possibly deeper cuts - up to 30 percent - should an international global warming agreement be reached which involves developing countries .
" keeping the 30 percent target alive sends an encouraging signal to our international partners in the run-up to poznan and copenhagen , " said tomas wyns , climate action network europe 's emissions trading senior policy officer , as quoted on can europe 's web site .

" troops from five -lrb- of six -rrb- posts are already in south ossetia , and the last column with peacekeepers from the sixth observation post is on its way to tskhinvali , " marat kulakhmetov , commander of russian peacekeeping forces , was quoted by news agency interfax as saying in the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian president dmitry medvedev said all of russia 's forces would quit the security zones extending into georgia from its rebel regions by midnight wednesday .
medvedev shows regard for eu role medvedev hailed the role of eu observers in the post conflict zone , speaking at a summit in the french town of evian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian president has offered his thanks to the eu for its role in the georgia crisis " i want to stress the constructive role of the european union in finding a peaceful option for overcoming the caucasus crisis , " he said .
" when other forces in the world were reluctant or incapable of doing this , it was in the european union that we found a ... responsible and pragmatic partner . "
moscow has until friday under an eu-brokered ceasefire to withdraw from the georgian checkpoints occupied since its brief but violent war with the post-soviet republic in august .
russia honored its word : sarkozy french president nicolas sarkozy paid tribute to the russian president for keeping his word in promising to pull troops out of the georgia proper " buffer zones . "
sarkozy acknowledged " the withdrawal confirmed by president medvedev , who in doing so has kept his word , " in a speech to a conference in eastern france , where he was to hold talks with medvedev .
" both sides must now refrain from any provocation on the ground , " sarkozy added .
the russian withdrawal precedes a peace conference set for oct .
15 in geneva , where the broader issue of georgia 's long-term security is to be debated .
the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy says russia lived up to its word by withdrawing france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday , aug .
12 to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the two breakaway georgian provinces .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow was to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
russia insists it will keep nearly 4,000 troops in each of the separatist zones , a plan which the us , eu and nato have said contravenes the french-brokered ceasefire .
russian president chastises us as his country 's troops rolled out of georgia proper , medvedev said europe 's security system , which was still based around nato and the us , needed an overhaul , as highlighted by russia 's war with georgia .
he proposed a new european security pact that would negate the possibility of any one country having a monopoly on the safety of the continent .
" a desire by the united states to consolidate its global domination led to it missing a historical chance ... to build a truly democratic world order , " medvedev said . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy also proposed a summit meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe to be held at the end of 2009 " to discuss -lrb- russian -rrb- proposals and those of the european union for new concepts of a pan-european defence . "
for his part , medvedev urged the convening of a " special forum " at which " the leaders of all european states and the leaders of key organisations in the euro-atlantic area could take part . "
the object of the forum would be to discuss the new european security treaty , which medvedev first suggested to german chancellor angela merkel in june , and which he elaborated on in evian .
" the euro-atlantic area needs a positive agenda today , " medvedev said .
" the events in the caucasus have merely confirmed the absolute correctness of the idea of a new european security treaty . "
russian proposal for european security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fiercely opposes expansion of nato the russian president said his proposed treaty consisted of five parts , including " a clear affirmation of the inadmissibility of the use of force - or the threat of force - in international relations . "
another clause would assert that " no single state or international organization may have the exclusive right to maintain peace and stability in the region .
this applies fully to russia too . "
sarkozy was receptive to the idea , saying , " we are ready to talk about it with the russians because security in europe and beyond is a common good . "
medvedev also used the occasion to protest against the expansion of nato to near russia 's borders .
" the alliance is moving its military infrastructure right up to our country 's borders , and drawing new ' dividing lines ' in europe , right along our western and southern borders , " he said .
" quite naturally , no matter what is being said , we regard these actions as directed against us . "
however , he said that moscow 's intentions were peaceful .
" we are absolutely not interested in confrontation .
russia 's successful development is possible only in conditions of transparent and equal international relations .
and this is the guarantee of the stability of the world , " medvedev said .
georgia pullout honoured bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy recognized russia kept its word on georgia medvedev also used the conference to officially declare the withdrawal of russian troops from two “ buffer zones ” inside georgia proper , two days before a deadline set by an eu-brokered peace deal .
the completed pull-out was later confirmed by georgian and eu officials on the ground .
sarkozy acknowledged the russian pullout as “ a highly important development , ” saying that medvedev had “ kept his word ” and that the move reopened the floor for discussions between russia and the eu .
" the full implementation of the -lrb- georgia peace -rrb- accords ... paves the way for the resumption of negotiations on an ambitious framework agreement " that would " lead the way towards a real human and economic common space , " sarkozy said .
" europe wants a strong russia , " he added , arguing that the world 's current financial turmoil rendered it " essential " for the bloc to have strong ties with russia .
the relationship - frozen by the 27-nation eu last month in protest over the georgia conflict - is up for review at an eu-russia summit in november in the southern french city of nice .

the object of the forum would be to discuss the new european security treaty , which medvedev first suggested to german chancellor angela merkel in june , and which he elaborated on in evian .
" the euro-atlantic area needs a positive agenda today , " medvedev said .
" the events in the caucasus have merely confirmed the absolute correctness of the idea of a new european security treaty . "
russian proposal for european security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fiercely opposes expansion of nato the russian president said his proposed treaty consisted of five parts , including " a clear affirmation of the inadmissibility of the use of force - or the threat of force - in international relations . "
another clause would assert that " no single state or international organization may have the exclusive right to maintain peace and stability in the region .
this applies fully to russia too . "
sarkozy was receptive to the idea , saying , " we are ready to talk about it with the russians because security in europe and beyond is a common good . "
medvedev also used the occasion to protest against the expansion of nato to near russia 's borders .
" the alliance is moving its military infrastructure right up to our country 's borders , and drawing new ' dividing lines ' in europe , right along our western and southern borders , " he said .
" quite naturally , no matter what is being said , we regard these actions as directed against us . "
however , he said that moscow 's intentions were peaceful .
" we are absolutely not interested in confrontation .
russia 's successful development is possible only in conditions of transparent and equal international relations .
and this is the guarantee of the stability of the world , " medvedev said .

the completed pull-out was later confirmed by georgian and eu officials on the ground .
sarkozy acknowledged the russian pullout as “ a highly important development , ” saying that medvedev had “ kept his word ” and that the move reopened the floor for discussions between russia and the eu .
" the full implementation of the -lrb- georgia peace -rrb- accords ... paves the way for the resumption of negotiations on an ambitious framework agreement " that would " lead the way towards a real human and economic common space , " sarkozy said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 08.10.2008 central banks cut interest rates around globe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors breathed a short sigh of relief , but are unsure how long the break from bad news will last stock markets partially recovered from a week of losses after a coordinated effort wednesday by central banks around the world to cut interest rates as a joint response to the global financial crisis . the us federal reserve said it was cutting its key rate by 50 basis points to 1.5 percent .
china , the european central bank and central banks in britain , canada , sweden and switzerland also cut rates in the coordinated response that analysts had been demanding .
the ecb dropped its interest rate to 3.75 percent . the decision was taken in coordination with central banks in britain , canada sweden , switzerland and the united states , the ecb said in a statement . the banks highlighted in a joint statement that they had cooperated in " unprecedented joint actions such as the provision of liquidity to reduce strains in financial markets " during the crisis . the ecb said " the bank of japan expresses its strong support of these policy actions " although tokyo did not take part in the joint action which followed unprecedented measures taken in washington and london to battle the international financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation did n't look good on wednesday morning " throughout the current financial crisis , central banks have engaged in continuous close consultation and have cooperated in unprecedented joint actions such as the provision of liquidity to reduce strains in financial markets , " the ecb statement said . the cuts followed days of calls for concerted action by economists and world leaders after repeated attempts by central banks to inject liquidity into world markets failed to halt a crisis of confidence . " the central banks of the world have finally woke up to the gravity of the current situation , " charles diebel , the head of interest rates strategy at nomura , told reuters news agency .
" this is a major step to convincing the world that they are serious about stabilizing . " share prices around the world were plunging ahead of the cuts despite britain announcement of a 50 billion pound -lrb- $ 87 billion , 64 billion euro -rrb- partial nationalization of the country 's eight main banks as well as a 200 billion pound credit line extended to banks . brown promotes eu-wide plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain announced a 250 billlion pound bank rescue backage when presenting his country 's bank rescue package , british prime minister gordon brown proposed a " european-wide funding plan " to ease the financial crisis ' effects .
though he did not give details on the proposal immediately , a pan-european bail-out fund was rejected by eu leaders over the weekend . addressing a press conference on the british rescue package , brown said he had spoken earlier wednesday to french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating european union presidency . " countries are tested in difficult times , " brown said .
" these problems certainly started in the united states of america but they are having a big impact on our and on others ' financial systems . " imf : more losses on the way the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- warned on tuesday that us financial sector losses could total $ 1.4 trillion as the housing crisis , adding that the center of the turmoil has yet to reach its peak . banks will go under , and financial institutions will face an " inevitable " restructuring period as they battle to raise the capital needed to bolster their own balance sheets , the imf wrote in its annual financial stability report . france blames us for banking crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde said the us was wrong to allow lehman brothers to fall french finance minister christine lagarde on wednesday traced the start of the global financial meltdown to the united states ' " dramatic " decision allow lehman brothers bank to go under . lehman sought bankruptcy protection last month , after failed talks to find a buyer for the $ 600 billion wall street investment giant .

" substances that will be tested for across all sports include epo cera . " continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator , a new generation of doping drug that improves blood 's oxygen delivery system . the ioc 's move comes after a series of doping tests carried out on blood samples frozen after this summer 's tour de france came back positive .
german ioc vice-president thomas bach said the string of doping cases in men 's road racing could put the sport 's position as an olympic event at risk . olympic cycling ban possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's anti-doping agency confirmed two of schumacher 's samples were positive " an olympic break must be considered if those involved do n't make a joint effort against doping , " bach told dpa on tueseday .

the riders have not used their chance for change . " the statement came after revelations that german rider stephan schumacher and italy 's leonardo piepoli tested positive for the third generation of the blood booster epo at the tour de france in july . the head of schumacher 's gerolsteiner team , hans-michael holczer , said on monday he was informed by tour boss christian prudhomme that a retest of schumacher 's samples for cera was positive . the german cycling federation bdr and the anti-doping agency nada have launched investigations into the doping claims .
schumacher , who has been linked with performance-enhancing drug use in the past , faces a two-year ban if he is found guilty of a doping offence . suspicious samples retested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more cyclists are being shown to have crossed the doping line retests were conducted on riders who returned abnormally high blood readings during this year 's tour .
seven other riders are reportedly still awaiting their fate . saunier duval 's piepoli and riccardo ricco also tested positive for cera , the french anti-doping agency afld said earlier this week . both men were kicked out of this summer 's tour de france .
piepoli is due to appear at an italian olympic committee hearing on friday , and ricco has been banned for 20 months . along with schumacher , the three riders combined for five stage wins at the 2008 tour , with schumacher winning both time trials . ioc boss jacques rogge told dpa earlier this year that cycling 's place at the olympics was not endangered as long as the sport fought doping in an efficient way . the dosb general secretary michael vesper said that cycling was committing suicide and there were also suggestions that the body would sue schumacher for the money the country spent on him to send him to the olympics . also on tuesday , german state networks ard and zdf were debating whether to continue tour de france broadcasts in the future in the wake of the latest cases .
ard and zdf last year terminated their broadcasts during the tour after several doping cases . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the committee did , however , vote to have carbon emissions cut by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 , with possibly deeper cuts - up to 30 percent - should an international global warming agreement be reached which involves developing countries .
" keeping the 30 percent target alive sends an encouraging signal to our international partners in the run-up to poznan and copenhagen , " said tomas wyns , climate action network europe 's emissions trading senior policy officer , as quoted on can europe 's web site .

"
the movie is a ast-paced account of how a band of left-wing revolutionaries caused mayhem in west germany with a series of politically-motivated assassinations , bombings and kidnappings in the 1970s .

the son of chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback , murdered in 1977 , said that he and other relatives had not been informed of the contents of the film .
the movie has been praised by some critics for showing members of the infamous urban guerrilla group founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof as brutal murderers rather than romantic desperadoes .
the movie disrespects ponto 's memory , his daughter corinna ponto told the internet site of the welt newspaper .
everything about the portrayal of juergen ponto 's murder was false , corinna ponto said in the interview .
juergen ponto , chairman of the dresdner bank board of directors , was shot at close range in a botched kidnapping attempt .
his wife , inges ponto , witnessed the shooting .
movie praised for not glorifying the terrorists director uli edel said he aimed to put the record straight by focusing on the carnage and human toll of the baader-meinhof gang , later the red army faction whose bloody exploits claimed dozens of lives .
the film went into general release in germany at the end of september .
it is believed to have been one of the most expensive german films ever made .
germany 's film export board has nominated the movie for the february 2009 oscars as best foreign film of the year and german judges said the work " gave a picture of the 1970s without glorifying " the terrorists . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow has until friday under an eu-brokered ceasefire to withdraw from the georgian checkpoints occupied since its brief but violent war with the post-soviet republic in august .
russia honored its word : sarkozy french president nicolas sarkozy paid tribute to the russian president for keeping his word in promising to pull troops out of the georgia proper " buffer zones . "

sarkozy also proposed a summit meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe to be held at the end of 2009 " to discuss -lrb- russian -rrb- proposals and those of the european union for new concepts of a pan-european defence . "
for his part , medvedev urged the convening of a " special forum " at which " the leaders of all european states and the leaders of key organisations in the euro-atlantic area could take part . "
the object of the forum would be to discuss the new european security treaty , which medvedev first suggested to german chancellor angela merkel in june , and which he elaborated on in evian .
" the euro-atlantic area needs a positive agenda today , " medvedev said .
" the events in the caucasus have merely confirmed the absolute correctness of the idea of a new european security treaty . "
russian proposal for european security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fiercely opposes expansion of nato the russian president said his proposed treaty consisted of five parts , including " a clear affirmation of the inadmissibility of the use of force - or the threat of force - in international relations . "
another clause would assert that " no single state or international organization may have the exclusive right to maintain peace and stability in the region .
this applies fully to russia too . "
sarkozy was receptive to the idea , saying , " we are ready to talk about it with the russians because security in europe and beyond is a common good . "
medvedev also used the occasion to protest against the expansion of nato to near russia 's borders .
" the alliance is moving its military infrastructure right up to our country 's borders , and drawing new ' dividing lines ' in europe , right along our western and southern borders , " he said .
" quite naturally , no matter what is being said , we regard these actions as directed against us . "
however , he said that moscow 's intentions were peaceful .
" we are absolutely not interested in confrontation .
russia 's successful development is possible only in conditions of transparent and equal international relations .
and this is the guarantee of the stability of the world , " medvedev said .

sarkozy also proposed a summit meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe to be held at the end of 2009 " to discuss -lrb- russian -rrb- proposals and those of the european union for new concepts of a pan-european defence . "
for his part , medvedev urged the convening of a " special forum " at which " the leaders of all european states and the leaders of key organisations in the euro-atlantic area could take part . "
the object of the forum would be to discuss the new european security treaty , which medvedev first suggested to german chancellor angela merkel in june , and which he elaborated on in evian .
" the euro-atlantic area needs a positive agenda today , " medvedev said .
" the events in the caucasus have merely confirmed the absolute correctness of the idea of a new european security treaty . "

another clause would assert that " no single state or international organization may have the exclusive right to maintain peace and stability in the region .
this applies fully to russia too . "
sarkozy was receptive to the idea , saying , " we are ready to talk about it with the russians because security in europe and beyond is a common good . "
medvedev also used the occasion to protest against the expansion of nato to near russia 's borders .
" the alliance is moving its military infrastructure right up to our country 's borders , and drawing new ' dividing lines ' in europe , right along our western and southern borders , " he said .
" quite naturally , no matter what is being said , we regard these actions as directed against us . "
however , he said that moscow 's intentions were peaceful .
" we are absolutely not interested in confrontation .
russia 's successful development is possible only in conditions of transparent and equal international relations .

sarkozy also proposed a summit meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe to be held at the end of 2009 " to discuss -lrb- russian -rrb- proposals and those of the european union for new concepts of a pan-european defence . "
for his part , medvedev urged the convening of a " special forum " at which " the leaders of all european states and the leaders of key organisations in the euro-atlantic area could take part . "
the object of the forum would be to discuss the new european security treaty , which medvedev first suggested to german chancellor angela merkel in june , and which he elaborated on in evian .
" the euro-atlantic area needs a positive agenda today , " medvedev said .
" the events in the caucasus have merely confirmed the absolute correctness of the idea of a new european security treaty . "
russian proposal for european security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fiercely opposes expansion of nato the russian president said his proposed treaty consisted of five parts , including " a clear affirmation of the inadmissibility of the use of force - or the threat of force - in international relations . "
another clause would assert that " no single state or international organization may have the exclusive right to maintain peace and stability in the region .
this applies fully to russia too . "
sarkozy was receptive to the idea , saying , " we are ready to talk about it with the russians because security in europe and beyond is a common good . "
medvedev also used the occasion to protest against the expansion of nato to near russia 's borders .
" the alliance is moving its military infrastructure right up to our country 's borders , and drawing new ' dividing lines ' in europe , right along our western and southern borders , " he said .
" quite naturally , no matter what is being said , we regard these actions as directed against us . "
however , he said that moscow 's intentions were peaceful .
" we are absolutely not interested in confrontation .
russia 's successful development is possible only in conditions of transparent and equal international relations .
and this is the guarantee of the stability of the world , " medvedev said .
georgia pullout honoured bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy recognized russia kept its word on georgia medvedev also used the conference to officially declare the withdrawal of russian troops from two “ buffer zones ” inside georgia proper , two days before a deadline set by an eu-brokered peace deal .
the completed pull-out was later confirmed by georgian and eu officials on the ground .
sarkozy acknowledged the russian pullout as “ a highly important development , ” saying that medvedev had “ kept his word ” and that the move reopened the floor for discussions between russia and the eu .
" the full implementation of the -lrb- georgia peace -rrb- accords ... paves the way for the resumption of negotiations on an ambitious framework agreement " that would " lead the way towards a real human and economic common space , " sarkozy said .
" europe wants a strong russia , " he added , arguing that the world 's current financial turmoil rendered it " essential " for the bloc to have strong ties with russia .
the relationship - frozen by the 27-nation eu last month in protest over the georgia conflict - is up for review at an eu-russia summit in november in the southern french city of nice .
in a united nations speech last month , sarkozy called for a common economic space uniting europe and russia . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now he wants the prime minister of turkey to return the goodwill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schramma wants erdogan to return a goodwill gesture schramma sent a letter to turkey 's recep tayyip erdogan this week reminding the prime minister of a promise to support building a turkish shrine in tarsus dedicated to the christian saint peter .
erdogan promised to support the project when he visited cologne in february , afp news agency reported .
tarsus a pilgrimage destination tarsus , the birth city of the apostle paul , is a pilgrimage destination for devout roman catholics .
in september , cardinal joachim meisner , the influential archbishop of cologne , led a delegation of 10 german bishops to turkey .
meisner called for a center for pilgrims to be built in tarsus .
now , it 's time for erdogan to support the project , mayor schramma said in a letter to erdogan made public this week .
" you said you would actively support the creation of a pilgrimage center as soon as the church approached you with this request , " schramma wrote , underlining that erdogan 's backing would be " invaluable " to the cause .
it 's unclear whether erdogan has responded to the letter . calls for religious tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's mosque will be one of europe 's largest schramma said erdogan 's active support would be a sign of " religious tolerance " and pointed out that he has strongly backed plans to build a highly controversial mosque in cologne .
" that is why i would be very pleased if turkey sent a similar message and if you as prime minister would spearhead this movement , " he said .
the apostle paul hailed from a jewish family in tarsus in what is now turkey .
according to the bible , he converted to christianity after having persecuted some of its followers .
in july , pope benedict xvi opened the year of saint paul to commemorate 2,000 years since his birth .
mosque plans move forward despite opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated in cologne last month against the far-right " anti-islamification " congress plans for building a mosque in cologne , where 12 percent of the population is muslim , were approved in august after germany 's main muslim group agreed to shorten the minarets .
far-right groups have seized on the project as proof of what they see as a creeping influence of islamism in germany and europe . extremists held an " anti-islamification " conference in cologne last month which sparked a counter protest attended by 40,000 people .
mayor schramma has called for a peaceful coexistence between muslims and non-muslims in germany .

mice have long been seen as little more than appetizers for the snakes living in the world 's zoos , but one taiwanese showed it 's capable of more .
zookeepers in stuttgart may want to invite the rodent to germany . a zookeeper had to be rescued in germany when a 12-foot snake began trying to eat her head .
renate klosse was cleaning its cage when the 126-pound -lrb- 57-kilogram -rrb- tiger python named antonia clamped its jaws on her face . she tried to relieve the pressure from its 70 teeth by sticking her thumbs into its jawbone , the sun newspaper reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you wo n't be half so tough when i get a water hose colleagues then sprayed it with hoses until it slithered off at uhldingen zoo near stuttgart .
klosse 's thumb-to-the-jaw technique would have hurt the snake and colleagues ' spraying it with water would have disorientated the creature , python expert jan knoll said . " its jaws opened so wide that it was able to completely cover the woman 's face , " said a police spokeswoman .
" she was in danger of slithering down its gullet . " while renate was treated at the hospital for bites and shocks , antonia had to settle for yet another dinner of mice . mouse : you look like lunch , mr. snake still , the german snake may want to be a bit more thankful next time renate comes in to the clean the cage or the stuttgart zoo 's reptile house may start making the beast work for her dinner like a viper in taiwan . firefighters who found the snake put it in a cage for safekeeping until they could locate a suitable snack and quickly came across a small mouse . but when they tossed a tiny rodent into the enclosure it turned out to be more than the 35-cm snake could handle . " it attacked the snake continuously , biting and scratching it , " a fire department spokesman told apple daily . after a 30-minute battle , the snake was dead and the mouse was left with hardly a scratch . " perhaps it used up its venom when we caught it , and perhaps it was a novice predator , " said fire chief lan sengqiu . whatever the cause of the mouse 's good fortune , the stuttgart zoo 's reptile house may want to get its hands on a few for the first aid kit . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

china , the european central bank and central banks in britain , canada , sweden and switzerland also cut rates in the coordinated response that analysts had been demanding .
the ecb dropped its interest rate to 3.75 percent . the decision was taken in coordination with central banks in britain , canada sweden , switzerland and the united states , the ecb said in a statement . the banks highlighted in a joint statement that they had cooperated in " unprecedented joint actions such as the provision of liquidity to reduce strains in financial markets " during the crisis . the ecb said " the bank of japan expresses its strong support of these policy actions " although tokyo did not take part in the joint action which followed unprecedented measures taken in washington and london to battle the international financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation did n't look good on wednesday morning " throughout the current financial crisis , central banks have engaged in continuous close consultation and have cooperated in unprecedented joint actions such as the provision of liquidity to reduce strains in financial markets , " the ecb statement said . the cuts followed days of calls for concerted action by economists and world leaders after repeated attempts by central banks to inject liquidity into world markets failed to halt a crisis of confidence . " the central banks of the world have finally woke up to the gravity of the current situation , " charles diebel , the head of interest rates strategy at nomura , told reuters news agency .
" this is a major step to convincing the world that they are serious about stabilizing . " share prices around the world were plunging ahead of the cuts despite britain announcement of a 50 billion pound -lrb- $ 87 billion , 64 billion euro -rrb- partial nationalization of the country 's eight main banks as well as a 200 billion pound credit line extended to banks . brown promotes eu-wide plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain announced a 250 billlion pound bank rescue backage when presenting his country 's bank rescue package , british prime minister gordon brown proposed a " european-wide funding plan " to ease the financial crisis ' effects .
though he did not give details on the proposal immediately , a pan-european bail-out fund was rejected by eu leaders over the weekend . addressing a press conference on the british rescue package , brown said he had spoken earlier wednesday to french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating european union presidency . " countries are tested in difficult times , " brown said .
" these problems certainly started in the united states of america but they are having a big impact on our and on others ' financial systems . " imf : more losses on the way the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- warned on tuesday that us financial sector losses could total $ 1.4 trillion as the housing crisis , adding that the center of the turmoil has yet to reach its peak . banks will go under , and financial institutions will face an " inevitable " restructuring period as they battle to raise the capital needed to bolster their own balance sheets , the imf wrote in its annual financial stability report . france blames us for banking crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde said the us was wrong to allow lehman brothers to fall french finance minister christine lagarde on wednesday traced the start of the global financial meltdown to the united states ' " dramatic " decision allow lehman brothers bank to go under . lehman sought bankruptcy protection last month , after failed talks to find a buyer for the $ 600 billion wall street investment giant .
the us government then decided not to step in and save it . " as far as i am concerned , that was a mistake , " lagarde said , in an interview with rtl radio , complaining that a government bail-out would have reassured markets .
" when you let one domino fall , the others follow . " the collapse of lehman brothers , one of wall street 's most established banks , sparked turmoil on financial markets across the world that has it roots in a wave of loans to us homebuyers with spotty credit histories . once people began to default on the subprime mortgages offered to them by banks , a chain reaction of chaos followed .

yet zur hausen said he was disappointed in the initial lack of interest from pharmaceutical companies in his team 's findings and the slow pace at which a vaccine was developed .
zur hausen also lamented the high cost of the vaccine , which he said keeps it out of the reach of most poor women .
vaccine cost prohibitive for poor women bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vaccine is " way too expensive , " zur hausen says each year 250,000 women die of cervical cancer , 83 percent of them in developing coutnries , zur hausen said .
yet a vaccine against cervical cancer , available in germany since 2006 , costs 500 euros -lrb- $ 682 -rrb- .
that is " much too expensive , " the scientist told germany 's frankfurter rundschau newspaper in an interview published wednesday , oct .
8 .
but zur hausen said he was hopeful that the price will eventually drop .
" i assume that countries such as india and china will begin producing it themselves and that there will be complete immunization programs in developing countries within a few years , " he told the newspaper .
calls for earlier immunization zur hausen worked as a professor , chairman and scientific director of the management board of the german cancer research center -lrb- dkfz -rrb- in heidelberg up to his retirement .
he shares the award , the highest for medicine , with two french researchers who studied the hiv virus which causes aids .
zur hausen dismissed the notion that regular pap smears make a vaccination unnecessary .
even though cervical cancer is often detected early and can be surgically removed , preventing it is a far better option , zur hausen said .
zur hausen also said he supports giving vaccinations to girls as young as nine .
currently , girls between the ages of 12 and 17 are vaccinated .
zur hausen said he would also advocate extending the age upwards for women who are not sexually active .
he also said that young men should be given the vaccine , since they can transmit the virus . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the movie is a ast-paced account of how a band of left-wing revolutionaries caused mayhem in west germany with a series of politically-motivated assassinations , bombings and kidnappings in the 1970s .
ignes ponto was so upset that she sent back her federal cross of merit , germany 's highest civil award .
ponto was given the medal in 1988 for founding a society to aid the careers of talented young musicians .
movie " all wrong " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ponto 's widow gave back her award in protest the ponto family is not alone in expressing displeasure with the movie .
the son of chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback , murdered in 1977 , said that he and other relatives had not been informed of the contents of the film .
the movie has been praised by some critics for showing members of the infamous urban guerrilla group founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof as brutal murderers rather than romantic desperadoes .
the movie disrespects ponto 's memory , his daughter corinna ponto told the internet site of the welt newspaper .
everything about the portrayal of juergen ponto 's murder was false , corinna ponto said in the interview .
juergen ponto , chairman of the dresdner bank board of directors , was shot at close range in a botched kidnapping attempt .
his wife , inges ponto , witnessed the shooting .
movie praised for not glorifying the terrorists director uli edel said he aimed to put the record straight by focusing on the carnage and human toll of the baader-meinhof gang , later the red army faction whose bloody exploits claimed dozens of lives .
the film went into general release in germany at the end of september .
it is believed to have been one of the most expensive german films ever made .
germany 's film export board has nominated the movie for the february 2009 oscars as best foreign film of the year and german judges said the work " gave a picture of the 1970s without glorifying " the terrorists . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" troops from five -lrb- of six -rrb- posts are already in south ossetia , and the last column with peacekeepers from the sixth observation post is on its way to tskhinvali , " marat kulakhmetov , commander of russian peacekeeping forces , was quoted by news agency interfax as saying in the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian president dmitry medvedev said all of russia 's forces would quit the security zones extending into georgia from its rebel regions by midnight wednesday .
medvedev shows regard for eu role medvedev hailed the role of eu observers in the post conflict zone , speaking at a summit in the french town of evian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian president has offered his thanks to the eu for its role in the georgia crisis " i want to stress the constructive role of the european union in finding a peaceful option for overcoming the caucasus crisis , " he said .
" when other forces in the world were reluctant or incapable of doing this , it was in the european union that we found a ... responsible and pragmatic partner . "
moscow has until friday under an eu-brokered ceasefire to withdraw from the georgian checkpoints occupied since its brief but violent war with the post-soviet republic in august .
russia honored its word : sarkozy french president nicolas sarkozy paid tribute to the russian president for keeping his word in promising to pull troops out of the georgia proper " buffer zones . "
sarkozy acknowledged " the withdrawal confirmed by president medvedev , who in doing so has kept his word , " in a speech to a conference in eastern france , where he was to hold talks with medvedev .
" both sides must now refrain from any provocation on the ground , " sarkozy added .
the russian withdrawal precedes a peace conference set for oct .
15 in geneva , where the broader issue of georgia 's long-term security is to be debated .
the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy says russia lived up to its word by withdrawing france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday , aug .
12 to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the two breakaway georgian provinces .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow was to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
russia insists it will keep nearly 4,000 troops in each of the separatist zones , a plan which the us , eu and nato have said contravenes the french-brokered ceasefire .
russian president chastises us as his country 's troops rolled out of georgia proper , medvedev said europe 's security system , which was still based around nato and the us , needed an overhaul , as highlighted by russia 's war with georgia .
he proposed a new european security pact that would negate the possibility of any one country having a monopoly on the safety of the continent .
" a desire by the united states to consolidate its global domination led to it missing a historical chance ... to build a truly democratic world order , " medvedev said . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mice have long been seen as little more than appetizers for the snakes living in the world 's zoos , but one taiwanese showed it 's capable of more .
zookeepers in stuttgart may want to invite the rodent to germany . a zookeeper had to be rescued in germany when a 12-foot snake began trying to eat her head .
renate klosse was cleaning its cage when the 126-pound -lrb- 57-kilogram -rrb- tiger python named antonia clamped its jaws on her face . she tried to relieve the pressure from its 70 teeth by sticking her thumbs into its jawbone , the sun newspaper reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you wo n't be half so tough when i get a water hose colleagues then sprayed it with hoses until it slithered off at uhldingen zoo near stuttgart .
klosse 's thumb-to-the-jaw technique would have hurt the snake and colleagues ' spraying it with water would have disorientated the creature , python expert jan knoll said . " its jaws opened so wide that it was able to completely cover the woman 's face , " said a police spokeswoman .
" she was in danger of slithering down its gullet . " while renate was treated at the hospital for bites and shocks , antonia had to settle for yet another dinner of mice . mouse : you look like lunch , mr. snake still , the german snake may want to be a bit more thankful next time renate comes in to the clean the cage or the stuttgart zoo 's reptile house may start making the beast work for her dinner like a viper in taiwan . firefighters who found the snake put it in a cage for safekeeping until they could locate a suitable snack and quickly came across a small mouse . but when they tossed a tiny rodent into the enclosure it turned out to be more than the 35-cm snake could handle . " it attacked the snake continuously , biting and scratching it , " a fire department spokesman told apple daily . after a 30-minute battle , the snake was dead and the mouse was left with hardly a scratch . " perhaps it used up its venom when we caught it , and perhaps it was a novice predator , " said fire chief lan sengqiu . whatever the cause of the mouse 's good fortune , the stuttgart zoo 's reptile house may want to get its hands on a few for the first aid kit . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy also proposed a summit meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe to be held at the end of 2009 " to discuss -lrb- russian -rrb- proposals and those of the european union for new concepts of a pan-european defence . "
for his part , medvedev urged the convening of a " special forum " at which " the leaders of all european states and the leaders of key organisations in the euro-atlantic area could take part . "
the object of the forum would be to discuss the new european security treaty , which medvedev first suggested to german chancellor angela merkel in june , and which he elaborated on in evian .
" the euro-atlantic area needs a positive agenda today , " medvedev said .
" the events in the caucasus have merely confirmed the absolute correctness of the idea of a new european security treaty . "
russian proposal for european security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fiercely opposes expansion of nato the russian president said his proposed treaty consisted of five parts , including " a clear affirmation of the inadmissibility of the use of force - or the threat of force - in international relations . "
another clause would assert that " no single state or international organization may have the exclusive right to maintain peace and stability in the region .
this applies fully to russia too . "
sarkozy was receptive to the idea , saying , " we are ready to talk about it with the russians because security in europe and beyond is a common good . "
medvedev also used the occasion to protest against the expansion of nato to near russia 's borders .
" the alliance is moving its military infrastructure right up to our country 's borders , and drawing new ' dividing lines ' in europe , right along our western and southern borders , " he said .
" quite naturally , no matter what is being said , we regard these actions as directed against us . "
however , he said that moscow 's intentions were peaceful .
" we are absolutely not interested in confrontation .
russia 's successful development is possible only in conditions of transparent and equal international relations .
and this is the guarantee of the stability of the world , " medvedev said .
georgia pullout honoured bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy recognized russia kept its word on georgia medvedev also used the conference to officially declare the withdrawal of russian troops from two “ buffer zones ” inside georgia proper , two days before a deadline set by an eu-brokered peace deal .
the completed pull-out was later confirmed by georgian and eu officials on the ground .
sarkozy acknowledged the russian pullout as “ a highly important development , ” saying that medvedev had “ kept his word ” and that the move reopened the floor for discussions between russia and the eu .
" the full implementation of the -lrb- georgia peace -rrb- accords ... paves the way for the resumption of negotiations on an ambitious framework agreement " that would " lead the way towards a real human and economic common space , " sarkozy said .
" europe wants a strong russia , " he added , arguing that the world 's current financial turmoil rendered it " essential " for the bloc to have strong ties with russia .
the relationship - frozen by the 27-nation eu last month in protest over the georgia conflict - is up for review at an eu-russia summit in november in the southern french city of nice .
in a united nations speech last month , sarkozy called for a common economic space uniting europe and russia . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet zur hausen said he was disappointed in the initial lack of interest from pharmaceutical companies in his team 's findings and the slow pace at which a vaccine was developed .
zur hausen also lamented the high cost of the vaccine , which he said keeps it out of the reach of most poor women .
vaccine cost prohibitive for poor women bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vaccine is " way too expensive , " zur hausen says each year 250,000 women die of cervical cancer , 83 percent of them in developing coutnries , zur hausen said .
yet a vaccine against cervical cancer , available in germany since 2006 , costs 500 euros -lrb- $ 682 -rrb- .
that is " much too expensive , " the scientist told germany 's frankfurter rundschau newspaper in an interview published wednesday , oct .
8 .
but zur hausen said he was hopeful that the price will eventually drop .
" i assume that countries such as india and china will begin producing it themselves and that there will be complete immunization programs in developing countries within a few years , " he told the newspaper .
calls for earlier immunization zur hausen worked as a professor , chairman and scientific director of the management board of the german cancer research center -lrb- dkfz -rrb- in heidelberg up to his retirement .
he shares the award , the highest for medicine , with two french researchers who studied the hiv virus which causes aids .
zur hausen dismissed the notion that regular pap smears make a vaccination unnecessary .
even though cervical cancer is often detected early and can be surgically removed , preventing it is a far better option , zur hausen said .
zur hausen also said he supports giving vaccinations to girls as young as nine .
currently , girls between the ages of 12 and 17 are vaccinated .
zur hausen said he would also advocate extending the age upwards for women who are not sexually active .
he also said that young men should be given the vaccine , since they can transmit the virus . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" troops from five -lrb- of six -rrb- posts are already in south ossetia , and the last column with peacekeepers from the sixth observation post is on its way to tskhinvali , " marat kulakhmetov , commander of russian peacekeeping forces , was quoted by news agency interfax as saying in the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian president dmitry medvedev said all of russia 's forces would quit the security zones extending into georgia from its rebel regions by midnight wednesday .
medvedev shows regard for eu role medvedev hailed the role of eu observers in the post conflict zone , speaking at a summit in the french town of evian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian president has offered his thanks to the eu for its role in the georgia crisis " i want to stress the constructive role of the european union in finding a peaceful option for overcoming the caucasus crisis , " he said .
" when other forces in the world were reluctant or incapable of doing this , it was in the european union that we found a ... responsible and pragmatic partner . "
moscow has until friday under an eu-brokered ceasefire to withdraw from the georgian checkpoints occupied since its brief but violent war with the post-soviet republic in august .
russia honored its word : sarkozy french president nicolas sarkozy paid tribute to the russian president for keeping his word in promising to pull troops out of the georgia proper " buffer zones . "
sarkozy acknowledged " the withdrawal confirmed by president medvedev , who in doing so has kept his word , " in a speech to a conference in eastern france , where he was to hold talks with medvedev .
" both sides must now refrain from any provocation on the ground , " sarkozy added .
the russian withdrawal precedes a peace conference set for oct .
15 in geneva , where the broader issue of georgia 's long-term security is to be debated .
the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy says russia lived up to its word by withdrawing france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday , aug .
12 to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the two breakaway georgian provinces .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow was to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
russia insists it will keep nearly 4,000 troops in each of the separatist zones , a plan which the us , eu and nato have said contravenes the french-brokered ceasefire .
russian president chastises us as his country 's troops rolled out of georgia proper , medvedev said europe 's security system , which was still based around nato and the us , needed an overhaul , as highlighted by russia 's war with georgia .
he proposed a new european security pact that would negate the possibility of any one country having a monopoly on the safety of the continent .
" a desire by the united states to consolidate its global domination led to it missing a historical chance ... to build a truly democratic world order , " medvedev said . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" troops from five -lrb- of six -rrb- posts are already in south ossetia , and the last column with peacekeepers from the sixth observation post is on its way to tskhinvali , " marat kulakhmetov , commander of russian peacekeeping forces , was quoted by news agency interfax as saying in the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian president dmitry medvedev said all of russia 's forces would quit the security zones extending into georgia from its rebel regions by midnight wednesday .
medvedev shows regard for eu role medvedev hailed the role of eu observers in the post conflict zone , speaking at a summit in the french town of evian .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian president has offered his thanks to the eu for its role in the georgia crisis " i want to stress the constructive role of the european union in finding a peaceful option for overcoming the caucasus crisis , " he said .
" when other forces in the world were reluctant or incapable of doing this , it was in the european union that we found a ... responsible and pragmatic partner . "
moscow has until friday under an eu-brokered ceasefire to withdraw from the georgian checkpoints occupied since its brief but violent war with the post-soviet republic in august .
russia honored its word : sarkozy french president nicolas sarkozy paid tribute to the russian president for keeping his word in promising to pull troops out of the georgia proper " buffer zones . "
sarkozy acknowledged " the withdrawal confirmed by president medvedev , who in doing so has kept his word , " in a speech to a conference in eastern france , where he was to hold talks with medvedev .
" both sides must now refrain from any provocation on the ground , " sarkozy added .
the russian withdrawal precedes a peace conference set for oct .

12 to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the two breakaway georgian provinces .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow was to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
russia insists it will keep nearly 4,000 troops in each of the separatist zones , a plan which the us , eu and nato have said contravenes the french-brokered ceasefire .
russian president chastises us as his country 's troops rolled out of georgia proper , medvedev said europe 's security system , which was still based around nato and the us , needed an overhaul , as highlighted by russia 's war with georgia .
he proposed a new european security pact that would negate the possibility of any one country having a monopoly on the safety of the continent .
" a desire by the united states to consolidate its global domination led to it missing a historical chance ... to build a truly democratic world order , " medvedev said . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the biggest concern is that banks will start issuing fewer loans , " johann stiegler of the " mittelstand " federation , as the class of small and medium-sized companies -lrb- smes -rrb- is known , told the afp news agency . often family-run businesses with a few dozen employees , smes tend to operate in market niches .
but stiegler said the companies have limited financing options when they want to expand , adding that several institutions that specialized in issuing credit to small companies are struggling through the financial crisis . lenders swept up in crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german lender ikb was rescued by the state then carried away by a us investment fund a major german lender , commercial lending bank ikb , invested heavily in the us subprime mortgage market and required a bailout that cost the government over a billion euros before the bank was sold to the us investment fund lone star . " it will be harder and more expensive for companies to obtain credit , " werner schnappauf , head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , told the financial times deutschland on tuesday , oct .
7 . he also it was certain that the financial crisis would hit the general economy in the coming months . in addition to increasing raw material prices and a highly valued euro that makes exports more expensive , the current financial crisis led the bdi to estimate german growth would fall to 3.9 percent in 2008 and just 1.9 percent in 2009 .
last year german exports grew by 8.5 percent . situation could be worse while business owners may have to wait and see if the banking crisis expands to their industries , they 're also being confronted with a set of contradictory messages from their banks .

8 . " our preliminary investigation and reports based on witnesses suggest that the plane belonging to yeti airlines crashed after hitting a higher ground near the airport , " said mohan adhikari , the director general of civil aviation authority of nepal . those killed were 12 germans , including six women , four nepalese and two australians he said .
adhikari corrected earlier reports that two swiss nationals were onboard the plane saying they were mistaken for the australians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lukla airport where the plane crashed is the gateway to nepal 's everest region " only the captain of the aircraft survived and he was airlifted to kathmandu for treatment and was in stable condition , " adhikari said , adding that severe burns were making identifying the victims difficult . the german government was working closely with nepalese authorities to confirm the identities of the germans reported to be onboard , a foreign ministry spokesman told reporters in berlin on wednesday . aviation officials in kathmandu said the plane burst into flames after it crashed and hit the airport sideways .
the afp news agency quoted suraj kunwar , a local journalist , who said the aircraft caught fire after it crash landed on the sloping airstrip . " it took locals and security forces about two hours to put out the fire , " kunwar said .
" officials at the airport here have said that bad weather was the reason for the crash .
there was heavy cloud when the accident occurred . " officials said the weather and visibility were good in the area when the plane took off early in the morning but clouds had moved in by the time of the crash . when the weather is clear , dozens of flights land daily at lukla 's tenzing-hillary airport , the gateway to nepal 's everest region , which is used by thousands of trekkers and mountaineers . the crash is the worst reported in nepal since march when a un-helicopter crashed and killed 10 people in stormy weather in the ramechhap district , east of kathmandu .
in 2002 , 18 people including 13 germans , died when a small plane crashed in bad weather near pokhara town in west nepal .

sarkozy also proposed a summit meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe to be held at the end of 2009 " to discuss -lrb- russian -rrb- proposals and those of the european union for new concepts of a pan-european defence . "
for his part , medvedev urged the convening of a " special forum " at which " the leaders of all european states and the leaders of key organisations in the euro-atlantic area could take part . "
the object of the forum would be to discuss the new european security treaty , which medvedev first suggested to german chancellor angela merkel in june , and which he elaborated on in evian .
" the euro-atlantic area needs a positive agenda today , " medvedev said .
" the events in the caucasus have merely confirmed the absolute correctness of the idea of a new european security treaty . "
russian proposal for european security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fiercely opposes expansion of nato the russian president said his proposed treaty consisted of five parts , including " a clear affirmation of the inadmissibility of the use of force - or the threat of force - in international relations . "
another clause would assert that " no single state or international organization may have the exclusive right to maintain peace and stability in the region .
this applies fully to russia too . "
sarkozy was receptive to the idea , saying , " we are ready to talk about it with the russians because security in europe and beyond is a common good . "
medvedev also used the occasion to protest against the expansion of nato to near russia 's borders .
" the alliance is moving its military infrastructure right up to our country 's borders , and drawing new ' dividing lines ' in europe , right along our western and southern borders , " he said .
" quite naturally , no matter what is being said , we regard these actions as directed against us . "
however , he said that moscow 's intentions were peaceful .
" we are absolutely not interested in confrontation .
russia 's successful development is possible only in conditions of transparent and equal international relations .

sarkozy acknowledged the russian pullout as “ a highly important development , ” saying that medvedev had “ kept his word ” and that the move reopened the floor for discussions between russia and the eu .

8 . " the ioc intends to retest the samples collected this summer during the olympic games in beijing , " ioc spokeswoman emmanuelle moreau told the german news agency dpa .
" substances that will be tested for across all sports include epo cera . " continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator , a new generation of doping drug that improves blood 's oxygen delivery system . the ioc 's move comes after a series of doping tests carried out on blood samples frozen after this summer 's tour de france came back positive .
german ioc vice-president thomas bach said the string of doping cases in men 's road racing could put the sport 's position as an olympic event at risk . olympic cycling ban possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's anti-doping agency confirmed two of schumacher 's samples were positive " an olympic break must be considered if those involved do n't make a joint effort against doping , " bach told dpa on tueseday .
" the credibility of cycling is at zero .
the riders have not used their chance for change . " the statement came after revelations that german rider stephan schumacher and italy 's leonardo piepoli tested positive for the third generation of the blood booster epo at the tour de france in july . the head of schumacher 's gerolsteiner team , hans-michael holczer , said on monday he was informed by tour boss christian prudhomme that a retest of schumacher 's samples for cera was positive . the german cycling federation bdr and the anti-doping agency nada have launched investigations into the doping claims .
schumacher , who has been linked with performance-enhancing drug use in the past , faces a two-year ban if he is found guilty of a doping offence . suspicious samples retested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more cyclists are being shown to have crossed the doping line retests were conducted on riders who returned abnormally high blood readings during this year 's tour .
seven other riders are reportedly still awaiting their fate . saunier duval 's piepoli and riccardo ricco also tested positive for cera , the french anti-doping agency afld said earlier this week . both men were kicked out of this summer 's tour de france .
piepoli is due to appear at an italian olympic committee hearing on friday , and ricco has been banned for 20 months . along with schumacher , the three riders combined for five stage wins at the 2008 tour , with schumacher winning both time trials . ioc boss jacques rogge told dpa earlier this year that cycling 's place at the olympics was not endangered as long as the sport fought doping in an efficient way . the dosb general secretary michael vesper said that cycling was committing suicide and there were also suggestions that the body would sue schumacher for the money the country spent on him to send him to the olympics . also on tuesday , german state networks ard and zdf were debating whether to continue tour de france broadcasts in the future in the wake of the latest cases .

yet zur hausen said he was disappointed in the initial lack of interest from pharmaceutical companies in his team 's findings and the slow pace at which a vaccine was developed .
zur hausen also lamented the high cost of the vaccine , which he said keeps it out of the reach of most poor women .
vaccine cost prohibitive for poor women bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vaccine is " way too expensive , " zur hausen says each year 250,000 women die of cervical cancer , 83 percent of them in developing coutnries , zur hausen said .
yet a vaccine against cervical cancer , available in germany since 2006 , costs 500 euros -lrb- $ 682 -rrb- .
that is " much too expensive , " the scientist told germany 's frankfurter rundschau newspaper in an interview published wednesday , oct .
8 .
but zur hausen said he was hopeful that the price will eventually drop .
" i assume that countries such as india and china will begin producing it themselves and that there will be complete immunization programs in developing countries within a few years , " he told the newspaper .
calls for earlier immunization zur hausen worked as a professor , chairman and scientific director of the management board of the german cancer research center -lrb- dkfz -rrb- in heidelberg up to his retirement .
he shares the award , the highest for medicine , with two french researchers who studied the hiv virus which causes aids .
zur hausen dismissed the notion that regular pap smears make a vaccination unnecessary .
even though cervical cancer is often detected early and can be surgically removed , preventing it is a far better option , zur hausen said .
zur hausen also said he supports giving vaccinations to girls as young as nine .
currently , girls between the ages of 12 and 17 are vaccinated .
zur hausen said he would also advocate extending the age upwards for women who are not sexually active .
he also said that young men should be given the vaccine , since they can transmit the virus . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy also proposed a summit meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe to be held at the end of 2009 " to discuss -lrb- russian -rrb- proposals and those of the european union for new concepts of a pan-european defence . "
for his part , medvedev urged the convening of a " special forum " at which " the leaders of all european states and the leaders of key organisations in the euro-atlantic area could take part . "
the object of the forum would be to discuss the new european security treaty , which medvedev first suggested to german chancellor angela merkel in june , and which he elaborated on in evian .
" the euro-atlantic area needs a positive agenda today , " medvedev said .
" the events in the caucasus have merely confirmed the absolute correctness of the idea of a new european security treaty . "
russian proposal for european security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fiercely opposes expansion of nato the russian president said his proposed treaty consisted of five parts , including " a clear affirmation of the inadmissibility of the use of force - or the threat of force - in international relations . "
another clause would assert that " no single state or international organization may have the exclusive right to maintain peace and stability in the region .
this applies fully to russia too . "
sarkozy was receptive to the idea , saying , " we are ready to talk about it with the russians because security in europe and beyond is a common good . "
medvedev also used the occasion to protest against the expansion of nato to near russia 's borders .
" the alliance is moving its military infrastructure right up to our country 's borders , and drawing new ' dividing lines ' in europe , right along our western and southern borders , " he said .
" quite naturally , no matter what is being said , we regard these actions as directed against us . "
however , he said that moscow 's intentions were peaceful .
" we are absolutely not interested in confrontation .
russia 's successful development is possible only in conditions of transparent and equal international relations .
and this is the guarantee of the stability of the world , " medvedev said .
georgia pullout honoured bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy recognized russia kept its word on georgia medvedev also used the conference to officially declare the withdrawal of russian troops from two “ buffer zones ” inside georgia proper , two days before a deadline set by an eu-brokered peace deal .
the completed pull-out was later confirmed by georgian and eu officials on the ground .
sarkozy acknowledged the russian pullout as “ a highly important development , ” saying that medvedev had “ kept his word ” and that the move reopened the floor for discussions between russia and the eu .
" the full implementation of the -lrb- georgia peace -rrb- accords ... paves the way for the resumption of negotiations on an ambitious framework agreement " that would " lead the way towards a real human and economic common space , " sarkozy said .
" europe wants a strong russia , " he added , arguing that the world 's current financial turmoil rendered it " essential " for the bloc to have strong ties with russia .
the relationship - frozen by the 27-nation eu last month in protest over the georgia conflict - is up for review at an eu-russia summit in november in the southern french city of nice .
in a united nations speech last month , sarkozy called for a common economic space uniting europe and russia . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

media requires javascript to play .
behind the scenes of the debate as the spin doctors try to promote their candidates how ironic that campaign 2008 should offer us a town hall meeting just as it starts to turn negative in the build-up to its colossally expensive climax .
the town in question of course was a purely notional one , conjured up in the grounds of belmont university , nashville , with a population consisting entirely of well-informed but undecided voters presided over by " mayor " tom brokaw , who has a day job as an nbc anchorman .
it promised to be the most interesting of the four debates of the general election campaigning season , if only because it offered voters the chance to ask their questions directly .
on paper , the format should have favoured john mccain , who conducts lots of campaign events as town hall meetings god forbid , though , that any real debating should take place - both camps employ negotiators to limit the amount of time spent in " discussion " after each answer , more or less eliminating any prospect of real , sustained exchange that might catch someone out on network television .
' dancing backwards ' in practice both candidates went wildly over time on a number of occasions - at one point mayor brokaw observed that the debate would be running a bigger deficit than the federal government if they did n't get it back under control .
john mccain is trailing in nearly all the key polls on paper , the format should have favoured john mccain , who conducts lots of campaign events as town hall meetings , in which he prowls the stage taking questions from anyone who wants to ask one .
in fact , i thought barack obama did rather better , measured in manner and clear-minded in content where mr mccain seemed to spend too much time attempting to score points directly off his rival , with what felt like carefully-rehearsed digs that did n't seem quite to find the mark .
mr obama offered a performance reminiscent of a great boxer who knows he is ahead on points and only has to keep dancing backwards around the ring avoiding trouble to win .
he did n't land many scoring punches , but then he did n't have to .
mr mccain , who is now trailing in nearly all the important local and national opinion polls , went into the contest knowing he needed a clear-cut win to change the game .
he duly headed off around the ring on the offensive more than once , but he tended to telegraph his punches and they mostly felt like they missed their target .
at one point he played what is clearly his ace - his relative experience - by saying directly : " there 's no time for on-the-job training , my friend . "
but in such an intimate forum it felt oddly inappropriate to say it so bluntly - better surely to demonstrate the proposition with a superior grasp of the facts ?
husky sincerity the problem with reaching back into the briefings and bulletin points for ammunition is , of course , that if you do n't deliver pre-prepared material well , it can sound a little odd .
at one point , mr mccain tried to skewer mr obama as a big-spending liberal by claiming he 'd once voted for a plan to give $ 3m of federal money to buy an overhead projector for a planetarium in chicago .
i 'm surely not the only viewer who spent the rest of the evening wondering what kind of projector that kind of money buys you .
mr obama seemed more relaxed than mr mccain - partly , no doubt , because he knows the polls show he is heading for victory unless his rival can change the race .
senator mccain is the man who sang ' bomb , bomb , bomb iran ' and talked about annihilating north korea barack obama he seemed steady and relaxed and held his natural inclination to the high-flown rhetorical flourish in check .
mr mccain had gone for a soft note of slightly muted , husky sincerity which briefly made me think of ronald reagan 's delivery , but mainly sounded like the tone of a children 's storyteller with a sore throat .
there were some sharp exchanges of course , when mr obama was goaded into trading jabs .
the sharpest came after mr mccain made the familiar charge that mr obama was naive to indicate that in some circumstances he would launch an attack into pakistan to " get " osama bin laden .
he quoted teddy roosevelt 's maxim : " talk softly and carry a big stick . "
mr obama looked stung , perhaps for the first time in the evening , and replied : " senator mccain is the man who sang ' bomb , bomb , bomb iran ' and talked about annihilating north korea . "
both men 's advisers will feel they did competent jobs getting across competing visions of what america should do about health , tax and the economic bail-out package but neither had any surprises - and neither offered undecided voters anything they had n't seen and heard hundreds of times before .
a good question one of the most telling moments of the evening , in fact , was prompted by a question sent in over the internet by a member of the public , who asked what sacrifices americans might be called on to make in the current difficult circumstances .
it was a question that called for poetry - a good question because it tried to drag them away from the answers to predictable issues they have been hot-housing in debate camp .
tellingly , neither of them had a convincing answer .
mr obama offered something about how george bush had told america to go shopping in the aftermath of 9/11 and mr mccain told a story about how he once saved the country $ 6.8bn on a contract to build a new tanker for the air force .
on the vision thing , mr mccain spoke again about his national service and mr obama about how america had given him opportunities which he would n't have had elsewhere .
by this stage of the campaign , it 's all starting to sound a little familiar .
if you were feeling generous , you might call that section of the debate a tie - but overall the message of the night seemed to me to be clear .
barack obama emerged as the clear winner on the night in nashville - if only because john mccain needed a game-changing victory on the night and he clearly did n't manage one .

in fact , i thought barack obama did rather better , measured in manner and clear-minded in content where mr mccain seemed to spend too much time attempting to score points directly off his rival , with what felt like carefully-rehearsed digs that did n't seem quite to find the mark .
mr obama offered a performance reminiscent of a great boxer who knows he is ahead on points and only has to keep dancing backwards around the ring avoiding trouble to win .
he did n't land many scoring punches , but then he did n't have to .
mr mccain , who is now trailing in nearly all the important local and national opinion polls , went into the contest knowing he needed a clear-cut win to change the game .
he duly headed off around the ring on the offensive more than once , but he tended to telegraph his punches and they mostly felt like they missed their target .
at one point he played what is clearly his ace - his relative experience - by saying directly : " there 's no time for on-the-job training , my friend . "
but in such an intimate forum it felt oddly inappropriate to say it so bluntly - better surely to demonstrate the proposition with a superior grasp of the facts ?
husky sincerity the problem with reaching back into the briefings and bulletin points for ammunition is , of course , that if you do n't deliver pre-prepared material well , it can sound a little odd .
at one point , mr mccain tried to skewer mr obama as a big-spending liberal by claiming he 'd once voted for a plan to give $ 3m of federal money to buy an overhead projector for a planetarium in chicago .
i 'm surely not the only viewer who spent the rest of the evening wondering what kind of projector that kind of money buys you .
mr obama seemed more relaxed than mr mccain - partly , no doubt , because he knows the polls show he is heading for victory unless his rival can change the race .
senator mccain is the man who sang ' bomb , bomb , bomb iran ' and talked about annihilating north korea barack obama he seemed steady and relaxed and held his natural inclination to the high-flown rhetorical flourish in check .
mr mccain had gone for a soft note of slightly muted , husky sincerity which briefly made me think of ronald reagan 's delivery , but mainly sounded like the tone of a children 's storyteller with a sore throat .
there were some sharp exchanges of course , when mr obama was goaded into trading jabs .
the sharpest came after mr mccain made the familiar charge that mr obama was naive to indicate that in some circumstances he would launch an attack into pakistan to " get " osama bin laden .
he quoted teddy roosevelt 's maxim : " talk softly and carry a big stick . "
mr obama looked stung , perhaps for the first time in the evening , and replied : " senator mccain is the man who sang ' bomb , bomb , bomb iran ' and talked about annihilating north korea . "
both men 's advisers will feel they did competent jobs getting across competing visions of what america should do about health , tax and the economic bail-out package but neither had any surprises - and neither offered undecided voters anything they had n't seen and heard hundreds of times before .
a good question one of the most telling moments of the evening , in fact , was prompted by a question sent in over the internet by a member of the public , who asked what sacrifices americans might be called on to make in the current difficult circumstances .
it was a question that called for poetry - a good question because it tried to drag them away from the answers to predictable issues they have been hot-housing in debate camp .
tellingly , neither of them had a convincing answer .
mr obama offered something about how george bush had told america to go shopping in the aftermath of 9/11 and mr mccain told a story about how he once saved the country $ 6.8bn on a contract to build a new tanker for the air force .
on the vision thing , mr mccain spoke again about his national service and mr obama about how america had given him opportunities which he would n't have had elsewhere .
by this stage of the campaign , it 's all starting to sound a little familiar .
if you were feeling generous , you might call that section of the debate a tie - but overall the message of the night seemed to me to be clear .
barack obama emerged as the clear winner on the night in nashville - if only because john mccain needed a game-changing victory on the night and he clearly did n't manage one .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- mccain fails to change the game bbc news / americas graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 04:48 gmt , wednesday , 8 october 2008 05:48 uk mccain fails to change the game by kevin connolly bbc news , nashville the idea of the town hall meeting reaches far back into the american folk memory - to a time when a community solved its problems by gathering all its people together for an open debate .
it is an inspiring idea - ordinary folks gathered in a common purpose to identify the right thing to do .
no party politics , no expensive campaigning , no negative profiling of the other guy .
how ironic that campaign 2008 should offer us a town hall meeting just as it starts to turn negative in the build-up to its colossally expensive climax .
the town in question of course was a purely notional one , conjured up in the grounds of belmont university , nashville , with a population consisting entirely of well-informed but undecided voters presided over by " mayor " tom brokaw , who has a day job as an nbc anchorman .
it promised to be the most interesting of the four debates of the general election campaigning season , if only because it offered voters the chance to ask their questions directly . "
on paper , the format should have favoured john mccain , who conducts lots of campaign events as town hall meetings " god forbid , though , that any real debating should take place - both camps employ negotiators to limit the amount of time spent in " discussion " after each answer , more or less eliminating any prospect of real , sustained exchange that might catch someone out on network television .
' dancing backwards ' in practice both candidates went wildly over time on a number of occasions - at one point mayor brokaw observed that the debate would be running a bigger deficit than the federal government if they did n't get it back under control .
on paper , the format should have favoured john mccain , who conducts lots of campaign events as town hall meetings , in which he prowls the stage taking questions from anyone who wants to ask one .
in fact , i thought barack obama did rather better , measured in manner and clear-minded in content where mr mccain seemed to spend too much time attempting to score points directly off his rival , with what felt like carefully-rehearsed digs that did n't seem quite to find the mark .
mr obama offered a performance reminiscent of a great boxer who knows he is ahead on points and only has to keep dancing backwards around the ring avoiding trouble to win .
he did n't land many scoring punches , but then he did n't have to .
mr mccain , who is now trailing in nearly all the important local and national opinion polls , went into the contest knowing he needed a clear-cut win to change the game .
he duly headed off around the ring on the offensive more than once , but he tended to telegraph his punches and they mostly felt like they missed their target .
at one point he played what is clearly his ace - his relative experience - by saying directly : " there 's no time for on-the-job training , my friend . "
but in such an intimate forum it felt oddly inappropriate to say it so bluntly - better surely to demonstrate the proposition with a superior grasp of the facts ?
husky sincerity the problem with reaching back into the briefings and bulletin points for ammunition is , of course , that if you do n't deliver pre-prepared material well , it can sound a little odd .
at one point , mr mccain tried to skewer mr obama as a big-spending liberal by claiming he 'd once voted for a plan to give $ 3m of federal money to buy an overhead projector for a planetarium in chicago .
i 'm surely not the only viewer who spent the rest of the evening wondering what kind of projector that kind of money buys you .
mr obama seemed more relaxed than mr mccain - partly , no doubt , because he knows the polls show he is heading for victory unless his rival can change the race . "
senator mccain is the man who sang ' bomb , bomb , bomb iran ' and talked about annihilating north korea " barack obama he seemed steady and relaxed and held his natural inclination to the high-flown rhetorical flourish in check .
mr mccain had gone for a soft note of slightly muted , husky sincerity which briefly made me think of ronald reagan 's delivery , but mainly sounded like the tone of a children 's storyteller with a sore throat .
there were some sharp exchanges of course , when mr obama was goaded into trading jabs .
the sharpest came after mr mccain made the familiar charge that mr obama was naive to indicate that in some circumstances he would launch an attack into pakistan to " get " osama bin laden .
he quoted teddy roosevelt 's maxim : " talk softly and carry a big stick . "
mr obama looked stung , perhaps for the first time in the evening , and replied : " senator mccain is the man who sang ' bomb , bomb , bomb iran ' and talked about annihilating north korea . "
both men 's advisers will feel they did competent jobs getting across competing visions of what america should do about health , tax and the economic bail-out package but neither had any surprises - and neither offered undecided voters anything they had n't seen and heard hundreds of times before .
a good question one of the most telling moments of the evening , in fact , was prompted by a question sent in over the internet by a member of the public , who asked what sacrifices americans might be called on to make in the current difficult circumstances .
it was a question that called for poetry - a good question because it tried to drag them away from the answers to predictable issues they have been hot-housing in debate camp .
tellingly , neither of them had a convincing answer .
mr obama offered something about how george bush had told america to go shopping in the aftermath of 9/11 and mr mccain told a story about how he once saved the country $ 6.8bn on a contract to build a new tanker for the air force .
on the vision thing , mr mccain spoke again about his national service and mr obama about how america had given him opportunities which he would n't have had elsewhere .
by this stage of the campaign , it 's all starting to sound a little familiar .
if you were feeling generous , you might call that section of the debate a tie - but overall the message of the night seemed to me to be clear .
barack obama emerged as the clear winner on the night in nashville - if only because john mccain needed a game-changing victory on the night and he clearly did n't manage one .

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- war of words in divided belgium bbc news / europe graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 05:06 gmt , wednesday , 8 october 2008 06:06 uk war of words in divided belgium belgian politicians are starting talks on wednesday , aimed at ending a crisis that has paralysed government for 16 months .
at the heart of the stalemate are the rival aspirations of the dutch-speaking and francophone communities .
in the third of a series of articles on belgium , henri astier looks at mixed areas around brussels , where relations are at their most fraught .
when fernand herman died in 2005 , his widow thought of a fitting epitaph for the former belgian cabinet minister and euro mp : " l 'europe est ma patrie " -lrb- europe is my homeland -rrb- .
but the funeral director warned her that the authorities of overijse , a flemish town , would take a dim view of a french-language grave .
rudy herman suggested latin - and " europa patria mea " passed muster .
her husband is probably the only french-speaker buried in the cemetery who is remembered by more than a mere name and two dates .
like many other municipalities near brussels , overijse takes language very seriously .
the capital is a cosmopolitan , largely french-speaking enclave within flanders - and as its swelling population moves out , the suburbs are fighting to preserve their flemish identity .
a polite request in overijse , the local authorities ' zeal is in evidence on the high street .
in may , a local restaurant received a letter from the overijse council , which read : " as you know , this is a flemish commune , whose official language is dutch .
however , we notice that your neon sign , ' thai takeaway ' , is in english only .
we would like to request that you change this to ' thai meeneemrestaurant ' .
" we are also asking you to greet your customers in dutch ' goede dag ' or ' goede avond ' , instead of just in french . "
many non-dutch shopkeepers insist relations with the overijse authorities are civil , and accusations of " linguistic cleansing " levelled by some french-speakers are overdone .
a few shops down from the thai takeaway , a new brasserie has a distinctly gallic feel to it .
" moules marinieres " feature prominently on the menu , and the stereo plays songs by edith piaf and charles aznavour .
eric vermersch , the manager , says he uses a dutch-speaker in his dealings with the town hall , and there is always a flemish waiter on hand in the brasserie .
" there is a gentleman 's agreement .
as long as you respect others , you 're ok , " mr vermersch says .
" this is nothing like northern ireland and orange marches . "
vandalism bloody ethnic strife is not about to break out in brussels ' leafy suburbs - but the war of words can get nasty .
militant groups , such as the taal aktie komitee -lrb- tak -rrb- , specialise in vandalising non-dutch billboards and facilities .
one overijse business whose owner has been resisting official requests to change its english-language sign - " textile repair shop " - is regularly spray-painted with " nederlands " -lrb- " dutch " -rrb- graffiti .
some shopkeepers feel under such pressure that they will only speak under condition of anonymity .
one , in tervuren , says belgium 's government crisis has poisoned the atmosphere , and led to many flemish people boycotting his restaurant .
" over the past 15 months our sales have fallen by 35 % , " he says .
" i 'm from a mixed family .
i grew up speaking both dutch and french , i find it sad that it has come to this . "
in another suburb , " jeff " says local officials are encouraging people to report any non-dutch in-store advertising , adding that he once received a letter complaining about some ads in his food shop .
" i can not bear for people to tell me how to run my business , " jeff says .
" most of my customers are non-dutch speakers .
if i speak only dutch , i might as well close up shop . "
in fact that is exactly what jeff is doing .
he is moving to france .
remembering passchendaele flemish linguistic sensitivity is rooted in history .
belgium was run as a french-speaking state for at least a century after independence in 1830 , denying the language rights of the majority of its population . "
we want to preserve our identity and our culture " veronique caprasse kraainem deputy mayor many flemish people will tell you that their ancestors died during world war i because they could not understand the orders of french-speaking officers .
historian bruno de wever of ghent university says this is a " romantic story " popularised after the war by those fighting for flemish rights - " the language of war is not all that complicated , " he points out .
but the fact that this story remains in circulation shows how central language is to flemish identity .
near brussels , linguistic defensiveness is fuelled not just by historical grievances , but also fears for the future .
what would happen if the flight to the suburbs turned the flemish into a minority on their own soil ?
in some areas , this nightmare scenario has already happened .
about 80 % of the population of kraainem , for instance , consists of non dutch-speakers .
through the sheer force of numbers , they are running the place .
the mayor and all his team are native french-speakers .
bad blood kraainem is one of six flemish towns around brussels where , under a 1963 constitutional agreement , french-speakers have been granted special rights , notably services in french .
tensions between local leaders from the two communities are running high .
deputy mayor veronique caprasse says the flemish are determined to roll back the special language rights . "
if nobody speaks dutch in a flemish town , it still belongs to flanders " luk van biesen belgian mp she regards the regular dutch-language mailshots sent by the regional government to kraainem 's french-speakers as " a form of harassment " .
her community , ms caprasse says , is being threatened by a nationalist wave that has gone from strength to strength in the past three decades .
" we want to preserve our identity , our culture , " she says .
" we do n't reject the flemish people - we have good relations with them .
the whole problem comes from flemish politicians . "
flemish leaders , on the other hand , feel it is kraainem 's natives who are being sidelined .
local councillor luk van biesen , who is also a belgian mp , says this is the result of a long-term plan by french-speaking politicians to take over the suburbs of brussels .
but he insists that flemish land is sacrosanct : " if nobody speaks dutch in a flemish town - that will not change our opinion : it still belongs to flanders . "
mr van biesen says he understands the measures taken in some suburbs to stem an expanding wave of newcomers demanding special rights .
" if you give them one inch of ground , they will try to spread to other parts a couple of years later , " he says .
punishment that lesson is not lost on neighbouring zaventem .
the town , where the brussels airport is located , is home to a large expatriate community and immigrants from all over the world .
but mayor francis vermeiren is determined to uphold flemishness .
all visitors to the town hall must bring an interpreter if they do n't speak dutch , as staff are banned from speaking another language .
" i speak english to the people from london , and ' je parle en francais ' to the people from wallonia , " he says .
" we respect the culture of everyone , but we ask that they respect our culture also . "
zaventem has also set a controversial dutch language requirement for people applying to buy cheap land from the municipality .
" the point is not to keep foreigners out , " mr vermeiren insists .
" the condition is that they should have to either know or learn the language . "
but some who are learning dutch feel they could be made to feel more welcome in zaventem .
souhaila , a 16-year-old student , says her native french is banned from the school grounds .
" if they catch us speaking french in playground they tell us to stop .
if we continue we get a detention .
this bothers me , " she says .

fernand herman worked hard for european reconciliation when fernand herman died in 2005 , his widow thought of a fitting epitaph for the former belgian cabinet minister and euro mp : " l 'europe est ma patrie " -lrb- europe is my homeland -rrb- .
but the funeral director warned her that the authorities of overijse , a flemish town , would take a dim view of a french-language grave .
rudy herman suggested latin - and " europa patria mea " passed muster .
her husband is probably the only french-speaker buried in the cemetery who is remembered by more than a mere name and two dates .
like many other municipalities near brussels , overijse takes language very seriously .
the capital is a cosmopolitan , largely french-speaking enclave within flanders - and as its swelling population moves out , the suburbs are fighting to preserve their flemish identity .
a polite request in overijse , the local authorities ' zeal is in evidence on the high street .
in may , a local restaurant received a letter from the overijse council , which read : " as you know , this is a flemish commune , whose official language is dutch .
however , we notice that your neon sign , ' thai takeaway ' , is in english only .
we would like to request that you change this to ' thai meeneemrestaurant ' .
" we are also asking you to greet your customers in dutch ' goede dag ' or ' goede avond ' , instead of just in french . "
many non-dutch shopkeepers insist relations with the overijse authorities are civil , and accusations of " linguistic cleansing " levelled by some french-speakers are overdone .
a few shops down from the thai takeaway , a new brasserie has a distinctly gallic feel to it .
" moules marinieres " feature prominently on the menu , and the stereo plays songs by edith piaf and charles aznavour .
eric vermersch , the manager , says he uses a dutch-speaker in his dealings with the town hall , and there is always a flemish waiter on hand in the brasserie .

" this is nothing like northern ireland and orange marches . "

militant groups , such as the taal aktie komitee -lrb- tak -rrb- , specialise in vandalising non-dutch billboards and facilities .
the overijse repair shop is regularly spray-painted by militants one overijse business whose owner has been resisting official requests to change its english-language sign - " textile repair shop " - is regularly spray-painted with " nederlands " -lrb- " dutch " -rrb- graffiti .
some shopkeepers feel under such pressure that they will only speak under condition of anonymity .
one , in tervuren , says belgium 's government crisis has poisoned the atmosphere , and led to many flemish people boycotting his restaurant .
" over the past 15 months our sales have fallen by 35 % , " he says .
" i 'm from a mixed family .
i grew up speaking both dutch and french , i find it sad that it has come to this . "
in another suburb , " jeff " says local officials are encouraging people to report any non-dutch in-store advertising , adding that he once received a letter complaining about some ads in his food shop .
" i can not bear for people to tell me how to run my business , " jeff says .
" most of my customers are non-dutch speakers .
if i speak only dutch , i might as well close up shop . "
in fact that is exactly what jeff is doing .
he is moving to france .
remembering passchendaele flemish linguistic sensitivity is rooted in history .
belgium was run as a french-speaking state for at least a century after independence in 1830 , denying the language rights of the majority of its population .
we want to preserve our identity and our culture veronique caprasse kraainem deputy mayor many flemish people will tell you that their ancestors died during world war i because they could not understand the orders of french-speaking officers .
historian bruno de wever of ghent university says this is a " romantic story " popularised after the war by those fighting for flemish rights - " the language of war is not all that complicated , " he points out .
but the fact that this story remains in circulation shows how central language is to flemish identity .
near brussels , linguistic defensiveness is fuelled not just by historical grievances , but also fears for the future .
what would happen if the flight to the suburbs turned the flemish into a minority on their own soil ?
in some areas , this nightmare scenario has already happened .
about 80 % of the population of kraainem , for instance , consists of non dutch-speakers .
through the sheer force of numbers , they are running the place .
the mayor and all his team are native french-speakers .
bad blood kraainem is one of six flemish towns around brussels where , under a 1963 constitutional agreement , french-speakers have been granted special rights , notably services in french .
tensions between local leaders from the two communities are running high .
deputy mayor veronique caprasse says the flemish are determined to roll back the special language rights .
if nobody speaks dutch in a flemish town , it still belongs to flanders luk van biesen belgian mp she regards the regular dutch-language mailshots sent by the regional government to kraainem 's french-speakers as " a form of harassment " .
her community , ms caprasse says , is being threatened by a nationalist wave that has gone from strength to strength in the past three decades .
" we want to preserve our identity , our culture , " she says .
" we do n't reject the flemish people - we have good relations with them .
the whole problem comes from flemish politicians . "
flemish leaders , on the other hand , feel it is kraainem 's natives who are being sidelined .
local councillor luk van biesen , who is also a belgian mp , says this is the result of a long-term plan by french-speaking politicians to take over the suburbs of brussels .
but he insists that flemish land is sacrosanct : " if nobody speaks dutch in a flemish town - that will not change our opinion : it still belongs to flanders . "
mr van biesen says he understands the measures taken in some suburbs to stem an expanding wave of newcomers demanding special rights .
" if you give them one inch of ground , they will try to spread to other parts a couple of years later , " he says .
punishment that lesson is not lost on neighbouring zaventem .
the town , where the brussels airport is located , is home to a large expatriate community and immigrants from all over the world .
flemish and walloons give their views on tensions in belgium in pictures but mayor francis vermeiren is determined to uphold flemishness .
all visitors to the town hall must bring an interpreter if they do n't speak dutch , as staff are banned from speaking another language .
" i speak english to the people from london , and ' je parle en francais ' to the people from wallonia , " he says .
" we respect the culture of everyone , but we ask that they respect our culture also . "
zaventem has also set a controversial dutch language requirement for people applying to buy cheap land from the municipality .
" the point is not to keep foreigners out , " mr vermeiren insists .
" the condition is that they should have to either know or learn the language . "
but some who are learning dutch feel they could be made to feel more welcome in zaventem .
souhaila , a 16-year-old student , says her native french is banned from the school grounds .
" if they catch us speaking french in playground they tell us to stop .
if we continue we get a detention .
this bothers me , " she says .

at the heart of the stalemate are the rival aspirations of the dutch-speaking and francophone communities .

fernand herman worked hard for european reconciliation when fernand herman died in 2005 , his widow thought of a fitting epitaph for the former belgian cabinet minister and euro mp : " l 'europe est ma patrie " -lrb- europe is my homeland -rrb- .
but the funeral director warned her that the authorities of overijse , a flemish town , would take a dim view of a french-language grave .
rudy herman suggested latin - and " europa patria mea " passed muster .
her husband is probably the only french-speaker buried in the cemetery who is remembered by more than a mere name and two dates .
like many other municipalities near brussels , overijse takes language very seriously .
the capital is a cosmopolitan , largely french-speaking enclave within flanders - and as its swelling population moves out , the suburbs are fighting to preserve their flemish identity .
a polite request in overijse , the local authorities ' zeal is in evidence on the high street .
in may , a local restaurant received a letter from the overijse council , which read : " as you know , this is a flemish commune , whose official language is dutch .
however , we notice that your neon sign , ' thai takeaway ' , is in english only .
we would like to request that you change this to ' thai meeneemrestaurant ' .
" we are also asking you to greet your customers in dutch ' goede dag ' or ' goede avond ' , instead of just in french . "

the overijse repair shop is regularly spray-painted by militants one overijse business whose owner has been resisting official requests to change its english-language sign - " textile repair shop " - is regularly spray-painted with " nederlands " -lrb- " dutch " -rrb- graffiti .
some shopkeepers feel under such pressure that they will only speak under condition of anonymity .
one , in tervuren , says belgium 's government crisis has poisoned the atmosphere , and led to many flemish people boycotting his restaurant .
" over the past 15 months our sales have fallen by 35 % , " he says .
" i 'm from a mixed family .
i grew up speaking both dutch and french , i find it sad that it has come to this . "
in another suburb , " jeff " says local officials are encouraging people to report any non-dutch in-store advertising , adding that he once received a letter complaining about some ads in his food shop .
" i can not bear for people to tell me how to run my business , " jeff says .
" most of my customers are non-dutch speakers .
if i speak only dutch , i might as well close up shop . "
in fact that is exactly what jeff is doing .
he is moving to france .
remembering passchendaele flemish linguistic sensitivity is rooted in history .
belgium was run as a french-speaking state for at least a century after independence in 1830 , denying the language rights of the majority of its population .
we want to preserve our identity and our culture veronique caprasse kraainem deputy mayor many flemish people will tell you that their ancestors died during world war i because they could not understand the orders of french-speaking officers .
historian bruno de wever of ghent university says this is a " romantic story " popularised after the war by those fighting for flemish rights - " the language of war is not all that complicated , " he points out .
but the fact that this story remains in circulation shows how central language is to flemish identity .
near brussels , linguistic defensiveness is fuelled not just by historical grievances , but also fears for the future .
what would happen if the flight to the suburbs turned the flemish into a minority on their own soil ?
in some areas , this nightmare scenario has already happened .
about 80 % of the population of kraainem , for instance , consists of non dutch-speakers .
through the sheer force of numbers , they are running the place .
the mayor and all his team are native french-speakers .
bad blood kraainem is one of six flemish towns around brussels where , under a 1963 constitutional agreement , french-speakers have been granted special rights , notably services in french .
tensions between local leaders from the two communities are running high .
deputy mayor veronique caprasse says the flemish are determined to roll back the special language rights .
if nobody speaks dutch in a flemish town , it still belongs to flanders luk van biesen belgian mp she regards the regular dutch-language mailshots sent by the regional government to kraainem 's french-speakers as " a form of harassment " .
her community , ms caprasse says , is being threatened by a nationalist wave that has gone from strength to strength in the past three decades .
" we want to preserve our identity , our culture , " she says .
" we do n't reject the flemish people - we have good relations with them .
the whole problem comes from flemish politicians . "
flemish leaders , on the other hand , feel it is kraainem 's natives who are being sidelined .
local councillor luk van biesen , who is also a belgian mp , says this is the result of a long-term plan by french-speaking politicians to take over the suburbs of brussels .
but he insists that flemish land is sacrosanct : " if nobody speaks dutch in a flemish town - that will not change our opinion : it still belongs to flanders . "
mr van biesen says he understands the measures taken in some suburbs to stem an expanding wave of newcomers demanding special rights .
" if you give them one inch of ground , they will try to spread to other parts a couple of years later , " he says .
punishment that lesson is not lost on neighbouring zaventem .
the town , where the brussels airport is located , is home to a large expatriate community and immigrants from all over the world .
flemish and walloons give their views on tensions in belgium in pictures but mayor francis vermeiren is determined to uphold flemishness .
all visitors to the town hall must bring an interpreter if they do n't speak dutch , as staff are banned from speaking another language .
" i speak english to the people from london , and ' je parle en francais ' to the people from wallonia , " he says .
" we respect the culture of everyone , but we ask that they respect our culture also . "
zaventem has also set a controversial dutch language requirement for people applying to buy cheap land from the municipality .
" the point is not to keep foreigners out , " mr vermeiren insists .
" the condition is that they should have to either know or learn the language . "
but some who are learning dutch feel they could be made to feel more welcome in zaventem .
souhaila , a 16-year-old student , says her native french is banned from the school grounds .
" if they catch us speaking french in playground they tell us to stop .
if we continue we get a detention .
this bothers me , " she says .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- fact-checking the presidential debate bbc news / americas graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 05:28 gmt , wednesday , 8 october 2008 06:28 uk fact-checking the presidential debate barack obama and john mccain made a number of arguable claims during their second presidential debate .
the bbc news website took a look to see which claims stacked up - and which ones were less than accurate .
oil companies ' unused acres claim : barack obama said : " the oil companies ... currently have 68 million acres that they 're not using .
either you use them or you lose them . "
fact : mr obama was probably basing his claim on a june report from the democratic staff of the house natural resources committee , which cited statistics from the interior department 's minerals revenue management that classified 67,055,715 acres of oil and gas leases as " non-producing " in 2007 .
but just because land is defined as " non-producing " , it does n't mean that it is not being used .
it can take more than 10 years for an oil company to start producing oil or natural gas from a parcel of land , during which they are often engaging in serious exploratory work .
throughout this time , however , the land parcel in question must officially be described as " non-producing " .
verdict : it is misleading for mr obama to use statistics about " non-producing " land to make a point about oil companies not using their existing land holdings .
obama 's 94 votes to raise taxes claim : john mccain said mr obama " has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts " .
fact : the claim comes from a republican national committee fact sheet , which counted votes on non-binding budget resolutions , as well as votes that , in the opinion of politifact.com " would not have resulted in a net tax increase , but instead redistributed the burden among different payers " .
using the rnc 's methodology , in an effort to demonstrate the bogusness of the mccain team 's claims , the obama campaign released their own fact sheet detailing the 477 times that mr mccain had " voted for tax increases or against tax cuts " .
verdict : technically , mr mccain 's claim can be stood up , but - as the obama camp 's tallying of mccain 's 477 pro-tax hike votes demonstrates , such apparent statistical exactness actually obfuscates more than it enlightens .
who invented the computer ?
claim : mr obama said that " the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out , for defence purposes , how to communicate " .
fact : early versions of the computer were developed by governments during world war ii , but the personal computer was created by private enterprise in the 1980s .
however , the first version of the internet was created as a secure network by us defence scientists working for arpa who were trying to find a way to protect networks from nuclear attack .
verdict : it does sound here like mr obama was referring to the internet , but misspoke .
obama 's support for oil company tax breaks claim : john mccain said that " an energy bill on the floor of the senate loaded down with goodies , billions for the oil companies ... sponsored by bush and cheney " was supported by " that one " , meaning barack obama .
fact : mr obama did vote for the energy policy act of 2005 , which did indeed contain tax breaks for oil companies .
but , as factcheck.org have pointed out " according to a congressional research service report , more tax breaks were taken away from oil companies than were given .
overall , the act resulted in a small net tax increase on the oil industry . "
the act contained about $ 2.6bn of tax cuts for the oil and gas industry , but also $ 2.9bn of tax increases on the oil and gas industry .
it also provided tax breaks to alternative sources of energy .
verdict : mr mccain 's claim is misleading - the opposite of his claim is actually the case .

the bbc news website took a look to see which claims stacked up - and which ones were less than accurate .
oil companies ' unused acres claim : barack obama said : " the oil companies ... currently have 68 million acres that they 're not using .
either you use them or you lose them . "
fact : mr obama was probably basing his claim on a june report from the democratic staff of the house natural resources committee , which cited statistics from the interior department 's minerals revenue management that classified 67,055,715 acres of oil and gas leases as " non-producing " in 2007 .
but just because land is defined as " non-producing " , it does n't mean that it is not being used .
it can take more than 10 years for an oil company to start producing oil or natural gas from a parcel of land , during which they are often engaging in serious exploratory work .
throughout this time , however , the land parcel in question must officially be described as " non-producing " .
verdict : it is misleading for mr obama to use statistics about " non-producing " land to make a point about oil companies not using their existing land holdings .
obama 's 94 votes to raise taxes claim : john mccain said mr obama " has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts " .
fact : the claim comes from a republican national committee fact sheet , which counted votes on non-binding budget resolutions , as well as votes that , in the opinion of politifact.com " would not have resulted in a net tax increase , but instead redistributed the burden among different payers " .
using the rnc 's methodology , in an effort to demonstrate the bogusness of the mccain team 's claims , the obama campaign released their own fact sheet detailing the 477 times that mr mccain had " voted for tax increases or against tax cuts " .
verdict : technically , mr mccain 's claim can be stood up , but - as the obama camp 's tallying of mccain 's 477 pro-tax hike votes demonstrates , such apparent statistical exactness actually obfuscates more than it enlightens .
who invented the computer ?
claim : mr obama said that " the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out , for defence purposes , how to communicate " .
fact : early versions of the computer were developed by governments during world war ii , but the personal computer was created by private enterprise in the 1980s .
however , the first version of the internet was created as a secure network by us defence scientists working for arpa who were trying to find a way to protect networks from nuclear attack .
verdict : it does sound here like mr obama was referring to the internet , but misspoke .
obama 's support for oil company tax breaks claim : john mccain said that " an energy bill on the floor of the senate loaded down with goodies , billions for the oil companies ... sponsored by bush and cheney " was supported by " that one " , meaning barack obama .
fact : mr obama did vote for the energy policy act of 2005 , which did indeed contain tax breaks for oil companies .
but , as factcheck.org have pointed out " according to a congressional research service report , more tax breaks were taken away from oil companies than were given .
overall , the act resulted in a small net tax increase on the oil industry . "
the act contained about $ 2.6bn of tax cuts for the oil and gas industry , but also $ 2.9bn of tax increases on the oil and gas industry .
it also provided tax breaks to alternative sources of energy .
verdict : mr mccain 's claim is misleading - the opposite of his claim is actually the case .

welsh students studying in wales pay £ 1,200 in fees - rather than £ 3,000 for students from other parts of the uk - at a total cost of £ 61m per year .
a review proposes a targeted system , linked to family income , which could operate from 2011 .
students from poorer backgrounds could receive up to £ 6,000 a year .
the review team propose helping those students with homes in wales , whose families are on the lowest incomes .
the task and finish group , headed up by the vice chancellor of bangor university , professor merfyn jones , was established in june to carry out the review .

a report recommends scrapping support for welsh students to pay lower fees than in england it has now presented the first part of its report , looking at student debt and widening access , to education minister jane hutt , who is expected to formally respond next month .
disadvantaged students the group 's proposals would mean that those from low income families would receive most financial support , while those from families on the highest incomes would receive very little .
bbc wales understands that the plans would see an increase in the assembly learning grant -lrb- alg -rrb- for the most disadvantaged students .
this could mean giving £ 5,000 to £ 6,000 directly to them and letting them choose whether to pay tuition fees up front in full , or to use the money as a living allowance throughout the year .
this outcome could lead to the £ 1,890 currently given to all welsh students studying in wales being scrapped .
the alg at the moment gives £ 2,835 to those students who come from a family with a household income of up to £ 18,370 .
they 're able to use this providing their family lives in wales but it allows them to study outside wales .
those with a household income of between £ 18,370 to £ 39,000 receive a partial grant , and those beyond that will not receive anything .
bbc wales also understands the group wants the threshold where students have to start repaying their loans increased from the current £ 15,000 up to between £ 18,000 and £ 20,000 .
spending however , the one wales coalition document commits the assembly government to keeping current spending levels in place until the end of the 2009/10 academic term where the tuition fees bill would rise to £ 77.9m.
the second phase of the group 's review will look at the purpose and role of higher education in wales and is due to be completed by the end of february 2009 .
the welsh assembly government said prof jones submitted his final report on the first stage of his higher education review to education minister ms hutt last week .
" the minister will now consider this very important piece of work in the coming weeks in consultation with her cabinet colleagues and will formally respond in november , " said the spokesperson .
conservative education spokesman andrew davies said the report recommendation came as " little surprise " as the assembly government had failed to put sufficient money into higher education .
" year after year the funding gap with england and scotland has widened , " he said .
" the assembly government has let that gap become so unmanageable that it looks increasingly likely parents and students are going to be forced to pay more to plug the gap . "

a review proposes a targeted system , linked to family income , which could operate from 2011 .
students from poorer backgrounds could receive up to £ 6,000 a year .
the review team propose helping those students with homes in wales , whose families are on the lowest incomes .
the task and finish group , headed up by the vice chancellor of bangor university , professor merfyn jones , was established in june to carry out the review .

a report recommends scrapping support for welsh students to pay lower fees than in england it has now presented the first part of its report , looking at student debt and widening access , to education minister jane hutt , who is expected to formally respond next month .
disadvantaged students the group 's proposals would mean that those from low income families would receive most financial support , while those from families on the highest incomes would receive very little .
bbc wales understands that the plans would see an increase in the assembly learning grant -lrb- alg -rrb- for the most disadvantaged students .
this could mean giving £ 5,000 to £ 6,000 directly to them and letting them choose whether to pay tuition fees up front in full , or to use the money as a living allowance throughout the year .
this outcome could lead to the £ 1,890 currently given to all welsh students studying in wales being scrapped .
the alg at the moment gives £ 2,835 to those students who come from a family with a household income of up to £ 18,370 .
they 're able to use this providing their family lives in wales but it allows them to study outside wales .
those with a household income of between £ 18,370 to £ 39,000 receive a partial grant , and those beyond that will not receive anything .
bbc wales also understands the group wants the threshold where students have to start repaying their loans increased from the current £ 15,000 up to between £ 18,000 and £ 20,000 .
spending however , the one wales coalition document commits the assembly government to keeping current spending levels in place until the end of the 2009/10 academic term where the tuition fees bill would rise to £ 77.9m.
the second phase of the group 's review will look at the purpose and role of higher education in wales and is due to be completed by the end of february 2009 .
the welsh assembly government said prof jones submitted his final report on the first stage of his higher education review to education minister ms hutt last week .
" the minister will now consider this very important piece of work in the coming weeks in consultation with her cabinet colleagues and will formally respond in november , " said the spokesperson .
conservative education spokesman andrew davies said the report recommendation came as " little surprise " as the assembly government had failed to put sufficient money into higher education .
" year after year the funding gap with england and scotland has widened , " he said .
" the assembly government has let that gap become so unmanageable that it looks increasingly likely parents and students are going to be forced to pay more to plug the gap . "
