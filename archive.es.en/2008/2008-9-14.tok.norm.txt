or at least to be able to compete with them .
russian television channels , available in the baltics on cable , showed the russian military presence in georgia as positive .
they hailed last week 's eu summit , where european nations stopped short of sanctions on moscow , as a success of the russian foreign policy .
by contrast , latvian and estonian news took a pro-western tone , condemning the first russian military excursion into another sovereign country since the soviet union fell in 1991 .
a recent survey by the riga-based marketing and public opinion research center showed latvia 's population is evenly split in its support for either side in the five-day conflict between georgia and russia .
experts say it is partly because two opposing media spheres divide ethnic latvians and russians .
" theoretically , the national board for radio and tv broadcasting can forbid broadcast of the russian shows , " the executive director of the broadcasters ' association gunta lidaka told a russian-language newspaper in latvia .
but that would hit only latvian-based cable providers , whose business relies heavily on their russian packages .
with russian-language tv also available by satellite , a ban seems unlikely .
increased broadcasts at time of crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live at five : medvedev talks to more than his own nation the question of russian broadcasts in the baltics traditionally arises at times of crisis with moscow .
estonia and latvia - two countries with a large russian population - have watched the caucasus crisis through the lens of their own history .
occupied by the soviet union in 1940 , they were subjected to labor migrants from russia , some whom stayed when the baltics re-gained their independence in 1991 .
cable companies now do good business with their russian packages because they 're popular with their clients .
the first baltic channel , a local version of the russia 's first channel , and other major russian channels are in demand by clients of latvia 's largest cable operator , baltkom , company spokesman lauris klavins told the dpa news agency .
one reason for their popularity is the russian speakers who account for the third of the population in latvia and estonia .
reaching the russian-speaking audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings ran high in estonia 's russian community when the estonian government decided to relocate the soviet-era war memorial from the city square to military cemetery in 2007 , it caused riots among mostly russian-speaking population and exposed a deep rift between ethnic estonians and non-estonians .
at the time estonian officials began talking about launching a new tv channel aimed at local russians .
it has remained on paper , but the crisis in georgia threw the issue back into spotlight .
most cable packages includes more channels in russian than in latvian , estonian , or even in english .
but for now , channels from russia will continue to stream news , entertainment , music shows directly into baltic living rooms . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian media report that even in hitherto tranquil russian regions such as tatarstan and bashkiria , muslim separatists have become more independence-minded of late .
for years , russia 's leaders have sought to quell separatist tendencies by what they describe as " isolated extremists . "
the lengths to which the kremlin is prepared to go is best illustrated by restive chechnya , battered into submission by two wars since 1994 .
a declaration addressed to the council of europe by russian human rights activists said that " the situation in the north caucasus republics has became greatly more agitated since the war between russia and georgia in the south caucasus . "
lyudmila alekseyeva , head of the moscow helsinki group , and the document 's other signatories are warning of a further escalation .

opposition activists in ingushetia accuse ingush president murat zyazikov of " political murder " and demand that the ex-kgb general be removed from office .
zyazikov 's cousin was shot and killed shortly after yevloyev 's death .
alekseyeva said that north caucasus leaders , hand-picked by the kremlin , were using raw violence to suppress opposition in the region .
pointing to the numerous killings in recent years , ingush opposition activist magomet khasbiyev has accused the authorities of " genocide " - echoing the kremlin , which said it had invaded georgia to stop georgians ' " genocide " against south ossetians .
people in north caucasus regions other than ingushetia also feel threatened by moscow authorities , including in kabardino-balkaria , karachai-cherkessia , and north ossetia .
territorial disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 40 russian soldiers and police officers have been killed in ingushetia this year conflicts in the caucasus - the multiethnic region between the black and caspian seas - have historically been fueled by territorial disputes , the islamic faith , and deep-seated resistance to russian domination .
" we must ask europe or the us to separate us from russia , " khasbiyev told the liberal moscow radio station ekho moskvy .
" if we are n't acceptable to this country , we do n't know what else we should do . "
moscow reinforced its military presence in the north caucasus last year to deal with the 500 to 700 rebels thought to operate there .
yevloyev had repeatedly decried the brutality of russian police and soldiers , and accused authorities of turning a blind eye to the abduction , torture , and murder of innocent people .

or at least to be able to compete with them .
russian television channels , available in the baltics on cable , showed the russian military presence in georgia as positive .
they hailed last week 's eu summit , where european nations stopped short of sanctions on moscow , as a success of the russian foreign policy .
by contrast , latvian and estonian news took a pro-western tone , condemning the first russian military excursion into another sovereign country since the soviet union fell in 1991 .
a recent survey by the riga-based marketing and public opinion research center showed latvia 's population is evenly split in its support for either side in the five-day conflict between georgia and russia .
experts say it is partly because two opposing media spheres divide ethnic latvians and russians .
" theoretically , the national board for radio and tv broadcasting can forbid broadcast of the russian shows , " the executive director of the broadcasters ' association gunta lidaka told a russian-language newspaper in latvia .
but that would hit only latvian-based cable providers , whose business relies heavily on their russian packages .

at 21 years and 74 days , vettel , who started from pole , broke the previous mark of 22 years , 26 days set in august 2003 by fernando alonso at the hungarian grand prix , to give his team their first-ever grand prix victory .
as vettel crossed the line he briefly buried his head in his hands as he drove down the straight and told the race engineers of his italian team that he was simply speechless .
" grazie mile , grazie mile , " he said over the intercom .
due to wet conditions , the race started behind the safety car , allowing vettel to keep the lead , which he held onto until his first fuel stop .
he then regained the lead after the other drivers came into the pits for their fuel stop .
less rain than predicted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel stunned formula one with his italian gp win although forecasts predicted more rain during the race , fernando alonso in a renault and mark webber in a red bull chose intermediate tyres during their first pit stop , prompting others to also change to intermediates .
championship leader hamilton in a mclaren-mercedes , who started from 15th , took a while to get going , but then started overtaking the field from the back .
he pitted shortly after vettel , but , unlike most of the other drivers , put in enough fuel to stay out for the remaining race .
however , even though he had planned on a one-stop strategy , he had to come in a second time as he went out on wet tyres after his first stop and had to change to intermediates .
upfront vettel continued pushing for a historic victory ahead of kovalainen , kubica and alonso .
furious chase behind them , hamilton was continuing his furious chase and with 12 laps remaining , was running a close seventh behind nick heidfeld and felipe massa .
the briton seemed to be pushing to overtake the brazilian , but then suddenly with just a few laps to go , looked as if he needed to spare his tyres and made no further attempts to get past .
he finished seventh , behind heidfeld and massa and ahead of webber , who took the final championship point .

among them were charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany , and juergen ruettgers , premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where krefeld is located .
knobloch said the synagogue " stands for that which we lost and for that which we want to rebuild . "
jews are back in the mainstream of german society and would never allow this right to be contested , she said .
the new synagogue can accommodate up to 300 worshippers .
it is located in a converted commercial building that also houses a jewish community centre , library and meeting rooms .
extensive renovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for charlotte knobloch , right , the new synagogue is a symbol of jewish revival in germany some 12 million euros -lrb- $ 17 million -rrb- were pumped into the renovation work , which was carried out under the auspices of the non-profit isidor herzfelder foundation .
there are around 1,100 jews living in and around krefeld , an industrial city some 500 kilometers south-west of berlin .
the only item that recalls the old synagogue is a three-piece ornamental window designed by dutch artist jan thorn-prikker for the original building in 1928 .
the window was irreparably damaged when the synagogue was burned down during the nazi pogrom of 1938 , but was reconstructed from the original drawings kept at a local museum .
renaissance of jewish culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krefeld synagogue can accomodate up to 300 worshippers the opening of the synagogue , the 20th in north rhine-westphalia , is another sign of the renaissance of jewish culture in germany .
in the nearby city of essen the old synagogue is being given an extensive makeover so that it will be ready by 2010 when essen becomes european capital of culture .
more restoration work is taking place on another synagogue destroyed during the nazi pogrom in darmstadt , not far from the banking centre of frankfurt .
some 600,000 jews lived in germany before world war ii , but the figure declined to around 12,000 after 1945 .
today , there are more than 110,000 jews or people of jewish origin , giving germany one of the largest jewish populations of any country in europe . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the wreckage burned just metres from a residential community and debris blocked a section of russia 's trans-siberian railway .

at 21 years and 74 days , vettel , who started from pole , broke the previous mark of 22 years , 26 days set in august 2003 by fernando alonso at the hungarian grand prix , to give his team their first-ever grand prix victory .
as vettel crossed the line he briefly buried his head in his hands as he drove down the straight and told the race engineers of his italian team that he was simply speechless .
" grazie mile , grazie mile , " he said over the intercom .
due to wet conditions , the race started behind the safety car , allowing vettel to keep the lead , which he held onto until his first fuel stop .
he then regained the lead after the other drivers came into the pits for their fuel stop .
less rain than predicted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel stunned formula one with his italian gp win although forecasts predicted more rain during the race , fernando alonso in a renault and mark webber in a red bull chose intermediate tyres during their first pit stop , prompting others to also change to intermediates .
championship leader hamilton in a mclaren-mercedes , who started from 15th , took a while to get going , but then started overtaking the field from the back .
he pitted shortly after vettel , but , unlike most of the other drivers , put in enough fuel to stay out for the remaining race .
however , even though he had planned on a one-stop strategy , he had to come in a second time as he went out on wet tyres after his first stop and had to change to intermediates .
upfront vettel continued pushing for a historic victory ahead of kovalainen , kubica and alonso .
furious chase behind them , hamilton was continuing his furious chase and with 12 laps remaining , was running a close seventh behind nick heidfeld and felipe massa .
the briton seemed to be pushing to overtake the brazilian , but then suddenly with just a few laps to go , looked as if he needed to spare his tyres and made no further attempts to get past .
he finished seventh , behind heidfeld and massa and ahead of webber , who took the final championship point .
hamilton retains the lead with 78 points from ferrari 's felipe massa , who finished sixth to go to 77 points . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

among them were charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany , and juergen ruettgers , premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where krefeld is located .
knobloch said the synagogue " stands for that which we lost and for that which we want to rebuild . "
jews are back in the mainstream of german society and would never allow this right to be contested , she said .
the new synagogue can accommodate up to 300 worshippers .
it is located in a converted commercial building that also houses a jewish community centre , library and meeting rooms .
extensive renovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for charlotte knobloch , right , the new synagogue is a symbol of jewish revival in germany some 12 million euros -lrb- $ 17 million -rrb- were pumped into the renovation work , which was carried out under the auspices of the non-profit isidor herzfelder foundation .
there are around 1,100 jews living in and around krefeld , an industrial city some 500 kilometers south-west of berlin .
the only item that recalls the old synagogue is a three-piece ornamental window designed by dutch artist jan thorn-prikker for the original building in 1928 .
the window was irreparably damaged when the synagogue was burned down during the nazi pogrom of 1938 , but was reconstructed from the original drawings kept at a local museum .
renaissance of jewish culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krefeld synagogue can accomodate up to 300 worshippers the opening of the synagogue , the 20th in north rhine-westphalia , is another sign of the renaissance of jewish culture in germany .
in the nearby city of essen the old synagogue is being given an extensive makeover so that it will be ready by 2010 when essen becomes european capital of culture .
more restoration work is taking place on another synagogue destroyed during the nazi pogrom in darmstadt , not far from the banking centre of frankfurt .
some 600,000 jews lived in germany before world war ii , but the figure declined to around 12,000 after 1945 .
today , there are more than 110,000 jews or people of jewish origin , giving germany one of the largest jewish populations of any country in europe . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

among them were charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany , and juergen ruettgers , premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where krefeld is located .
knobloch said the synagogue " stands for that which we lost and for that which we want to rebuild . "
jews are back in the mainstream of german society and would never allow this right to be contested , she said .
the new synagogue can accommodate up to 300 worshippers .
it is located in a converted commercial building that also houses a jewish community centre , library and meeting rooms .
extensive renovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for charlotte knobloch , right , the new synagogue is a symbol of jewish revival in germany some 12 million euros -lrb- $ 17 million -rrb- were pumped into the renovation work , which was carried out under the auspices of the non-profit isidor herzfelder foundation .
there are around 1,100 jews living in and around krefeld , an industrial city some 500 kilometers south-west of berlin .
the only item that recalls the old synagogue is a three-piece ornamental window designed by dutch artist jan thorn-prikker for the original building in 1928 .
the window was irreparably damaged when the synagogue was burned down during the nazi pogrom of 1938 , but was reconstructed from the original drawings kept at a local museum .
renaissance of jewish culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krefeld synagogue can accomodate up to 300 worshippers the opening of the synagogue , the 20th in north rhine-westphalia , is another sign of the renaissance of jewish culture in germany .
in the nearby city of essen the old synagogue is being given an extensive makeover so that it will be ready by 2010 when essen becomes european capital of culture .
more restoration work is taking place on another synagogue destroyed during the nazi pogrom in darmstadt , not far from the banking centre of frankfurt .
some 600,000 jews lived in germany before world war ii , but the figure declined to around 12,000 after 1945 .
today , there are more than 110,000 jews or people of jewish origin , giving germany one of the largest jewish populations of any country in europe . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at 21 years and 74 days , vettel , who started from pole , broke the previous mark of 22 years , 26 days set in august 2003 by fernando alonso at the hungarian grand prix , to give his team their first-ever grand prix victory .
as vettel crossed the line he briefly buried his head in his hands as he drove down the straight and told the race engineers of his italian team that he was simply speechless .
" grazie mile , grazie mile , " he said over the intercom .
due to wet conditions , the race started behind the safety car , allowing vettel to keep the lead , which he held onto until his first fuel stop .
he then regained the lead after the other drivers came into the pits for their fuel stop .
less rain than predicted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel stunned formula one with his italian gp win although forecasts predicted more rain during the race , fernando alonso in a renault and mark webber in a red bull chose intermediate tyres during their first pit stop , prompting others to also change to intermediates .
championship leader hamilton in a mclaren-mercedes , who started from 15th , took a while to get going , but then started overtaking the field from the back .
he pitted shortly after vettel , but , unlike most of the other drivers , put in enough fuel to stay out for the remaining race .
however , even though he had planned on a one-stop strategy , he had to come in a second time as he went out on wet tyres after his first stop and had to change to intermediates .
upfront vettel continued pushing for a historic victory ahead of kovalainen , kubica and alonso .
furious chase behind them , hamilton was continuing his furious chase and with 12 laps remaining , was running a close seventh behind nick heidfeld and felipe massa .
the briton seemed to be pushing to overtake the brazilian , but then suddenly with just a few laps to go , looked as if he needed to spare his tyres and made no further attempts to get past .
he finished seventh , behind heidfeld and massa and ahead of webber , who took the final championship point .
hamilton retains the lead with 78 points from ferrari 's felipe massa , who finished sixth to go to 77 points . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a date had not yet been fixed for the conference , which is expected to take place in the willy brandt house in the northern city of luebeck .
grass urged the two koreas to aim for a more gradual and balanced process of reunification than the german model , a statement from the gallery said .

as the events which led to german reunification in 1990 began to unfold , grass was very vocal in his opposition and referred to it as an " annexation . "
grass caused a furor in germany two years ago when he admitted that he had served in the notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii , but chose to keep quiet about it for decades , during which he became a moral authority in post-war germany .
tammen plans to display drawings and sculptures by grass , who studied sculpture and graphics , at this year 's korea international art fair from sept .

russian television channels , available in the baltics on cable , showed the russian military presence in georgia as positive .
they hailed last week 's eu summit , where european nations stopped short of sanctions on moscow , as a success of the russian foreign policy .
by contrast , latvian and estonian news took a pro-western tone , condemning the first russian military excursion into another sovereign country since the soviet union fell in 1991 .

experts say it is partly because two opposing media spheres divide ethnic latvians and russians .
" theoretically , the national board for radio and tv broadcasting can forbid broadcast of the russian shows , " the executive director of the broadcasters ' association gunta lidaka told a russian-language newspaper in latvia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 14.09.2008 baltic states witness media war over georgia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mad for vlad : russia 's prime minister got plenty of face time during the recent brief war ever since russia and georgia launched an information war in the world 's media , the baltic nations have been exposed to two often-conflicting viewpoints about the war and its consequences . so much so that baltic officials began pondering how to curb broadcasts from neighboring russia .
or at least to be able to compete with them .
russian television channels , available in the baltics on cable , showed the russian military presence in georgia as positive .
they hailed last week 's eu summit , where european nations stopped short of sanctions on moscow , as a success of the russian foreign policy .
by contrast , latvian and estonian news took a pro-western tone , condemning the first russian military excursion into another sovereign country since the soviet union fell in 1991 .
a recent survey by the riga-based marketing and public opinion research center showed latvia 's population is evenly split in its support for either side in the five-day conflict between georgia and russia .
experts say it is partly because two opposing media spheres divide ethnic latvians and russians .
" theoretically , the national board for radio and tv broadcasting can forbid broadcast of the russian shows , " the executive director of the broadcasters ' association gunta lidaka told a russian-language newspaper in latvia .
but that would hit only latvian-based cable providers , whose business relies heavily on their russian packages .
with russian-language tv also available by satellite , a ban seems unlikely .
increased broadcasts at time of crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live at five : medvedev talks to more than his own nation the question of russian broadcasts in the baltics traditionally arises at times of crisis with moscow .
estonia and latvia - two countries with a large russian population - have watched the caucasus crisis through the lens of their own history .
occupied by the soviet union in 1940 , they were subjected to labor migrants from russia , some whom stayed when the baltics re-gained their independence in 1991 .
cable companies now do good business with their russian packages because they 're popular with their clients .
the first baltic channel , a local version of the russia 's first channel , and other major russian channels are in demand by clients of latvia 's largest cable operator , baltkom , company spokesman lauris klavins told the dpa news agency .
one reason for their popularity is the russian speakers who account for the third of the population in latvia and estonia .
reaching the russian-speaking audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings ran high in estonia 's russian community when the estonian government decided to relocate the soviet-era war memorial from the city square to military cemetery in 2007 , it caused riots among mostly russian-speaking population and exposed a deep rift between ethnic estonians and non-estonians .
at the time estonian officials began talking about launching a new tv channel aimed at local russians .
it has remained on paper , but the crisis in georgia threw the issue back into spotlight .
most cable packages includes more channels in russian than in latvian , estonian , or even in english .
but for now , channels from russia will continue to stream news , entertainment , music shows directly into baltic living rooms . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

among them were charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany , and juergen ruettgers , premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where krefeld is located .
knobloch said the synagogue " stands for that which we lost and for that which we want to rebuild . "
jews are back in the mainstream of german society and would never allow this right to be contested , she said .
the new synagogue can accommodate up to 300 worshippers .
it is located in a converted commercial building that also houses a jewish community centre , library and meeting rooms .
extensive renovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for charlotte knobloch , right , the new synagogue is a symbol of jewish revival in germany some 12 million euros -lrb- $ 17 million -rrb- were pumped into the renovation work , which was carried out under the auspices of the non-profit isidor herzfelder foundation .
there are around 1,100 jews living in and around krefeld , an industrial city some 500 kilometers south-west of berlin .
the only item that recalls the old synagogue is a three-piece ornamental window designed by dutch artist jan thorn-prikker for the original building in 1928 .

the window was irreparably damaged when the synagogue was burned down during the nazi pogrom of 1938 , but was reconstructed from the original drawings kept at a local museum .
renaissance of jewish culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krefeld synagogue can accomodate up to 300 worshippers the opening of the synagogue , the 20th in north rhine-westphalia , is another sign of the renaissance of jewish culture in germany .
in the nearby city of essen the old synagogue is being given an extensive makeover so that it will be ready by 2010 when essen becomes european capital of culture .
more restoration work is taking place on another synagogue destroyed during the nazi pogrom in darmstadt , not far from the banking centre of frankfurt .
some 600,000 jews lived in germany before world war ii , but the figure declined to around 12,000 after 1945 .
today , there are more than 110,000 jews or people of jewish origin , giving germany one of the largest jewish populations of any country in europe . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian media report that even in hitherto tranquil russian regions such as tatarstan and bashkiria , muslim separatists have become more independence-minded of late .
for years , russia 's leaders have sought to quell separatist tendencies by what they describe as " isolated extremists . "
the lengths to which the kremlin is prepared to go is best illustrated by restive chechnya , battered into submission by two wars since 1994 .
a declaration addressed to the council of europe by russian human rights activists said that " the situation in the north caucasus republics has became greatly more agitated since the war between russia and georgia in the south caucasus . "
lyudmila alekseyeva , head of the moscow helsinki group , and the document 's other signatories are warning of a further escalation .
avenging the death of a journalist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian police have crushed an opposition rally in nazran last year islamist groups have vowed to avenge yevloyev , who died of a gunshot wound to the head while in a police car .
opposition activists in ingushetia accuse ingush president murat zyazikov of " political murder " and demand that the ex-kgb general be removed from office .
zyazikov 's cousin was shot and killed shortly after yevloyev 's death .
alekseyeva said that north caucasus leaders , hand-picked by the kremlin , were using raw violence to suppress opposition in the region .
pointing to the numerous killings in recent years , ingush opposition activist magomet khasbiyev has accused the authorities of " genocide " - echoing the kremlin , which said it had invaded georgia to stop georgians ' " genocide " against south ossetians .
people in north caucasus regions other than ingushetia also feel threatened by moscow authorities , including in kabardino-balkaria , karachai-cherkessia , and north ossetia .
territorial disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 40 russian soldiers and police officers have been killed in ingushetia this year conflicts in the caucasus - the multiethnic region between the black and caspian seas - have historically been fueled by territorial disputes , the islamic faith , and deep-seated resistance to russian domination .
" we must ask europe or the us to separate us from russia , " khasbiyev told the liberal moscow radio station ekho moskvy .
" if we are n't acceptable to this country , we do n't know what else we should do . "
moscow reinforced its military presence in the north caucasus last year to deal with the 500 to 700 rebels thought to operate there .
yevloyev had repeatedly decried the brutality of russian police and soldiers , and accused authorities of turning a blind eye to the abduction , torture , and murder of innocent people .
reports by the russian human rights group memorial have detailed the violence suffered by dozens of people in the region .
volatile situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fought two wars in separatist chechnya moscow is keeping an ever warier eye on the volatile situation .
the danger of terrorist attacks by islamists anywhere in the country has not passed since the wars in chechnya .
according to alexander bastrykin , chief investigator in russia 's prosecutor general 's office , so far this year about 40 soldiers and police officers have been killed in ingushetia alone , not to mention the dozens of rebels who are often " wiped out " - to use the official jargon - in large numbers in armed encounters .
following moscow 's formal recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia 's independence , georgian justice minister nika gvaramia warned russia that it could break up as a result .
" i 'm certain that separatism will lead to russia 's complete collapse , " he said .

russian media report that even in hitherto tranquil russian regions such as tatarstan and bashkiria , muslim separatists have become more independence-minded of late .
for years , russia 's leaders have sought to quell separatist tendencies by what they describe as " isolated extremists . "
the lengths to which the kremlin is prepared to go is best illustrated by restive chechnya , battered into submission by two wars since 1994 .
a declaration addressed to the council of europe by russian human rights activists said that " the situation in the north caucasus republics has became greatly more agitated since the war between russia and georgia in the south caucasus . "
lyudmila alekseyeva , head of the moscow helsinki group , and the document 's other signatories are warning of a further escalation .
avenging the death of a journalist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian police have crushed an opposition rally in nazran last year islamist groups have vowed to avenge yevloyev , who died of a gunshot wound to the head while in a police car .

grass caused a furor in germany two years ago when he admitted that he had served in the notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii , but chose to keep quiet about it for decades , during which he became a moral authority in post-war germany .
tammen plans to display drawings and sculptures by grass , who studied sculpture and graphics , at this year 's korea international art fair from sept .

the wreckage burned just metres from a residential community and debris blocked a section of russia 's trans-siberian railway .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 14.09.2008 baltic states witness media war over georgia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mad for vlad : russia 's prime minister got plenty of face time during the recent brief war ever since russia and georgia launched an information war in the world 's media , the baltic nations have been exposed to two often-conflicting viewpoints about the war and its consequences . so much so that baltic officials began pondering how to curb broadcasts from neighboring russia .
or at least to be able to compete with them .
russian television channels , available in the baltics on cable , showed the russian military presence in georgia as positive .
they hailed last week 's eu summit , where european nations stopped short of sanctions on moscow , as a success of the russian foreign policy .
by contrast , latvian and estonian news took a pro-western tone , condemning the first russian military excursion into another sovereign country since the soviet union fell in 1991 .
a recent survey by the riga-based marketing and public opinion research center showed latvia 's population is evenly split in its support for either side in the five-day conflict between georgia and russia .
experts say it is partly because two opposing media spheres divide ethnic latvians and russians .
" theoretically , the national board for radio and tv broadcasting can forbid broadcast of the russian shows , " the executive director of the broadcasters ' association gunta lidaka told a russian-language newspaper in latvia .
but that would hit only latvian-based cable providers , whose business relies heavily on their russian packages .
with russian-language tv also available by satellite , a ban seems unlikely .
increased broadcasts at time of crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live at five : medvedev talks to more than his own nation the question of russian broadcasts in the baltics traditionally arises at times of crisis with moscow .
estonia and latvia - two countries with a large russian population - have watched the caucasus crisis through the lens of their own history .
occupied by the soviet union in 1940 , they were subjected to labor migrants from russia , some whom stayed when the baltics re-gained their independence in 1991 .
cable companies now do good business with their russian packages because they 're popular with their clients .
the first baltic channel , a local version of the russia 's first channel , and other major russian channels are in demand by clients of latvia 's largest cable operator , baltkom , company spokesman lauris klavins told the dpa news agency .
one reason for their popularity is the russian speakers who account for the third of the population in latvia and estonia .
reaching the russian-speaking audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings ran high in estonia 's russian community when the estonian government decided to relocate the soviet-era war memorial from the city square to military cemetery in 2007 , it caused riots among mostly russian-speaking population and exposed a deep rift between ethnic estonians and non-estonians .
at the time estonian officials began talking about launching a new tv channel aimed at local russians .
it has remained on paper , but the crisis in georgia threw the issue back into spotlight .
most cable packages includes more channels in russian than in latvian , estonian , or even in english .
but for now , channels from russia will continue to stream news , entertainment , music shows directly into baltic living rooms . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

or at least to be able to compete with them .
russian television channels , available in the baltics on cable , showed the russian military presence in georgia as positive .
they hailed last week 's eu summit , where european nations stopped short of sanctions on moscow , as a success of the russian foreign policy .
by contrast , latvian and estonian news took a pro-western tone , condemning the first russian military excursion into another sovereign country since the soviet union fell in 1991 .
a recent survey by the riga-based marketing and public opinion research center showed latvia 's population is evenly split in its support for either side in the five-day conflict between georgia and russia .
experts say it is partly because two opposing media spheres divide ethnic latvians and russians .
" theoretically , the national board for radio and tv broadcasting can forbid broadcast of the russian shows , " the executive director of the broadcasters ' association gunta lidaka told a russian-language newspaper in latvia .
but that would hit only latvian-based cable providers , whose business relies heavily on their russian packages .
with russian-language tv also available by satellite , a ban seems unlikely .
increased broadcasts at time of crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live at five : medvedev talks to more than his own nation the question of russian broadcasts in the baltics traditionally arises at times of crisis with moscow .
estonia and latvia - two countries with a large russian population - have watched the caucasus crisis through the lens of their own history .
occupied by the soviet union in 1940 , they were subjected to labor migrants from russia , some whom stayed when the baltics re-gained their independence in 1991 .
cable companies now do good business with their russian packages because they 're popular with their clients .
the first baltic channel , a local version of the russia 's first channel , and other major russian channels are in demand by clients of latvia 's largest cable operator , baltkom , company spokesman lauris klavins told the dpa news agency .
one reason for their popularity is the russian speakers who account for the third of the population in latvia and estonia .
reaching the russian-speaking audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings ran high in estonia 's russian community when the estonian government decided to relocate the soviet-era war memorial from the city square to military cemetery in 2007 , it caused riots among mostly russian-speaking population and exposed a deep rift between ethnic estonians and non-estonians .
at the time estonian officials began talking about launching a new tv channel aimed at local russians .
it has remained on paper , but the crisis in georgia threw the issue back into spotlight .
most cable packages includes more channels in russian than in latvian , estonian , or even in english .
but for now , channels from russia will continue to stream news , entertainment , music shows directly into baltic living rooms . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

among them were charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany , and juergen ruettgers , premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where krefeld is located .
knobloch said the synagogue " stands for that which we lost and for that which we want to rebuild . "
jews are back in the mainstream of german society and would never allow this right to be contested , she said .
the new synagogue can accommodate up to 300 worshippers .
it is located in a converted commercial building that also houses a jewish community centre , library and meeting rooms .
extensive renovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for charlotte knobloch , right , the new synagogue is a symbol of jewish revival in germany some 12 million euros -lrb- $ 17 million -rrb- were pumped into the renovation work , which was carried out under the auspices of the non-profit isidor herzfelder foundation .
there are around 1,100 jews living in and around krefeld , an industrial city some 500 kilometers south-west of berlin .
the only item that recalls the old synagogue is a three-piece ornamental window designed by dutch artist jan thorn-prikker for the original building in 1928 .
the window was irreparably damaged when the synagogue was burned down during the nazi pogrom of 1938 , but was reconstructed from the original drawings kept at a local museum .

more restoration work is taking place on another synagogue destroyed during the nazi pogrom in darmstadt , not far from the banking centre of frankfurt .
some 600,000 jews lived in germany before world war ii , but the figure declined to around 12,000 after 1945 .

or at least to be able to compete with them .
russian television channels , available in the baltics on cable , showed the russian military presence in georgia as positive .
they hailed last week 's eu summit , where european nations stopped short of sanctions on moscow , as a success of the russian foreign policy .
by contrast , latvian and estonian news took a pro-western tone , condemning the first russian military excursion into another sovereign country since the soviet union fell in 1991 .
a recent survey by the riga-based marketing and public opinion research center showed latvia 's population is evenly split in its support for either side in the five-day conflict between georgia and russia .
experts say it is partly because two opposing media spheres divide ethnic latvians and russians .
" theoretically , the national board for radio and tv broadcasting can forbid broadcast of the russian shows , " the executive director of the broadcasters ' association gunta lidaka told a russian-language newspaper in latvia .
but that would hit only latvian-based cable providers , whose business relies heavily on their russian packages .
with russian-language tv also available by satellite , a ban seems unlikely .
increased broadcasts at time of crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live at five : medvedev talks to more than his own nation the question of russian broadcasts in the baltics traditionally arises at times of crisis with moscow .
estonia and latvia - two countries with a large russian population - have watched the caucasus crisis through the lens of their own history .
occupied by the soviet union in 1940 , they were subjected to labor migrants from russia , some whom stayed when the baltics re-gained their independence in 1991 .
cable companies now do good business with their russian packages because they 're popular with their clients .
the first baltic channel , a local version of the russia 's first channel , and other major russian channels are in demand by clients of latvia 's largest cable operator , baltkom , company spokesman lauris klavins told the dpa news agency .
one reason for their popularity is the russian speakers who account for the third of the population in latvia and estonia .

russian media report that even in hitherto tranquil russian regions such as tatarstan and bashkiria , muslim separatists have become more independence-minded of late .
for years , russia 's leaders have sought to quell separatist tendencies by what they describe as " isolated extremists . "
the lengths to which the kremlin is prepared to go is best illustrated by restive chechnya , battered into submission by two wars since 1994 .
a declaration addressed to the council of europe by russian human rights activists said that " the situation in the north caucasus republics has became greatly more agitated since the war between russia and georgia in the south caucasus . "
lyudmila alekseyeva , head of the moscow helsinki group , and the document 's other signatories are warning of a further escalation .

opposition activists in ingushetia accuse ingush president murat zyazikov of " political murder " and demand that the ex-kgb general be removed from office .
zyazikov 's cousin was shot and killed shortly after yevloyev 's death .
alekseyeva said that north caucasus leaders , hand-picked by the kremlin , were using raw violence to suppress opposition in the region .
pointing to the numerous killings in recent years , ingush opposition activist magomet khasbiyev has accused the authorities of " genocide " - echoing the kremlin , which said it had invaded georgia to stop georgians ' " genocide " against south ossetians .
people in north caucasus regions other than ingushetia also feel threatened by moscow authorities , including in kabardino-balkaria , karachai-cherkessia , and north ossetia .
territorial disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 40 russian soldiers and police officers have been killed in ingushetia this year conflicts in the caucasus - the multiethnic region between the black and caspian seas - have historically been fueled by territorial disputes , the islamic faith , and deep-seated resistance to russian domination .
" we must ask europe or the us to separate us from russia , " khasbiyev told the liberal moscow radio station ekho moskvy .
" if we are n't acceptable to this country , we do n't know what else we should do . "
moscow reinforced its military presence in the north caucasus last year to deal with the 500 to 700 rebels thought to operate there .
yevloyev had repeatedly decried the brutality of russian police and soldiers , and accused authorities of turning a blind eye to the abduction , torture , and murder of innocent people .
reports by the russian human rights group memorial have detailed the violence suffered by dozens of people in the region .

russian media report that even in hitherto tranquil russian regions such as tatarstan and bashkiria , muslim separatists have become more independence-minded of late .
for years , russia 's leaders have sought to quell separatist tendencies by what they describe as " isolated extremists . "
the lengths to which the kremlin is prepared to go is best illustrated by restive chechnya , battered into submission by two wars since 1994 .
a declaration addressed to the council of europe by russian human rights activists said that " the situation in the north caucasus republics has became greatly more agitated since the war between russia and georgia in the south caucasus . "
lyudmila alekseyeva , head of the moscow helsinki group , and the document 's other signatories are warning of a further escalation .

opposition activists in ingushetia accuse ingush president murat zyazikov of " political murder " and demand that the ex-kgb general be removed from office .
zyazikov 's cousin was shot and killed shortly after yevloyev 's death .
alekseyeva said that north caucasus leaders , hand-picked by the kremlin , were using raw violence to suppress opposition in the region .
pointing to the numerous killings in recent years , ingush opposition activist magomet khasbiyev has accused the authorities of " genocide " - echoing the kremlin , which said it had invaded georgia to stop georgians ' " genocide " against south ossetians .
people in north caucasus regions other than ingushetia also feel threatened by moscow authorities , including in kabardino-balkaria , karachai-cherkessia , and north ossetia .
territorial disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 40 russian soldiers and police officers have been killed in ingushetia this year conflicts in the caucasus - the multiethnic region between the black and caspian seas - have historically been fueled by territorial disputes , the islamic faith , and deep-seated resistance to russian domination .
" we must ask europe or the us to separate us from russia , " khasbiyev told the liberal moscow radio station ekho moskvy .
" if we are n't acceptable to this country , we do n't know what else we should do . "
moscow reinforced its military presence in the north caucasus last year to deal with the 500 to 700 rebels thought to operate there .
yevloyev had repeatedly decried the brutality of russian police and soldiers , and accused authorities of turning a blind eye to the abduction , torture , and murder of innocent people .
reports by the russian human rights group memorial have detailed the violence suffered by dozens of people in the region .

the danger of terrorist attacks by islamists anywhere in the country has not passed since the wars in chechnya .
according to alexander bastrykin , chief investigator in russia 's prosecutor general 's office , so far this year about 40 soldiers and police officers have been killed in ingushetia alone , not to mention the dozens of rebels who are often " wiped out " - to use the official jargon - in large numbers in armed encounters .
following moscow 's formal recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia 's independence , georgian justice minister nika gvaramia warned russia that it could break up as a result .
" i 'm certain that separatism will lead to russia 's complete collapse , " he said .

among them were charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany , and juergen ruettgers , premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where krefeld is located .
knobloch said the synagogue " stands for that which we lost and for that which we want to rebuild . "
jews are back in the mainstream of german society and would never allow this right to be contested , she said .
the new synagogue can accommodate up to 300 worshippers .
it is located in a converted commercial building that also houses a jewish community centre , library and meeting rooms .
extensive renovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for charlotte knobloch , right , the new synagogue is a symbol of jewish revival in germany some 12 million euros -lrb- $ 17 million -rrb- were pumped into the renovation work , which was carried out under the auspices of the non-profit isidor herzfelder foundation .
there are around 1,100 jews living in and around krefeld , an industrial city some 500 kilometers south-west of berlin .
the only item that recalls the old synagogue is a three-piece ornamental window designed by dutch artist jan thorn-prikker for the original building in 1928 .
the window was irreparably damaged when the synagogue was burned down during the nazi pogrom of 1938 , but was reconstructed from the original drawings kept at a local museum .
renaissance of jewish culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krefeld synagogue can accomodate up to 300 worshippers the opening of the synagogue , the 20th in north rhine-westphalia , is another sign of the renaissance of jewish culture in germany .
in the nearby city of essen the old synagogue is being given an extensive makeover so that it will be ready by 2010 when essen becomes european capital of culture .
more restoration work is taking place on another synagogue destroyed during the nazi pogrom in darmstadt , not far from the banking centre of frankfurt .
some 600,000 jews lived in germany before world war ii , but the figure declined to around 12,000 after 1945 .
today , there are more than 110,000 jews or people of jewish origin , giving germany one of the largest jewish populations of any country in europe . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at 21 years and 74 days , vettel , who started from pole , broke the previous mark of 22 years , 26 days set in august 2003 by fernando alonso at the hungarian grand prix , to give his team their first-ever grand prix victory .
as vettel crossed the line he briefly buried his head in his hands as he drove down the straight and told the race engineers of his italian team that he was simply speechless .
" grazie mile , grazie mile , " he said over the intercom .
due to wet conditions , the race started behind the safety car , allowing vettel to keep the lead , which he held onto until his first fuel stop .
he then regained the lead after the other drivers came into the pits for their fuel stop .
less rain than predicted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel stunned formula one with his italian gp win although forecasts predicted more rain during the race , fernando alonso in a renault and mark webber in a red bull chose intermediate tyres during their first pit stop , prompting others to also change to intermediates .
championship leader hamilton in a mclaren-mercedes , who started from 15th , took a while to get going , but then started overtaking the field from the back .
he pitted shortly after vettel , but , unlike most of the other drivers , put in enough fuel to stay out for the remaining race .
however , even though he had planned on a one-stop strategy , he had to come in a second time as he went out on wet tyres after his first stop and had to change to intermediates .
upfront vettel continued pushing for a historic victory ahead of kovalainen , kubica and alonso .
furious chase behind them , hamilton was continuing his furious chase and with 12 laps remaining , was running a close seventh behind nick heidfeld and felipe massa .
the briton seemed to be pushing to overtake the brazilian , but then suddenly with just a few laps to go , looked as if he needed to spare his tyres and made no further attempts to get past .
he finished seventh , behind heidfeld and massa and ahead of webber , who took the final championship point .
hamilton retains the lead with 78 points from ferrari 's felipe massa , who finished sixth to go to 77 points . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the wreckage burned just metres from a residential community and debris blocked a section of russia 's trans-siberian railway .
television showed firefighters and investigators sifting through the wreckage which was spread over about four square kilometres , officials said .
investigators have recovered the aircraft 's two black box recorders , which they hope will clarify the cause of the accident .

among the victims were citizens of azerbaijan , ukraine , germany , the united states , france , switzerland , latvia , turkey and italy .
seven children died in the tragedy .
among the dead was general gennady troshev , a government advisor and a key general in russia 's war in chechnya , the country 's transportation ministry was cited as saying by the news agency interfax .
irina andrianova , spokeswoman for the civil defense ministry , said the aircraft lost contact with air traffic control at around 1800 metres off the ground .
the plane exploded into flames upon hitting the ground at 5.00 am -lrb- 2300 gmt -rrb- , she added .

the airplane was leased by aeroflot until 2013 from irish firm pinewatch limited .
president dmitry medvedev was being briefed on the crash and transport minister igor levitin was to fly to the site of the disaster , news agencies said .

as the events which led to german reunification in 1990 began to unfold , grass was very vocal in his opposition and referred to it as an " annexation . "
grass caused a furor in germany two years ago when he admitted that he had served in the notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii , but chose to keep quiet about it for decades , during which he became a moral authority in post-war germany .

among them were charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany , and juergen ruettgers , premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where krefeld is located .
knobloch said the synagogue " stands for that which we lost and for that which we want to rebuild . "
jews are back in the mainstream of german society and would never allow this right to be contested , she said .
the new synagogue can accommodate up to 300 worshippers .
it is located in a converted commercial building that also houses a jewish community centre , library and meeting rooms .
extensive renovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for charlotte knobloch , right , the new synagogue is a symbol of jewish revival in germany some 12 million euros -lrb- $ 17 million -rrb- were pumped into the renovation work , which was carried out under the auspices of the non-profit isidor herzfelder foundation .
there are around 1,100 jews living in and around krefeld , an industrial city some 500 kilometers south-west of berlin .
the only item that recalls the old synagogue is a three-piece ornamental window designed by dutch artist jan thorn-prikker for the original building in 1928 .
the window was irreparably damaged when the synagogue was burned down during the nazi pogrom of 1938 , but was reconstructed from the original drawings kept at a local museum .

more restoration work is taking place on another synagogue destroyed during the nazi pogrom in darmstadt , not far from the banking centre of frankfurt .
some 600,000 jews lived in germany before world war ii , but the figure declined to around 12,000 after 1945 .
today , there are more than 110,000 jews or people of jewish origin , giving germany one of the largest jewish populations of any country in europe . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at 21 years and 74 days , vettel , who started from pole , broke the previous mark of 22 years , 26 days set in august 2003 by fernando alonso at the hungarian grand prix , to give his team their first-ever grand prix victory .
as vettel crossed the line he briefly buried his head in his hands as he drove down the straight and told the race engineers of his italian team that he was simply speechless .
" grazie mile , grazie mile , " he said over the intercom .
due to wet conditions , the race started behind the safety car , allowing vettel to keep the lead , which he held onto until his first fuel stop .
he then regained the lead after the other drivers came into the pits for their fuel stop .
less rain than predicted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel stunned formula one with his italian gp win although forecasts predicted more rain during the race , fernando alonso in a renault and mark webber in a red bull chose intermediate tyres during their first pit stop , prompting others to also change to intermediates .
championship leader hamilton in a mclaren-mercedes , who started from 15th , took a while to get going , but then started overtaking the field from the back .
he pitted shortly after vettel , but , unlike most of the other drivers , put in enough fuel to stay out for the remaining race .
however , even though he had planned on a one-stop strategy , he had to come in a second time as he went out on wet tyres after his first stop and had to change to intermediates .
upfront vettel continued pushing for a historic victory ahead of kovalainen , kubica and alonso .
furious chase behind them , hamilton was continuing his furious chase and with 12 laps remaining , was running a close seventh behind nick heidfeld and felipe massa .
the briton seemed to be pushing to overtake the brazilian , but then suddenly with just a few laps to go , looked as if he needed to spare his tyres and made no further attempts to get past .
he finished seventh , behind heidfeld and massa and ahead of webber , who took the final championship point .

russian media report that even in hitherto tranquil russian regions such as tatarstan and bashkiria , muslim separatists have become more independence-minded of late .
for years , russia 's leaders have sought to quell separatist tendencies by what they describe as " isolated extremists . "
the lengths to which the kremlin is prepared to go is best illustrated by restive chechnya , battered into submission by two wars since 1994 .
a declaration addressed to the council of europe by russian human rights activists said that " the situation in the north caucasus republics has became greatly more agitated since the war between russia and georgia in the south caucasus . "
lyudmila alekseyeva , head of the moscow helsinki group , and the document 's other signatories are warning of a further escalation .
avenging the death of a journalist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian police have crushed an opposition rally in nazran last year islamist groups have vowed to avenge yevloyev , who died of a gunshot wound to the head while in a police car .
opposition activists in ingushetia accuse ingush president murat zyazikov of " political murder " and demand that the ex-kgb general be removed from office .
zyazikov 's cousin was shot and killed shortly after yevloyev 's death .
alekseyeva said that north caucasus leaders , hand-picked by the kremlin , were using raw violence to suppress opposition in the region .
pointing to the numerous killings in recent years , ingush opposition activist magomet khasbiyev has accused the authorities of " genocide " - echoing the kremlin , which said it had invaded georgia to stop georgians ' " genocide " against south ossetians .
people in north caucasus regions other than ingushetia also feel threatened by moscow authorities , including in kabardino-balkaria , karachai-cherkessia , and north ossetia .
territorial disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 40 russian soldiers and police officers have been killed in ingushetia this year conflicts in the caucasus - the multiethnic region between the black and caspian seas - have historically been fueled by territorial disputes , the islamic faith , and deep-seated resistance to russian domination .
" we must ask europe or the us to separate us from russia , " khasbiyev told the liberal moscow radio station ekho moskvy .
" if we are n't acceptable to this country , we do n't know what else we should do . "
moscow reinforced its military presence in the north caucasus last year to deal with the 500 to 700 rebels thought to operate there .
yevloyev had repeatedly decried the brutality of russian police and soldiers , and accused authorities of turning a blind eye to the abduction , torture , and murder of innocent people .
reports by the russian human rights group memorial have detailed the violence suffered by dozens of people in the region .
volatile situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fought two wars in separatist chechnya moscow is keeping an ever warier eye on the volatile situation .
the danger of terrorist attacks by islamists anywhere in the country has not passed since the wars in chechnya .
according to alexander bastrykin , chief investigator in russia 's prosecutor general 's office , so far this year about 40 soldiers and police officers have been killed in ingushetia alone , not to mention the dozens of rebels who are often " wiped out " - to use the official jargon - in large numbers in armed encounters .
following moscow 's formal recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia 's independence , georgian justice minister nika gvaramia warned russia that it could break up as a result .
" i 'm certain that separatism will lead to russia 's complete collapse , " he said .
the response by russian president dmitri medvedev was pointedly unconcerned : " i do not see any such danger so long as people abroad do not meddle in these issues , thinking up various scenarios for dismembering russia .

russian media report that even in hitherto tranquil russian regions such as tatarstan and bashkiria , muslim separatists have become more independence-minded of late .
for years , russia 's leaders have sought to quell separatist tendencies by what they describe as " isolated extremists . "
the lengths to which the kremlin is prepared to go is best illustrated by restive chechnya , battered into submission by two wars since 1994 .
a declaration addressed to the council of europe by russian human rights activists said that " the situation in the north caucasus republics has became greatly more agitated since the war between russia and georgia in the south caucasus . "
lyudmila alekseyeva , head of the moscow helsinki group , and the document 's other signatories are warning of a further escalation .
avenging the death of a journalist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian police have crushed an opposition rally in nazran last year islamist groups have vowed to avenge yevloyev , who died of a gunshot wound to the head while in a police car .
opposition activists in ingushetia accuse ingush president murat zyazikov of " political murder " and demand that the ex-kgb general be removed from office .
zyazikov 's cousin was shot and killed shortly after yevloyev 's death .
alekseyeva said that north caucasus leaders , hand-picked by the kremlin , were using raw violence to suppress opposition in the region .
pointing to the numerous killings in recent years , ingush opposition activist magomet khasbiyev has accused the authorities of " genocide " - echoing the kremlin , which said it had invaded georgia to stop georgians ' " genocide " against south ossetians .
people in north caucasus regions other than ingushetia also feel threatened by moscow authorities , including in kabardino-balkaria , karachai-cherkessia , and north ossetia .
territorial disputes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 40 russian soldiers and police officers have been killed in ingushetia this year conflicts in the caucasus - the multiethnic region between the black and caspian seas - have historically been fueled by territorial disputes , the islamic faith , and deep-seated resistance to russian domination .
" we must ask europe or the us to separate us from russia , " khasbiyev told the liberal moscow radio station ekho moskvy .
" if we are n't acceptable to this country , we do n't know what else we should do . "
moscow reinforced its military presence in the north caucasus last year to deal with the 500 to 700 rebels thought to operate there .
yevloyev had repeatedly decried the brutality of russian police and soldiers , and accused authorities of turning a blind eye to the abduction , torture , and murder of innocent people .
reports by the russian human rights group memorial have detailed the violence suffered by dozens of people in the region .
volatile situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fought two wars in separatist chechnya moscow is keeping an ever warier eye on the volatile situation .
the danger of terrorist attacks by islamists anywhere in the country has not passed since the wars in chechnya .
according to alexander bastrykin , chief investigator in russia 's prosecutor general 's office , so far this year about 40 soldiers and police officers have been killed in ingushetia alone , not to mention the dozens of rebels who are often " wiped out " - to use the official jargon - in large numbers in armed encounters .
following moscow 's formal recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia 's independence , georgian justice minister nika gvaramia warned russia that it could break up as a result .
" i 'm certain that separatism will lead to russia 's complete collapse , " he said .
the response by russian president dmitri medvedev was pointedly unconcerned : " i do not see any such danger so long as people abroad do not meddle in these issues , thinking up various scenarios for dismembering russia .

at 21 years and 74 days , vettel , who started from pole , broke the previous mark of 22 years , 26 days set in august 2003 by fernando alonso at the hungarian grand prix , to give his team their first-ever grand prix victory .
as vettel crossed the line he briefly buried his head in his hands as he drove down the straight and told the race engineers of his italian team that he was simply speechless .
" grazie mile , grazie mile , " he said over the intercom .
due to wet conditions , the race started behind the safety car , allowing vettel to keep the lead , which he held onto until his first fuel stop .
he then regained the lead after the other drivers came into the pits for their fuel stop .
less rain than predicted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel stunned formula one with his italian gp win although forecasts predicted more rain during the race , fernando alonso in a renault and mark webber in a red bull chose intermediate tyres during their first pit stop , prompting others to also change to intermediates .
championship leader hamilton in a mclaren-mercedes , who started from 15th , took a while to get going , but then started overtaking the field from the back .
he pitted shortly after vettel , but , unlike most of the other drivers , put in enough fuel to stay out for the remaining race .
however , even though he had planned on a one-stop strategy , he had to come in a second time as he went out on wet tyres after his first stop and had to change to intermediates .
upfront vettel continued pushing for a historic victory ahead of kovalainen , kubica and alonso .
furious chase behind them , hamilton was continuing his furious chase and with 12 laps remaining , was running a close seventh behind nick heidfeld and felipe massa .
the briton seemed to be pushing to overtake the brazilian , but then suddenly with just a few laps to go , looked as if he needed to spare his tyres and made no further attempts to get past .
he finished seventh , behind heidfeld and massa and ahead of webber , who took the final championship point .
hamilton retains the lead with 78 points from ferrari 's felipe massa , who finished sixth to go to 77 points . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gaffar market is globalisation 's unruly child .
on its dirty , traffic-clogged streets are hawked chinese mobile phones , taiwanese computer peripherals , japanese knock-offs , local flowers and ice cream , imported wine and beer .
there are also currency exchange shops , one of which advertises itself as a " full and fledged money changer " .
shoaib , who owns a phone shop with his brother , yusuf , on the other side of the city , was walking down a street in the sprawling market with a friend when the force of the explosion knocked him out .
with dust and smoke rising from the pavement , bicycles parked near a tree twisting in the heat and bloodied people howling in pain or running helter-skelter , shoaib managed to make a call to yusuf before he passed out . "
blast ho gaya .
tu ..
-lrb- there has been a blast .
you .. -rrb- " , yusuf , 26 , remembers his brother saying on the phone , before the line went silent .
mohammed shoaib is among the 90 people wounded in saturday evening 's bomb blasts which ripped through busy shopping areas in delhi .
the explosions killed at least 20 people .
waiting outside the hospital where his brother lies with deep wounds , yusuf is at a loss for words .
" every other day , we go to this market to pick up our supplies .
this day he drove a friend on his bike and i stayed back . "
spree of attacks such days are becoming increasingly common in the lives of indians .
more than 400 people have died since october 2005 in bomb attacks in its cities .
the police have blamed islamist militant groups and a shadowy students ' group for some bombings .
a few suspects have been picked up in each case , but there have been no convictions .
on saturday evening , the blasts in delhi took the lives of the well-to-do and the poor , of men and women , of the young and the old , and of india 's ubiquitous " unknown " people , usually dirt-poor migrants or beggars who roam the city to eke out a living .
at one city hospital , the youngest of the eight dead there was 20-year-old babita , and the oldest 60-year-old harichand .
three of the dead are listed as unknown or " uk " , 15 hours after the explosion .
three are women , two are men , and the unknown have no sex on the hospital list .
among the 69 wounded at this hospital , 14 are women .
the oldest victim is 60-year-old pa purusottam , and the youngest is 18-year-old sonal jain .
there are , again , three " unknowns " .
the dead and the wounded come from all over india in a city driven by hard-working migrants .
like 20-year-old babita negi , one of the youngest victims of the blast , who met a friend at a circular park , which sits atop delhi 's biggest underground railway station .
one of the bombs in a rubbish bin exploded as she took a walk in the park with her friend and snuffed out her life .
babita was the daughter of a government canteen worker and had just taken up a beautician 's course .
the lush park which overlooks delhi 's elegant colonnaded shopping district of connaught place is an unlikely location for an explosion .
a board outside prohibits " plucking of flowers , cooking , smoking , pitching of tents , loudspeakers , shooting , washing of clothes , swimming , bathing , cricket , football and hockey games " .
and yet , somebody walked in with a bomb and put it into a rubbish bin , leading to the bloody havoc .
unexpected chander negi , father of babita , still can not believe that his daughter died taking an evening walk with her friend at a pretty city park .
" you do n't expect people to die in such places .
that 's why i kept waiting for babita to return home till somebody called up to say that she was caught up in the blast , " he says .
you also do not expect a bomb to go off at a downtown bus station , while waiting for a bus to take you home .
shakil ahmed , 32 , used to drive the car of a employee with the indian parliament .
he finished his work , parked the car in the office garage , and stood at a bus stand to take a bus home to his wife and two children , a five-year-old-son and a three-year-old daughter .
that is when a bomb in a pale green rubbish bin nearby exploded and killed him .
" he was just waiting to come home to family , waiting for a bus , " says his father-in-law , waiting to take shakil 's body home .
the latest delhi bombings follow the eerie script of recent blasts in other parts of the country - an e-mail from a group calling itself indian mujahideen reaches a newspaper or tv news office , and then serial , low-intensity blasts are triggered in busy places .
the only difference this time is that the perpetrators stuck in more unusual places : a quiet city park , a downtown bus stand , a cinema sidewalk .
the aim , clearly , is to impose fear over the city .
but it is not going to be easy .
the morning after the blasts , people crowded the gaffar market streets , young couples stood outside the shuttered park wondering whether it would reopen on monday , and at a main city hospital , gloved cleaners scrubbed bloodstains off a row of yellow-painted stretchers .
" it was really bad and busy last night .
now we are back to normal , " said one of the cleaners .

mohammed shoaib is among the 90 people wounded in saturday evening 's bomb blasts which ripped through busy shopping areas in delhi .
the explosions killed at least 20 people .

" every other day , we go to this market to pick up our supplies .

spree of attacks such days are becoming increasingly common in the lives of indians .
more than 400 people have died since october 2005 in bomb attacks in its cities .
more than 90 people were wounded in the explosions the police have blamed islamist militant groups and a shadowy students ' group for some bombings .
a few suspects have been picked up in each case , but there have been no convictions .
on saturday evening , the blasts in delhi took the lives of the well-to-do and the poor , of men and women , of the young and the old , and of india 's ubiquitous " unknown " people , usually dirt-poor migrants or beggars who roam the city to eke out a living .
at one city hospital , the youngest of the eight dead there was 20-year-old babita , and the oldest 60-year-old harichand .
three of the dead are listed as unknown or " uk " , 15 hours after the explosion .
three are women , two are men , and the unknown have no sex on the hospital list .

the oldest victim is 60-year-old pa purusottam , and the youngest is 18-year-old sonal jain .

the dead and the wounded come from all over india in a city driven by hard-working migrants .
like 20-year-old babita negi , one of the youngest victims of the blast , who met a friend at a circular park , which sits atop delhi 's biggest underground railway station .
one of the bombs in a rubbish bin exploded as she took a walk in the park with her friend and snuffed out her life .
babita was the daughter of a government canteen worker and had just taken up a beautician 's course .

and yet , somebody walked in with a bomb and put it into a rubbish bin , leading to the bloody havoc .
unexpected chander negi , father of babita , still can not believe that his daughter died taking an evening walk with her friend at a pretty city park .
more than 400 people have died since october 2005 " you do n't expect people to die in such places .
that 's why i kept waiting for babita to return home till somebody called up to say that she was caught up in the blast , " he says .
you also do not expect a bomb to go off at a downtown bus station , while waiting for a bus to take you home .
shakil ahmed , 32 , used to drive the car of a employee with the indian parliament .
he finished his work , parked the car in the office garage , and stood at a bus stand to take a bus home to his wife and two children , a five-year-old-son and a three-year-old daughter .

an aerial view of crystal beach , near the coastal city of galveston , which took the brunt of the category two storm , captures the scale of the devastation .
the storm , which caused up to 80 deaths in the caribbean last week , reduced swathes of galveston 's seafront to matchwood and left the city without water or electricity .
the destruction evoked comparisons with a storm that battered the city in 1900 .
there are reports of a couple of deaths in texas , but nothing like the 8,000 lives claimed by the hurricane 108 years ago .
ike tossed boats about like children ’ s toys .
us president george w bush declared texas a federal disaster zone .
there were more insurance claims in store for boat owners up the coast at nassau bay .
nearby , ike also damaged the roof at nasa 's johnson space center mission control .
rescuers are using boats , high-wheel lorries and helicopters to rescue thousands of people who ignored an evacuation order .
these residents had a jet ski handy to get around their neighbourhood .
but many had to wade through the flood waters .
ike is estimated to have caused billions of dollars of damage but appears to have been less destructive than originally feared .
in houston city the storm shattered skyscraper windows , showering streets with glass and debris , tore apart bus shelters and ripped metal sheets off buildings .
as residents were left to count the cost , ike weakened to a tropical depression as it headed across western arkansas on sunday .

an aerial view of crystal beach , near the coastal city of galveston , which took the brunt of the category two storm , captures the scale of the devastation .
the storm , which caused up to 80 deaths in the caribbean last week , reduced swathes of galveston 's seafront to matchwood and left the city without water or electricity .
the destruction evoked comparisons with a storm that battered the city in 1900 .
there are reports of a couple of deaths in texas , but nothing like the 8,000 lives claimed by the hurricane 108 years ago .
ike tossed boats about like children ’ s toys .
us president george w bush declared texas a federal disaster zone .
there were more insurance claims in store for boat owners up the coast at nassau bay .
nearby , ike also damaged the roof at nasa 's johnson space center mission control .
rescuers are using boats , high-wheel lorries and helicopters to rescue thousands of people who ignored an evacuation order .
these residents had a jet ski handy to get around their neighbourhood .
but many had to wade through the flood waters .
ike is estimated to have caused billions of dollars of damage but appears to have been less destructive than originally feared .
in houston city the storm shattered skyscraper windows , showering streets with glass and debris , tore apart bus shelters and ripped metal sheets off buildings .
as residents were left to count the cost , ike weakened to a tropical depression as it headed across western arkansas on sunday .

freddie peters - a special kind of guy a few hundred yards from the house of commons is the ethelred estate .
to be frank it 's pretty rough .
kids who live there have a problem moving around the borough - lambeth - because of turf wars and gang violence .
when i was there i was told of a lambeth boy who rents out his gun for £ 50 a day .
now right slap bang in the middle of all this is freddie 's .
it 's a youth club run by a fabulously colourful character - fred peters - who started the club back in 1981 after the brixton riots .
anyone for pool ?
fred is a maverick and has fallen out with lambeth borough council , which has withdrawn its funding .
a cry for help he wrote to me asking if we could help him .
so ian and i , and a full crew , spent an extraordinary evening being initiated into the heady atmosphere of a night out chez fred .
our task turned out not to be one of providing expertise , but one of arbitration .
as dusk fell , the first few camera shy kids started to arrive : " little tackers " in judo kit , hatted and hooded white kids in for pool , an ethiopian family who like it " cos it 's safe inside " .
the local councils and the police , who dealt with all the violence in 1981 , would have been pleased as punch to see multi cultural south london so vibrant and good natured .
karate kids - a sense of " team " flora , a mother of four , here told me : " children when they come out of the club , they stiffen up , they get a heavy feeling .
" when they 're in here it 's lifted off their shoulders ...
freddie is very familiar to all the young boys .
it 's a familiar place .
it makes it special . "
three generations have been through freddie 's .
changed times the land the club stands on is worth a fortune in redevelopment .
youth clubs now need service level agreements and checks and balances that no one even considered 30 years ago .
freddie 's is the place to hang out lambeth council , quite justifiably , want a measure of control over public money they use to fund youth services .
so what we had to do was get the club and the council to agree to meet .
they have and we will keep you posted on what happens to freddie 's over the coming weeks .
both parties probably need to walk a mile or two in each others shoes .

freddie peters - a special kind of guy a few hundred yards from the house of commons is the ethelred estate .
to be frank it 's pretty rough .
kids who live there have a problem moving around the borough - lambeth - because of turf wars and gang violence .
when i was there i was told of a lambeth boy who rents out his gun for £ 50 a day .
now right slap bang in the middle of all this is freddie 's .
it 's a youth club run by a fabulously colourful character - fred peters - who started the club back in 1981 after the brixton riots .
anyone for pool ?
fred is a maverick and has fallen out with lambeth borough council , which has withdrawn its funding .
a cry for help he wrote to me asking if we could help him .
so ian and i , and a full crew , spent an extraordinary evening being initiated into the heady atmosphere of a night out chez fred .
our task turned out not to be one of providing expertise , but one of arbitration .
as dusk fell , the first few camera shy kids started to arrive : " little tackers " in judo kit , hatted and hooded white kids in for pool , an ethiopian family who like it " cos it 's safe inside " .
the local councils and the police , who dealt with all the violence in 1981 , would have been pleased as punch to see multi cultural south london so vibrant and good natured .
karate kids - a sense of " team " flora , a mother of four , here told me : " children when they come out of the club , they stiffen up , they get a heavy feeling .
" when they 're in here it 's lifted off their shoulders ...
freddie is very familiar to all the young boys .
it 's a familiar place .
it makes it special . "
three generations have been through freddie 's .
changed times the land the club stands on is worth a fortune in redevelopment .
youth clubs now need service level agreements and checks and balances that no one even considered 30 years ago .
freddie 's is the place to hang out lambeth council , quite justifiably , want a measure of control over public money they use to fund youth services .
so what we had to do was get the club and the council to agree to meet .
they have and we will keep you posted on what happens to freddie 's over the coming weeks .
both parties probably need to walk a mile or two in each others shoes .

the scottish government said it planned to take their views on board when drafting new carers legislation .
karen reid has more responsibilities than your average 10-year-old girl .
each day she tries to divide her time between schoolwork , seeing friends and being a carer for her mother nicola .
" it 's a bit awkward , but at the end of they day i know that i 've helped my mum and i feel better , " she said .
" i 'd rather feel proud of myself than go out sometimes " enjoy hobbies karen , from renfrewshire , is one of scotland 's 100,000 young carers .
she was just four when her mum began to show the symptoms of hypophosphatemia , a rare bone and muscle condition .
nicola reid said her daughter was forced to grow up quickly .
she said : " it was getting tough for karen .
" she 'd get up in the morning to go to school , to get me up and dressed and she 'd have to leave things out for my lunch that i could reach - like she 'd leave out a bowl and a spoon and a tin of soup , so i could manage to eat while she was n't there .
" and then she 'd go to school worrying about me , that i would n't be able to reach my tablets , i would n't be able to get something to eat , and she would n't be concentrating on her work . "
nicola now receives 43 hours of care each week from the local council , and while karen still cares for her at the weekend it leaves her more time to do her homework and enjoy hobbies such as horse riding , acting and darts .
karen also attends a regular group set up by the princess royal trust for carers which allows her to talk to other young people in her position .
karen struggled to fit in school work with her other responsibilities she said : " sometimes i can lash out with my anger and it helps , because if i did n't go to the young carers group then i would be really angry . "
about 3,000 children receive this kind of support .
while karen is not old enough to attend the young carers festival -lrb- which is for children aged 12 and above -rrb- , she hopes ministers will be persuaded to pledge extra funding for more carers groups .
louise morgan , scottish young carers development manager at the princess royal trust for carers , said the children in karen 's position often felt isolated .
she said : " the majority of young carers receive no help at all , yet they may be carrying out a caring role which even an adult would find onerous .
" very often they are the only care for a parent with a physical or mental illness .
young carers themselves are twice as likely as their peers to suffer mental health problems . "
the young carers festival was set up in response to the scottish government 's care 21 report which found 62 % of young carers had experienced tiredness and 28 % had felt depressed as a result of their caring role .
additional funding for young carers was a snp manifesto commitment .

the scottish government said it planned to take their views on board when drafting new carers legislation .
karen reid has more responsibilities than your average 10-year-old girl .
each day she tries to divide her time between schoolwork , seeing friends and being a carer for her mother nicola .
" it 's a bit awkward , but at the end of they day i know that i 've helped my mum and i feel better , " she said .
" i 'd rather feel proud of myself than go out sometimes " enjoy hobbies karen , from renfrewshire , is one of scotland 's 100,000 young carers .
she was just four when her mum began to show the symptoms of hypophosphatemia , a rare bone and muscle condition .
nicola reid said her daughter was forced to grow up quickly .
she said : " it was getting tough for karen .
" she 'd get up in the morning to go to school , to get me up and dressed and she 'd have to leave things out for my lunch that i could reach - like she 'd leave out a bowl and a spoon and a tin of soup , so i could manage to eat while she was n't there .
" and then she 'd go to school worrying about me , that i would n't be able to reach my tablets , i would n't be able to get something to eat , and she would n't be concentrating on her work . "
nicola now receives 43 hours of care each week from the local council , and while karen still cares for her at the weekend it leaves her more time to do her homework and enjoy hobbies such as horse riding , acting and darts .
karen also attends a regular group set up by the princess royal trust for carers which allows her to talk to other young people in her position .
karen struggled to fit in school work with her other responsibilities she said : " sometimes i can lash out with my anger and it helps , because if i did n't go to the young carers group then i would be really angry . "
about 3,000 children receive this kind of support .
while karen is not old enough to attend the young carers festival -lrb- which is for children aged 12 and above -rrb- , she hopes ministers will be persuaded to pledge extra funding for more carers groups .
louise morgan , scottish young carers development manager at the princess royal trust for carers , said the children in karen 's position often felt isolated .
she said : " the majority of young carers receive no help at all , yet they may be carrying out a caring role which even an adult would find onerous .
" very often they are the only care for a parent with a physical or mental illness .
young carers themselves are twice as likely as their peers to suffer mental health problems . "
the young carers festival was set up in response to the scottish government 's care 21 report which found 62 % of young carers had experienced tiredness and 28 % had felt depressed as a result of their caring role .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- panorama -pipe- omagh : what the police were never told bbc news / panorama graphics version bbc sport home 08:48 gmt , sunday , 14 september 2008 09:48 uk omagh : what the police were never told on 15 august 1998 , 29 people and unborn twins were killed in the omagh bombing , the worst loss of life in a single incident during the troubles .
a further 200 people were injured by the 500lb -lrb- 227kg -rrb- car bomb , which exploded in the town 's high street on a busy saturday afternoon .
in the wake of the attack , the-then uk prime minister , tony blair , said the perpetrators would be " pursued to the utmost " .
but 10 years on , despite police inquiries on both sides of the irish border at the cost of tens of millions of pounds , none of the bombers are in jail .
able to act ?
seven years after his award-winning programme who bombed omagh ?
panorama reporter john ware returns to the subject in omagh : what the police were never told .
he has learnt that the uk 's electronic intelligence agency , gchq , was recording mobile phone exchanges between the omagh bombers on the day of attack as they drove the car bomb into the town .
the claim , confirmed by ray white , former assistant chief constable in charge of crime and special branch for the police service of northern ireland , raises new questions about whether the attack could have been prevented or the culprits brought to justice .
as the programme reports , whether gchq could have helped stop the bombing comes down to whether they were listening to live exchanges between the bombers , allowing them to respond to events , or whether they were simply recording the conversations .
assistant chief constable white tells panorama that the special branch officer responsible for requesting gchq 's assistance is " adamant " he was expecting live monitoring .
assistant chief constable white says the officer had asked for this " primarily for the purpose of triggering a pre-arranged surveillance plan " to interdict the bombers .
coded phrase if intelligence officers were listening there were clues in the conversations , which though coded , could have acted as warnings .
these include the key phrase " the bricks are in the wall " , a code meaning that the bomb was parked and armed .
that exact phrase had been recorded just two weeks earlier when bombers exploded a similar 500lb car bomb in the town of banbridge .
relatives voice their anger your gchq omagh comments but , as panorama reports , even if gchq could not have stopped the attack from actually happening , more could have been done to help the investigation which followed .
former assistant chief constable white says that if gchq had shared telephone numbers and the identities of those using the mobiles immediately it would have meant that arrests could have been made in the " golden hours period " when forensic and other evidential opportunities were at their optimum .
according to one of the sources who spoke to the programme , transcripts reporting exchanges with up to five mobiles associated with the bombers were sent to belfast " within hours " of the bombing .
but , as the programme reports , these were never disclosed to the detectives hunting the culprits .
in fact , sir ronnie flanagan , former chief constable of both the police service of northern ireland and the royal ulster constabulary -lrb- ruc -rrb- , told panorama he was unaware gchq had been monitoring the bombers ' mobile phones .
possible leads even when information was passed on it lacked the detail necessary to help detectives build their case .
the fact that the bombers had used mobile phones , and that gchq had voice recordings and their telephone numbers , was withheld .
consequently detectives were forced to spend nine months trawling through 6.4 million telephone records to finally identify 22 suspects ' phones active in omagh and four other bombings .
although this proved which mobiles had been in omagh , prosecutors needed evidence of who had been using them before going to court .
by law the gchq intercepts could not be admitted as evidence in court , but there was nothing to stop the details from being shared with the detectives to give them early leads .
panorama : omagh - what the police were never told will be broadcast on bbc one at 8.30pm on monday 15 september .

seven years after his award-winning programme who bombed omagh ?
panorama reporter john ware returns to the subject in omagh : what the police were never told .
he has learnt that the uk 's electronic intelligence agency , gchq , was recording mobile phone exchanges between the omagh bombers on the day of attack as they drove the car bomb into the town .
special branch officers say they asked gchq for live monitoring the claim , confirmed by ray white , former assistant chief constable in charge of crime and special branch for the police service of northern ireland , raises new questions about whether the attack could have been prevented or the culprits brought to justice .
as the programme reports , whether gchq could have helped stop the bombing comes down to whether they were listening to live exchanges between the bombers , allowing them to respond to events , or whether they were simply recording the conversations .
assistant chief constable white tells panorama that the special branch officer responsible for requesting gchq 's assistance is " adamant " he was expecting live monitoring .
assistant chief constable white says the officer had asked for this " primarily for the purpose of triggering a pre-arranged surveillance plan " to interdict the bombers .
coded phrase if intelligence officers were listening there were clues in the conversations , which though coded , could have acted as warnings .
these include the key phrase " the bricks are in the wall " , a code meaning that the bomb was parked and armed .
that exact phrase had been recorded just two weeks earlier when bombers exploded a similar 500lb car bomb in the town of banbridge .
relatives voice their anger your gchq omagh comments but , as panorama reports , even if gchq could not have stopped the attack from actually happening , more could have been done to help the investigation which followed .
former assistant chief constable white says that if gchq had shared telephone numbers and the identities of those using the mobiles immediately it would have meant that arrests could have been made in the " golden hours period " when forensic and other evidential opportunities were at their optimum .
according to one of the sources who spoke to the programme , transcripts reporting exchanges with up to five mobiles associated with the bombers were sent to belfast " within hours " of the bombing .
but , as the programme reports , these were never disclosed to the detectives hunting the culprits .
in fact , sir ronnie flanagan , former chief constable of both the police service of northern ireland and the royal ulster constabulary -lrb- ruc -rrb- , told panorama he was unaware gchq had been monitoring the bombers ' mobile phones .
possible leads even when information was passed on it lacked the detail necessary to help detectives build their case .
the fact that the bombers had used mobile phones , and that gchq had voice recordings and their telephone numbers , was withheld .
consequently detectives were forced to spend nine months trawling through 6.4 million telephone records to finally identify 22 suspects ' phones active in omagh and four other bombings .

nathan , a student from kenfig hill , bridgend county , is in the shot putt , javelin and discus events , after being part of the sledge hockey team at the 2006 winter paralympics in turin .
this is the second part of his parents ' diary from beijing .
it 's been a few days since our last diary , during which time we 've done the tourist trail .
it 's quite a novelty for us as usually we come away to athletics competitions as support staff , working from dawn till dusk , ensuring that our athletes have the best possible support and only have to worry about performing to the best of their ability on the field of play .
the sightseeing started on wednesday with a trip to tiananmen square where we saw claire balding and steve cram doing a piece to camera , which was more interesting to me than tiananmen square as i love steve cram .
this was followed by a hair-raising walk to the forbidden city .
but when we got there , it was an oasis of calm and tranquillity : you could not believe you were in the middle of a noisy a frantic city .
the couple visited a number of china 's landmarks it was a blessed relief to get out of the midday heat : we enjoyed a couple of hours meandering through the beautifully manicured gardens admiring magnificent architecture , sculptures and carvings .
it was quite bizarre to find myself the main attraction , being stopped and asked to pose for photographs with the locals ; i made many new chinese friends .
next on our agenda was a trip to beijing zoo .
on our way to find a taxi , we were approached by a bald chinese man pedalling a rickshaw , so deciding it would be another tick in the box of things to do in china , we got in - which in retrospect was the wrong thing to do , as taxi rides are hazardous enough .
but we certainly saw the other face of beijing , the beijing where the real people live , not the perfect façade that 's shown to the outside world .
when our hour was up , we still had to find a taxi to beijing zoo , as he dropped us off in the middle of nowhere .
luckily we had a map and asking locals where on the map we were , we headed off to find a taxi which took us to the zoo .
beijing zoo is one of extremes : the very modern , where the much-revered giant pandas are housed , to the very old -lrb- much the same as ours 30 or 40 years ago -rrb- where the magnificent large cats pace backwards and forwards in confined concrete enclosures , to the ultra hi-tech aquatic centre .
all in all this last part of the day 's adventure was quite depressing .
helen and barrie stephens enjoyed a sightseeing tour around beijing the new day dawns : 5:30 am , clear blue skies , clean mountain air beckons , we 're off to the wall .
arriving at the juyongguan section of the wall an hour later after having avoided beijing 's rush hour traffic , which seems to last all day , we were rewarded with spectacular tourist and hawker-free views : definitely worth the early start to have it all to ourselves .
our trip has been unforgettable : the people are charming and polite , but have not yet grasped the art of queuing .
the sports venues are spectacular and , believe it or not , you can find peace and tranquillity in this enormous noisy frantic city .
as with the olympics , there have been many highs , with numerous medals coming from the velodrome , the rowing and equestrian .
the water cube has produced some of my highlights , gareth duke against all the odds winning silver and lizzy johnson won a well deserved gold , despite having lost her mother to cancer on the day she arrived in holding camp .
we felt like the proudest parents watching our son compete in his first summer paralympic games .
unfortunately , due to rescheduling we will miss nathan 's best event : the javelin on tuesday - he is only 1m off the f57 world record , so go for it , boy , and let the welsh dragon breathe fire .

nathan , a student from kenfig hill , bridgend county , is in the shot putt , javelin and discus events , after being part of the sledge hockey team at the 2006 winter paralympics in turin .
this is the second part of his parents ' diary from beijing .
it 's been a few days since our last diary , during which time we 've done the tourist trail .
it 's quite a novelty for us as usually we come away to athletics competitions as support staff , working from dawn till dusk , ensuring that our athletes have the best possible support and only have to worry about performing to the best of their ability on the field of play .
the sightseeing started on wednesday with a trip to tiananmen square where we saw claire balding and steve cram doing a piece to camera , which was more interesting to me than tiananmen square as i love steve cram .
this was followed by a hair-raising walk to the forbidden city .
but when we got there , it was an oasis of calm and tranquillity : you could not believe you were in the middle of a noisy a frantic city .
the couple visited a number of china 's landmarks it was a blessed relief to get out of the midday heat : we enjoyed a couple of hours meandering through the beautifully manicured gardens admiring magnificent architecture , sculptures and carvings .
it was quite bizarre to find myself the main attraction , being stopped and asked to pose for photographs with the locals ; i made many new chinese friends .
next on our agenda was a trip to beijing zoo .
on our way to find a taxi , we were approached by a bald chinese man pedalling a rickshaw , so deciding it would be another tick in the box of things to do in china , we got in - which in retrospect was the wrong thing to do , as taxi rides are hazardous enough .
but we certainly saw the other face of beijing , the beijing where the real people live , not the perfect façade that 's shown to the outside world .
when our hour was up , we still had to find a taxi to beijing zoo , as he dropped us off in the middle of nowhere .
luckily we had a map and asking locals where on the map we were , we headed off to find a taxi which took us to the zoo .
beijing zoo is one of extremes : the very modern , where the much-revered giant pandas are housed , to the very old -lrb- much the same as ours 30 or 40 years ago -rrb- where the magnificent large cats pace backwards and forwards in confined concrete enclosures , to the ultra hi-tech aquatic centre .
all in all this last part of the day 's adventure was quite depressing .
helen and barrie stephens enjoyed a sightseeing tour around beijing the new day dawns : 5:30 am , clear blue skies , clean mountain air beckons , we 're off to the wall .
arriving at the juyongguan section of the wall an hour later after having avoided beijing 's rush hour traffic , which seems to last all day , we were rewarded with spectacular tourist and hawker-free views : definitely worth the early start to have it all to ourselves .
our trip has been unforgettable : the people are charming and polite , but have not yet grasped the art of queuing .
the sports venues are spectacular and , believe it or not , you can find peace and tranquillity in this enormous noisy frantic city .
as with the olympics , there have been many highs , with numerous medals coming from the velodrome , the rowing and equestrian .
the water cube has produced some of my highlights , gareth duke against all the odds winning silver and lizzy johnson won a well deserved gold , despite having lost her mother to cancer on the day she arrived in holding camp .
we felt like the proudest parents watching our son compete in his first summer paralympic games .
unfortunately , due to rescheduling we will miss nathan 's best event : the javelin on tuesday - he is only 1m off the f57 world record , so go for it , boy , and let the welsh dragon breathe fire .
let 's hope the complexities of disability sport will be recognised so that our young track and field athletes can achieve greatness and win medals in london 2012 .

nick clegg denies any similarity with the tories liberal democrat leader nick clegg has said his party is " absolutely not " becoming too similar to david cameron 's conservatives .
he told bbc one 's andrew marr show that plans for tax cuts would work from the " bottom up " , while the tories were focused on helping the rich .
the lib dems are promising a 4p cut in the basic rate of income tax .
mr clegg also said that , in government , his party could " scrap a department or two " in whitehall .
the lib dems have previously pledged only to abolish the department for business , enterprise and regulatory reform .
mr clegg , who is taking part in his first autumn party conference as leader , attempted to distance himself from both labour and the conservatives .
' loopholes ' he said : " we will be the only party in britain with a tax plan to restore fairness to british families . "
there would be more tax to pay for rich people who rely on " capital " , rather than working , to make money , mr clegg added .
nick clegg is a pale imitation of david cameron john hutton , business secretary the lib dems would close " the loopholes for hedge fund managers " , he said .
such measures would raise about £ 12bn , making his party 's position " twice as redistributive " as its manifesto at the 2005 general election .
mr clegg said : " the conservative party talk about fairness .
they talk the talk , but do they walk the walk ?
" their only tax policy is to raise the threshold of inheritance tax , which will only benefit the very wealthy . "
turning his attention to labour , mr clegg said public spending had increased from £ 300bn in 1997 to more than £ 600bn .
he added : " i just do n't believe that central government , the man or woman in whitehall , always knows best how that money should be spent .
" we are going to look very carefully at the way whitehall works ...
people have lost faith in the ability of government to fix everything from the centre . "
but business secretary john hutton told the andrew marr show : " nick clegg is a pale imitation of david cameron .
" david cameron is , at best , a pale imitation of tony blair . "
the lib dem conference , in bournemouth , runs until wednesday .

there would be more tax to pay for rich people who rely on " capital " , rather than working , to make money , mr clegg added .
nick clegg is a pale imitation of david cameron john hutton , business secretary the lib dems would close " the loopholes for hedge fund managers " , he said .
such measures would raise about £ 12bn , making his party 's position " twice as redistributive " as its manifesto at the 2005 general election .
mr clegg said : " the conservative party talk about fairness .
they talk the talk , but do they walk the walk ?
" their only tax policy is to raise the threshold of inheritance tax , which will only benefit the very wealthy . "
turning his attention to labour , mr clegg said public spending had increased from £ 300bn in 1997 to more than £ 600bn .
he added : " i just do n't believe that central government , the man or woman in whitehall , always knows best how that money should be spent .
" we are going to look very carefully at the way whitehall works ...
people have lost faith in the ability of government to fix everything from the centre . "
but business secretary john hutton told the andrew marr show : " nick clegg is a pale imitation of david cameron .
" david cameron is , at best , a pale imitation of tony blair . "
the lib dem conference , in bournemouth , runs until wednesday .
