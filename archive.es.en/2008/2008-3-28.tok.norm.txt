while the procedure 's not punishable , the man still expects to be taken to court . presenting his machine to reporters on friday , march 28 , former hamburg justice minister roger kusch said that it would give terminally ill people in germany a chance to end their lives instead of forcing them to travel to switzerland , where assisted suicide is legal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kusch has made assisted suicide his mission " the machine is ready for use , " kusch said of the device that 's made up of a conventional intravenous drip feed .
it will be fitted with two syringes , one of which is filled with an anesthetic while the other one contains lethal potassium chloride . a doctor would place a needle in the patient 's vein , which is not punishable under german law .
the patient would then get a button placed in his or her hand and decide whether to push it or not , hence starting the deadly infusion . kusch said that the whole procedure would last around four minutes , the person would die much more quickly than that after losing consciousness within a few seconds .
he added that two doctors were ready to place the needle and issue a certificate ahead of the procedure , stating that the person was indeed terminally ill and still in charge of their mental capacities . harsh criticism germany 's medical community and church leaders quickly criticized kusch 's plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should germany offer more care to the terminally ill rather than a way for them to commit suicide ?
" we do n't need a killing machine , but instead terminal care and palliative medicine that relieves people of pain and fear at the end of their lives , " said frank ulrich montgomery , the vice president of the german medical association , according to german news service dpa . hamburg 's catholic auxiliary bishop , hans-jochen jaschke , also rejected kusch 's machine , calling it a " torture instrument " and a " macabre game with death , disguised by noble words of compassion and covered by questionable legal nit-picking , " according to catholic news service kna . jaschke added that the church was also aware that humans had a right to die . " you can not prolong life at any price and you have to help people to die humanely , " he said .
" but not by using this killing apparatus . " from minister to activist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beust is currently trying to form germany 's first coalition between conservatives and greens at state level kusch told reporters that he expected to face criminal proceedings despite not actually breaking any laws . kusch was hamburg 's justice minister for the german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union from 2001 to 2006 .
he left the government after a falling-out with his friend , hamburg mayor ole von beust , and founded a right-wing splinter party . during the city state 's february elections , he made assisted suicide one of his main campaign topics , but only received 0.5 percent of votes .
kusch has now left politics and heads a non-profit organization for assisted suicide . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , eu foreign ministers remain at odds over a unified stance on the coming event . the decision to stay away was not a boycott in protest to china 's crackdown on tibet or its wider human right record , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .
steinmeier said that neither the chancellor , interior and sports minister wolfgang schaeuble nor he had plans in place to attend even before the people 's republic 's recent crushing of pro-independence protestors in lhasa .
" as far as i know , schaeuble has not planned to take part in the opening ceremony ...

the eu foreign ministers , in slovenia for two days of talks , are under increasing public pressure to send a strong message to china over tibet but have so far been divided over boycotting the beijing olympics opening ceremony .
no one was seeking a full boycott of the summer games as they arrived for the talks at brdo pri kranju , near the slovenian capital ljubljana , but most eu nations have openly condemned the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet which left some 140 dead , according to tibetan leaders in exile .
the official eu line so far has been to call for restraint and urge china to open a dialogue on cultural rights with the dalai lama , whom beijing has accused of inciting the pro-independence riots .

the resulting institution would then acquire postbank , which will be up for sale in the next few months , according to the report . the deal has n't been inked , however .
discussions are still underway and negotiations have not yet begun , according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which did not identify its sources . allianz acquired dresdner bank seven years ago in response to government plans to promote private pension plans .
speculations about the future of the frankfurt-based bank have arisen since dresdner announced earlier this week that it was planning to split its investment division from its customer banking department . according to other news reports , spain 's giant banco santander has expressed interest in acquiring dresdner and allianz is also holding talks with beijing 's state-owned china investment corporation over the sale of their banking offshoot . if the three-way merger pans out , it could take months to see through .
as the largest shareholder in the deutsche post , the owner of postbank , the german government would have a decisive say in the deal . the resulting bank would , with 26 million customers , become the country 's largest . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new book detailing east germany 's passion for nudity is set to be launched in typically candid style just weeks after a documentary exposed the communist regime 's secret porn industry . if selling a book with the recollections - and photographs - of nudist holidaymakers in east germany was n't enough to cause a stir , bookshop owner helmut maass intends to capitalize on the flesh angle of the new tome by promoting it with a reading to a naked audience .
the book , which celebrates east germany 's renowned " freikoerperkultur " -lsb- fkk -rsb- , draws on the era before the berlin wall came down in 1989 .
its publishers , berlin-based eulenspiegel , are enthusiastic about the publicity stunt .

a new book detailing east germany 's passion for nudity is set to be launched in typically candid style just weeks after a documentary exposed the communist regime 's secret porn industry . if selling a book with the recollections - and photographs - of nudist holidaymakers in east germany was n't enough to cause a stir , bookshop owner helmut maass intends to capitalize on the flesh angle of the new tome by promoting it with a reading to a naked audience .
the book , which celebrates east germany 's renowned " freikoerperkultur " -lsb- fkk -rsb- , draws on the era before the berlin wall came down in 1989 .
its publishers , berlin-based eulenspiegel , are enthusiastic about the publicity stunt .
" this is great advertising for our book , " a spokeswoman said .
the book 's author , thomas kupfermann , contacted devotees and asked them to send him their photographs and also secured a contribution from east german television reporter hans-joachim woller , who covered the fkk scene before 1989 .
the event , set to take place in the north-eastern town of pasewalk and hosted by the nude female model who adorns its cover , is scheduled for april 1 , but it 's no joke , maass said .
book event the latest in fkk revival the shop owner believes he is putting on a world first with his nudist book reading , which is sold out .
he has invited his audience to arrive clothed , as germany is experiencing a chilly spring , and assures them his shop is adequately heated .
he is also providing heavy drapes for the windows to keep passing voyeurs at bay .
east germany 's fkk movement is generally experiencing something of a revival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nudist resorts and interest in the lifestyle are on the up a travel agent in the eastern city of erfurt has laid on nudist charter flights this summer to usedom , a baltic island resort and home to a large nudist colony in the communist era .
enrico hess says tickets are selling rapidly for the first flight on july 5 .
he has had applications from as far afield as australia .
the fkk movement dates its origins to the founding of the first nudist society in berlin in 1906 .
while the movement faded in the western states , it flourished in the communist east , with bathing resorts established all along the baltic coast and at the inland lakes frequented by east german holidaymakers .
the fkk movement was just one of the communist country 's many contradictions regarding nudity .
despite the atmosphere of public prudery that prevailed in east germany before the fall of the berlin wall , the gdr was a hot-bed of nudism and naked bathing , both of which were permitted by the communist regime .
secret but sanctioned porn industry exposed while the regime banned western sex films and confiscated erotic films and magazines brought into the country by visitors , it has recently been revealed that the gdr 's armed forces had their own pornography department , which made movies for senior officers and the country 's outwardly prudish hard-line political elite .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the so-called " stasi porn " have looked like this ?
the former communist state 's secret porn industry has recently been the subject of a documentary shown on german television .
the show revealed that the gdr 's pornography department was operated by a 160-man film unit which used a secret circle of 12 amateur porn enthusiasts as its stars .
the documentary explained that the unit was set up in 1982 and managed to make a total of 12 erotic films before the collapse of communism in 1989 .
officially the films were all made in secret but eye-witness accounts claimed that they were produced under direction from senior officers and their premieres were attended by many of the state 's most high-ranking officials and politicians . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some say that 's nothing more than a symbolic move to avoid a human rights confrontation with china . european union foreign ministers began talks on friday , march 28 , on whether the bloc would respond to china 's crackdown on pro-independence protesters in tibet with a boycott of the 2008 summer olympics opening ceremony . violence ensuing from street protests , which began on march 10 to mark the anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against chinese rule in tibet and turned into riots four days later , has left some 140 dead , according to tibetan leaders in exile .
chinese authorities put the figure at 20 . an easy way to make a statement a boycott of the opening ceremony - or even all the olympic events - is a sign that lets western governments make a symbolic statement without really risking much , said matthias chardon of munich 's center for applied policy research . " when considered as a symbol , a boycott is a clear , public sign , " he said .
" the power of these kinds of symbolic statements should n't be underestimated , but a boycott of the opening ceremony is a relatively easy statement to make . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups want an investigation into violence in lhasa the scope of violence in tibet , however , demands more than a symbolic statement , according to marianne heuwagen of human rights watch 's berlin office .

" europe has to make clear that what 's happening is not acceptable . " she said the international community should call for an independent investigation of what has occurred in tibet and ask for journalists to be granted free access to the region . " europe needs to hold china to the agreements it made when it was awarded the olympics , " she said , adding that beijing had not kept promises regarding freedom of the press by kicking foreign journalists out of tibet during the demonstrations . serious consequences unlikely china , however , realizes its status as a world economic power will go a long way in protecting it from more serious consequences , according to karsten giese , a china expert at the german institute of global and area studies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is buying more and more from china " serious consequences that go beyond symbolic policies are unlikely - china 's role in the global economy and politics is too strong , " he said .
" nothing can get done without china when it comes to dealing with issues like north korea , the iranian nuclear program or global climate change . " china has replaced the us as the main source of eu imports and is becoming an increasingly popular destination for european products , according to eu statistics for 2006 , the most recent year for which records exist . in part , it 's an interest in maintaining positive trade relations that keeps the bloc from discussing measures beyond sitting out the olympic opening ceremony , chardon said . " every european country is also working hard to keep up good relations with china so business is n't disturbed , " he added .
" if they are serious about improving the situation then they should probably consider economic measures .

but some say that 's nothing more than a symbolic move to avoid a human rights confrontation with china . european union foreign ministers began talks on friday , march 28 , on whether the bloc would respond to china 's crackdown on pro-independence protesters in tibet with a boycott of the 2008 summer olympics opening ceremony . violence ensuing from street protests , which began on march 10 to mark the anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against chinese rule in tibet and turned into riots four days later , has left some 140 dead , according to tibetan leaders in exile .

while the procedure 's not punishable , the man still expects to be taken to court . presenting his machine to reporters on friday , march 28 , former hamburg justice minister roger kusch said that it would give terminally ill people in germany a chance to end their lives instead of forcing them to travel to switzerland , where assisted suicide is legal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kusch has made assisted suicide his mission " the machine is ready for use , " kusch said of the device that 's made up of a conventional intravenous drip feed .
it will be fitted with two syringes , one of which is filled with an anesthetic while the other one contains lethal potassium chloride . a doctor would place a needle in the patient 's vein , which is not punishable under german law .
the patient would then get a button placed in his or her hand and decide whether to push it or not , hence starting the deadly infusion . kusch said that the whole procedure would last around four minutes , the person would die much more quickly than that after losing consciousness within a few seconds .
he added that two doctors were ready to place the needle and issue a certificate ahead of the procedure , stating that the person was indeed terminally ill and still in charge of their mental capacities . harsh criticism germany 's medical community and church leaders quickly criticized kusch 's plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should germany offer more care to the terminally ill rather than a way for them to commit suicide ?
" we do n't need a killing machine , but instead terminal care and palliative medicine that relieves people of pain and fear at the end of their lives , " said frank ulrich montgomery , the vice president of the german medical association , according to german news service dpa . hamburg 's catholic auxiliary bishop , hans-jochen jaschke , also rejected kusch 's machine , calling it a " torture instrument " and a " macabre game with death , disguised by noble words of compassion and covered by questionable legal nit-picking , " according to catholic news service kna . jaschke added that the church was also aware that humans had a right to die . " you can not prolong life at any price and you have to help people to die humanely , " he said .
" but not by using this killing apparatus . " from minister to activist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beust is currently trying to form germany 's first coalition between conservatives and greens at state level kusch told reporters that he expected to face criminal proceedings despite not actually breaking any laws . kusch was hamburg 's justice minister for the german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union from 2001 to 2006 .
he left the government after a falling-out with his friend , hamburg mayor ole von beust , and founded a right-wing splinter party . during the city state 's february elections , he made assisted suicide one of his main campaign topics , but only received 0.5 percent of votes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de islamic world -pipe- 28.03.2008 dutch muslims react with restraint to mp 's controversial film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right mp geert wilders claims his film is not an attack on muslims but on radicalism muslims in the netherlands have reacted calmly to the internet release of a controversial film critical of islam by dutch far-right mp geert wilders , but elsewhere passions run high . the wilders film , titled " fitna " -lsb- strife -rsb- , made its debut via british video-sharing website liveleak and soon spread to the globally popular youtube site where it quickly generated heated debate among viewers and much divided opinion .
the 17-minute film , which wilders claims is not intended as an attack on muslims but on radical islam , features violent imagery of the terrorist attacks in new york and madrid intertwined with koranic texts .
the film opens and ends with a cartoon of the prophet mohammad with a bomb under his turban , originally published in danish newspapers , accompanied by the sound of ticking .
images of hijacked airplanes flying into the world trade centre in new york on september 11 , 2001 , soon follow with sound bites from phone calls to the emergency services on that day .
the film then continues with grizzly images of bloodstained bodies in the aftermath of the madrid train bombings in march 2004 in which 191 people were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excerpts from the koran are shown with images from 9/11 it intersperses these with images of a koran and the text of a sura from islam 's holiest tome , which translated from arabic implores the faithful to " terrorize the enemies of allah . "
the film carries no commentary and relies purely on the pictures of the terrorist attacks , as well as a beheading and a vision of a future holland where homosexuals and alternative thinkers are tortured , to carry wilders ' perceived vision of " reality . "
" i am a politician , " wilders said recently .
" i think that islam and the koran present a danger for our country and i want to warn against it .
i think i have made a good film within the boundaries of the law .
if something should now happen , then it is solely the responsibility of those people who use violence . "
dutch government distances itself from wilders the dutch government , fearful of reprisals similar to those which followed the reproduction across europe of the cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed , pressured wilders not to release the movie but to little effect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende rejected wilders ' interpretation of islam " this film equates islam with violence and we reject this interpretation , " said prime minister jan peter balkenende .
" the vast majority of muslims reject extremism and violence .
in fact the victims are often also muslims " initial reactions from the muslim community in the netherlands were restrained .
the evening after the film 's release passed without incident , in contrast to the unrest that swept the country following the murder by an islamic militant in 2004 of film director theo van gogh , another dutch artist who was accused of offending islam .
however , iran and indonesia slammed the film .
iran called it film heinous , blasphemous and anti-islamic and called on european governments to block any further showing . indonesia , the world 's most populous muslim nation and a former dutch colony , also condemned the film .
" we are of the view that the film has a racist flavour and is an insult to islam , hidden under the cover of freedom of expression , " a foreign ministry spokesman said .
" we call on indonesian people not to be incited . "
prime minister balkenende praised the efforts of his government to defuse muslim anger in the months preceding the release of the film and welcomed the initial muslim response .
" the government is heartened by the initial restrained reactions of dutch muslim organizations , " he said .
" the dutch government stands for a society in which freedom and respect go hand in hand ...
let us solve problems by working together . "
dutch politicians distanced themselves from wilders and his film .
" the netherlands does not need wilders as a filmmaker , " said mark rutte , leader of the dutch liberal vvd party - of which wilders himself was a member until being thrown out in september 2004 .

the 17-minute film , which wilders claims is not intended as an attack on muslims but on radical islam , features violent imagery of the terrorist attacks in new york and madrid intertwined with koranic texts .
the film opens and ends with a cartoon of the prophet mohammad with a bomb under his turban , originally published in danish newspapers , accompanied by the sound of ticking .
images of hijacked airplanes flying into the world trade centre in new york on september 11 , 2001 , soon follow with sound bites from phone calls to the emergency services on that day .
the film then continues with grizzly images of bloodstained bodies in the aftermath of the madrid train bombings in march 2004 in which 191 people were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excerpts from the koran are shown with images from 9/11 it intersperses these with images of a koran and the text of a sura from islam 's holiest tome , which translated from arabic implores the faithful to " terrorize the enemies of allah . "
the film carries no commentary and relies purely on the pictures of the terrorist attacks , as well as a beheading and a vision of a future holland where homosexuals and alternative thinkers are tortured , to carry wilders ' perceived vision of " reality . "
" i am a politician , " wilders said recently .
" i think that islam and the koran present a danger for our country and i want to warn against it .
i think i have made a good film within the boundaries of the law .
if something should now happen , then it is solely the responsibility of those people who use violence . "
dutch government distances itself from wilders the dutch government , fearful of reprisals similar to those which followed the reproduction across europe of the cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed , pressured wilders not to release the movie but to little effect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende rejected wilders ' interpretation of islam " this film equates islam with violence and we reject this interpretation , " said prime minister jan peter balkenende .
" the vast majority of muslims reject extremism and violence .
in fact the victims are often also muslims " initial reactions from the muslim community in the netherlands were restrained .
the evening after the film 's release passed without incident , in contrast to the unrest that swept the country following the murder by an islamic militant in 2004 of film director theo van gogh , another dutch artist who was accused of offending islam .
however , iran and indonesia slammed the film .
iran called it film heinous , blasphemous and anti-islamic and called on european governments to block any further showing . indonesia , the world 's most populous muslim nation and a former dutch colony , also condemned the film .
" we are of the view that the film has a racist flavour and is an insult to islam , hidden under the cover of freedom of expression , " a foreign ministry spokesman said .
" we call on indonesian people not to be incited . "
prime minister balkenende praised the efforts of his government to defuse muslim anger in the months preceding the release of the film and welcomed the initial muslim response .
" the government is heartened by the initial restrained reactions of dutch muslim organizations , " he said .
" the dutch government stands for a society in which freedom and respect go hand in hand ...
let us solve problems by working together . "
dutch politicians distanced themselves from wilders and his film .
" the netherlands does not need wilders as a filmmaker , " said mark rutte , leader of the dutch liberal vvd party - of which wilders himself was a member until being thrown out in september 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de islamic world -pipe- 28.03.2008 dutch muslims react with restraint to mp 's controversial film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right mp geert wilders claims his film is not an attack on muslims but on radicalism muslims in the netherlands have reacted calmly to the internet release of a controversial film critical of islam by dutch far-right mp geert wilders , but elsewhere passions run high . the wilders film , titled " fitna " -lsb- strife -rsb- , made its debut via british video-sharing website liveleak and soon spread to the globally popular youtube site where it quickly generated heated debate among viewers and much divided opinion .
the 17-minute film , which wilders claims is not intended as an attack on muslims but on radical islam , features violent imagery of the terrorist attacks in new york and madrid intertwined with koranic texts .
the film opens and ends with a cartoon of the prophet mohammad with a bomb under his turban , originally published in danish newspapers , accompanied by the sound of ticking .
images of hijacked airplanes flying into the world trade centre in new york on september 11 , 2001 , soon follow with sound bites from phone calls to the emergency services on that day .
the film then continues with grizzly images of bloodstained bodies in the aftermath of the madrid train bombings in march 2004 in which 191 people were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excerpts from the koran are shown with images from 9/11 it intersperses these with images of a koran and the text of a sura from islam 's holiest tome , which translated from arabic implores the faithful to " terrorize the enemies of allah . "
the film carries no commentary and relies purely on the pictures of the terrorist attacks , as well as a beheading and a vision of a future holland where homosexuals and alternative thinkers are tortured , to carry wilders ' perceived vision of " reality . "
" i am a politician , " wilders said recently .
" i think that islam and the koran present a danger for our country and i want to warn against it .
i think i have made a good film within the boundaries of the law .
if something should now happen , then it is solely the responsibility of those people who use violence . "
dutch government distances itself from wilders the dutch government , fearful of reprisals similar to those which followed the reproduction across europe of the cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed , pressured wilders not to release the movie but to little effect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende rejected wilders ' interpretation of islam " this film equates islam with violence and we reject this interpretation , " said prime minister jan peter balkenende .
" the vast majority of muslims reject extremism and violence .
in fact the victims are often also muslims " initial reactions from the muslim community in the netherlands were restrained .
the evening after the film 's release passed without incident , in contrast to the unrest that swept the country following the murder by an islamic militant in 2004 of film director theo van gogh , another dutch artist who was accused of offending islam .
however , iran and indonesia slammed the film .
iran called it film heinous , blasphemous and anti-islamic and called on european governments to block any further showing . indonesia , the world 's most populous muslim nation and a former dutch colony , also condemned the film .
" we are of the view that the film has a racist flavour and is an insult to islam , hidden under the cover of freedom of expression , " a foreign ministry spokesman said .
" we call on indonesian people not to be incited . "
prime minister balkenende praised the efforts of his government to defuse muslim anger in the months preceding the release of the film and welcomed the initial muslim response .
" the government is heartened by the initial restrained reactions of dutch muslim organizations , " he said .
" the dutch government stands for a society in which freedom and respect go hand in hand ...
let us solve problems by working together . "
dutch politicians distanced themselves from wilders and his film .
" the netherlands does not need wilders as a filmmaker , " said mark rutte , leader of the dutch liberal vvd party - of which wilders himself was a member until being thrown out in september 2004 .
" we need wilders as a legislator , to debate about the netherlands and to find solutions for serious problems , including the problems of integration and immigration . "
minister of integration ella vogelaar said the film could increase people 's fears of islamic radicalism .
" the first half of the film contained shocking material , " she said .
dutch muslims wait , international anger simmers muslim groups have appealed for calm and mosques plan to open their doors to the public on friday to defuse tension .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch muslims have recated with restraint to the film fouad sidali , a leading member of the muslim community in holland , called for moderate responses .
" we muslims in the netherlands are opposed to any forms of violence and aggression , " sidali said .
" we are dutch ; we love our country and abide by the constitution . "
moslems in other areas of the world , however , have not been as magnanimous .
before the film 's release , demonstrators had already taken to the streets from afghanistan to indonesia to burn dutch and danish flags , and the governments of pakistan and iran sharply criticized wilders ' project .
nato has expressed concern the film could worsen security for foreign forces in afghanistan , including 1,650 dutch troops .
despite wilders ' own assertion , one that has been supported by a number of dutch legislators , that he did not break any blasphemy laws with the film , a court in rotterdam will hear an injunction against him on friday brought by the dutch islamic federation .

" my cartoon has been misused again .
it has been pulled from its original context and set in a completely different one , " westergaard told danish broadcaster dr.
" it is a drawing aimed specifically against islamic terror that uses interpretations of the koran and islam as spiritual ammunition , " westergaard , who remains in hiding after death threats , said .

germany 's labor minister wants to do something about it . nora neye , 27 , is a member of germany 's so-called " internship generation , " although it 's not a club she particularly wanted to join .
she 's among the many young germans in their 20s and early 30s who have university degrees but have had little luck finding full-time work . instead , they have embarked on a series of internships , often unpaid , hoping that one of them might lead to a permanent job .
at the end of each , it 's common that graduates leave disappointed or embittered , and usually a lot poorer . " finishing your degree and then finding proper work seems more and more difficult , " she said .
" if you have n't done quite a number of internships , you 're not going to find a job . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internships have become the norm as new graduates outnumber jobs so neye , after getting bachelor 's and master 's degrees in the humanities , got on the internship train herself , doing two-month stints at publishing houses and media organizations .
some were helpful ; some were not .
none led to a job . but it was firms ' attitude that there was a nearly endless source of highly qualified labor they can use on the cheap that angered her most . " companies believe more and more they can do whatever and do n't have to pay for it , " she said . new guidelines germany 's labor minister olaf scholz wants to cut down on what he and other critics call intern exploitation .
he has called for new regulations that would require interns with university degrees be paid appropriately , that their duties and goals be outlined at the outset , and that they not be treated as cheap replacements for regular employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholz wants to instate a series of protections for interns " internships are useful , but there 's been some abuse and we have to do something about it , " he told reporters . scholz , a member of the center-left social democratic party , pointed to a study conducted by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health -lrb- baua -rrb- , which asked 2,000 young people between 18 and 34 about their intern experiences .
although all had university degrees , 51 percent were not paid for their internships , and another 12 percent thought they were paid too little . he said he did not want to do away with internships or put in place a minimum wage for them , rather he was only interested in seeing that interns were treated fairly , since they are a growing group . while 17 percent of 30 to 34-year-olds have experience as an intern , 25 percent of those between 18 and 24 have an internship behind them . " there 's a general culture of doing more and more internships and it 's very problematic , " said former intern neye .
" employers see you after you 've finished your degree these days and say ' why have you only done five internships and not 10 ? " ' new economic model ? internships in germany have traditionally been seen as a way to introduce young people to professional working life .
for university graduates , they have been thought of as bridges to permanent employment , especially since these interns are n't just making coffee and copies , they 're doing real work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work-pay balance with many interns is off " they have a solid education and the required knowledge and therefore generally are given significant tasks , " said rene rudolf of the youth arm of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- . but he and others say many companies have abandoned the principle of interns transitioning to full-time employees .
bettina könig , who heads an initiative that aims to improve internships called fair work , said when the german economy was sputtering in 2001 , jobs were scarce , firms were afraid to hire , and graduates gladly took internships , even for low or no pay , just to get experience and perhaps impress a higher-up . " and now even that the economy is better , this kind of bad model has established itself in many companies , " she said .
" i do n't see it changing without some kind of government intervention . " fair work runs a web site where interns can post their own experiences .

a new book detailing east germany 's passion for nudity is set to be launched in typically candid style just weeks after a documentary exposed the communist regime 's secret porn industry . if selling a book with the recollections - and photographs - of nudist holidaymakers in east germany was n't enough to cause a stir , bookshop owner helmut maass intends to capitalize on the flesh angle of the new tome by promoting it with a reading to a naked audience .
the book , which celebrates east germany 's renowned " freikoerperkultur " -lsb- fkk -rsb- , draws on the era before the berlin wall came down in 1989 .
its publishers , berlin-based eulenspiegel , are enthusiastic about the publicity stunt .
" this is great advertising for our book , " a spokeswoman said .
the book 's author , thomas kupfermann , contacted devotees and asked them to send him their photographs and also secured a contribution from east german television reporter hans-joachim woller , who covered the fkk scene before 1989 .
the event , set to take place in the north-eastern town of pasewalk and hosted by the nude female model who adorns its cover , is scheduled for april 1 , but it 's no joke , maass said .
book event the latest in fkk revival the shop owner believes he is putting on a world first with his nudist book reading , which is sold out .

enrico hess says tickets are selling rapidly for the first flight on july 5 .
he has had applications from as far afield as australia .
the fkk movement dates its origins to the founding of the first nudist society in berlin in 1906 .
while the movement faded in the western states , it flourished in the communist east , with bathing resorts established all along the baltic coast and at the inland lakes frequented by east german holidaymakers .
the fkk movement was just one of the communist country 's many contradictions regarding nudity .
despite the atmosphere of public prudery that prevailed in east germany before the fall of the berlin wall , the gdr was a hot-bed of nudism and naked bathing , both of which were permitted by the communist regime .
secret but sanctioned porn industry exposed while the regime banned western sex films and confiscated erotic films and magazines brought into the country by visitors , it has recently been revealed that the gdr 's armed forces had their own pornography department , which made movies for senior officers and the country 's outwardly prudish hard-line political elite .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the so-called " stasi porn " have looked like this ?
the former communist state 's secret porn industry has recently been the subject of a documentary shown on german television .
the show revealed that the gdr 's pornography department was operated by a 160-man film unit which used a secret circle of 12 amateur porn enthusiasts as its stars .
the documentary explained that the unit was set up in 1982 and managed to make a total of 12 erotic films before the collapse of communism in 1989 .
officially the films were all made in secret but eye-witness accounts claimed that they were produced under direction from senior officers and their premieres were attended by many of the state 's most high-ranking officials and politicians . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the book 's author , thomas kupfermann , contacted devotees and asked them to send him their photographs and also secured a contribution from east german television reporter hans-joachim woller , who covered the fkk scene before 1989 .
the event , set to take place in the north-eastern town of pasewalk and hosted by the nude female model who adorns its cover , is scheduled for april 1 , but it 's no joke , maass said .
book event the latest in fkk revival the shop owner believes he is putting on a world first with his nudist book reading , which is sold out .
he has invited his audience to arrive clothed , as germany is experiencing a chilly spring , and assures them his shop is adequately heated .
he is also providing heavy drapes for the windows to keep passing voyeurs at bay .
east germany 's fkk movement is generally experiencing something of a revival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nudist resorts and interest in the lifestyle are on the up a travel agent in the eastern city of erfurt has laid on nudist charter flights this summer to usedom , a baltic island resort and home to a large nudist colony in the communist era .
enrico hess says tickets are selling rapidly for the first flight on july 5 .
he has had applications from as far afield as australia .
the fkk movement dates its origins to the founding of the first nudist society in berlin in 1906 .
while the movement faded in the western states , it flourished in the communist east , with bathing resorts established all along the baltic coast and at the inland lakes frequented by east german holidaymakers .
the fkk movement was just one of the communist country 's many contradictions regarding nudity .
despite the atmosphere of public prudery that prevailed in east germany before the fall of the berlin wall , the gdr was a hot-bed of nudism and naked bathing , both of which were permitted by the communist regime .
secret but sanctioned porn industry exposed while the regime banned western sex films and confiscated erotic films and magazines brought into the country by visitors , it has recently been revealed that the gdr 's armed forces had their own pornography department , which made movies for senior officers and the country 's outwardly prudish hard-line political elite .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the so-called " stasi porn " have looked like this ?
the former communist state 's secret porn industry has recently been the subject of a documentary shown on german television .
the show revealed that the gdr 's pornography department was operated by a 160-man film unit which used a secret circle of 12 amateur porn enthusiasts as its stars .
the documentary explained that the unit was set up in 1982 and managed to make a total of 12 erotic films before the collapse of communism in 1989 .
officially the films were all made in secret but eye-witness accounts claimed that they were produced under direction from senior officers and their premieres were attended by many of the state 's most high-ranking officials and politicians . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , eu foreign ministers remain at odds over a unified stance on the coming event . the decision to stay away was not a boycott in protest to china 's crackdown on tibet or its wider human right record , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .
steinmeier said that neither the chancellor , interior and sports minister wolfgang schaeuble nor he had plans in place to attend even before the people 's republic 's recent crushing of pro-independence protestors in lhasa .
" as far as i know , schaeuble has not planned to take part in the opening ceremony ...
as for myself and the chancellor , i do n't think so either , " steinmeier told journalists ahead of an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in slovenia .
" in that sense , there has been nothing to cancel . "
" a ' no ' to the olympics in order to relieve our consciences would help neither the people in china nor the sports organizations ...
at the moment i am against the kind of boycott debate that is going on in some european member states , " he said .

we should watch how the chinese government deals with the situation in the next weeks and months , " steinmeier said .

" i ca n't imagine it , because i ca n't say who has already decided to take part , so there ca n't be agreement on canceling that attendance , " he said .

"
the eu foreign ministers , in slovenia for two days of talks , are under increasing public pressure to send a strong message to china over tibet but have so far been divided over boycotting the beijing olympics opening ceremony .
no one was seeking a full boycott of the summer games as they arrived for the talks at brdo pri kranju , near the slovenian capital ljubljana , but most eu nations have openly condemned the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet which left some 140 dead , according to tibetan leaders in exile .
the official eu line so far has been to call for restraint and urge china to open a dialogue on cultural rights with the dalai lama , whom beijing has accused of inciting the pro-independence riots .

however british prime minister gordon brown said in london that britain , which will host the 2012 olympics , would definitely not be boycotting any part of the beijing games .
others were more cautious .
austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , arriving in brdo , said a ceremony boycott could be " a strong signal , " without committing to such a move .
she said on austrian radio it was " important not to limit the question of the respect of human rights in china and tibet exclusively to the question of a political presence at the opening ceremony of the olympic games . "

meanwhile , eu foreign ministers remain at odds over a unified stance on the coming event . the decision to stay away was not a boycott in protest to china 's crackdown on tibet or its wider human right record , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .
steinmeier said that neither the chancellor , interior and sports minister wolfgang schaeuble nor he had plans in place to attend even before the people 's republic 's recent crushing of pro-independence protestors in lhasa .
" as far as i know , schaeuble has not planned to take part in the opening ceremony ...
as for myself and the chancellor , i do n't think so either , " steinmeier told journalists ahead of an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in slovenia .
" in that sense , there has been nothing to cancel . "
" a ' no ' to the olympics in order to relieve our consciences would help neither the people in china nor the sports organizations ...
at the moment i am against the kind of boycott debate that is going on in some european member states , " he said .
" this is not the right moment to talk about a boycott of the olympics ...
we should watch how the chinese government deals with the situation in the next weeks and months , " steinmeier said .
but the subject of forming a joint eu position was unlikely to be debated at the foreign ministers ' meeting , steinmeier added .
" i ca n't imagine it , because i ca n't say who has already decided to take part , so there ca n't be agreement on canceling that attendance , " he said .
as sports minister , schaeuble is expected to travel to beijing as a traditional sign of support for the german athletes at a later date during the olympics .
german president horst koehler is expected to attend the beijing paralympics , which take place in september .
berlin says merkel never had any intention to attend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin says merkel 's decision has nothing to do with tibet in berlin , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said : " i can confirm that merkel never had any intention of being a guest at the olympics , either at the opening ceremony or at the sporting events . "
the eu foreign ministers , in slovenia for two days of talks , are under increasing public pressure to send a strong message to china over tibet but have so far been divided over boycotting the beijing olympics opening ceremony .
no one was seeking a full boycott of the summer games as they arrived for the talks at brdo pri kranju , near the slovenian capital ljubljana , but most eu nations have openly condemned the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet which left some 140 dead , according to tibetan leaders in exile .
the official eu line so far has been to call for restraint and urge china to open a dialogue on cultural rights with the dalai lama , whom beijing has accused of inciting the pro-independence riots .
more european leaders to stay away from opening ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer and fewer european leaders will be at the opening several leaders of eastern european states - czech president vaclav klaus , his estonian counterpart toomas hendrik ilves and polish prime minister donald tusk - have all said they will not be attending the games opening .

but some say that 's nothing more than a symbolic move to avoid a human rights confrontation with china . european union foreign ministers began talks on friday , march 28 , on whether the bloc would respond to china 's crackdown on pro-independence protesters in tibet with a boycott of the 2008 summer olympics opening ceremony . violence ensuing from street protests , which began on march 10 to mark the anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against chinese rule in tibet and turned into riots four days later , has left some 140 dead , according to tibetan leaders in exile .
chinese authorities put the figure at 20 . an easy way to make a statement a boycott of the opening ceremony - or even all the olympic events - is a sign that lets western governments make a symbolic statement without really risking much , said matthias chardon of munich 's center for applied policy research .

" europe has to make clear that what 's happening is not acceptable . " she said the international community should call for an independent investigation of what has occurred in tibet and ask for journalists to be granted free access to the region . " europe needs to hold china to the agreements it made when it was awarded the olympics , " she said , adding that beijing had not kept promises regarding freedom of the press by kicking foreign journalists out of tibet during the demonstrations . serious consequences unlikely china , however , realizes its status as a world economic power will go a long way in protecting it from more serious consequences , according to karsten giese , a china expert at the german institute of global and area studies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is buying more and more from china " serious consequences that go beyond symbolic policies are unlikely - china 's role in the global economy and politics is too strong , " he said .

" every european country is also working hard to keep up good relations with china so business is n't disturbed , " he added .
" if they are serious about improving the situation then they should probably consider economic measures .

a new book detailing east germany 's passion for nudity is set to be launched in typically candid style just weeks after a documentary exposed the communist regime 's secret porn industry . if selling a book with the recollections - and photographs - of nudist holidaymakers in east germany was n't enough to cause a stir , bookshop owner helmut maass intends to capitalize on the flesh angle of the new tome by promoting it with a reading to a naked audience .
the book , which celebrates east germany 's renowned " freikoerperkultur " -lsb- fkk -rsb- , draws on the era before the berlin wall came down in 1989 .
its publishers , berlin-based eulenspiegel , are enthusiastic about the publicity stunt .
" this is great advertising for our book , " a spokeswoman said .
the book 's author , thomas kupfermann , contacted devotees and asked them to send him their photographs and also secured a contribution from east german television reporter hans-joachim woller , who covered the fkk scene before 1989 .
the event , set to take place in the north-eastern town of pasewalk and hosted by the nude female model who adorns its cover , is scheduled for april 1 , but it 's no joke , maass said .
book event the latest in fkk revival the shop owner believes he is putting on a world first with his nudist book reading , which is sold out .

the fkk movement dates its origins to the founding of the first nudist society in berlin in 1906 .
while the movement faded in the western states , it flourished in the communist east , with bathing resorts established all along the baltic coast and at the inland lakes frequented by east german holidaymakers .
the fkk movement was just one of the communist country 's many contradictions regarding nudity .
despite the atmosphere of public prudery that prevailed in east germany before the fall of the berlin wall , the gdr was a hot-bed of nudism and naked bathing , both of which were permitted by the communist regime .
secret but sanctioned porn industry exposed while the regime banned western sex films and confiscated erotic films and magazines brought into the country by visitors , it has recently been revealed that the gdr 's armed forces had their own pornography department , which made movies for senior officers and the country 's outwardly prudish hard-line political elite .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the so-called " stasi porn " have looked like this ?
the former communist state 's secret porn industry has recently been the subject of a documentary shown on german television .
the show revealed that the gdr 's pornography department was operated by a 160-man film unit which used a secret circle of 12 amateur porn enthusiasts as its stars .
the documentary explained that the unit was set up in 1982 and managed to make a total of 12 erotic films before the collapse of communism in 1989 .
officially the films were all made in secret but eye-witness accounts claimed that they were produced under direction from senior officers and their premieres were attended by many of the state 's most high-ranking officials and politicians . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new book detailing east germany 's passion for nudity is set to be launched in typically candid style just weeks after a documentary exposed the communist regime 's secret porn industry . if selling a book with the recollections - and photographs - of nudist holidaymakers in east germany was n't enough to cause a stir , bookshop owner helmut maass intends to capitalize on the flesh angle of the new tome by promoting it with a reading to a naked audience .
the book , which celebrates east germany 's renowned " freikoerperkultur " -lsb- fkk -rsb- , draws on the era before the berlin wall came down in 1989 .
its publishers , berlin-based eulenspiegel , are enthusiastic about the publicity stunt .
" this is great advertising for our book , " a spokeswoman said .
the book 's author , thomas kupfermann , contacted devotees and asked them to send him their photographs and also secured a contribution from east german television reporter hans-joachim woller , who covered the fkk scene before 1989 .
the event , set to take place in the north-eastern town of pasewalk and hosted by the nude female model who adorns its cover , is scheduled for april 1 , but it 's no joke , maass said .
book event the latest in fkk revival the shop owner believes he is putting on a world first with his nudist book reading , which is sold out .
he has invited his audience to arrive clothed , as germany is experiencing a chilly spring , and assures them his shop is adequately heated .
he is also providing heavy drapes for the windows to keep passing voyeurs at bay .
east germany 's fkk movement is generally experiencing something of a revival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nudist resorts and interest in the lifestyle are on the up a travel agent in the eastern city of erfurt has laid on nudist charter flights this summer to usedom , a baltic island resort and home to a large nudist colony in the communist era .
enrico hess says tickets are selling rapidly for the first flight on july 5 .
he has had applications from as far afield as australia .
the fkk movement dates its origins to the founding of the first nudist society in berlin in 1906 .
while the movement faded in the western states , it flourished in the communist east , with bathing resorts established all along the baltic coast and at the inland lakes frequented by east german holidaymakers .
the fkk movement was just one of the communist country 's many contradictions regarding nudity .

they currently only have the rights to construct the train cars , but purchasing additional rights from thyssenkrupp would mean they could produce complete transrapid systems and sell them elsewhere . however , it would also be necessary to obtain the control technology developed by siemens , as well as the engine know-how . chinese expert says deal unlikely a chinese transport export on friday however said that such a deal between beijing and thyssenkrupp was " unlikely . "
xie weida , deputy director of the railway institute at shanghai 's tongji university , said the core technology would be extremely expensive but conceded that buying it could benefit china . a planned extension of the shanghai transrapid line by world expo , which the city will host in 2010 , was recently postponed by mayor han zheng . according to the welt report , an eight- or nine-figure deal between beijing and thyssenkrupp could potentially spare the 220 jobs in germany that are threatened by the closure of the project . " i can not guarantee that we will not lose out to china , " said thomas schlenz , the head of thyssenkrupp 's works council .
" there is a danger that they can pick up this technology and run with it . "
he added that about 1,000 new jobs would have been created in germany had the transrapid plan been carried out . klaus-heiner roehl from the iw economic research institute , however , said that it will likely " be difficult to sell something abroad that was rejected at home . " the blame game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human error caused the 2006 accident six months ago , the heads of siemens , thyssenkrupp and hochtief construction group had said the plan to build the transrapid in munich would total 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- , but federal transport minister wolfgang tiefensee announced on thursday , march 27 , that costs had risen unexpectedly to nearly double , making the venture too pricy to continue with . the hope was that a successful transrapid in germany would provide the showcase necessary to market the high-speed technology to the rest of the world . news of the decision to scrap the flagship train link in munich developed by thyseenkrupp and siemens has triggered angry recriminations among politicians in the southern state of bavaria about who is to blame for the project 's abrupt demise . bavaria 's premier guenter beckstein of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- slammed the industrial consortium developing the technology for the failure of the munich train project , which his predecessor edmund stoiber had pushed through shortly before stepping down . " those who could n't keep their promises " are responsible for putting the project on ice , beckstein told the friday edition of the passauer neue presse .
he added that " no other routes will be built in germany .
the munich project was the last chance . " csu secretary general christine haderthauer joined the bavarian premier in placing blame on the project 's industrial partners . " apparently , industry did n't want a flagship project , but to make a profit , " she told berliner zeitung . opposition to train project the csu , bavarian sister-party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , had long been under fire for the controversial endeavor and critics had accused former bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who stepped down last year , of trying to make the transrapid his personal legacy . " bavaria 's conservative party led a propaganda campaign for the transrapid for years and splurged taxpayers ' money on it , " said franz maget , head of the social democratic party in bavaria . in november , some 13,000 people attended a demonstration against the project in munich , where the new high-speed train would have linked the airport with the city center .
public disapproval was fuelled by a transrapid accident that occurred due to human failure during a test run in 2006 ; 23 people were killed . german engineers started developing the magnetic levitation system in 1969 and millions of euros of federal and private money has been invested in research and development since then . using the magnetic levitation technology , the train floats on a magnetic cushion just above the rail , traveling up to three times faster than standard steel-wheel trains .
the project would have shaved travel time between the munich airport and the city center down to 10 minutes from 40 minutes . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some say that 's nothing more than a symbolic move to avoid a human rights confrontation with china . european union foreign ministers began talks on friday , march 28 , on whether the bloc would respond to china 's crackdown on pro-independence protesters in tibet with a boycott of the 2008 summer olympics opening ceremony . violence ensuing from street protests , which began on march 10 to mark the anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against chinese rule in tibet and turned into riots four days later , has left some 140 dead , according to tibetan leaders in exile .

but some say that 's nothing more than a symbolic move to avoid a human rights confrontation with china . european union foreign ministers began talks on friday , march 28 , on whether the bloc would respond to china 's crackdown on pro-independence protesters in tibet with a boycott of the 2008 summer olympics opening ceremony . violence ensuing from street protests , which began on march 10 to mark the anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against chinese rule in tibet and turned into riots four days later , has left some 140 dead , according to tibetan leaders in exile .
chinese authorities put the figure at 20 . an easy way to make a statement a boycott of the opening ceremony - or even all the olympic events - is a sign that lets western governments make a symbolic statement without really risking much , said matthias chardon of munich 's center for applied policy research . " when considered as a symbol , a boycott is a clear , public sign , " he said .
" the power of these kinds of symbolic statements should n't be underestimated , but a boycott of the opening ceremony is a relatively easy statement to make . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups want an investigation into violence in lhasa the scope of violence in tibet , however , demands more than a symbolic statement , according to marianne heuwagen of human rights watch 's berlin office . " i think it 's inappropriate to only talk about an olympic boycott at this point , " she said .
" europe has to make clear that what 's happening is not acceptable . " she said the international community should call for an independent investigation of what has occurred in tibet and ask for journalists to be granted free access to the region . " europe needs to hold china to the agreements it made when it was awarded the olympics , " she said , adding that beijing had not kept promises regarding freedom of the press by kicking foreign journalists out of tibet during the demonstrations . serious consequences unlikely china , however , realizes its status as a world economic power will go a long way in protecting it from more serious consequences , according to karsten giese , a china expert at the german institute of global and area studies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is buying more and more from china " serious consequences that go beyond symbolic policies are unlikely - china 's role in the global economy and politics is too strong , " he said .
" nothing can get done without china when it comes to dealing with issues like north korea , the iranian nuclear program or global climate change . " china has replaced the us as the main source of eu imports and is becoming an increasingly popular destination for european products , according to eu statistics for 2006 , the most recent year for which records exist . in part , it 's an interest in maintaining positive trade relations that keeps the bloc from discussing measures beyond sitting out the olympic opening ceremony , chardon said . " every european country is also working hard to keep up good relations with china so business is n't disturbed , " he added .
" if they are serious about improving the situation then they should probably consider economic measures . " france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted there were economic concerns that played a role in determining the eu 's response to violence in tibet . " we are constrained by a certain number of economic interests , " he told the daily newspaper liberation this week . international initiatives needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators took to the streets around the world in support of tibet protests one economic move came out of berlin on wednesday when germany said it would cancel aid talks scheduled for may unless violence in tibet stopped . " it is hard to imagine dialog taking place under the current conditions , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said in a statement . but such steps would be more effective if they were coordinated at an eu-level , chardon said : calls for change will carry more weight when made by not just 80 million germans but 497 million europeans . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 28.03.2008 east germany 's fascination with flesh gets more exposure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 'd go naked if one can dress to swim like this ?
a new book detailing east germany 's passion for nudity is set to be launched in typically candid style just weeks after a documentary exposed the communist regime 's secret porn industry . if selling a book with the recollections - and photographs - of nudist holidaymakers in east germany was n't enough to cause a stir , bookshop owner helmut maass intends to capitalize on the flesh angle of the new tome by promoting it with a reading to a naked audience .
the book , which celebrates east germany 's renowned " freikoerperkultur " -lsb- fkk -rsb- , draws on the era before the berlin wall came down in 1989 .
its publishers , berlin-based eulenspiegel , are enthusiastic about the publicity stunt .
" this is great advertising for our book , " a spokeswoman said .
the book 's author , thomas kupfermann , contacted devotees and asked them to send him their photographs and also secured a contribution from east german television reporter hans-joachim woller , who covered the fkk scene before 1989 .
the event , set to take place in the north-eastern town of pasewalk and hosted by the nude female model who adorns its cover , is scheduled for april 1 , but it 's no joke , maass said .
book event the latest in fkk revival the shop owner believes he is putting on a world first with his nudist book reading , which is sold out .
he has invited his audience to arrive clothed , as germany is experiencing a chilly spring , and assures them his shop is adequately heated .
he is also providing heavy drapes for the windows to keep passing voyeurs at bay .
east germany 's fkk movement is generally experiencing something of a revival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nudist resorts and interest in the lifestyle are on the up a travel agent in the eastern city of erfurt has laid on nudist charter flights this summer to usedom , a baltic island resort and home to a large nudist colony in the communist era .
enrico hess says tickets are selling rapidly for the first flight on july 5 .
he has had applications from as far afield as australia .
the fkk movement dates its origins to the founding of the first nudist society in berlin in 1906 .
while the movement faded in the western states , it flourished in the communist east , with bathing resorts established all along the baltic coast and at the inland lakes frequented by east german holidaymakers .
the fkk movement was just one of the communist country 's many contradictions regarding nudity .
despite the atmosphere of public prudery that prevailed in east germany before the fall of the berlin wall , the gdr was a hot-bed of nudism and naked bathing , both of which were permitted by the communist regime .
secret but sanctioned porn industry exposed while the regime banned western sex films and confiscated erotic films and magazines brought into the country by visitors , it has recently been revealed that the gdr 's armed forces had their own pornography department , which made movies for senior officers and the country 's outwardly prudish hard-line political elite .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the so-called " stasi porn " have looked like this ?
the former communist state 's secret porn industry has recently been the subject of a documentary shown on german television .
the show revealed that the gdr 's pornography department was operated by a 160-man film unit which used a secret circle of 12 amateur porn enthusiasts as its stars .
the documentary explained that the unit was set up in 1982 and managed to make a total of 12 erotic films before the collapse of communism in 1989 .
officially the films were all made in secret but eye-witness accounts claimed that they were produced under direction from senior officers and their premieres were attended by many of the state 's most high-ranking officials and politicians . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , eu foreign ministers remain at odds over a unified stance on the coming event . the decision to stay away was not a boycott in protest to china 's crackdown on tibet or its wider human right record , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .
steinmeier said that neither the chancellor , interior and sports minister wolfgang schaeuble nor he had plans in place to attend even before the people 's republic 's recent crushing of pro-independence protestors in lhasa .
" as far as i know , schaeuble has not planned to take part in the opening ceremony ...
as for myself and the chancellor , i do n't think so either , " steinmeier told journalists ahead of an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in slovenia .
" in that sense , there has been nothing to cancel . "
" a ' no ' to the olympics in order to relieve our consciences would help neither the people in china nor the sports organizations ...
at the moment i am against the kind of boycott debate that is going on in some european member states , " he said .
" this is not the right moment to talk about a boycott of the olympics ...
we should watch how the chinese government deals with the situation in the next weeks and months , " steinmeier said .
but the subject of forming a joint eu position was unlikely to be debated at the foreign ministers ' meeting , steinmeier added .
" i ca n't imagine it , because i ca n't say who has already decided to take part , so there ca n't be agreement on canceling that attendance , " he said .
as sports minister , schaeuble is expected to travel to beijing as a traditional sign of support for the german athletes at a later date during the olympics .

"
the eu foreign ministers , in slovenia for two days of talks , are under increasing public pressure to send a strong message to china over tibet but have so far been divided over boycotting the beijing olympics opening ceremony .
no one was seeking a full boycott of the summer games as they arrived for the talks at brdo pri kranju , near the slovenian capital ljubljana , but most eu nations have openly condemned the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet which left some 140 dead , according to tibetan leaders in exile .
the official eu line so far has been to call for restraint and urge china to open a dialogue on cultural rights with the dalai lama , whom beijing has accused of inciting the pro-independence riots .

however british prime minister gordon brown said in london that britain , which will host the 2012 olympics , would definitely not be boycotting any part of the beijing games .
others were more cautious .
austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , arriving in brdo , said a ceremony boycott could be " a strong signal , " without committing to such a move .
she said on austrian radio it was " important not to limit the question of the respect of human rights in china and tibet exclusively to the question of a political presence at the opening ceremony of the olympic games . "

meanwhile , eu foreign ministers remain at odds over a unified stance on the coming event . the decision to stay away was not a boycott in protest to china 's crackdown on tibet or its wider human right record , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .
steinmeier said that neither the chancellor , interior and sports minister wolfgang schaeuble nor he had plans in place to attend even before the people 's republic 's recent crushing of pro-independence protestors in lhasa .
" as far as i know , schaeuble has not planned to take part in the opening ceremony ...
as for myself and the chancellor , i do n't think so either , " steinmeier told journalists ahead of an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in slovenia .
" in that sense , there has been nothing to cancel . "
" a ' no ' to the olympics in order to relieve our consciences would help neither the people in china nor the sports organizations ...
at the moment i am against the kind of boycott debate that is going on in some european member states , " he said .
" this is not the right moment to talk about a boycott of the olympics ...
we should watch how the chinese government deals with the situation in the next weeks and months , " steinmeier said .
but the subject of forming a joint eu position was unlikely to be debated at the foreign ministers ' meeting , steinmeier added .
" i ca n't imagine it , because i ca n't say who has already decided to take part , so there ca n't be agreement on canceling that attendance , " he said .
as sports minister , schaeuble is expected to travel to beijing as a traditional sign of support for the german athletes at a later date during the olympics .
german president horst koehler is expected to attend the beijing paralympics , which take place in september .
berlin says merkel never had any intention to attend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin says merkel 's decision has nothing to do with tibet in berlin , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said : " i can confirm that merkel never had any intention of being a guest at the olympics , either at the opening ceremony or at the sporting events . "
the eu foreign ministers , in slovenia for two days of talks , are under increasing public pressure to send a strong message to china over tibet but have so far been divided over boycotting the beijing olympics opening ceremony .
no one was seeking a full boycott of the summer games as they arrived for the talks at brdo pri kranju , near the slovenian capital ljubljana , but most eu nations have openly condemned the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet which left some 140 dead , according to tibetan leaders in exile .
the official eu line so far has been to call for restraint and urge china to open a dialogue on cultural rights with the dalai lama , whom beijing has accused of inciting the pro-independence riots .
more european leaders to stay away from opening ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer and fewer european leaders will be at the opening several leaders of eastern european states - czech president vaclav klaus , his estonian counterpart toomas hendrik ilves and polish prime minister donald tusk - have all said they will not be attending the games opening .
however british prime minister gordon brown said in london that britain , which will host the 2012 olympics , would definitely not be boycotting any part of the beijing games .
others were more cautious .
austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , arriving in brdo , said a ceremony boycott could be " a strong signal , " without committing to such a move .
she said on austrian radio it was " important not to limit the question of the respect of human rights in china and tibet exclusively to the question of a political presence at the opening ceremony of the olympic games . "
sarkozy 's presidency to confirm eu position french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country will assume the eu presidency from slovenia in july , promised thursday to consult with his european partners on a unified response and plan of action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said the eu would have a position under his presidency " at the time of the olympics , i will be in the presidency of the european union so i have to sound out and consult my fellow members to see whether or not we should boycott , " sarkozy said .
" according to how the situation is looking at the time , i reserve the right to say whether or not i will attend the opening ceremony . "

a new book detailing east germany 's passion for nudity is set to be launched in typically candid style just weeks after a documentary exposed the communist regime 's secret porn industry . if selling a book with the recollections - and photographs - of nudist holidaymakers in east germany was n't enough to cause a stir , bookshop owner helmut maass intends to capitalize on the flesh angle of the new tome by promoting it with a reading to a naked audience .
the book , which celebrates east germany 's renowned " freikoerperkultur " -lsb- fkk -rsb- , draws on the era before the berlin wall came down in 1989 .
its publishers , berlin-based eulenspiegel , are enthusiastic about the publicity stunt .
" this is great advertising for our book , " a spokeswoman said .
the book 's author , thomas kupfermann , contacted devotees and asked them to send him their photographs and also secured a contribution from east german television reporter hans-joachim woller , who covered the fkk scene before 1989 .
the event , set to take place in the north-eastern town of pasewalk and hosted by the nude female model who adorns its cover , is scheduled for april 1 , but it 's no joke , maass said .
book event the latest in fkk revival the shop owner believes he is putting on a world first with his nudist book reading , which is sold out .
he has invited his audience to arrive clothed , as germany is experiencing a chilly spring , and assures them his shop is adequately heated .

enrico hess says tickets are selling rapidly for the first flight on july 5 .
he has had applications from as far afield as australia .
the fkk movement dates its origins to the founding of the first nudist society in berlin in 1906 .
while the movement faded in the western states , it flourished in the communist east , with bathing resorts established all along the baltic coast and at the inland lakes frequented by east german holidaymakers .
the fkk movement was just one of the communist country 's many contradictions regarding nudity .
despite the atmosphere of public prudery that prevailed in east germany before the fall of the berlin wall , the gdr was a hot-bed of nudism and naked bathing , both of which were permitted by the communist regime .
secret but sanctioned porn industry exposed while the regime banned western sex films and confiscated erotic films and magazines brought into the country by visitors , it has recently been revealed that the gdr 's armed forces had their own pornography department , which made movies for senior officers and the country 's outwardly prudish hard-line political elite .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the so-called " stasi porn " have looked like this ?
the former communist state 's secret porn industry has recently been the subject of a documentary shown on german television .
the show revealed that the gdr 's pornography department was operated by a 160-man film unit which used a secret circle of 12 amateur porn enthusiasts as its stars .
the documentary explained that the unit was set up in 1982 and managed to make a total of 12 erotic films before the collapse of communism in 1989 .
officially the films were all made in secret but eye-witness accounts claimed that they were produced under direction from senior officers and their premieres were attended by many of the state 's most high-ranking officials and politicians . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de islamic world -pipe- 28.03.2008 dutch muslims react with restraint to mp 's controversial film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right mp geert wilders claims his film is not an attack on muslims but on radicalism muslims in the netherlands have reacted calmly to the internet release of a controversial film critical of islam by dutch far-right mp geert wilders , but elsewhere passions run high . the wilders film , titled " fitna " -lsb- strife -rsb- , made its debut via british video-sharing website liveleak and soon spread to the globally popular youtube site where it quickly generated heated debate among viewers and much divided opinion .
the 17-minute film , which wilders claims is not intended as an attack on muslims but on radical islam , features violent imagery of the terrorist attacks in new york and madrid intertwined with koranic texts .
the film opens and ends with a cartoon of the prophet mohammad with a bomb under his turban , originally published in danish newspapers , accompanied by the sound of ticking .
images of hijacked airplanes flying into the world trade centre in new york on september 11 , 2001 , soon follow with sound bites from phone calls to the emergency services on that day .
the film then continues with grizzly images of bloodstained bodies in the aftermath of the madrid train bombings in march 2004 in which 191 people were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excerpts from the koran are shown with images from 9/11 it intersperses these with images of a koran and the text of a sura from islam 's holiest tome , which translated from arabic implores the faithful to " terrorize the enemies of allah . "
the film carries no commentary and relies purely on the pictures of the terrorist attacks , as well as a beheading and a vision of a future holland where homosexuals and alternative thinkers are tortured , to carry wilders ' perceived vision of " reality . "
" i am a politician , " wilders said recently .
" i think that islam and the koran present a danger for our country and i want to warn against it .
i think i have made a good film within the boundaries of the law .
if something should now happen , then it is solely the responsibility of those people who use violence . "
dutch government distances itself from wilders the dutch government , fearful of reprisals similar to those which followed the reproduction across europe of the cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed , pressured wilders not to release the movie but to little effect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende rejected wilders ' interpretation of islam " this film equates islam with violence and we reject this interpretation , " said prime minister jan peter balkenende .
" the vast majority of muslims reject extremism and violence .
in fact the victims are often also muslims " initial reactions from the muslim community in the netherlands were restrained .
the evening after the film 's release passed without incident , in contrast to the unrest that swept the country following the murder by an islamic militant in 2004 of film director theo van gogh , another dutch artist who was accused of offending islam .
however , iran and indonesia slammed the film .
iran called it film heinous , blasphemous and anti-islamic and called on european governments to block any further showing . indonesia , the world 's most populous muslim nation and a former dutch colony , also condemned the film .
" we are of the view that the film has a racist flavour and is an insult to islam , hidden under the cover of freedom of expression , " a foreign ministry spokesman said .
" we call on indonesian people not to be incited . "
prime minister balkenende praised the efforts of his government to defuse muslim anger in the months preceding the release of the film and welcomed the initial muslim response .
" the government is heartened by the initial restrained reactions of dutch muslim organizations , " he said .
" the dutch government stands for a society in which freedom and respect go hand in hand ...
let us solve problems by working together . "
dutch politicians distanced themselves from wilders and his film .
" the netherlands does not need wilders as a filmmaker , " said mark rutte , leader of the dutch liberal vvd party - of which wilders himself was a member until being thrown out in september 2004 .
" we need wilders as a legislator , to debate about the netherlands and to find solutions for serious problems , including the problems of integration and immigration . "
minister of integration ella vogelaar said the film could increase people 's fears of islamic radicalism .
" the first half of the film contained shocking material , " she said .
dutch muslims wait , international anger simmers muslim groups have appealed for calm and mosques plan to open their doors to the public on friday to defuse tension .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch muslims have recated with restraint to the film fouad sidali , a leading member of the muslim community in holland , called for moderate responses .
" we muslims in the netherlands are opposed to any forms of violence and aggression , " sidali said .
" we are dutch ; we love our country and abide by the constitution . "
moslems in other areas of the world , however , have not been as magnanimous .
before the film 's release , demonstrators had already taken to the streets from afghanistan to indonesia to burn dutch and danish flags , and the governments of pakistan and iran sharply criticized wilders ' project .
nato has expressed concern the film could worsen security for foreign forces in afghanistan , including 1,650 dutch troops .
despite wilders ' own assertion , one that has been supported by a number of dutch legislators , that he did not break any blasphemy laws with the film , a court in rotterdam will hear an injunction against him on friday brought by the dutch islamic federation .
cartoonist to issue writ from secure location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard 's cartoon continues to cause outrage wilders may also find himself embroiled in another court case brought against him by the cartoonist kurt westergaard , whose mohammed caricature , which opens and closes the film , sparked violent protests by muslims worldwide in 2006 .
" my cartoon has been misused again .
it has been pulled from its original context and set in a completely different one , " westergaard told danish broadcaster dr.

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de islamic world -pipe- 28.03.2008 dutch muslims react with restraint to mp 's controversial film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right mp geert wilders claims his film is not an attack on muslims but on radicalism muslims in the netherlands have reacted calmly to the internet release of a controversial film critical of islam by dutch far-right mp geert wilders , but elsewhere passions run high . the wilders film , titled " fitna " -lsb- strife -rsb- , made its debut via british video-sharing website liveleak and soon spread to the globally popular youtube site where it quickly generated heated debate among viewers and much divided opinion .
the 17-minute film , which wilders claims is not intended as an attack on muslims but on radical islam , features violent imagery of the terrorist attacks in new york and madrid intertwined with koranic texts .
the film opens and ends with a cartoon of the prophet mohammad with a bomb under his turban , originally published in danish newspapers , accompanied by the sound of ticking .
images of hijacked airplanes flying into the world trade centre in new york on september 11 , 2001 , soon follow with sound bites from phone calls to the emergency services on that day .
the film then continues with grizzly images of bloodstained bodies in the aftermath of the madrid train bombings in march 2004 in which 191 people were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excerpts from the koran are shown with images from 9/11 it intersperses these with images of a koran and the text of a sura from islam 's holiest tome , which translated from arabic implores the faithful to " terrorize the enemies of allah . "
the film carries no commentary and relies purely on the pictures of the terrorist attacks , as well as a beheading and a vision of a future holland where homosexuals and alternative thinkers are tortured , to carry wilders ' perceived vision of " reality . "
" i am a politician , " wilders said recently .
" i think that islam and the koran present a danger for our country and i want to warn against it .
i think i have made a good film within the boundaries of the law .
if something should now happen , then it is solely the responsibility of those people who use violence . "
dutch government distances itself from wilders the dutch government , fearful of reprisals similar to those which followed the reproduction across europe of the cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed , pressured wilders not to release the movie but to little effect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende rejected wilders ' interpretation of islam " this film equates islam with violence and we reject this interpretation , " said prime minister jan peter balkenende .
" the vast majority of muslims reject extremism and violence .
in fact the victims are often also muslims " initial reactions from the muslim community in the netherlands were restrained .
the evening after the film 's release passed without incident , in contrast to the unrest that swept the country following the murder by an islamic militant in 2004 of film director theo van gogh , another dutch artist who was accused of offending islam .
however , iran and indonesia slammed the film .
iran called it film heinous , blasphemous and anti-islamic and called on european governments to block any further showing . indonesia , the world 's most populous muslim nation and a former dutch colony , also condemned the film .
" we are of the view that the film has a racist flavour and is an insult to islam , hidden under the cover of freedom of expression , " a foreign ministry spokesman said .
" we call on indonesian people not to be incited . "
prime minister balkenende praised the efforts of his government to defuse muslim anger in the months preceding the release of the film and welcomed the initial muslim response .
" the government is heartened by the initial restrained reactions of dutch muslim organizations , " he said .
" the dutch government stands for a society in which freedom and respect go hand in hand ...
let us solve problems by working together . "
dutch politicians distanced themselves from wilders and his film .
" the netherlands does not need wilders as a filmmaker , " said mark rutte , leader of the dutch liberal vvd party - of which wilders himself was a member until being thrown out in september 2004 .
" we need wilders as a legislator , to debate about the netherlands and to find solutions for serious problems , including the problems of integration and immigration . "
minister of integration ella vogelaar said the film could increase people 's fears of islamic radicalism .
" the first half of the film contained shocking material , " she said .
dutch muslims wait , international anger simmers muslim groups have appealed for calm and mosques plan to open their doors to the public on friday to defuse tension .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch muslims have recated with restraint to the film fouad sidali , a leading member of the muslim community in holland , called for moderate responses .
" we muslims in the netherlands are opposed to any forms of violence and aggression , " sidali said .
" we are dutch ; we love our country and abide by the constitution . "
moslems in other areas of the world , however , have not been as magnanimous .
before the film 's release , demonstrators had already taken to the streets from afghanistan to indonesia to burn dutch and danish flags , and the governments of pakistan and iran sharply criticized wilders ' project .
nato has expressed concern the film could worsen security for foreign forces in afghanistan , including 1,650 dutch troops .
despite wilders ' own assertion , one that has been supported by a number of dutch legislators , that he did not break any blasphemy laws with the film , a court in rotterdam will hear an injunction against him on friday brought by the dutch islamic federation .
cartoonist to issue writ from secure location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard 's cartoon continues to cause outrage wilders may also find himself embroiled in another court case brought against him by the cartoonist kurt westergaard , whose mohammed caricature , which opens and closes the film , sparked violent protests by muslims worldwide in 2006 .
" my cartoon has been misused again .
it has been pulled from its original context and set in a completely different one , " westergaard told danish broadcaster dr.
" it is a drawing aimed specifically against islamic terror that uses interpretations of the koran and islam as spiritual ammunition , " westergaard , who remains in hiding after death threats , said .

"
xie weida , deputy director of the railway institute at shanghai 's tongji university , said the core technology would be extremely expensive but conceded that buying it could benefit china . a planned extension of the shanghai transrapid line by world expo , which the city will host in 2010 , was recently postponed by mayor han zheng . according to the welt report , an eight- or nine-figure deal between beijing and thyssenkrupp could potentially spare the 220 jobs in germany that are threatened by the closure of the project .

but some say that 's nothing more than a symbolic move to avoid a human rights confrontation with china . european union foreign ministers began talks on friday , march 28 , on whether the bloc would respond to china 's crackdown on pro-independence protesters in tibet with a boycott of the 2008 summer olympics opening ceremony . violence ensuing from street protests , which began on march 10 to mark the anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against chinese rule in tibet and turned into riots four days later , has left some 140 dead , according to tibetan leaders in exile .

but some say that 's nothing more than a symbolic move to avoid a human rights confrontation with china . european union foreign ministers began talks on friday , march 28 , on whether the bloc would respond to china 's crackdown on pro-independence protesters in tibet with a boycott of the 2008 summer olympics opening ceremony . violence ensuing from street protests , which began on march 10 to mark the anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against chinese rule in tibet and turned into riots four days later , has left some 140 dead , according to tibetan leaders in exile .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de islamic world -pipe- 28.03.2008 dutch muslims react with restraint to mp 's controversial film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right mp geert wilders claims his film is not an attack on muslims but on radicalism muslims in the netherlands have reacted calmly to the internet release of a controversial film critical of islam by dutch far-right mp geert wilders , but elsewhere passions run high . the wilders film , titled " fitna " -lsb- strife -rsb- , made its debut via british video-sharing website liveleak and soon spread to the globally popular youtube site where it quickly generated heated debate among viewers and much divided opinion .
the 17-minute film , which wilders claims is not intended as an attack on muslims but on radical islam , features violent imagery of the terrorist attacks in new york and madrid intertwined with koranic texts .
the film opens and ends with a cartoon of the prophet mohammad with a bomb under his turban , originally published in danish newspapers , accompanied by the sound of ticking .
images of hijacked airplanes flying into the world trade centre in new york on september 11 , 2001 , soon follow with sound bites from phone calls to the emergency services on that day .
the film then continues with grizzly images of bloodstained bodies in the aftermath of the madrid train bombings in march 2004 in which 191 people were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excerpts from the koran are shown with images from 9/11 it intersperses these with images of a koran and the text of a sura from islam 's holiest tome , which translated from arabic implores the faithful to " terrorize the enemies of allah . "
the film carries no commentary and relies purely on the pictures of the terrorist attacks , as well as a beheading and a vision of a future holland where homosexuals and alternative thinkers are tortured , to carry wilders ' perceived vision of " reality . "
" i am a politician , " wilders said recently .
" i think that islam and the koran present a danger for our country and i want to warn against it .
i think i have made a good film within the boundaries of the law .
if something should now happen , then it is solely the responsibility of those people who use violence . "
dutch government distances itself from wilders the dutch government , fearful of reprisals similar to those which followed the reproduction across europe of the cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed , pressured wilders not to release the movie but to little effect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende rejected wilders ' interpretation of islam " this film equates islam with violence and we reject this interpretation , " said prime minister jan peter balkenende .
" the vast majority of muslims reject extremism and violence .
in fact the victims are often also muslims " initial reactions from the muslim community in the netherlands were restrained .
the evening after the film 's release passed without incident , in contrast to the unrest that swept the country following the murder by an islamic militant in 2004 of film director theo van gogh , another dutch artist who was accused of offending islam .
however , iran and indonesia slammed the film .
iran called it film heinous , blasphemous and anti-islamic and called on european governments to block any further showing . indonesia , the world 's most populous muslim nation and a former dutch colony , also condemned the film .
" we are of the view that the film has a racist flavour and is an insult to islam , hidden under the cover of freedom of expression , " a foreign ministry spokesman said .
" we call on indonesian people not to be incited . "
prime minister balkenende praised the efforts of his government to defuse muslim anger in the months preceding the release of the film and welcomed the initial muslim response .
" the government is heartened by the initial restrained reactions of dutch muslim organizations , " he said .
" the dutch government stands for a society in which freedom and respect go hand in hand ...
let us solve problems by working together . "
dutch politicians distanced themselves from wilders and his film .
" the netherlands does not need wilders as a filmmaker , " said mark rutte , leader of the dutch liberal vvd party - of which wilders himself was a member until being thrown out in september 2004 .
" we need wilders as a legislator , to debate about the netherlands and to find solutions for serious problems , including the problems of integration and immigration . "
minister of integration ella vogelaar said the film could increase people 's fears of islamic radicalism .
" the first half of the film contained shocking material , " she said .
dutch muslims wait , international anger simmers muslim groups have appealed for calm and mosques plan to open their doors to the public on friday to defuse tension .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch muslims have recated with restraint to the film fouad sidali , a leading member of the muslim community in holland , called for moderate responses .
" we muslims in the netherlands are opposed to any forms of violence and aggression , " sidali said .
" we are dutch ; we love our country and abide by the constitution . "
moslems in other areas of the world , however , have not been as magnanimous .
before the film 's release , demonstrators had already taken to the streets from afghanistan to indonesia to burn dutch and danish flags , and the governments of pakistan and iran sharply criticized wilders ' project .
nato has expressed concern the film could worsen security for foreign forces in afghanistan , including 1,650 dutch troops .
despite wilders ' own assertion , one that has been supported by a number of dutch legislators , that he did not break any blasphemy laws with the film , a court in rotterdam will hear an injunction against him on friday brought by the dutch islamic federation .
cartoonist to issue writ from secure location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard 's cartoon continues to cause outrage wilders may also find himself embroiled in another court case brought against him by the cartoonist kurt westergaard , whose mohammed caricature , which opens and closes the film , sparked violent protests by muslims worldwide in 2006 .
" my cartoon has been misused again .
it has been pulled from its original context and set in a completely different one , " westergaard told danish broadcaster dr.
" it is a drawing aimed specifically against islamic terror that uses interpretations of the koran and islam as spiritual ammunition , " westergaard , who remains in hiding after death threats , said .
" wilders has not asked me for permission , so it is simply a case of violation of copyright rules , " westergaard said , adding he would contact legal experts friday . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they currently only have the rights to construct the train cars , but purchasing additional rights from thyssenkrupp would mean they could produce complete transrapid systems and sell them elsewhere . however , it would also be necessary to obtain the control technology developed by siemens , as well as the engine know-how . chinese expert says deal unlikely a chinese transport export on friday however said that such a deal between beijing and thyssenkrupp was " unlikely . "
xie weida , deputy director of the railway institute at shanghai 's tongji university , said the core technology would be extremely expensive but conceded that buying it could benefit china . a planned extension of the shanghai transrapid line by world expo , which the city will host in 2010 , was recently postponed by mayor han zheng . according to the welt report , an eight- or nine-figure deal between beijing and thyssenkrupp could potentially spare the 220 jobs in germany that are threatened by the closure of the project . " i can not guarantee that we will not lose out to china , " said thomas schlenz , the head of thyssenkrupp 's works council .
" there is a danger that they can pick up this technology and run with it . "
he added that about 1,000 new jobs would have been created in germany had the transrapid plan been carried out . klaus-heiner roehl from the iw economic research institute , however , said that it will likely " be difficult to sell something abroad that was rejected at home . " the blame game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human error caused the 2006 accident six months ago , the heads of siemens , thyssenkrupp and hochtief construction group had said the plan to build the transrapid in munich would total 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- , but federal transport minister wolfgang tiefensee announced on thursday , march 27 , that costs had risen unexpectedly to nearly double , making the venture too pricy to continue with . the hope was that a successful transrapid in germany would provide the showcase necessary to market the high-speed technology to the rest of the world . news of the decision to scrap the flagship train link in munich developed by thyseenkrupp and siemens has triggered angry recriminations among politicians in the southern state of bavaria about who is to blame for the project 's abrupt demise . bavaria 's premier guenter beckstein of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- slammed the industrial consortium developing the technology for the failure of the munich train project , which his predecessor edmund stoiber had pushed through shortly before stepping down . " those who could n't keep their promises " are responsible for putting the project on ice , beckstein told the friday edition of the passauer neue presse .
he added that " no other routes will be built in germany .
the munich project was the last chance . " csu secretary general christine haderthauer joined the bavarian premier in placing blame on the project 's industrial partners . " apparently , industry did n't want a flagship project , but to make a profit , " she told berliner zeitung . opposition to train project the csu , bavarian sister-party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , had long been under fire for the controversial endeavor and critics had accused former bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who stepped down last year , of trying to make the transrapid his personal legacy . " bavaria 's conservative party led a propaganda campaign for the transrapid for years and splurged taxpayers ' money on it , " said franz maget , head of the social democratic party in bavaria . in november , some 13,000 people attended a demonstration against the project in munich , where the new high-speed train would have linked the airport with the city center .
public disapproval was fuelled by a transrapid accident that occurred due to human failure during a test run in 2006 ; 23 people were killed . german engineers started developing the magnetic levitation system in 1969 and millions of euros of federal and private money has been invested in research and development since then . using the magnetic levitation technology , the train floats on a magnetic cushion just above the rail , traveling up to three times faster than standard steel-wheel trains .
the project would have shaved travel time between the munich airport and the city center down to 10 minutes from 40 minutes . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the blame game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human error caused the 2006 accident six months ago , the heads of siemens , thyssenkrupp and hochtief construction group had said the plan to build the transrapid in munich would total 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- , but federal transport minister wolfgang tiefensee announced on thursday , march 27 , that costs had risen unexpectedly to nearly double , making the venture too pricy to continue with . the hope was that a successful transrapid in germany would provide the showcase necessary to market the high-speed technology to the rest of the world . news of the decision to scrap the flagship train link in munich developed by thyseenkrupp and siemens has triggered angry recriminations among politicians in the southern state of bavaria about who is to blame for the project 's abrupt demise . bavaria 's premier guenter beckstein of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- slammed the industrial consortium developing the technology for the failure of the munich train project , which his predecessor edmund stoiber had pushed through shortly before stepping down . " those who could n't keep their promises " are responsible for putting the project on ice , beckstein told the friday edition of the passauer neue presse .
he added that " no other routes will be built in germany .
the munich project was the last chance . " csu secretary general christine haderthauer joined the bavarian premier in placing blame on the project 's industrial partners . " apparently , industry did n't want a flagship project , but to make a profit , " she told berliner zeitung . opposition to train project the csu , bavarian sister-party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , had long been under fire for the controversial endeavor and critics had accused former bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who stepped down last year , of trying to make the transrapid his personal legacy . " bavaria 's conservative party led a propaganda campaign for the transrapid for years and splurged taxpayers ' money on it , " said franz maget , head of the social democratic party in bavaria . in november , some 13,000 people attended a demonstration against the project in munich , where the new high-speed train would have linked the airport with the city center .
public disapproval was fuelled by a transrapid accident that occurred due to human failure during a test run in 2006 ; 23 people were killed . german engineers started developing the magnetic levitation system in 1969 and millions of euros of federal and private money has been invested in research and development since then . using the magnetic levitation technology , the train floats on a magnetic cushion just above the rail , traveling up to three times faster than standard steel-wheel trains .
the project would have shaved travel time between the munich airport and the city center down to 10 minutes from 40 minutes . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's labor minister wants to do something about it . nora neye , 27 , is a member of germany 's so-called " internship generation , " although it 's not a club she particularly wanted to join .
she 's among the many young germans in their 20s and early 30s who have university degrees but have had little luck finding full-time work . instead , they have embarked on a series of internships , often unpaid , hoping that one of them might lead to a permanent job .
at the end of each , it 's common that graduates leave disappointed or embittered , and usually a lot poorer . " finishing your degree and then finding proper work seems more and more difficult , " she said .
" if you have n't done quite a number of internships , you 're not going to find a job . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internships have become the norm as new graduates outnumber jobs so neye , after getting bachelor 's and master 's degrees in the humanities , got on the internship train herself , doing two-month stints at publishing houses and media organizations .
some were helpful ; some were not .
none led to a job . but it was firms ' attitude that there was a nearly endless source of highly qualified labor they can use on the cheap that angered her most . " companies believe more and more they can do whatever and do n't have to pay for it , " she said . new guidelines germany 's labor minister olaf scholz wants to cut down on what he and other critics call intern exploitation .
he has called for new regulations that would require interns with university degrees be paid appropriately , that their duties and goals be outlined at the outset , and that they not be treated as cheap replacements for regular employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholz wants to instate a series of protections for interns " internships are useful , but there 's been some abuse and we have to do something about it , " he told reporters . scholz , a member of the center-left social democratic party , pointed to a study conducted by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health -lrb- baua -rrb- , which asked 2,000 young people between 18 and 34 about their intern experiences .
although all had university degrees , 51 percent were not paid for their internships , and another 12 percent thought they were paid too little . he said he did not want to do away with internships or put in place a minimum wage for them , rather he was only interested in seeing that interns were treated fairly , since they are a growing group . while 17 percent of 30 to 34-year-olds have experience as an intern , 25 percent of those between 18 and 24 have an internship behind them . " there 's a general culture of doing more and more internships and it 's very problematic , " said former intern neye .
" employers see you after you 've finished your degree these days and say ' why have you only done five internships and not 10 ? " ' new economic model ? internships in germany have traditionally been seen as a way to introduce young people to professional working life .
for university graduates , they have been thought of as bridges to permanent employment , especially since these interns are n't just making coffee and copies , they 're doing real work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work-pay balance with many interns is off " they have a solid education and the required knowledge and therefore generally are given significant tasks , " said rene rudolf of the youth arm of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- . but he and others say many companies have abandoned the principle of interns transitioning to full-time employees .
bettina könig , who heads an initiative that aims to improve internships called fair work , said when the german economy was sputtering in 2001 , jobs were scarce , firms were afraid to hire , and graduates gladly took internships , even for low or no pay , just to get experience and perhaps impress a higher-up . " and now even that the economy is better , this kind of bad model has established itself in many companies , " she said .
" i do n't see it changing without some kind of government intervention . " fair work runs a web site where interns can post their own experiences .
reports of 40 or 50-hour weeks with no pay and no time off yet fulfilling most or all the duties of a full-time staff person are not unusual . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nice facade , bad intern policy - german historical museum last year , the group 's annual prize of the worst internship of the year , money-grubber 2007 , went to the german historical museum in berlin . there , a history graduate worked 39-hour weeks for six months without insurance , vacation or sick leave .
she had to sign an agreement that all work that she did during the time was for the exclusive use of the museum . over or under-regulation but some politicians and employer groups are against any kind of new regulation being placed on business .
german education minister annette schavan of the center-right christian democratic party has warned against imposing more " bureaucratic rules " and has cast doubt on the validity of the baua study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say interns are considered low-wage , high-skilled labor the head of the bda employers ' association , gerhard braun , told the financial times deutschland that more regulation and the establishment of pay rules would cause companies to discontinue their internship programs . but for others , the suggested changes do n't go far enough . rudolf of the dgb trade union group wants to see a three-month time limit placed on internships , pay requirements , and a clear understanding of what an internship is .
it should be a learning relationship with a company , not a pure work relationship . if the firm wants that , they should go out and hire somebody , he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the procedure 's not punishable , the man still expects to be taken to court . presenting his machine to reporters on friday , march 28 , former hamburg justice minister roger kusch said that it would give terminally ill people in germany a chance to end their lives instead of forcing them to travel to switzerland , where assisted suicide is legal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kusch has made assisted suicide his mission " the machine is ready for use , " kusch said of the device that 's made up of a conventional intravenous drip feed .

meanwhile , eu foreign ministers remain at odds over a unified stance on the coming event . the decision to stay away was not a boycott in protest to china 's crackdown on tibet or its wider human right record , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .
steinmeier said that neither the chancellor , interior and sports minister wolfgang schaeuble nor he had plans in place to attend even before the people 's republic 's recent crushing of pro-independence protestors in lhasa .
" as far as i know , schaeuble has not planned to take part in the opening ceremony ...
as for myself and the chancellor , i do n't think so either , " steinmeier told journalists ahead of an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in slovenia .
" in that sense , there has been nothing to cancel . "
" a ' no ' to the olympics in order to relieve our consciences would help neither the people in china nor the sports organizations ...
at the moment i am against the kind of boycott debate that is going on in some european member states , " he said .
" this is not the right moment to talk about a boycott of the olympics ...
we should watch how the chinese government deals with the situation in the next weeks and months , " steinmeier said .
but the subject of forming a joint eu position was unlikely to be debated at the foreign ministers ' meeting , steinmeier added .
" i ca n't imagine it , because i ca n't say who has already decided to take part , so there ca n't be agreement on canceling that attendance , " he said .

"
the eu foreign ministers , in slovenia for two days of talks , are under increasing public pressure to send a strong message to china over tibet but have so far been divided over boycotting the beijing olympics opening ceremony .
no one was seeking a full boycott of the summer games as they arrived for the talks at brdo pri kranju , near the slovenian capital ljubljana , but most eu nations have openly condemned the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet which left some 140 dead , according to tibetan leaders in exile .
the official eu line so far has been to call for restraint and urge china to open a dialogue on cultural rights with the dalai lama , whom beijing has accused of inciting the pro-independence riots .
more european leaders to stay away from opening ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer and fewer european leaders will be at the opening several leaders of eastern european states - czech president vaclav klaus , his estonian counterpart toomas hendrik ilves and polish prime minister donald tusk - have all said they will not be attending the games opening .
however british prime minister gordon brown said in london that britain , which will host the 2012 olympics , would definitely not be boycotting any part of the beijing games .
others were more cautious .
austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , arriving in brdo , said a ceremony boycott could be " a strong signal , " without committing to such a move .
she said on austrian radio it was " important not to limit the question of the respect of human rights in china and tibet exclusively to the question of a political presence at the opening ceremony of the olympic games . "
sarkozy 's presidency to confirm eu position french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country will assume the eu presidency from slovenia in july , promised thursday to consult with his european partners on a unified response and plan of action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said the eu would have a position under his presidency " at the time of the olympics , i will be in the presidency of the european union so i have to sound out and consult my fellow members to see whether or not we should boycott , " sarkozy said .
" according to how the situation is looking at the time , i reserve the right to say whether or not i will attend the opening ceremony . "
sarkozy reiterated that none of the 27 eu nations had so far called for a joint boycott . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the resulting institution would then acquire postbank , which will be up for sale in the next few months , according to the report . the deal has n't been inked , however .
discussions are still underway and negotiations have not yet begun , according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which did not identify its sources . allianz acquired dresdner bank seven years ago in response to government plans to promote private pension plans .
speculations about the future of the frankfurt-based bank have arisen since dresdner announced earlier this week that it was planning to split its investment division from its customer banking department . according to other news reports , spain 's giant banco santander has expressed interest in acquiring dresdner and allianz is also holding talks with beijing 's state-owned china investment corporation over the sale of their banking offshoot . if the three-way merger pans out , it could take months to see through .
as the largest shareholder in the deutsche post , the owner of postbank , the german government would have a decisive say in the deal . the resulting bank would , with 26 million customers , become the country 's largest . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 28.03.2008 real work for no money : a growing reality for young germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interns often do the work of full-time staff new debate has broken out about german companies using interns who are poorly paid , if they 're paid at all , to do work that once was done by full-time staff .
germany 's labor minister wants to do something about it . nora neye , 27 , is a member of germany 's so-called " internship generation , " although it 's not a club she particularly wanted to join .
she 's among the many young germans in their 20s and early 30s who have university degrees but have had little luck finding full-time work . instead , they have embarked on a series of internships , often unpaid , hoping that one of them might lead to a permanent job .
at the end of each , it 's common that graduates leave disappointed or embittered , and usually a lot poorer . " finishing your degree and then finding proper work seems more and more difficult , " she said .
" if you have n't done quite a number of internships , you 're not going to find a job . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internships have become the norm as new graduates outnumber jobs so neye , after getting bachelor 's and master 's degrees in the humanities , got on the internship train herself , doing two-month stints at publishing houses and media organizations .
some were helpful ; some were not .
none led to a job . but it was firms ' attitude that there was a nearly endless source of highly qualified labor they can use on the cheap that angered her most . " companies believe more and more they can do whatever and do n't have to pay for it , " she said . new guidelines germany 's labor minister olaf scholz wants to cut down on what he and other critics call intern exploitation .
he has called for new regulations that would require interns with university degrees be paid appropriately , that their duties and goals be outlined at the outset , and that they not be treated as cheap replacements for regular employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholz wants to instate a series of protections for interns " internships are useful , but there 's been some abuse and we have to do something about it , " he told reporters . scholz , a member of the center-left social democratic party , pointed to a study conducted by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health -lrb- baua -rrb- , which asked 2,000 young people between 18 and 34 about their intern experiences .
although all had university degrees , 51 percent were not paid for their internships , and another 12 percent thought they were paid too little . he said he did not want to do away with internships or put in place a minimum wage for them , rather he was only interested in seeing that interns were treated fairly , since they are a growing group . while 17 percent of 30 to 34-year-olds have experience as an intern , 25 percent of those between 18 and 24 have an internship behind them . " there 's a general culture of doing more and more internships and it 's very problematic , " said former intern neye .
" employers see you after you 've finished your degree these days and say ' why have you only done five internships and not 10 ? " ' new economic model ? internships in germany have traditionally been seen as a way to introduce young people to professional working life .
for university graduates , they have been thought of as bridges to permanent employment , especially since these interns are n't just making coffee and copies , they 're doing real work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work-pay balance with many interns is off " they have a solid education and the required knowledge and therefore generally are given significant tasks , " said rene rudolf of the youth arm of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- . but he and others say many companies have abandoned the principle of interns transitioning to full-time employees .
bettina könig , who heads an initiative that aims to improve internships called fair work , said when the german economy was sputtering in 2001 , jobs were scarce , firms were afraid to hire , and graduates gladly took internships , even for low or no pay , just to get experience and perhaps impress a higher-up . " and now even that the economy is better , this kind of bad model has established itself in many companies , " she said .
" i do n't see it changing without some kind of government intervention . " fair work runs a web site where interns can post their own experiences .

germany 's labor minister wants to do something about it . nora neye , 27 , is a member of germany 's so-called " internship generation , " although it 's not a club she particularly wanted to join .
she 's among the many young germans in their 20s and early 30s who have university degrees but have had little luck finding full-time work . instead , they have embarked on a series of internships , often unpaid , hoping that one of them might lead to a permanent job .
at the end of each , it 's common that graduates leave disappointed or embittered , and usually a lot poorer . " finishing your degree and then finding proper work seems more and more difficult , " she said .

some were helpful ; some were not .
none led to a job . but it was firms ' attitude that there was a nearly endless source of highly qualified labor they can use on the cheap that angered her most . " companies believe more and more they can do whatever and do n't have to pay for it , " she said . new guidelines germany 's labor minister olaf scholz wants to cut down on what he and other critics call intern exploitation .
he has called for new regulations that would require interns with university degrees be paid appropriately , that their duties and goals be outlined at the outset , and that they not be treated as cheap replacements for regular employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholz wants to instate a series of protections for interns " internships are useful , but there 's been some abuse and we have to do something about it , " he told reporters . scholz , a member of the center-left social democratic party , pointed to a study conducted by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health -lrb- baua -rrb- , which asked 2,000 young people between 18 and 34 about their intern experiences .
although all had university degrees , 51 percent were not paid for their internships , and another 12 percent thought they were paid too little . he said he did not want to do away with internships or put in place a minimum wage for them , rather he was only interested in seeing that interns were treated fairly , since they are a growing group . while 17 percent of 30 to 34-year-olds have experience as an intern , 25 percent of those between 18 and 24 have an internship behind them .

bettina könig , who heads an initiative that aims to improve internships called fair work , said when the german economy was sputtering in 2001 , jobs were scarce , firms were afraid to hire , and graduates gladly took internships , even for low or no pay , just to get experience and perhaps impress a higher-up .

they currently only have the rights to construct the train cars , but purchasing additional rights from thyssenkrupp would mean they could produce complete transrapid systems and sell them elsewhere . however , it would also be necessary to obtain the control technology developed by siemens , as well as the engine know-how . chinese expert says deal unlikely a chinese transport export on friday however said that such a deal between beijing and thyssenkrupp was " unlikely . "
xie weida , deputy director of the railway institute at shanghai 's tongji university , said the core technology would be extremely expensive but conceded that buying it could benefit china . a planned extension of the shanghai transrapid line by world expo , which the city will host in 2010 , was recently postponed by mayor han zheng . according to the welt report , an eight- or nine-figure deal between beijing and thyssenkrupp could potentially spare the 220 jobs in germany that are threatened by the closure of the project . " i can not guarantee that we will not lose out to china , " said thomas schlenz , the head of thyssenkrupp 's works council .
" there is a danger that they can pick up this technology and run with it . "
he added that about 1,000 new jobs would have been created in germany had the transrapid plan been carried out . klaus-heiner roehl from the iw economic research institute , however , said that it will likely " be difficult to sell something abroad that was rejected at home . " the blame game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human error caused the 2006 accident six months ago , the heads of siemens , thyssenkrupp and hochtief construction group had said the plan to build the transrapid in munich would total 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- , but federal transport minister wolfgang tiefensee announced on thursday , march 27 , that costs had risen unexpectedly to nearly double , making the venture too pricy to continue with . the hope was that a successful transrapid in germany would provide the showcase necessary to market the high-speed technology to the rest of the world . news of the decision to scrap the flagship train link in munich developed by thyseenkrupp and siemens has triggered angry recriminations among politicians in the southern state of bavaria about who is to blame for the project 's abrupt demise . bavaria 's premier guenter beckstein of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- slammed the industrial consortium developing the technology for the failure of the munich train project , which his predecessor edmund stoiber had pushed through shortly before stepping down . " those who could n't keep their promises " are responsible for putting the project on ice , beckstein told the friday edition of the passauer neue presse .
he added that " no other routes will be built in germany .
the munich project was the last chance . " csu secretary general christine haderthauer joined the bavarian premier in placing blame on the project 's industrial partners . " apparently , industry did n't want a flagship project , but to make a profit , " she told berliner zeitung . opposition to train project the csu , bavarian sister-party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , had long been under fire for the controversial endeavor and critics had accused former bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who stepped down last year , of trying to make the transrapid his personal legacy . " bavaria 's conservative party led a propaganda campaign for the transrapid for years and splurged taxpayers ' money on it , " said franz maget , head of the social democratic party in bavaria . in november , some 13,000 people attended a demonstration against the project in munich , where the new high-speed train would have linked the airport with the city center .
public disapproval was fuelled by a transrapid accident that occurred due to human failure during a test run in 2006 ; 23 people were killed . german engineers started developing the magnetic levitation system in 1969 and millions of euros of federal and private money has been invested in research and development since then . using the magnetic levitation technology , the train floats on a magnetic cushion just above the rail , traveling up to three times faster than standard steel-wheel trains .
the project would have shaved travel time between the munich airport and the city center down to 10 minutes from 40 minutes . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new book detailing east germany 's passion for nudity is set to be launched in typically candid style just weeks after a documentary exposed the communist regime 's secret porn industry . if selling a book with the recollections - and photographs - of nudist holidaymakers in east germany was n't enough to cause a stir , bookshop owner helmut maass intends to capitalize on the flesh angle of the new tome by promoting it with a reading to a naked audience .
the book , which celebrates east germany 's renowned " freikoerperkultur " -lsb- fkk -rsb- , draws on the era before the berlin wall came down in 1989 .
its publishers , berlin-based eulenspiegel , are enthusiastic about the publicity stunt .
" this is great advertising for our book , " a spokeswoman said .
the book 's author , thomas kupfermann , contacted devotees and asked them to send him their photographs and also secured a contribution from east german television reporter hans-joachim woller , who covered the fkk scene before 1989 .
the event , set to take place in the north-eastern town of pasewalk and hosted by the nude female model who adorns its cover , is scheduled for april 1 , but it 's no joke , maass said .
book event the latest in fkk revival the shop owner believes he is putting on a world first with his nudist book reading , which is sold out .
he has invited his audience to arrive clothed , as germany is experiencing a chilly spring , and assures them his shop is adequately heated .

enrico hess says tickets are selling rapidly for the first flight on july 5 .
he has had applications from as far afield as australia .
the fkk movement dates its origins to the founding of the first nudist society in berlin in 1906 .
while the movement faded in the western states , it flourished in the communist east , with bathing resorts established all along the baltic coast and at the inland lakes frequented by east german holidaymakers .
the fkk movement was just one of the communist country 's many contradictions regarding nudity .
despite the atmosphere of public prudery that prevailed in east germany before the fall of the berlin wall , the gdr was a hot-bed of nudism and naked bathing , both of which were permitted by the communist regime .
secret but sanctioned porn industry exposed while the regime banned western sex films and confiscated erotic films and magazines brought into the country by visitors , it has recently been revealed that the gdr 's armed forces had their own pornography department , which made movies for senior officers and the country 's outwardly prudish hard-line political elite .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the so-called " stasi porn " have looked like this ?
the former communist state 's secret porn industry has recently been the subject of a documentary shown on german television .

the documentary explained that the unit was set up in 1982 and managed to make a total of 12 erotic films before the collapse of communism in 1989 .
officially the films were all made in secret but eye-witness accounts claimed that they were produced under direction from senior officers and their premieres were attended by many of the state 's most high-ranking officials and politicians . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , eu foreign ministers remain at odds over a unified stance on the coming event . the decision to stay away was not a boycott in protest to china 's crackdown on tibet or its wider human right record , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .
steinmeier said that neither the chancellor , interior and sports minister wolfgang schaeuble nor he had plans in place to attend even before the people 's republic 's recent crushing of pro-independence protestors in lhasa .
" as far as i know , schaeuble has not planned to take part in the opening ceremony ...
as for myself and the chancellor , i do n't think so either , " steinmeier told journalists ahead of an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in slovenia .
" in that sense , there has been nothing to cancel . "
" a ' no ' to the olympics in order to relieve our consciences would help neither the people in china nor the sports organizations ...
at the moment i am against the kind of boycott debate that is going on in some european member states , " he said .
" this is not the right moment to talk about a boycott of the olympics ...
we should watch how the chinese government deals with the situation in the next weeks and months , " steinmeier said .
but the subject of forming a joint eu position was unlikely to be debated at the foreign ministers ' meeting , steinmeier added .
" i ca n't imagine it , because i ca n't say who has already decided to take part , so there ca n't be agreement on canceling that attendance , " he said .
as sports minister , schaeuble is expected to travel to beijing as a traditional sign of support for the german athletes at a later date during the olympics .
german president horst koehler is expected to attend the beijing paralympics , which take place in september .
berlin says merkel never had any intention to attend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin says merkel 's decision has nothing to do with tibet in berlin , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said : " i can confirm that merkel never had any intention of being a guest at the olympics , either at the opening ceremony or at the sporting events . "
the eu foreign ministers , in slovenia for two days of talks , are under increasing public pressure to send a strong message to china over tibet but have so far been divided over boycotting the beijing olympics opening ceremony .
no one was seeking a full boycott of the summer games as they arrived for the talks at brdo pri kranju , near the slovenian capital ljubljana , but most eu nations have openly condemned the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet which left some 140 dead , according to tibetan leaders in exile .
the official eu line so far has been to call for restraint and urge china to open a dialogue on cultural rights with the dalai lama , whom beijing has accused of inciting the pro-independence riots .
more european leaders to stay away from opening ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer and fewer european leaders will be at the opening several leaders of eastern european states - czech president vaclav klaus , his estonian counterpart toomas hendrik ilves and polish prime minister donald tusk - have all said they will not be attending the games opening .
however british prime minister gordon brown said in london that britain , which will host the 2012 olympics , would definitely not be boycotting any part of the beijing games .
others were more cautious .
austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , arriving in brdo , said a ceremony boycott could be " a strong signal , " without committing to such a move .
she said on austrian radio it was " important not to limit the question of the respect of human rights in china and tibet exclusively to the question of a political presence at the opening ceremony of the olympic games . "
sarkozy 's presidency to confirm eu position french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country will assume the eu presidency from slovenia in july , promised thursday to consult with his european partners on a unified response and plan of action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said the eu would have a position under his presidency " at the time of the olympics , i will be in the presidency of the european union so i have to sound out and consult my fellow members to see whether or not we should boycott , " sarkozy said .
" according to how the situation is looking at the time , i reserve the right to say whether or not i will attend the opening ceremony . "
sarkozy reiterated that none of the 27 eu nations had so far called for a joint boycott . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the procedure 's not punishable , the man still expects to be taken to court . presenting his machine to reporters on friday , march 28 , former hamburg justice minister roger kusch said that it would give terminally ill people in germany a chance to end their lives instead of forcing them to travel to switzerland , where assisted suicide is legal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kusch has made assisted suicide his mission " the machine is ready for use , " kusch said of the device that 's made up of a conventional intravenous drip feed .

but some say that 's nothing more than a symbolic move to avoid a human rights confrontation with china . european union foreign ministers began talks on friday , march 28 , on whether the bloc would respond to china 's crackdown on pro-independence protesters in tibet with a boycott of the 2008 summer olympics opening ceremony . violence ensuing from street protests , which began on march 10 to mark the anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against chinese rule in tibet and turned into riots four days later , has left some 140 dead , according to tibetan leaders in exile .
chinese authorities put the figure at 20 . an easy way to make a statement a boycott of the opening ceremony - or even all the olympic events - is a sign that lets western governments make a symbolic statement without really risking much , said matthias chardon of munich 's center for applied policy research . " when considered as a symbol , a boycott is a clear , public sign , " he said .
" the power of these kinds of symbolic statements should n't be underestimated , but a boycott of the opening ceremony is a relatively easy statement to make . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups want an investigation into violence in lhasa the scope of violence in tibet , however , demands more than a symbolic statement , according to marianne heuwagen of human rights watch 's berlin office . " i think it 's inappropriate to only talk about an olympic boycott at this point , " she said .
" europe has to make clear that what 's happening is not acceptable . " she said the international community should call for an independent investigation of what has occurred in tibet and ask for journalists to be granted free access to the region . " europe needs to hold china to the agreements it made when it was awarded the olympics , " she said , adding that beijing had not kept promises regarding freedom of the press by kicking foreign journalists out of tibet during the demonstrations . serious consequences unlikely china , however , realizes its status as a world economic power will go a long way in protecting it from more serious consequences , according to karsten giese , a china expert at the german institute of global and area studies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is buying more and more from china " serious consequences that go beyond symbolic policies are unlikely - china 's role in the global economy and politics is too strong , " he said .
" nothing can get done without china when it comes to dealing with issues like north korea , the iranian nuclear program or global climate change . " china has replaced the us as the main source of eu imports and is becoming an increasingly popular destination for european products , according to eu statistics for 2006 , the most recent year for which records exist . in part , it 's an interest in maintaining positive trade relations that keeps the bloc from discussing measures beyond sitting out the olympic opening ceremony , chardon said . " every european country is also working hard to keep up good relations with china so business is n't disturbed , " he added .
" if they are serious about improving the situation then they should probably consider economic measures . " france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted there were economic concerns that played a role in determining the eu 's response to violence in tibet . " we are constrained by a certain number of economic interests , " he told the daily newspaper liberation this week . international initiatives needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators took to the streets around the world in support of tibet protests one economic move came out of berlin on wednesday when germany said it would cancel aid talks scheduled for may unless violence in tibet stopped . " it is hard to imagine dialog taking place under the current conditions , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said in a statement . but such steps would be more effective if they were coordinated at an eu-level , chardon said : calls for change will carry more weight when made by not just 80 million germans but 497 million europeans . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de islamic world -pipe- 28.03.2008 dutch muslims react with restraint to mp 's controversial film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right mp geert wilders claims his film is not an attack on muslims but on radicalism muslims in the netherlands have reacted calmly to the internet release of a controversial film critical of islam by dutch far-right mp geert wilders , but elsewhere passions run high . the wilders film , titled " fitna " -lsb- strife -rsb- , made its debut via british video-sharing website liveleak and soon spread to the globally popular youtube site where it quickly generated heated debate among viewers and much divided opinion .
the 17-minute film , which wilders claims is not intended as an attack on muslims but on radical islam , features violent imagery of the terrorist attacks in new york and madrid intertwined with koranic texts .
the film opens and ends with a cartoon of the prophet mohammad with a bomb under his turban , originally published in danish newspapers , accompanied by the sound of ticking .
images of hijacked airplanes flying into the world trade centre in new york on september 11 , 2001 , soon follow with sound bites from phone calls to the emergency services on that day .
the film then continues with grizzly images of bloodstained bodies in the aftermath of the madrid train bombings in march 2004 in which 191 people were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excerpts from the koran are shown with images from 9/11 it intersperses these with images of a koran and the text of a sura from islam 's holiest tome , which translated from arabic implores the faithful to " terrorize the enemies of allah . "
the film carries no commentary and relies purely on the pictures of the terrorist attacks , as well as a beheading and a vision of a future holland where homosexuals and alternative thinkers are tortured , to carry wilders ' perceived vision of " reality . "
" i am a politician , " wilders said recently .
" i think that islam and the koran present a danger for our country and i want to warn against it .
i think i have made a good film within the boundaries of the law .
if something should now happen , then it is solely the responsibility of those people who use violence . "
dutch government distances itself from wilders the dutch government , fearful of reprisals similar to those which followed the reproduction across europe of the cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed , pressured wilders not to release the movie but to little effect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende rejected wilders ' interpretation of islam " this film equates islam with violence and we reject this interpretation , " said prime minister jan peter balkenende .
" the vast majority of muslims reject extremism and violence .
in fact the victims are often also muslims " initial reactions from the muslim community in the netherlands were restrained .
the evening after the film 's release passed without incident , in contrast to the unrest that swept the country following the murder by an islamic militant in 2004 of film director theo van gogh , another dutch artist who was accused of offending islam .
however , iran and indonesia slammed the film .
iran called it film heinous , blasphemous and anti-islamic and called on european governments to block any further showing . indonesia , the world 's most populous muslim nation and a former dutch colony , also condemned the film .
" we are of the view that the film has a racist flavour and is an insult to islam , hidden under the cover of freedom of expression , " a foreign ministry spokesman said .
" we call on indonesian people not to be incited . "
prime minister balkenende praised the efforts of his government to defuse muslim anger in the months preceding the release of the film and welcomed the initial muslim response .
" the government is heartened by the initial restrained reactions of dutch muslim organizations , " he said .
" the dutch government stands for a society in which freedom and respect go hand in hand ...
let us solve problems by working together . "
dutch politicians distanced themselves from wilders and his film .
" the netherlands does not need wilders as a filmmaker , " said mark rutte , leader of the dutch liberal vvd party - of which wilders himself was a member until being thrown out in september 2004 .
" we need wilders as a legislator , to debate about the netherlands and to find solutions for serious problems , including the problems of integration and immigration . "
minister of integration ella vogelaar said the film could increase people 's fears of islamic radicalism .
" the first half of the film contained shocking material , " she said .
dutch muslims wait , international anger simmers muslim groups have appealed for calm and mosques plan to open their doors to the public on friday to defuse tension .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch muslims have recated with restraint to the film fouad sidali , a leading member of the muslim community in holland , called for moderate responses .
" we muslims in the netherlands are opposed to any forms of violence and aggression , " sidali said .
" we are dutch ; we love our country and abide by the constitution . "
moslems in other areas of the world , however , have not been as magnanimous .
before the film 's release , demonstrators had already taken to the streets from afghanistan to indonesia to burn dutch and danish flags , and the governments of pakistan and iran sharply criticized wilders ' project .
nato has expressed concern the film could worsen security for foreign forces in afghanistan , including 1,650 dutch troops .
despite wilders ' own assertion , one that has been supported by a number of dutch legislators , that he did not break any blasphemy laws with the film , a court in rotterdam will hear an injunction against him on friday brought by the dutch islamic federation .
cartoonist to issue writ from secure location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard 's cartoon continues to cause outrage wilders may also find himself embroiled in another court case brought against him by the cartoonist kurt westergaard , whose mohammed caricature , which opens and closes the film , sparked violent protests by muslims worldwide in 2006 .
" my cartoon has been misused again .
it has been pulled from its original context and set in a completely different one , " westergaard told danish broadcaster dr.
" it is a drawing aimed specifically against islamic terror that uses interpretations of the koran and islam as spiritual ammunition , " westergaard , who remains in hiding after death threats , said .
" wilders has not asked me for permission , so it is simply a case of violation of copyright rules , " westergaard said , adding he would contact legal experts friday . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" every european country is also working hard to keep up good relations with china so business is n't disturbed , " he added .
" if they are serious about improving the situation then they should probably consider economic measures . " france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted there were economic concerns that played a role in determining the eu 's response to violence in tibet . " we are constrained by a certain number of economic interests , " he told the daily newspaper liberation this week . international initiatives needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators took to the streets around the world in support of tibet protests one economic move came out of berlin on wednesday when germany said it would cancel aid talks scheduled for may unless violence in tibet stopped .

discussions are still underway and negotiations have not yet begun , according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which did not identify its sources . allianz acquired dresdner bank seven years ago in response to government plans to promote private pension plans .

a new book detailing east germany 's passion for nudity is set to be launched in typically candid style just weeks after a documentary exposed the communist regime 's secret porn industry . if selling a book with the recollections - and photographs - of nudist holidaymakers in east germany was n't enough to cause a stir , bookshop owner helmut maass intends to capitalize on the flesh angle of the new tome by promoting it with a reading to a naked audience .
the book , which celebrates east germany 's renowned " freikoerperkultur " -lsb- fkk -rsb- , draws on the era before the berlin wall came down in 1989 .
its publishers , berlin-based eulenspiegel , are enthusiastic about the publicity stunt .
" this is great advertising for our book , " a spokeswoman said .
the book 's author , thomas kupfermann , contacted devotees and asked them to send him their photographs and also secured a contribution from east german television reporter hans-joachim woller , who covered the fkk scene before 1989 .
the event , set to take place in the north-eastern town of pasewalk and hosted by the nude female model who adorns its cover , is scheduled for april 1 , but it 's no joke , maass said .

the fkk movement dates its origins to the founding of the first nudist society in berlin in 1906 .
while the movement faded in the western states , it flourished in the communist east , with bathing resorts established all along the baltic coast and at the inland lakes frequented by east german holidaymakers .
the fkk movement was just one of the communist country 's many contradictions regarding nudity .
despite the atmosphere of public prudery that prevailed in east germany before the fall of the berlin wall , the gdr was a hot-bed of nudism and naked bathing , both of which were permitted by the communist regime .
secret but sanctioned porn industry exposed while the regime banned western sex films and confiscated erotic films and magazines brought into the country by visitors , it has recently been revealed that the gdr 's armed forces had their own pornography department , which made movies for senior officers and the country 's outwardly prudish hard-line political elite .

the former communist state 's secret porn industry has recently been the subject of a documentary shown on german television .
the show revealed that the gdr 's pornography department was operated by a 160-man film unit which used a secret circle of 12 amateur porn enthusiasts as its stars .
the documentary explained that the unit was set up in 1982 and managed to make a total of 12 erotic films before the collapse of communism in 1989 .
officially the films were all made in secret but eye-witness accounts claimed that they were produced under direction from senior officers and their premieres were attended by many of the state 's most high-ranking officials and politicians . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the documentary explained that the unit was set up in 1982 and managed to make a total of 12 erotic films before the collapse of communism in 1989 .
officially the films were all made in secret but eye-witness accounts claimed that they were produced under direction from senior officers and their premieres were attended by many of the state 's most high-ranking officials and politicians . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new book detailing east germany 's passion for nudity is set to be launched in typically candid style just weeks after a documentary exposed the communist regime 's secret porn industry . if selling a book with the recollections - and photographs - of nudist holidaymakers in east germany was n't enough to cause a stir , bookshop owner helmut maass intends to capitalize on the flesh angle of the new tome by promoting it with a reading to a naked audience .
the book , which celebrates east germany 's renowned " freikoerperkultur " -lsb- fkk -rsb- , draws on the era before the berlin wall came down in 1989 .
its publishers , berlin-based eulenspiegel , are enthusiastic about the publicity stunt .
" this is great advertising for our book , " a spokeswoman said .
the book 's author , thomas kupfermann , contacted devotees and asked them to send him their photographs and also secured a contribution from east german television reporter hans-joachim woller , who covered the fkk scene before 1989 .
the event , set to take place in the north-eastern town of pasewalk and hosted by the nude female model who adorns its cover , is scheduled for april 1 , but it 's no joke , maass said .
book event the latest in fkk revival the shop owner believes he is putting on a world first with his nudist book reading , which is sold out .
he has invited his audience to arrive clothed , as germany is experiencing a chilly spring , and assures them his shop is adequately heated .
he is also providing heavy drapes for the windows to keep passing voyeurs at bay .
east germany 's fkk movement is generally experiencing something of a revival .

enrico hess says tickets are selling rapidly for the first flight on july 5 .
he has had applications from as far afield as australia .
the fkk movement dates its origins to the founding of the first nudist society in berlin in 1906 .
while the movement faded in the western states , it flourished in the communist east , with bathing resorts established all along the baltic coast and at the inland lakes frequented by east german holidaymakers .
the fkk movement was just one of the communist country 's many contradictions regarding nudity .
despite the atmosphere of public prudery that prevailed in east germany before the fall of the berlin wall , the gdr was a hot-bed of nudism and naked bathing , both of which were permitted by the communist regime .
secret but sanctioned porn industry exposed while the regime banned western sex films and confiscated erotic films and magazines brought into the country by visitors , it has recently been revealed that the gdr 's armed forces had their own pornography department , which made movies for senior officers and the country 's outwardly prudish hard-line political elite .

a new book detailing east germany 's passion for nudity is set to be launched in typically candid style just weeks after a documentary exposed the communist regime 's secret porn industry . if selling a book with the recollections - and photographs - of nudist holidaymakers in east germany was n't enough to cause a stir , bookshop owner helmut maass intends to capitalize on the flesh angle of the new tome by promoting it with a reading to a naked audience .
the book , which celebrates east germany 's renowned " freikoerperkultur " -lsb- fkk -rsb- , draws on the era before the berlin wall came down in 1989 .
its publishers , berlin-based eulenspiegel , are enthusiastic about the publicity stunt .
" this is great advertising for our book , " a spokeswoman said .
the book 's author , thomas kupfermann , contacted devotees and asked them to send him their photographs and also secured a contribution from east german television reporter hans-joachim woller , who covered the fkk scene before 1989 .
the event , set to take place in the north-eastern town of pasewalk and hosted by the nude female model who adorns its cover , is scheduled for april 1 , but it 's no joke , maass said .
book event the latest in fkk revival the shop owner believes he is putting on a world first with his nudist book reading , which is sold out .
he has invited his audience to arrive clothed , as germany is experiencing a chilly spring , and assures them his shop is adequately heated .
he is also providing heavy drapes for the windows to keep passing voyeurs at bay .
east germany 's fkk movement is generally experiencing something of a revival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nudist resorts and interest in the lifestyle are on the up a travel agent in the eastern city of erfurt has laid on nudist charter flights this summer to usedom , a baltic island resort and home to a large nudist colony in the communist era .
enrico hess says tickets are selling rapidly for the first flight on july 5 .
he has had applications from as far afield as australia .
the fkk movement dates its origins to the founding of the first nudist society in berlin in 1906 .
while the movement faded in the western states , it flourished in the communist east , with bathing resorts established all along the baltic coast and at the inland lakes frequented by east german holidaymakers .
the fkk movement was just one of the communist country 's many contradictions regarding nudity .
despite the atmosphere of public prudery that prevailed in east germany before the fall of the berlin wall , the gdr was a hot-bed of nudism and naked bathing , both of which were permitted by the communist regime .
secret but sanctioned porn industry exposed while the regime banned western sex films and confiscated erotic films and magazines brought into the country by visitors , it has recently been revealed that the gdr 's armed forces had their own pornography department , which made movies for senior officers and the country 's outwardly prudish hard-line political elite .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the so-called " stasi porn " have looked like this ?
the former communist state 's secret porn industry has recently been the subject of a documentary shown on german television .
the show revealed that the gdr 's pornography department was operated by a 160-man film unit which used a secret circle of 12 amateur porn enthusiasts as its stars .
the documentary explained that the unit was set up in 1982 and managed to make a total of 12 erotic films before the collapse of communism in 1989 .
officially the films were all made in secret but eye-witness accounts claimed that they were produced under direction from senior officers and their premieres were attended by many of the state 's most high-ranking officials and politicians . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de islamic world -pipe- 28.03.2008 dutch muslims react with restraint to mp 's controversial film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right mp geert wilders claims his film is not an attack on muslims but on radicalism muslims in the netherlands have reacted calmly to the internet release of a controversial film critical of islam by dutch far-right mp geert wilders , but elsewhere passions run high . the wilders film , titled " fitna " -lsb- strife -rsb- , made its debut via british video-sharing website liveleak and soon spread to the globally popular youtube site where it quickly generated heated debate among viewers and much divided opinion .
the 17-minute film , which wilders claims is not intended as an attack on muslims but on radical islam , features violent imagery of the terrorist attacks in new york and madrid intertwined with koranic texts .
the film opens and ends with a cartoon of the prophet mohammad with a bomb under his turban , originally published in danish newspapers , accompanied by the sound of ticking .
images of hijacked airplanes flying into the world trade centre in new york on september 11 , 2001 , soon follow with sound bites from phone calls to the emergency services on that day .
the film then continues with grizzly images of bloodstained bodies in the aftermath of the madrid train bombings in march 2004 in which 191 people were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excerpts from the koran are shown with images from 9/11 it intersperses these with images of a koran and the text of a sura from islam 's holiest tome , which translated from arabic implores the faithful to " terrorize the enemies of allah . "
the film carries no commentary and relies purely on the pictures of the terrorist attacks , as well as a beheading and a vision of a future holland where homosexuals and alternative thinkers are tortured , to carry wilders ' perceived vision of " reality . "
" i am a politician , " wilders said recently .
" i think that islam and the koran present a danger for our country and i want to warn against it .
i think i have made a good film within the boundaries of the law .
if something should now happen , then it is solely the responsibility of those people who use violence . "
dutch government distances itself from wilders the dutch government , fearful of reprisals similar to those which followed the reproduction across europe of the cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed , pressured wilders not to release the movie but to little effect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende rejected wilders ' interpretation of islam " this film equates islam with violence and we reject this interpretation , " said prime minister jan peter balkenende .
" the vast majority of muslims reject extremism and violence .
in fact the victims are often also muslims " initial reactions from the muslim community in the netherlands were restrained .
the evening after the film 's release passed without incident , in contrast to the unrest that swept the country following the murder by an islamic militant in 2004 of film director theo van gogh , another dutch artist who was accused of offending islam .
however , iran and indonesia slammed the film .
iran called it film heinous , blasphemous and anti-islamic and called on european governments to block any further showing . indonesia , the world 's most populous muslim nation and a former dutch colony , also condemned the film .
" we are of the view that the film has a racist flavour and is an insult to islam , hidden under the cover of freedom of expression , " a foreign ministry spokesman said .
" we call on indonesian people not to be incited . "
prime minister balkenende praised the efforts of his government to defuse muslim anger in the months preceding the release of the film and welcomed the initial muslim response .
" the government is heartened by the initial restrained reactions of dutch muslim organizations , " he said .
" the dutch government stands for a society in which freedom and respect go hand in hand ...
let us solve problems by working together . "
dutch politicians distanced themselves from wilders and his film .
" the netherlands does not need wilders as a filmmaker , " said mark rutte , leader of the dutch liberal vvd party - of which wilders himself was a member until being thrown out in september 2004 .
" we need wilders as a legislator , to debate about the netherlands and to find solutions for serious problems , including the problems of integration and immigration . "
minister of integration ella vogelaar said the film could increase people 's fears of islamic radicalism .
" the first half of the film contained shocking material , " she said .
dutch muslims wait , international anger simmers muslim groups have appealed for calm and mosques plan to open their doors to the public on friday to defuse tension .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch muslims have recated with restraint to the film fouad sidali , a leading member of the muslim community in holland , called for moderate responses .
" we muslims in the netherlands are opposed to any forms of violence and aggression , " sidali said .
" we are dutch ; we love our country and abide by the constitution . "
moslems in other areas of the world , however , have not been as magnanimous .
before the film 's release , demonstrators had already taken to the streets from afghanistan to indonesia to burn dutch and danish flags , and the governments of pakistan and iran sharply criticized wilders ' project .
nato has expressed concern the film could worsen security for foreign forces in afghanistan , including 1,650 dutch troops .
despite wilders ' own assertion , one that has been supported by a number of dutch legislators , that he did not break any blasphemy laws with the film , a court in rotterdam will hear an injunction against him on friday brought by the dutch islamic federation .
cartoonist to issue writ from secure location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard 's cartoon continues to cause outrage wilders may also find himself embroiled in another court case brought against him by the cartoonist kurt westergaard , whose mohammed caricature , which opens and closes the film , sparked violent protests by muslims worldwide in 2006 .
" my cartoon has been misused again .
it has been pulled from its original context and set in a completely different one , " westergaard told danish broadcaster dr.
" it is a drawing aimed specifically against islamic terror that uses interpretations of the koran and islam as spiritual ammunition , " westergaard , who remains in hiding after death threats , said .
" wilders has not asked me for permission , so it is simply a case of violation of copyright rules , " westergaard said , adding he would contact legal experts friday . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de islamic world -pipe- 28.03.2008 dutch muslims react with restraint to mp 's controversial film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right mp geert wilders claims his film is not an attack on muslims but on radicalism muslims in the netherlands have reacted calmly to the internet release of a controversial film critical of islam by dutch far-right mp geert wilders , but elsewhere passions run high . the wilders film , titled " fitna " -lsb- strife -rsb- , made its debut via british video-sharing website liveleak and soon spread to the globally popular youtube site where it quickly generated heated debate among viewers and much divided opinion .
the 17-minute film , which wilders claims is not intended as an attack on muslims but on radical islam , features violent imagery of the terrorist attacks in new york and madrid intertwined with koranic texts .
the film opens and ends with a cartoon of the prophet mohammad with a bomb under his turban , originally published in danish newspapers , accompanied by the sound of ticking .
images of hijacked airplanes flying into the world trade centre in new york on september 11 , 2001 , soon follow with sound bites from phone calls to the emergency services on that day .
the film then continues with grizzly images of bloodstained bodies in the aftermath of the madrid train bombings in march 2004 in which 191 people were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excerpts from the koran are shown with images from 9/11 it intersperses these with images of a koran and the text of a sura from islam 's holiest tome , which translated from arabic implores the faithful to " terrorize the enemies of allah . "
the film carries no commentary and relies purely on the pictures of the terrorist attacks , as well as a beheading and a vision of a future holland where homosexuals and alternative thinkers are tortured , to carry wilders ' perceived vision of " reality . "
" i am a politician , " wilders said recently .
" i think that islam and the koran present a danger for our country and i want to warn against it .
i think i have made a good film within the boundaries of the law .
if something should now happen , then it is solely the responsibility of those people who use violence . "
dutch government distances itself from wilders the dutch government , fearful of reprisals similar to those which followed the reproduction across europe of the cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed , pressured wilders not to release the movie but to little effect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende rejected wilders ' interpretation of islam " this film equates islam with violence and we reject this interpretation , " said prime minister jan peter balkenende .
" the vast majority of muslims reject extremism and violence .
in fact the victims are often also muslims " initial reactions from the muslim community in the netherlands were restrained .
the evening after the film 's release passed without incident , in contrast to the unrest that swept the country following the murder by an islamic militant in 2004 of film director theo van gogh , another dutch artist who was accused of offending islam .
however , iran and indonesia slammed the film .
iran called it film heinous , blasphemous and anti-islamic and called on european governments to block any further showing . indonesia , the world 's most populous muslim nation and a former dutch colony , also condemned the film .
" we are of the view that the film has a racist flavour and is an insult to islam , hidden under the cover of freedom of expression , " a foreign ministry spokesman said .
" we call on indonesian people not to be incited . "
prime minister balkenende praised the efforts of his government to defuse muslim anger in the months preceding the release of the film and welcomed the initial muslim response .
" the government is heartened by the initial restrained reactions of dutch muslim organizations , " he said .
" the dutch government stands for a society in which freedom and respect go hand in hand ...
let us solve problems by working together . "
dutch politicians distanced themselves from wilders and his film .
" the netherlands does not need wilders as a filmmaker , " said mark rutte , leader of the dutch liberal vvd party - of which wilders himself was a member until being thrown out in september 2004 .
" we need wilders as a legislator , to debate about the netherlands and to find solutions for serious problems , including the problems of integration and immigration . "
minister of integration ella vogelaar said the film could increase people 's fears of islamic radicalism .
" the first half of the film contained shocking material , " she said .
dutch muslims wait , international anger simmers muslim groups have appealed for calm and mosques plan to open their doors to the public on friday to defuse tension .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch muslims have recated with restraint to the film fouad sidali , a leading member of the muslim community in holland , called for moderate responses .
" we muslims in the netherlands are opposed to any forms of violence and aggression , " sidali said .
" we are dutch ; we love our country and abide by the constitution . "
moslems in other areas of the world , however , have not been as magnanimous .
before the film 's release , demonstrators had already taken to the streets from afghanistan to indonesia to burn dutch and danish flags , and the governments of pakistan and iran sharply criticized wilders ' project .
nato has expressed concern the film could worsen security for foreign forces in afghanistan , including 1,650 dutch troops .
despite wilders ' own assertion , one that has been supported by a number of dutch legislators , that he did not break any blasphemy laws with the film , a court in rotterdam will hear an injunction against him on friday brought by the dutch islamic federation .

" my cartoon has been misused again .
it has been pulled from its original context and set in a completely different one , " westergaard told danish broadcaster dr.
" it is a drawing aimed specifically against islamic terror that uses interpretations of the koran and islam as spiritual ammunition , " westergaard , who remains in hiding after death threats , said .

prime minister balkenende praised the efforts of his government to defuse muslim anger in the months preceding the release of the film and welcomed the initial muslim response .
" the government is heartened by the initial restrained reactions of dutch muslim organizations , " he said .
" the dutch government stands for a society in which freedom and respect go hand in hand ...

dutch politicians distanced themselves from wilders and his film .

" we need wilders as a legislator , to debate about the netherlands and to find solutions for serious problems , including the problems of integration and immigration . "

the resulting institution would then acquire postbank , which will be up for sale in the next few months , according to the report . the deal has n't been inked , however .
discussions are still underway and negotiations have not yet begun , according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which did not identify its sources . allianz acquired dresdner bank seven years ago in response to government plans to promote private pension plans .
speculations about the future of the frankfurt-based bank have arisen since dresdner announced earlier this week that it was planning to split its investment division from its customer banking department . according to other news reports , spain 's giant banco santander has expressed interest in acquiring dresdner and allianz is also holding talks with beijing 's state-owned china investment corporation over the sale of their banking offshoot . if the three-way merger pans out , it could take months to see through .
as the largest shareholder in the deutsche post , the owner of postbank , the german government would have a decisive say in the deal . the resulting bank would , with 26 million customers , become the country 's largest . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , eu foreign ministers remain at odds over a unified stance on the coming event . the decision to stay away was not a boycott in protest to china 's crackdown on tibet or its wider human right record , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .
steinmeier said that neither the chancellor , interior and sports minister wolfgang schaeuble nor he had plans in place to attend even before the people 's republic 's recent crushing of pro-independence protestors in lhasa .
" as far as i know , schaeuble has not planned to take part in the opening ceremony ...
as for myself and the chancellor , i do n't think so either , " steinmeier told journalists ahead of an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in slovenia .
" in that sense , there has been nothing to cancel . "

" this is not the right moment to talk about a boycott of the olympics ...
we should watch how the chinese government deals with the situation in the next weeks and months , " steinmeier said .
but the subject of forming a joint eu position was unlikely to be debated at the foreign ministers ' meeting , steinmeier added .
" i ca n't imagine it , because i ca n't say who has already decided to take part , so there ca n't be agreement on canceling that attendance , " he said .

"
the eu foreign ministers , in slovenia for two days of talks , are under increasing public pressure to send a strong message to china over tibet but have so far been divided over boycotting the beijing olympics opening ceremony .
no one was seeking a full boycott of the summer games as they arrived for the talks at brdo pri kranju , near the slovenian capital ljubljana , but most eu nations have openly condemned the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet which left some 140 dead , according to tibetan leaders in exile .
the official eu line so far has been to call for restraint and urge china to open a dialogue on cultural rights with the dalai lama , whom beijing has accused of inciting the pro-independence riots .
more european leaders to stay away from opening ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer and fewer european leaders will be at the opening several leaders of eastern european states - czech president vaclav klaus , his estonian counterpart toomas hendrik ilves and polish prime minister donald tusk - have all said they will not be attending the games opening .
however british prime minister gordon brown said in london that britain , which will host the 2012 olympics , would definitely not be boycotting any part of the beijing games .
others were more cautious .
austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , arriving in brdo , said a ceremony boycott could be " a strong signal , " without committing to such a move .
she said on austrian radio it was " important not to limit the question of the respect of human rights in china and tibet exclusively to the question of a political presence at the opening ceremony of the olympic games . "
sarkozy 's presidency to confirm eu position french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country will assume the eu presidency from slovenia in july , promised thursday to consult with his european partners on a unified response and plan of action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said the eu would have a position under his presidency " at the time of the olympics , i will be in the presidency of the european union so i have to sound out and consult my fellow members to see whether or not we should boycott , " sarkozy said .
" according to how the situation is looking at the time , i reserve the right to say whether or not i will attend the opening ceremony . "
sarkozy reiterated that none of the 27 eu nations had so far called for a joint boycott . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the official eu line so far has been to call for restraint and urge china to open a dialogue on cultural rights with the dalai lama , whom beijing has accused of inciting the pro-independence riots .
more european leaders to stay away from opening ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer and fewer european leaders will be at the opening several leaders of eastern european states - czech president vaclav klaus , his estonian counterpart toomas hendrik ilves and polish prime minister donald tusk - have all said they will not be attending the games opening .
however british prime minister gordon brown said in london that britain , which will host the 2012 olympics , would definitely not be boycotting any part of the beijing games .
others were more cautious .
austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , arriving in brdo , said a ceremony boycott could be " a strong signal , " without committing to such a move .
she said on austrian radio it was " important not to limit the question of the respect of human rights in china and tibet exclusively to the question of a political presence at the opening ceremony of the olympic games . "
sarkozy 's presidency to confirm eu position french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country will assume the eu presidency from slovenia in july , promised thursday to consult with his european partners on a unified response and plan of action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said the eu would have a position under his presidency " at the time of the olympics , i will be in the presidency of the european union so i have to sound out and consult my fellow members to see whether or not we should boycott , " sarkozy said .

meanwhile , eu foreign ministers remain at odds over a unified stance on the coming event . the decision to stay away was not a boycott in protest to china 's crackdown on tibet or its wider human right record , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .
steinmeier said that neither the chancellor , interior and sports minister wolfgang schaeuble nor he had plans in place to attend even before the people 's republic 's recent crushing of pro-independence protestors in lhasa .

the eu foreign ministers , in slovenia for two days of talks , are under increasing public pressure to send a strong message to china over tibet but have so far been divided over boycotting the beijing olympics opening ceremony .
no one was seeking a full boycott of the summer games as they arrived for the talks at brdo pri kranju , near the slovenian capital ljubljana , but most eu nations have openly condemned the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet which left some 140 dead , according to tibetan leaders in exile .
the official eu line so far has been to call for restraint and urge china to open a dialogue on cultural rights with the dalai lama , whom beijing has accused of inciting the pro-independence riots .
more european leaders to stay away from opening ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer and fewer european leaders will be at the opening several leaders of eastern european states - czech president vaclav klaus , his estonian counterpart toomas hendrik ilves and polish prime minister donald tusk - have all said they will not be attending the games opening .
however british prime minister gordon brown said in london that britain , which will host the 2012 olympics , would definitely not be boycotting any part of the beijing games .
others were more cautious .
austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , arriving in brdo , said a ceremony boycott could be " a strong signal , " without committing to such a move .
she said on austrian radio it was " important not to limit the question of the respect of human rights in china and tibet exclusively to the question of a political presence at the opening ceremony of the olympic games . "
sarkozy 's presidency to confirm eu position french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country will assume the eu presidency from slovenia in july , promised thursday to consult with his european partners on a unified response and plan of action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said the eu would have a position under his presidency " at the time of the olympics , i will be in the presidency of the european union so i have to sound out and consult my fellow members to see whether or not we should boycott , " sarkozy said .

meanwhile , eu foreign ministers remain at odds over a unified stance on the coming event . the decision to stay away was not a boycott in protest to china 's crackdown on tibet or its wider human right record , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .
steinmeier said that neither the chancellor , interior and sports minister wolfgang schaeuble nor he had plans in place to attend even before the people 's republic 's recent crushing of pro-independence protestors in lhasa .
" as far as i know , schaeuble has not planned to take part in the opening ceremony ...
as for myself and the chancellor , i do n't think so either , " steinmeier told journalists ahead of an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in slovenia .
" in that sense , there has been nothing to cancel . "
" a ' no ' to the olympics in order to relieve our consciences would help neither the people in china nor the sports organizations ...
at the moment i am against the kind of boycott debate that is going on in some european member states , " he said .
" this is not the right moment to talk about a boycott of the olympics ...
we should watch how the chinese government deals with the situation in the next weeks and months , " steinmeier said .
but the subject of forming a joint eu position was unlikely to be debated at the foreign ministers ' meeting , steinmeier added .
" i ca n't imagine it , because i ca n't say who has already decided to take part , so there ca n't be agreement on canceling that attendance , " he said .
as sports minister , schaeuble is expected to travel to beijing as a traditional sign of support for the german athletes at a later date during the olympics .
german president horst koehler is expected to attend the beijing paralympics , which take place in september .

while the procedure 's not punishable , the man still expects to be taken to court . presenting his machine to reporters on friday , march 28 , former hamburg justice minister roger kusch said that it would give terminally ill people in germany a chance to end their lives instead of forcing them to travel to switzerland , where assisted suicide is legal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kusch has made assisted suicide his mission " the machine is ready for use , " kusch said of the device that 's made up of a conventional intravenous drip feed .

while the procedure 's not punishable , the man still expects to be taken to court . presenting his machine to reporters on friday , march 28 , former hamburg justice minister roger kusch said that it would give terminally ill people in germany a chance to end their lives instead of forcing them to travel to switzerland , where assisted suicide is legal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kusch has made assisted suicide his mission " the machine is ready for use , " kusch said of the device that 's made up of a conventional intravenous drip feed .
it will be fitted with two syringes , one of which is filled with an anesthetic while the other one contains lethal potassium chloride . a doctor would place a needle in the patient 's vein , which is not punishable under german law .
the patient would then get a button placed in his or her hand and decide whether to push it or not , hence starting the deadly infusion . kusch said that the whole procedure would last around four minutes , the person would die much more quickly than that after losing consciousness within a few seconds .
he added that two doctors were ready to place the needle and issue a certificate ahead of the procedure , stating that the person was indeed terminally ill and still in charge of their mental capacities . harsh criticism germany 's medical community and church leaders quickly criticized kusch 's plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should germany offer more care to the terminally ill rather than a way for them to commit suicide ?
" we do n't need a killing machine , but instead terminal care and palliative medicine that relieves people of pain and fear at the end of their lives , " said frank ulrich montgomery , the vice president of the german medical association , according to german news service dpa . hamburg 's catholic auxiliary bishop , hans-jochen jaschke , also rejected kusch 's machine , calling it a " torture instrument " and a " macabre game with death , disguised by noble words of compassion and covered by questionable legal nit-picking , " according to catholic news service kna . jaschke added that the church was also aware that humans had a right to die . " you can not prolong life at any price and you have to help people to die humanely , " he said .
" but not by using this killing apparatus . " from minister to activist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beust is currently trying to form germany 's first coalition between conservatives and greens at state level kusch told reporters that he expected to face criminal proceedings despite not actually breaking any laws . kusch was hamburg 's justice minister for the german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union from 2001 to 2006 .
he left the government after a falling-out with his friend , hamburg mayor ole von beust , and founded a right-wing splinter party . during the city state 's february elections , he made assisted suicide one of his main campaign topics , but only received 0.5 percent of votes .

although all had university degrees , 51 percent were not paid for their internships , and another 12 percent thought they were paid too little . he said he did not want to do away with internships or put in place a minimum wage for them , rather he was only interested in seeing that interns were treated fairly , since they are a growing group . while 17 percent of 30 to 34-year-olds have experience as an intern , 25 percent of those between 18 and 24 have an internship behind them .

germany 's labor minister wants to do something about it . nora neye , 27 , is a member of germany 's so-called " internship generation , " although it 's not a club she particularly wanted to join .
she 's among the many young germans in their 20s and early 30s who have university degrees but have had little luck finding full-time work . instead , they have embarked on a series of internships , often unpaid , hoping that one of them might lead to a permanent job .
at the end of each , it 's common that graduates leave disappointed or embittered , and usually a lot poorer . " finishing your degree and then finding proper work seems more and more difficult , " she said .
" if you have n't done quite a number of internships , you 're not going to find a job . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internships have become the norm as new graduates outnumber jobs so neye , after getting bachelor 's and master 's degrees in the humanities , got on the internship train herself , doing two-month stints at publishing houses and media organizations .
some were helpful ; some were not .
none led to a job . but it was firms ' attitude that there was a nearly endless source of highly qualified labor they can use on the cheap that angered her most . " companies believe more and more they can do whatever and do n't have to pay for it , " she said . new guidelines germany 's labor minister olaf scholz wants to cut down on what he and other critics call intern exploitation .
he has called for new regulations that would require interns with university degrees be paid appropriately , that their duties and goals be outlined at the outset , and that they not be treated as cheap replacements for regular employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholz wants to instate a series of protections for interns " internships are useful , but there 's been some abuse and we have to do something about it , " he told reporters . scholz , a member of the center-left social democratic party , pointed to a study conducted by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health -lrb- baua -rrb- , which asked 2,000 young people between 18 and 34 about their intern experiences .
although all had university degrees , 51 percent were not paid for their internships , and another 12 percent thought they were paid too little . he said he did not want to do away with internships or put in place a minimum wage for them , rather he was only interested in seeing that interns were treated fairly , since they are a growing group . while 17 percent of 30 to 34-year-olds have experience as an intern , 25 percent of those between 18 and 24 have an internship behind them . " there 's a general culture of doing more and more internships and it 's very problematic , " said former intern neye .
" employers see you after you 've finished your degree these days and say ' why have you only done five internships and not 10 ? " ' new economic model ? internships in germany have traditionally been seen as a way to introduce young people to professional working life .
for university graduates , they have been thought of as bridges to permanent employment , especially since these interns are n't just making coffee and copies , they 're doing real work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work-pay balance with many interns is off " they have a solid education and the required knowledge and therefore generally are given significant tasks , " said rene rudolf of the youth arm of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- . but he and others say many companies have abandoned the principle of interns transitioning to full-time employees .
bettina könig , who heads an initiative that aims to improve internships called fair work , said when the german economy was sputtering in 2001 , jobs were scarce , firms were afraid to hire , and graduates gladly took internships , even for low or no pay , just to get experience and perhaps impress a higher-up . " and now even that the economy is better , this kind of bad model has established itself in many companies , " she said .
" i do n't see it changing without some kind of government intervention . " fair work runs a web site where interns can post their own experiences .
reports of 40 or 50-hour weeks with no pay and no time off yet fulfilling most or all the duties of a full-time staff person are not unusual . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nice facade , bad intern policy - german historical museum last year , the group 's annual prize of the worst internship of the year , money-grubber 2007 , went to the german historical museum in berlin . there , a history graduate worked 39-hour weeks for six months without insurance , vacation or sick leave .

but some say that 's nothing more than a symbolic move to avoid a human rights confrontation with china . european union foreign ministers began talks on friday , march 28 , on whether the bloc would respond to china 's crackdown on pro-independence protesters in tibet with a boycott of the 2008 summer olympics opening ceremony . violence ensuing from street protests , which began on march 10 to mark the anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against chinese rule in tibet and turned into riots four days later , has left some 140 dead , according to tibetan leaders in exile .
chinese authorities put the figure at 20 . an easy way to make a statement a boycott of the opening ceremony - or even all the olympic events - is a sign that lets western governments make a symbolic statement without really risking much , said matthias chardon of munich 's center for applied policy research . " when considered as a symbol , a boycott is a clear , public sign , " he said .
" the power of these kinds of symbolic statements should n't be underestimated , but a boycott of the opening ceremony is a relatively easy statement to make . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups want an investigation into violence in lhasa the scope of violence in tibet , however , demands more than a symbolic statement , according to marianne heuwagen of human rights watch 's berlin office . " i think it 's inappropriate to only talk about an olympic boycott at this point , " she said .
" europe has to make clear that what 's happening is not acceptable . " she said the international community should call for an independent investigation of what has occurred in tibet and ask for journalists to be granted free access to the region . " europe needs to hold china to the agreements it made when it was awarded the olympics , " she said , adding that beijing had not kept promises regarding freedom of the press by kicking foreign journalists out of tibet during the demonstrations . serious consequences unlikely china , however , realizes its status as a world economic power will go a long way in protecting it from more serious consequences , according to karsten giese , a china expert at the german institute of global and area studies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is buying more and more from china " serious consequences that go beyond symbolic policies are unlikely - china 's role in the global economy and politics is too strong , " he said .
" nothing can get done without china when it comes to dealing with issues like north korea , the iranian nuclear program or global climate change . " china has replaced the us as the main source of eu imports and is becoming an increasingly popular destination for european products , according to eu statistics for 2006 , the most recent year for which records exist . in part , it 's an interest in maintaining positive trade relations that keeps the bloc from discussing measures beyond sitting out the olympic opening ceremony , chardon said . " every european country is also working hard to keep up good relations with china so business is n't disturbed , " he added .
" if they are serious about improving the situation then they should probably consider economic measures .

the resulting institution would then acquire postbank , which will be up for sale in the next few months , according to the report . the deal has n't been inked , however .
discussions are still underway and negotiations have not yet begun , according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which did not identify its sources . allianz acquired dresdner bank seven years ago in response to government plans to promote private pension plans .
speculations about the future of the frankfurt-based bank have arisen since dresdner announced earlier this week that it was planning to split its investment division from its customer banking department . according to other news reports , spain 's giant banco santander has expressed interest in acquiring dresdner and allianz is also holding talks with beijing 's state-owned china investment corporation over the sale of their banking offshoot . if the three-way merger pans out , it could take months to see through .
as the largest shareholder in the deutsche post , the owner of postbank , the german government would have a decisive say in the deal . the resulting bank would , with 26 million customers , become the country 's largest . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new book detailing east germany 's passion for nudity is set to be launched in typically candid style just weeks after a documentary exposed the communist regime 's secret porn industry . if selling a book with the recollections - and photographs - of nudist holidaymakers in east germany was n't enough to cause a stir , bookshop owner helmut maass intends to capitalize on the flesh angle of the new tome by promoting it with a reading to a naked audience .
the book , which celebrates east germany 's renowned " freikoerperkultur " -lsb- fkk -rsb- , draws on the era before the berlin wall came down in 1989 .
its publishers , berlin-based eulenspiegel , are enthusiastic about the publicity stunt .
" this is great advertising for our book , " a spokeswoman said .
the book 's author , thomas kupfermann , contacted devotees and asked them to send him their photographs and also secured a contribution from east german television reporter hans-joachim woller , who covered the fkk scene before 1989 .
the event , set to take place in the north-eastern town of pasewalk and hosted by the nude female model who adorns its cover , is scheduled for april 1 , but it 's no joke , maass said .

he is also providing heavy drapes for the windows to keep passing voyeurs at bay .
east germany 's fkk movement is generally experiencing something of a revival .

enrico hess says tickets are selling rapidly for the first flight on july 5 .
he has had applications from as far afield as australia .
the fkk movement dates its origins to the founding of the first nudist society in berlin in 1906 .
while the movement faded in the western states , it flourished in the communist east , with bathing resorts established all along the baltic coast and at the inland lakes frequented by east german holidaymakers .
the fkk movement was just one of the communist country 's many contradictions regarding nudity .
despite the atmosphere of public prudery that prevailed in east germany before the fall of the berlin wall , the gdr was a hot-bed of nudism and naked bathing , both of which were permitted by the communist regime .

germany 's labor minister wants to do something about it . nora neye , 27 , is a member of germany 's so-called " internship generation , " although it 's not a club she particularly wanted to join .
she 's among the many young germans in their 20s and early 30s who have university degrees but have had little luck finding full-time work . instead , they have embarked on a series of internships , often unpaid , hoping that one of them might lead to a permanent job .
at the end of each , it 's common that graduates leave disappointed or embittered , and usually a lot poorer . " finishing your degree and then finding proper work seems more and more difficult , " she said .
" if you have n't done quite a number of internships , you 're not going to find a job .

some were helpful ; some were not .
none led to a job . but it was firms ' attitude that there was a nearly endless source of highly qualified labor they can use on the cheap that angered her most . " companies believe more and more they can do whatever and do n't have to pay for it , " she said . new guidelines germany 's labor minister olaf scholz wants to cut down on what he and other critics call intern exploitation .
he has called for new regulations that would require interns with university degrees be paid appropriately , that their duties and goals be outlined at the outset , and that they not be treated as cheap replacements for regular employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholz wants to instate a series of protections for interns " internships are useful , but there 's been some abuse and we have to do something about it , " he told reporters . scholz , a member of the center-left social democratic party , pointed to a study conducted by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health -lrb- baua -rrb- , which asked 2,000 young people between 18 and 34 about their intern experiences .
although all had university degrees , 51 percent were not paid for their internships , and another 12 percent thought they were paid too little . he said he did not want to do away with internships or put in place a minimum wage for them , rather he was only interested in seeing that interns were treated fairly , since they are a growing group . while 17 percent of 30 to 34-year-olds have experience as an intern , 25 percent of those between 18 and 24 have an internship behind them . " there 's a general culture of doing more and more internships and it 's very problematic , " said former intern neye .
" employers see you after you 've finished your degree these days and say ' why have you only done five internships and not 10 ? " ' new economic model ? internships in germany have traditionally been seen as a way to introduce young people to professional working life .
for university graduates , they have been thought of as bridges to permanent employment , especially since these interns are n't just making coffee and copies , they 're doing real work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work-pay balance with many interns is off " they have a solid education and the required knowledge and therefore generally are given significant tasks , " said rene rudolf of the youth arm of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- . but he and others say many companies have abandoned the principle of interns transitioning to full-time employees .
bettina könig , who heads an initiative that aims to improve internships called fair work , said when the german economy was sputtering in 2001 , jobs were scarce , firms were afraid to hire , and graduates gladly took internships , even for low or no pay , just to get experience and perhaps impress a higher-up . " and now even that the economy is better , this kind of bad model has established itself in many companies , " she said .
" i do n't see it changing without some kind of government intervention . " fair work runs a web site where interns can post their own experiences .

the 17-minute film , which wilders claims is not intended as an attack on muslims but on radical islam , features violent imagery of the terrorist attacks in new york and madrid intertwined with koranic texts .
the film opens and ends with a cartoon of the prophet mohammad with a bomb under his turban , originally published in danish newspapers , accompanied by the sound of ticking .
images of hijacked airplanes flying into the world trade centre in new york on september 11 , 2001 , soon follow with sound bites from phone calls to the emergency services on that day .
the film then continues with grizzly images of bloodstained bodies in the aftermath of the madrid train bombings in march 2004 in which 191 people were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excerpts from the koran are shown with images from 9/11 it intersperses these with images of a koran and the text of a sura from islam 's holiest tome , which translated from arabic implores the faithful to " terrorize the enemies of allah . "
the film carries no commentary and relies purely on the pictures of the terrorist attacks , as well as a beheading and a vision of a future holland where homosexuals and alternative thinkers are tortured , to carry wilders ' perceived vision of " reality . "
" i am a politician , " wilders said recently .
" i think that islam and the koran present a danger for our country and i want to warn against it .
i think i have made a good film within the boundaries of the law .
if something should now happen , then it is solely the responsibility of those people who use violence . "
dutch government distances itself from wilders the dutch government , fearful of reprisals similar to those which followed the reproduction across europe of the cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed , pressured wilders not to release the movie but to little effect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende rejected wilders ' interpretation of islam " this film equates islam with violence and we reject this interpretation , " said prime minister jan peter balkenende .
" the vast majority of muslims reject extremism and violence .
in fact the victims are often also muslims " initial reactions from the muslim community in the netherlands were restrained .
the evening after the film 's release passed without incident , in contrast to the unrest that swept the country following the murder by an islamic militant in 2004 of film director theo van gogh , another dutch artist who was accused of offending islam .
however , iran and indonesia slammed the film .
iran called it film heinous , blasphemous and anti-islamic and called on european governments to block any further showing . indonesia , the world 's most populous muslim nation and a former dutch colony , also condemned the film .
" we are of the view that the film has a racist flavour and is an insult to islam , hidden under the cover of freedom of expression , " a foreign ministry spokesman said .
" we call on indonesian people not to be incited . "
prime minister balkenende praised the efforts of his government to defuse muslim anger in the months preceding the release of the film and welcomed the initial muslim response .
" the government is heartened by the initial restrained reactions of dutch muslim organizations , " he said .
" the dutch government stands for a society in which freedom and respect go hand in hand ...
let us solve problems by working together . "
dutch politicians distanced themselves from wilders and his film .
" the netherlands does not need wilders as a filmmaker , " said mark rutte , leader of the dutch liberal vvd party - of which wilders himself was a member until being thrown out in september 2004 .
" we need wilders as a legislator , to debate about the netherlands and to find solutions for serious problems , including the problems of integration and immigration . "
minister of integration ella vogelaar said the film could increase people 's fears of islamic radicalism .
" the first half of the film contained shocking material , " she said .
dutch muslims wait , international anger simmers muslim groups have appealed for calm and mosques plan to open their doors to the public on friday to defuse tension .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch muslims have recated with restraint to the film fouad sidali , a leading member of the muslim community in holland , called for moderate responses .
" we muslims in the netherlands are opposed to any forms of violence and aggression , " sidali said .
" we are dutch ; we love our country and abide by the constitution . "
moslems in other areas of the world , however , have not been as magnanimous .
before the film 's release , demonstrators had already taken to the streets from afghanistan to indonesia to burn dutch and danish flags , and the governments of pakistan and iran sharply criticized wilders ' project .
nato has expressed concern the film could worsen security for foreign forces in afghanistan , including 1,650 dutch troops .
despite wilders ' own assertion , one that has been supported by a number of dutch legislators , that he did not break any blasphemy laws with the film , a court in rotterdam will hear an injunction against him on friday brought by the dutch islamic federation .
cartoonist to issue writ from secure location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard 's cartoon continues to cause outrage wilders may also find himself embroiled in another court case brought against him by the cartoonist kurt westergaard , whose mohammed caricature , which opens and closes the film , sparked violent protests by muslims worldwide in 2006 .
" my cartoon has been misused again .
it has been pulled from its original context and set in a completely different one , " westergaard told danish broadcaster dr.
" it is a drawing aimed specifically against islamic terror that uses interpretations of the koran and islam as spiritual ammunition , " westergaard , who remains in hiding after death threats , said .
" wilders has not asked me for permission , so it is simply a case of violation of copyright rules , " westergaard said , adding he would contact legal experts friday . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they currently only have the rights to construct the train cars , but purchasing additional rights from thyssenkrupp would mean they could produce complete transrapid systems and sell them elsewhere . however , it would also be necessary to obtain the control technology developed by siemens , as well as the engine know-how . chinese expert says deal unlikely a chinese transport export on friday however said that such a deal between beijing and thyssenkrupp was " unlikely . "
xie weida , deputy director of the railway institute at shanghai 's tongji university , said the core technology would be extremely expensive but conceded that buying it could benefit china . a planned extension of the shanghai transrapid line by world expo , which the city will host in 2010 , was recently postponed by mayor han zheng . according to the welt report , an eight- or nine-figure deal between beijing and thyssenkrupp could potentially spare the 220 jobs in germany that are threatened by the closure of the project .

but some say that 's nothing more than a symbolic move to avoid a human rights confrontation with china . european union foreign ministers began talks on friday , march 28 , on whether the bloc would respond to china 's crackdown on pro-independence protesters in tibet with a boycott of the 2008 summer olympics opening ceremony . violence ensuing from street protests , which began on march 10 to mark the anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against chinese rule in tibet and turned into riots four days later , has left some 140 dead , according to tibetan leaders in exile .
chinese authorities put the figure at 20 . an easy way to make a statement a boycott of the opening ceremony - or even all the olympic events - is a sign that lets western governments make a symbolic statement without really risking much , said matthias chardon of munich 's center for applied policy research . " when considered as a symbol , a boycott is a clear , public sign , " he said .
" the power of these kinds of symbolic statements should n't be underestimated , but a boycott of the opening ceremony is a relatively easy statement to make . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups want an investigation into violence in lhasa the scope of violence in tibet , however , demands more than a symbolic statement , according to marianne heuwagen of human rights watch 's berlin office . " i think it 's inappropriate to only talk about an olympic boycott at this point , " she said .
" europe has to make clear that what 's happening is not acceptable . " she said the international community should call for an independent investigation of what has occurred in tibet and ask for journalists to be granted free access to the region . " europe needs to hold china to the agreements it made when it was awarded the olympics , " she said , adding that beijing had not kept promises regarding freedom of the press by kicking foreign journalists out of tibet during the demonstrations . serious consequences unlikely china , however , realizes its status as a world economic power will go a long way in protecting it from more serious consequences , according to karsten giese , a china expert at the german institute of global and area studies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is buying more and more from china " serious consequences that go beyond symbolic policies are unlikely - china 's role in the global economy and politics is too strong , " he said .
" nothing can get done without china when it comes to dealing with issues like north korea , the iranian nuclear program or global climate change . " china has replaced the us as the main source of eu imports and is becoming an increasingly popular destination for european products , according to eu statistics for 2006 , the most recent year for which records exist . in part , it 's an interest in maintaining positive trade relations that keeps the bloc from discussing measures beyond sitting out the olympic opening ceremony , chardon said . " every european country is also working hard to keep up good relations with china so business is n't disturbed , " he added .
" if they are serious about improving the situation then they should probably consider economic measures . " france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted there were economic concerns that played a role in determining the eu 's response to violence in tibet . " we are constrained by a certain number of economic interests , " he told the daily newspaper liberation this week . international initiatives needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators took to the streets around the world in support of tibet protests one economic move came out of berlin on wednesday when germany said it would cancel aid talks scheduled for may unless violence in tibet stopped . " it is hard to imagine dialog taking place under the current conditions , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said in a statement . but such steps would be more effective if they were coordinated at an eu-level , chardon said : calls for change will carry more weight when made by not just 80 million germans but 497 million europeans . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" as far as i know , schaeuble has not planned to take part in the opening ceremony ...

the eu foreign ministers , in slovenia for two days of talks , are under increasing public pressure to send a strong message to china over tibet but have so far been divided over boycotting the beijing olympics opening ceremony .
no one was seeking a full boycott of the summer games as they arrived for the talks at brdo pri kranju , near the slovenian capital ljubljana , but most eu nations have openly condemned the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet which left some 140 dead , according to tibetan leaders in exile .
the official eu line so far has been to call for restraint and urge china to open a dialogue on cultural rights with the dalai lama , whom beijing has accused of inciting the pro-independence riots .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de islamic world -pipe- 28.03.2008 dutch muslims react with restraint to mp 's controversial film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right mp geert wilders claims his film is not an attack on muslims but on radicalism muslims in the netherlands have reacted calmly to the internet release of a controversial film critical of islam by dutch far-right mp geert wilders , but elsewhere passions run high . the wilders film , titled " fitna " -lsb- strife -rsb- , made its debut via british video-sharing website liveleak and soon spread to the globally popular youtube site where it quickly generated heated debate among viewers and much divided opinion .
the 17-minute film , which wilders claims is not intended as an attack on muslims but on radical islam , features violent imagery of the terrorist attacks in new york and madrid intertwined with koranic texts .
the film opens and ends with a cartoon of the prophet mohammad with a bomb under his turban , originally published in danish newspapers , accompanied by the sound of ticking .
images of hijacked airplanes flying into the world trade centre in new york on september 11 , 2001 , soon follow with sound bites from phone calls to the emergency services on that day .
the film then continues with grizzly images of bloodstained bodies in the aftermath of the madrid train bombings in march 2004 in which 191 people were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excerpts from the koran are shown with images from 9/11 it intersperses these with images of a koran and the text of a sura from islam 's holiest tome , which translated from arabic implores the faithful to " terrorize the enemies of allah . "
the film carries no commentary and relies purely on the pictures of the terrorist attacks , as well as a beheading and a vision of a future holland where homosexuals and alternative thinkers are tortured , to carry wilders ' perceived vision of " reality . "
" i am a politician , " wilders said recently .
" i think that islam and the koran present a danger for our country and i want to warn against it .
i think i have made a good film within the boundaries of the law .
if something should now happen , then it is solely the responsibility of those people who use violence . "
dutch government distances itself from wilders the dutch government , fearful of reprisals similar to those which followed the reproduction across europe of the cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed , pressured wilders not to release the movie but to little effect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende rejected wilders ' interpretation of islam " this film equates islam with violence and we reject this interpretation , " said prime minister jan peter balkenende .
" the vast majority of muslims reject extremism and violence .
in fact the victims are often also muslims " initial reactions from the muslim community in the netherlands were restrained .
the evening after the film 's release passed without incident , in contrast to the unrest that swept the country following the murder by an islamic militant in 2004 of film director theo van gogh , another dutch artist who was accused of offending islam .
however , iran and indonesia slammed the film .
iran called it film heinous , blasphemous and anti-islamic and called on european governments to block any further showing . indonesia , the world 's most populous muslim nation and a former dutch colony , also condemned the film .
" we are of the view that the film has a racist flavour and is an insult to islam , hidden under the cover of freedom of expression , " a foreign ministry spokesman said .
" we call on indonesian people not to be incited . "
prime minister balkenende praised the efforts of his government to defuse muslim anger in the months preceding the release of the film and welcomed the initial muslim response .
" the government is heartened by the initial restrained reactions of dutch muslim organizations , " he said .
" the dutch government stands for a society in which freedom and respect go hand in hand ...
let us solve problems by working together . "
dutch politicians distanced themselves from wilders and his film .
" the netherlands does not need wilders as a filmmaker , " said mark rutte , leader of the dutch liberal vvd party - of which wilders himself was a member until being thrown out in september 2004 .
" we need wilders as a legislator , to debate about the netherlands and to find solutions for serious problems , including the problems of integration and immigration . "
minister of integration ella vogelaar said the film could increase people 's fears of islamic radicalism .
" the first half of the film contained shocking material , " she said .
dutch muslims wait , international anger simmers muslim groups have appealed for calm and mosques plan to open their doors to the public on friday to defuse tension .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch muslims have recated with restraint to the film fouad sidali , a leading member of the muslim community in holland , called for moderate responses .
" we muslims in the netherlands are opposed to any forms of violence and aggression , " sidali said .
" we are dutch ; we love our country and abide by the constitution . "
moslems in other areas of the world , however , have not been as magnanimous .
before the film 's release , demonstrators had already taken to the streets from afghanistan to indonesia to burn dutch and danish flags , and the governments of pakistan and iran sharply criticized wilders ' project .
nato has expressed concern the film could worsen security for foreign forces in afghanistan , including 1,650 dutch troops .
despite wilders ' own assertion , one that has been supported by a number of dutch legislators , that he did not break any blasphemy laws with the film , a court in rotterdam will hear an injunction against him on friday brought by the dutch islamic federation .
cartoonist to issue writ from secure location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard 's cartoon continues to cause outrage wilders may also find himself embroiled in another court case brought against him by the cartoonist kurt westergaard , whose mohammed caricature , which opens and closes the film , sparked violent protests by muslims worldwide in 2006 .
" my cartoon has been misused again .
it has been pulled from its original context and set in a completely different one , " westergaard told danish broadcaster dr.
" it is a drawing aimed specifically against islamic terror that uses interpretations of the koran and islam as spiritual ammunition , " westergaard , who remains in hiding after death threats , said .
" wilders has not asked me for permission , so it is simply a case of violation of copyright rules , " westergaard said , adding he would contact legal experts friday . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some say that 's nothing more than a symbolic move to avoid a human rights confrontation with china . european union foreign ministers began talks on friday , march 28 , on whether the bloc would respond to china 's crackdown on pro-independence protesters in tibet with a boycott of the 2008 summer olympics opening ceremony . violence ensuing from street protests , which began on march 10 to mark the anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against chinese rule in tibet and turned into riots four days later , has left some 140 dead , according to tibetan leaders in exile .
chinese authorities put the figure at 20 . an easy way to make a statement a boycott of the opening ceremony - or even all the olympic events - is a sign that lets western governments make a symbolic statement without really risking much , said matthias chardon of munich 's center for applied policy research . " when considered as a symbol , a boycott is a clear , public sign , " he said .
" the power of these kinds of symbolic statements should n't be underestimated , but a boycott of the opening ceremony is a relatively easy statement to make . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups want an investigation into violence in lhasa the scope of violence in tibet , however , demands more than a symbolic statement , according to marianne heuwagen of human rights watch 's berlin office . " i think it 's inappropriate to only talk about an olympic boycott at this point , " she said .
" europe has to make clear that what 's happening is not acceptable . " she said the international community should call for an independent investigation of what has occurred in tibet and ask for journalists to be granted free access to the region . " europe needs to hold china to the agreements it made when it was awarded the olympics , " she said , adding that beijing had not kept promises regarding freedom of the press by kicking foreign journalists out of tibet during the demonstrations . serious consequences unlikely china , however , realizes its status as a world economic power will go a long way in protecting it from more serious consequences , according to karsten giese , a china expert at the german institute of global and area studies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is buying more and more from china " serious consequences that go beyond symbolic policies are unlikely - china 's role in the global economy and politics is too strong , " he said .
" nothing can get done without china when it comes to dealing with issues like north korea , the iranian nuclear program or global climate change . " china has replaced the us as the main source of eu imports and is becoming an increasingly popular destination for european products , according to eu statistics for 2006 , the most recent year for which records exist . in part , it 's an interest in maintaining positive trade relations that keeps the bloc from discussing measures beyond sitting out the olympic opening ceremony , chardon said . " every european country is also working hard to keep up good relations with china so business is n't disturbed , " he added .
" if they are serious about improving the situation then they should probably consider economic measures . " france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner admitted there were economic concerns that played a role in determining the eu 's response to violence in tibet . " we are constrained by a certain number of economic interests , " he told the daily newspaper liberation this week . international initiatives needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators took to the streets around the world in support of tibet protests one economic move came out of berlin on wednesday when germany said it would cancel aid talks scheduled for may unless violence in tibet stopped . " it is hard to imagine dialog taking place under the current conditions , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said in a statement . but such steps would be more effective if they were coordinated at an eu-level , chardon said : calls for change will carry more weight when made by not just 80 million germans but 497 million europeans . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , eu foreign ministers remain at odds over a unified stance on the coming event . the decision to stay away was not a boycott in protest to china 's crackdown on tibet or its wider human right record , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .
steinmeier said that neither the chancellor , interior and sports minister wolfgang schaeuble nor he had plans in place to attend even before the people 's republic 's recent crushing of pro-independence protestors in lhasa .
" as far as i know , schaeuble has not planned to take part in the opening ceremony ...
as for myself and the chancellor , i do n't think so either , " steinmeier told journalists ahead of an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in slovenia .
" in that sense , there has been nothing to cancel . "
" a ' no ' to the olympics in order to relieve our consciences would help neither the people in china nor the sports organizations ...
at the moment i am against the kind of boycott debate that is going on in some european member states , " he said .
" this is not the right moment to talk about a boycott of the olympics ...
we should watch how the chinese government deals with the situation in the next weeks and months , " steinmeier said .
but the subject of forming a joint eu position was unlikely to be debated at the foreign ministers ' meeting , steinmeier added .
" i ca n't imagine it , because i ca n't say who has already decided to take part , so there ca n't be agreement on canceling that attendance , " he said .
as sports minister , schaeuble is expected to travel to beijing as a traditional sign of support for the german athletes at a later date during the olympics .
german president horst koehler is expected to attend the beijing paralympics , which take place in september .
berlin says merkel never had any intention to attend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin says merkel 's decision has nothing to do with tibet in berlin , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said : " i can confirm that merkel never had any intention of being a guest at the olympics , either at the opening ceremony or at the sporting events . "
the eu foreign ministers , in slovenia for two days of talks , are under increasing public pressure to send a strong message to china over tibet but have so far been divided over boycotting the beijing olympics opening ceremony .
no one was seeking a full boycott of the summer games as they arrived for the talks at brdo pri kranju , near the slovenian capital ljubljana , but most eu nations have openly condemned the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet which left some 140 dead , according to tibetan leaders in exile .
the official eu line so far has been to call for restraint and urge china to open a dialogue on cultural rights with the dalai lama , whom beijing has accused of inciting the pro-independence riots .
more european leaders to stay away from opening ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer and fewer european leaders will be at the opening several leaders of eastern european states - czech president vaclav klaus , his estonian counterpart toomas hendrik ilves and polish prime minister donald tusk - have all said they will not be attending the games opening .
however british prime minister gordon brown said in london that britain , which will host the 2012 olympics , would definitely not be boycotting any part of the beijing games .
others were more cautious .
austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , arriving in brdo , said a ceremony boycott could be " a strong signal , " without committing to such a move .
she said on austrian radio it was " important not to limit the question of the respect of human rights in china and tibet exclusively to the question of a political presence at the opening ceremony of the olympic games . "
sarkozy 's presidency to confirm eu position french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country will assume the eu presidency from slovenia in july , promised thursday to consult with his european partners on a unified response and plan of action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said the eu would have a position under his presidency " at the time of the olympics , i will be in the presidency of the european union so i have to sound out and consult my fellow members to see whether or not we should boycott , " sarkozy said .
" according to how the situation is looking at the time , i reserve the right to say whether or not i will attend the opening ceremony . "
sarkozy reiterated that none of the 27 eu nations had so far called for a joint boycott . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's labor minister wants to do something about it . nora neye , 27 , is a member of germany 's so-called " internship generation , " although it 's not a club she particularly wanted to join .
she 's among the many young germans in their 20s and early 30s who have university degrees but have had little luck finding full-time work . instead , they have embarked on a series of internships , often unpaid , hoping that one of them might lead to a permanent job .
at the end of each , it 's common that graduates leave disappointed or embittered , and usually a lot poorer . " finishing your degree and then finding proper work seems more and more difficult , " she said .
" if you have n't done quite a number of internships , you 're not going to find a job . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internships have become the norm as new graduates outnumber jobs so neye , after getting bachelor 's and master 's degrees in the humanities , got on the internship train herself , doing two-month stints at publishing houses and media organizations .
some were helpful ; some were not .
none led to a job . but it was firms ' attitude that there was a nearly endless source of highly qualified labor they can use on the cheap that angered her most . " companies believe more and more they can do whatever and do n't have to pay for it , " she said . new guidelines germany 's labor minister olaf scholz wants to cut down on what he and other critics call intern exploitation .
he has called for new regulations that would require interns with university degrees be paid appropriately , that their duties and goals be outlined at the outset , and that they not be treated as cheap replacements for regular employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholz wants to instate a series of protections for interns " internships are useful , but there 's been some abuse and we have to do something about it , " he told reporters . scholz , a member of the center-left social democratic party , pointed to a study conducted by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health -lrb- baua -rrb- , which asked 2,000 young people between 18 and 34 about their intern experiences .
although all had university degrees , 51 percent were not paid for their internships , and another 12 percent thought they were paid too little . he said he did not want to do away with internships or put in place a minimum wage for them , rather he was only interested in seeing that interns were treated fairly , since they are a growing group . while 17 percent of 30 to 34-year-olds have experience as an intern , 25 percent of those between 18 and 24 have an internship behind them . " there 's a general culture of doing more and more internships and it 's very problematic , " said former intern neye .
" employers see you after you 've finished your degree these days and say ' why have you only done five internships and not 10 ? " ' new economic model ? internships in germany have traditionally been seen as a way to introduce young people to professional working life .
for university graduates , they have been thought of as bridges to permanent employment , especially since these interns are n't just making coffee and copies , they 're doing real work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work-pay balance with many interns is off " they have a solid education and the required knowledge and therefore generally are given significant tasks , " said rene rudolf of the youth arm of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- . but he and others say many companies have abandoned the principle of interns transitioning to full-time employees .
bettina könig , who heads an initiative that aims to improve internships called fair work , said when the german economy was sputtering in 2001 , jobs were scarce , firms were afraid to hire , and graduates gladly took internships , even for low or no pay , just to get experience and perhaps impress a higher-up . " and now even that the economy is better , this kind of bad model has established itself in many companies , " she said .
" i do n't see it changing without some kind of government intervention . " fair work runs a web site where interns can post their own experiences .
reports of 40 or 50-hour weeks with no pay and no time off yet fulfilling most or all the duties of a full-time staff person are not unusual . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nice facade , bad intern policy - german historical museum last year , the group 's annual prize of the worst internship of the year , money-grubber 2007 , went to the german historical museum in berlin . there , a history graduate worked 39-hour weeks for six months without insurance , vacation or sick leave .
she had to sign an agreement that all work that she did during the time was for the exclusive use of the museum . over or under-regulation but some politicians and employer groups are against any kind of new regulation being placed on business .
german education minister annette schavan of the center-right christian democratic party has warned against imposing more " bureaucratic rules " and has cast doubt on the validity of the baua study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say interns are considered low-wage , high-skilled labor the head of the bda employers ' association , gerhard braun , told the financial times deutschland that more regulation and the establishment of pay rules would cause companies to discontinue their internship programs . but for others , the suggested changes do n't go far enough . rudolf of the dgb trade union group wants to see a three-month time limit placed on internships , pay requirements , and a clear understanding of what an internship is .
it should be a learning relationship with a company , not a pure work relationship . if the firm wants that , they should go out and hire somebody , he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new book detailing east germany 's passion for nudity is set to be launched in typically candid style just weeks after a documentary exposed the communist regime 's secret porn industry . if selling a book with the recollections - and photographs - of nudist holidaymakers in east germany was n't enough to cause a stir , bookshop owner helmut maass intends to capitalize on the flesh angle of the new tome by promoting it with a reading to a naked audience .
the book , which celebrates east germany 's renowned " freikoerperkultur " -lsb- fkk -rsb- , draws on the era before the berlin wall came down in 1989 .
its publishers , berlin-based eulenspiegel , are enthusiastic about the publicity stunt .
" this is great advertising for our book , " a spokeswoman said .
the book 's author , thomas kupfermann , contacted devotees and asked them to send him their photographs and also secured a contribution from east german television reporter hans-joachim woller , who covered the fkk scene before 1989 .
the event , set to take place in the north-eastern town of pasewalk and hosted by the nude female model who adorns its cover , is scheduled for april 1 , but it 's no joke , maass said .
book event the latest in fkk revival the shop owner believes he is putting on a world first with his nudist book reading , which is sold out .
he has invited his audience to arrive clothed , as germany is experiencing a chilly spring , and assures them his shop is adequately heated .
he is also providing heavy drapes for the windows to keep passing voyeurs at bay .
east germany 's fkk movement is generally experiencing something of a revival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nudist resorts and interest in the lifestyle are on the up a travel agent in the eastern city of erfurt has laid on nudist charter flights this summer to usedom , a baltic island resort and home to a large nudist colony in the communist era .
enrico hess says tickets are selling rapidly for the first flight on july 5 .
he has had applications from as far afield as australia .
the fkk movement dates its origins to the founding of the first nudist society in berlin in 1906 .
while the movement faded in the western states , it flourished in the communist east , with bathing resorts established all along the baltic coast and at the inland lakes frequented by east german holidaymakers .
the fkk movement was just one of the communist country 's many contradictions regarding nudity .
despite the atmosphere of public prudery that prevailed in east germany before the fall of the berlin wall , the gdr was a hot-bed of nudism and naked bathing , both of which were permitted by the communist regime .
secret but sanctioned porn industry exposed while the regime banned western sex films and confiscated erotic films and magazines brought into the country by visitors , it has recently been revealed that the gdr 's armed forces had their own pornography department , which made movies for senior officers and the country 's outwardly prudish hard-line political elite .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the so-called " stasi porn " have looked like this ?
the former communist state 's secret porn industry has recently been the subject of a documentary shown on german television .
the show revealed that the gdr 's pornography department was operated by a 160-man film unit which used a secret circle of 12 amateur porn enthusiasts as its stars .
the documentary explained that the unit was set up in 1982 and managed to make a total of 12 erotic films before the collapse of communism in 1989 .
officially the films were all made in secret but eye-witness accounts claimed that they were produced under direction from senior officers and their premieres were attended by many of the state 's most high-ranking officials and politicians . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the procedure 's not punishable , the man still expects to be taken to court . presenting his machine to reporters on friday , march 28 , former hamburg justice minister roger kusch said that it would give terminally ill people in germany a chance to end their lives instead of forcing them to travel to switzerland , where assisted suicide is legal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kusch has made assisted suicide his mission " the machine is ready for use , " kusch said of the device that 's made up of a conventional intravenous drip feed .
it will be fitted with two syringes , one of which is filled with an anesthetic while the other one contains lethal potassium chloride . a doctor would place a needle in the patient 's vein , which is not punishable under german law .
the patient would then get a button placed in his or her hand and decide whether to push it or not , hence starting the deadly infusion . kusch said that the whole procedure would last around four minutes , the person would die much more quickly than that after losing consciousness within a few seconds .
he added that two doctors were ready to place the needle and issue a certificate ahead of the procedure , stating that the person was indeed terminally ill and still in charge of their mental capacities . harsh criticism germany 's medical community and church leaders quickly criticized kusch 's plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should germany offer more care to the terminally ill rather than a way for them to commit suicide ?
" we do n't need a killing machine , but instead terminal care and palliative medicine that relieves people of pain and fear at the end of their lives , " said frank ulrich montgomery , the vice president of the german medical association , according to german news service dpa . hamburg 's catholic auxiliary bishop , hans-jochen jaschke , also rejected kusch 's machine , calling it a " torture instrument " and a " macabre game with death , disguised by noble words of compassion and covered by questionable legal nit-picking , " according to catholic news service kna . jaschke added that the church was also aware that humans had a right to die . " you can not prolong life at any price and you have to help people to die humanely , " he said .
" but not by using this killing apparatus . " from minister to activist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beust is currently trying to form germany 's first coalition between conservatives and greens at state level kusch told reporters that he expected to face criminal proceedings despite not actually breaking any laws . kusch was hamburg 's justice minister for the german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union from 2001 to 2006 .
he left the government after a falling-out with his friend , hamburg mayor ole von beust , and founded a right-wing splinter party . during the city state 's february elections , he made assisted suicide one of his main campaign topics , but only received 0.5 percent of votes .

they currently only have the rights to construct the train cars , but purchasing additional rights from thyssenkrupp would mean they could produce complete transrapid systems and sell them elsewhere . however , it would also be necessary to obtain the control technology developed by siemens , as well as the engine know-how . chinese expert says deal unlikely a chinese transport export on friday however said that such a deal between beijing and thyssenkrupp was " unlikely . "
xie weida , deputy director of the railway institute at shanghai 's tongji university , said the core technology would be extremely expensive but conceded that buying it could benefit china . a planned extension of the shanghai transrapid line by world expo , which the city will host in 2010 , was recently postponed by mayor han zheng . according to the welt report , an eight- or nine-figure deal between beijing and thyssenkrupp could potentially spare the 220 jobs in germany that are threatened by the closure of the project . " i can not guarantee that we will not lose out to china , " said thomas schlenz , the head of thyssenkrupp 's works council .
" there is a danger that they can pick up this technology and run with it . "
he added that about 1,000 new jobs would have been created in germany had the transrapid plan been carried out . klaus-heiner roehl from the iw economic research institute , however , said that it will likely " be difficult to sell something abroad that was rejected at home . " the blame game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human error caused the 2006 accident six months ago , the heads of siemens , thyssenkrupp and hochtief construction group had said the plan to build the transrapid in munich would total 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- , but federal transport minister wolfgang tiefensee announced on thursday , march 27 , that costs had risen unexpectedly to nearly double , making the venture too pricy to continue with . the hope was that a successful transrapid in germany would provide the showcase necessary to market the high-speed technology to the rest of the world . news of the decision to scrap the flagship train link in munich developed by thyseenkrupp and siemens has triggered angry recriminations among politicians in the southern state of bavaria about who is to blame for the project 's abrupt demise . bavaria 's premier guenter beckstein of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- slammed the industrial consortium developing the technology for the failure of the munich train project , which his predecessor edmund stoiber had pushed through shortly before stepping down . " those who could n't keep their promises " are responsible for putting the project on ice , beckstein told the friday edition of the passauer neue presse .
he added that " no other routes will be built in germany .
the munich project was the last chance . " csu secretary general christine haderthauer joined the bavarian premier in placing blame on the project 's industrial partners . " apparently , industry did n't want a flagship project , but to make a profit , " she told berliner zeitung . opposition to train project the csu , bavarian sister-party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , had long been under fire for the controversial endeavor and critics had accused former bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who stepped down last year , of trying to make the transrapid his personal legacy . " bavaria 's conservative party led a propaganda campaign for the transrapid for years and splurged taxpayers ' money on it , " said franz maget , head of the social democratic party in bavaria . in november , some 13,000 people attended a demonstration against the project in munich , where the new high-speed train would have linked the airport with the city center .
public disapproval was fuelled by a transrapid accident that occurred due to human failure during a test run in 2006 ; 23 people were killed . german engineers started developing the magnetic levitation system in 1969 and millions of euros of federal and private money has been invested in research and development since then . using the magnetic levitation technology , the train floats on a magnetic cushion just above the rail , traveling up to three times faster than standard steel-wheel trains .
the project would have shaved travel time between the munich airport and the city center down to 10 minutes from 40 minutes . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's labor minister wants to do something about it . nora neye , 27 , is a member of germany 's so-called " internship generation , " although it 's not a club she particularly wanted to join .
she 's among the many young germans in their 20s and early 30s who have university degrees but have had little luck finding full-time work . instead , they have embarked on a series of internships , often unpaid , hoping that one of them might lead to a permanent job .
at the end of each , it 's common that graduates leave disappointed or embittered , and usually a lot poorer . " finishing your degree and then finding proper work seems more and more difficult , " she said .
" if you have n't done quite a number of internships , you 're not going to find a job . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internships have become the norm as new graduates outnumber jobs so neye , after getting bachelor 's and master 's degrees in the humanities , got on the internship train herself , doing two-month stints at publishing houses and media organizations .
some were helpful ; some were not .
none led to a job . but it was firms ' attitude that there was a nearly endless source of highly qualified labor they can use on the cheap that angered her most . " companies believe more and more they can do whatever and do n't have to pay for it , " she said . new guidelines germany 's labor minister olaf scholz wants to cut down on what he and other critics call intern exploitation .
he has called for new regulations that would require interns with university degrees be paid appropriately , that their duties and goals be outlined at the outset , and that they not be treated as cheap replacements for regular employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholz wants to instate a series of protections for interns " internships are useful , but there 's been some abuse and we have to do something about it , " he told reporters . scholz , a member of the center-left social democratic party , pointed to a study conducted by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health -lrb- baua -rrb- , which asked 2,000 young people between 18 and 34 about their intern experiences .
although all had university degrees , 51 percent were not paid for their internships , and another 12 percent thought they were paid too little . he said he did not want to do away with internships or put in place a minimum wage for them , rather he was only interested in seeing that interns were treated fairly , since they are a growing group . while 17 percent of 30 to 34-year-olds have experience as an intern , 25 percent of those between 18 and 24 have an internship behind them . " there 's a general culture of doing more and more internships and it 's very problematic , " said former intern neye .
" employers see you after you 've finished your degree these days and say ' why have you only done five internships and not 10 ? " ' new economic model ? internships in germany have traditionally been seen as a way to introduce young people to professional working life .
for university graduates , they have been thought of as bridges to permanent employment , especially since these interns are n't just making coffee and copies , they 're doing real work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work-pay balance with many interns is off " they have a solid education and the required knowledge and therefore generally are given significant tasks , " said rene rudolf of the youth arm of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- . but he and others say many companies have abandoned the principle of interns transitioning to full-time employees .
bettina könig , who heads an initiative that aims to improve internships called fair work , said when the german economy was sputtering in 2001 , jobs were scarce , firms were afraid to hire , and graduates gladly took internships , even for low or no pay , just to get experience and perhaps impress a higher-up . " and now even that the economy is better , this kind of bad model has established itself in many companies , " she said .
" i do n't see it changing without some kind of government intervention . " fair work runs a web site where interns can post their own experiences .
reports of 40 or 50-hour weeks with no pay and no time off yet fulfilling most or all the duties of a full-time staff person are not unusual . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nice facade , bad intern policy - german historical museum last year , the group 's annual prize of the worst internship of the year , money-grubber 2007 , went to the german historical museum in berlin . there , a history graduate worked 39-hour weeks for six months without insurance , vacation or sick leave .
she had to sign an agreement that all work that she did during the time was for the exclusive use of the museum . over or under-regulation but some politicians and employer groups are against any kind of new regulation being placed on business .
german education minister annette schavan of the center-right christian democratic party has warned against imposing more " bureaucratic rules " and has cast doubt on the validity of the baua study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say interns are considered low-wage , high-skilled labor the head of the bda employers ' association , gerhard braun , told the financial times deutschland that more regulation and the establishment of pay rules would cause companies to discontinue their internship programs . but for others , the suggested changes do n't go far enough . rudolf of the dgb trade union group wants to see a three-month time limit placed on internships , pay requirements , and a clear understanding of what an internship is .
it should be a learning relationship with a company , not a pure work relationship . if the firm wants that , they should go out and hire somebody , he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de islamic world -pipe- 28.03.2008 dutch muslims react with restraint to mp 's controversial film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right mp geert wilders claims his film is not an attack on muslims but on radicalism muslims in the netherlands have reacted calmly to the internet release of a controversial film critical of islam by dutch far-right mp geert wilders , but elsewhere passions run high . the wilders film , titled " fitna " -lsb- strife -rsb- , made its debut via british video-sharing website liveleak and soon spread to the globally popular youtube site where it quickly generated heated debate among viewers and much divided opinion .
the 17-minute film , which wilders claims is not intended as an attack on muslims but on radical islam , features violent imagery of the terrorist attacks in new york and madrid intertwined with koranic texts .
the film opens and ends with a cartoon of the prophet mohammad with a bomb under his turban , originally published in danish newspapers , accompanied by the sound of ticking .
images of hijacked airplanes flying into the world trade centre in new york on september 11 , 2001 , soon follow with sound bites from phone calls to the emergency services on that day .
the film then continues with grizzly images of bloodstained bodies in the aftermath of the madrid train bombings in march 2004 in which 191 people were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excerpts from the koran are shown with images from 9/11 it intersperses these with images of a koran and the text of a sura from islam 's holiest tome , which translated from arabic implores the faithful to " terrorize the enemies of allah . "
the film carries no commentary and relies purely on the pictures of the terrorist attacks , as well as a beheading and a vision of a future holland where homosexuals and alternative thinkers are tortured , to carry wilders ' perceived vision of " reality . "
" i am a politician , " wilders said recently .
" i think that islam and the koran present a danger for our country and i want to warn against it .
i think i have made a good film within the boundaries of the law .
if something should now happen , then it is solely the responsibility of those people who use violence . "
dutch government distances itself from wilders the dutch government , fearful of reprisals similar to those which followed the reproduction across europe of the cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed , pressured wilders not to release the movie but to little effect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende rejected wilders ' interpretation of islam " this film equates islam with violence and we reject this interpretation , " said prime minister jan peter balkenende .
" the vast majority of muslims reject extremism and violence .
in fact the victims are often also muslims " initial reactions from the muslim community in the netherlands were restrained .
the evening after the film 's release passed without incident , in contrast to the unrest that swept the country following the murder by an islamic militant in 2004 of film director theo van gogh , another dutch artist who was accused of offending islam .
however , iran and indonesia slammed the film .
iran called it film heinous , blasphemous and anti-islamic and called on european governments to block any further showing . indonesia , the world 's most populous muslim nation and a former dutch colony , also condemned the film .
" we are of the view that the film has a racist flavour and is an insult to islam , hidden under the cover of freedom of expression , " a foreign ministry spokesman said .
" we call on indonesian people not to be incited . "
prime minister balkenende praised the efforts of his government to defuse muslim anger in the months preceding the release of the film and welcomed the initial muslim response .
" the government is heartened by the initial restrained reactions of dutch muslim organizations , " he said .

the 17-minute film , which wilders claims is not intended as an attack on muslims but on radical islam , features violent imagery of the terrorist attacks in new york and madrid intertwined with koranic texts .
the film opens and ends with a cartoon of the prophet mohammad with a bomb under his turban , originally published in danish newspapers , accompanied by the sound of ticking .
images of hijacked airplanes flying into the world trade centre in new york on september 11 , 2001 , soon follow with sound bites from phone calls to the emergency services on that day .
the film then continues with grizzly images of bloodstained bodies in the aftermath of the madrid train bombings in march 2004 in which 191 people were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excerpts from the koran are shown with images from 9/11 it intersperses these with images of a koran and the text of a sura from islam 's holiest tome , which translated from arabic implores the faithful to " terrorize the enemies of allah . "
the film carries no commentary and relies purely on the pictures of the terrorist attacks , as well as a beheading and a vision of a future holland where homosexuals and alternative thinkers are tortured , to carry wilders ' perceived vision of " reality . "
" i am a politician , " wilders said recently .
" i think that islam and the koran present a danger for our country and i want to warn against it .
i think i have made a good film within the boundaries of the law .
if something should now happen , then it is solely the responsibility of those people who use violence . "
dutch government distances itself from wilders the dutch government , fearful of reprisals similar to those which followed the reproduction across europe of the cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed , pressured wilders not to release the movie but to little effect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende rejected wilders ' interpretation of islam " this film equates islam with violence and we reject this interpretation , " said prime minister jan peter balkenende .
" the vast majority of muslims reject extremism and violence .
in fact the victims are often also muslims " initial reactions from the muslim community in the netherlands were restrained .
the evening after the film 's release passed without incident , in contrast to the unrest that swept the country following the murder by an islamic militant in 2004 of film director theo van gogh , another dutch artist who was accused of offending islam .
however , iran and indonesia slammed the film .
iran called it film heinous , blasphemous and anti-islamic and called on european governments to block any further showing . indonesia , the world 's most populous muslim nation and a former dutch colony , also condemned the film .
" we are of the view that the film has a racist flavour and is an insult to islam , hidden under the cover of freedom of expression , " a foreign ministry spokesman said .
" we call on indonesian people not to be incited . "
prime minister balkenende praised the efforts of his government to defuse muslim anger in the months preceding the release of the film and welcomed the initial muslim response .

germany 's labor minister wants to do something about it . nora neye , 27 , is a member of germany 's so-called " internship generation , " although it 's not a club she particularly wanted to join .
she 's among the many young germans in their 20s and early 30s who have university degrees but have had little luck finding full-time work . instead , they have embarked on a series of internships , often unpaid , hoping that one of them might lead to a permanent job .
at the end of each , it 's common that graduates leave disappointed or embittered , and usually a lot poorer . " finishing your degree and then finding proper work seems more and more difficult , " she said .
" if you have n't done quite a number of internships , you 're not going to find a job . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internships have become the norm as new graduates outnumber jobs so neye , after getting bachelor 's and master 's degrees in the humanities , got on the internship train herself , doing two-month stints at publishing houses and media organizations .
some were helpful ; some were not .
none led to a job . but it was firms ' attitude that there was a nearly endless source of highly qualified labor they can use on the cheap that angered her most . " companies believe more and more they can do whatever and do n't have to pay for it , " she said . new guidelines germany 's labor minister olaf scholz wants to cut down on what he and other critics call intern exploitation .
he has called for new regulations that would require interns with university degrees be paid appropriately , that their duties and goals be outlined at the outset , and that they not be treated as cheap replacements for regular employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholz wants to instate a series of protections for interns " internships are useful , but there 's been some abuse and we have to do something about it , " he told reporters . scholz , a member of the center-left social democratic party , pointed to a study conducted by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health -lrb- baua -rrb- , which asked 2,000 young people between 18 and 34 about their intern experiences .
although all had university degrees , 51 percent were not paid for their internships , and another 12 percent thought they were paid too little . he said he did not want to do away with internships or put in place a minimum wage for them , rather he was only interested in seeing that interns were treated fairly , since they are a growing group . while 17 percent of 30 to 34-year-olds have experience as an intern , 25 percent of those between 18 and 24 have an internship behind them . " there 's a general culture of doing more and more internships and it 's very problematic , " said former intern neye .
" employers see you after you 've finished your degree these days and say ' why have you only done five internships and not 10 ? " ' new economic model ? internships in germany have traditionally been seen as a way to introduce young people to professional working life .
for university graduates , they have been thought of as bridges to permanent employment , especially since these interns are n't just making coffee and copies , they 're doing real work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work-pay balance with many interns is off " they have a solid education and the required knowledge and therefore generally are given significant tasks , " said rene rudolf of the youth arm of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- . but he and others say many companies have abandoned the principle of interns transitioning to full-time employees .
bettina könig , who heads an initiative that aims to improve internships called fair work , said when the german economy was sputtering in 2001 , jobs were scarce , firms were afraid to hire , and graduates gladly took internships , even for low or no pay , just to get experience and perhaps impress a higher-up . " and now even that the economy is better , this kind of bad model has established itself in many companies , " she said .
" i do n't see it changing without some kind of government intervention . " fair work runs a web site where interns can post their own experiences .
reports of 40 or 50-hour weeks with no pay and no time off yet fulfilling most or all the duties of a full-time staff person are not unusual . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nice facade , bad intern policy - german historical museum last year , the group 's annual prize of the worst internship of the year , money-grubber 2007 , went to the german historical museum in berlin . there , a history graduate worked 39-hour weeks for six months without insurance , vacation or sick leave .
she had to sign an agreement that all work that she did during the time was for the exclusive use of the museum . over or under-regulation but some politicians and employer groups are against any kind of new regulation being placed on business .
german education minister annette schavan of the center-right christian democratic party has warned against imposing more " bureaucratic rules " and has cast doubt on the validity of the baua study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say interns are considered low-wage , high-skilled labor the head of the bda employers ' association , gerhard braun , told the financial times deutschland that more regulation and the establishment of pay rules would cause companies to discontinue their internship programs . but for others , the suggested changes do n't go far enough . rudolf of the dgb trade union group wants to see a three-month time limit placed on internships , pay requirements , and a clear understanding of what an internship is .
it should be a learning relationship with a company , not a pure work relationship . if the firm wants that , they should go out and hire somebody , he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they currently only have the rights to construct the train cars , but purchasing additional rights from thyssenkrupp would mean they could produce complete transrapid systems and sell them elsewhere . however , it would also be necessary to obtain the control technology developed by siemens , as well as the engine know-how . chinese expert says deal unlikely a chinese transport export on friday however said that such a deal between beijing and thyssenkrupp was " unlikely . "
xie weida , deputy director of the railway institute at shanghai 's tongji university , said the core technology would be extremely expensive but conceded that buying it could benefit china . a planned extension of the shanghai transrapid line by world expo , which the city will host in 2010 , was recently postponed by mayor han zheng . according to the welt report , an eight- or nine-figure deal between beijing and thyssenkrupp could potentially spare the 220 jobs in germany that are threatened by the closure of the project . " i can not guarantee that we will not lose out to china , " said thomas schlenz , the head of thyssenkrupp 's works council .
" there is a danger that they can pick up this technology and run with it . "
he added that about 1,000 new jobs would have been created in germany had the transrapid plan been carried out . klaus-heiner roehl from the iw economic research institute , however , said that it will likely " be difficult to sell something abroad that was rejected at home . " the blame game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human error caused the 2006 accident six months ago , the heads of siemens , thyssenkrupp and hochtief construction group had said the plan to build the transrapid in munich would total 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- , but federal transport minister wolfgang tiefensee announced on thursday , march 27 , that costs had risen unexpectedly to nearly double , making the venture too pricy to continue with . the hope was that a successful transrapid in germany would provide the showcase necessary to market the high-speed technology to the rest of the world . news of the decision to scrap the flagship train link in munich developed by thyseenkrupp and siemens has triggered angry recriminations among politicians in the southern state of bavaria about who is to blame for the project 's abrupt demise . bavaria 's premier guenter beckstein of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- slammed the industrial consortium developing the technology for the failure of the munich train project , which his predecessor edmund stoiber had pushed through shortly before stepping down . " those who could n't keep their promises " are responsible for putting the project on ice , beckstein told the friday edition of the passauer neue presse .
he added that " no other routes will be built in germany .
the munich project was the last chance . " csu secretary general christine haderthauer joined the bavarian premier in placing blame on the project 's industrial partners . " apparently , industry did n't want a flagship project , but to make a profit , " she told berliner zeitung . opposition to train project the csu , bavarian sister-party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , had long been under fire for the controversial endeavor and critics had accused former bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who stepped down last year , of trying to make the transrapid his personal legacy . " bavaria 's conservative party led a propaganda campaign for the transrapid for years and splurged taxpayers ' money on it , " said franz maget , head of the social democratic party in bavaria . in november , some 13,000 people attended a demonstration against the project in munich , where the new high-speed train would have linked the airport with the city center .
public disapproval was fuelled by a transrapid accident that occurred due to human failure during a test run in 2006 ; 23 people were killed . german engineers started developing the magnetic levitation system in 1969 and millions of euros of federal and private money has been invested in research and development since then . using the magnetic levitation technology , the train floats on a magnetic cushion just above the rail , traveling up to three times faster than standard steel-wheel trains .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de islamic world -pipe- 28.03.2008 dutch muslims react with restraint to mp 's controversial film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right mp geert wilders claims his film is not an attack on muslims but on radicalism muslims in the netherlands have reacted calmly to the internet release of a controversial film critical of islam by dutch far-right mp geert wilders , but elsewhere passions run high . the wilders film , titled " fitna " -lsb- strife -rsb- , made its debut via british video-sharing website liveleak and soon spread to the globally popular youtube site where it quickly generated heated debate among viewers and much divided opinion .
the 17-minute film , which wilders claims is not intended as an attack on muslims but on radical islam , features violent imagery of the terrorist attacks in new york and madrid intertwined with koranic texts .
the film opens and ends with a cartoon of the prophet mohammad with a bomb under his turban , originally published in danish newspapers , accompanied by the sound of ticking .
images of hijacked airplanes flying into the world trade centre in new york on september 11 , 2001 , soon follow with sound bites from phone calls to the emergency services on that day .
the film then continues with grizzly images of bloodstained bodies in the aftermath of the madrid train bombings in march 2004 in which 191 people were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excerpts from the koran are shown with images from 9/11 it intersperses these with images of a koran and the text of a sura from islam 's holiest tome , which translated from arabic implores the faithful to " terrorize the enemies of allah . "
the film carries no commentary and relies purely on the pictures of the terrorist attacks , as well as a beheading and a vision of a future holland where homosexuals and alternative thinkers are tortured , to carry wilders ' perceived vision of " reality . "
" i am a politician , " wilders said recently .
" i think that islam and the koran present a danger for our country and i want to warn against it .
i think i have made a good film within the boundaries of the law .
if something should now happen , then it is solely the responsibility of those people who use violence . "
dutch government distances itself from wilders the dutch government , fearful of reprisals similar to those which followed the reproduction across europe of the cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed , pressured wilders not to release the movie but to little effect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende rejected wilders ' interpretation of islam " this film equates islam with violence and we reject this interpretation , " said prime minister jan peter balkenende .
" the vast majority of muslims reject extremism and violence .
in fact the victims are often also muslims " initial reactions from the muslim community in the netherlands were restrained .
the evening after the film 's release passed without incident , in contrast to the unrest that swept the country following the murder by an islamic militant in 2004 of film director theo van gogh , another dutch artist who was accused of offending islam .
however , iran and indonesia slammed the film .
iran called it film heinous , blasphemous and anti-islamic and called on european governments to block any further showing . indonesia , the world 's most populous muslim nation and a former dutch colony , also condemned the film .
" we are of the view that the film has a racist flavour and is an insult to islam , hidden under the cover of freedom of expression , " a foreign ministry spokesman said .
" we call on indonesian people not to be incited . "
prime minister balkenende praised the efforts of his government to defuse muslim anger in the months preceding the release of the film and welcomed the initial muslim response .
" the government is heartened by the initial restrained reactions of dutch muslim organizations , " he said .
" the dutch government stands for a society in which freedom and respect go hand in hand ...
let us solve problems by working together . "
dutch politicians distanced themselves from wilders and his film .
" the netherlands does not need wilders as a filmmaker , " said mark rutte , leader of the dutch liberal vvd party - of which wilders himself was a member until being thrown out in september 2004 .
" we need wilders as a legislator , to debate about the netherlands and to find solutions for serious problems , including the problems of integration and immigration . "
minister of integration ella vogelaar said the film could increase people 's fears of islamic radicalism .
" the first half of the film contained shocking material , " she said .
dutch muslims wait , international anger simmers muslim groups have appealed for calm and mosques plan to open their doors to the public on friday to defuse tension .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch muslims have recated with restraint to the film fouad sidali , a leading member of the muslim community in holland , called for moderate responses .
" we muslims in the netherlands are opposed to any forms of violence and aggression , " sidali said .
" we are dutch ; we love our country and abide by the constitution . "
moslems in other areas of the world , however , have not been as magnanimous .
before the film 's release , demonstrators had already taken to the streets from afghanistan to indonesia to burn dutch and danish flags , and the governments of pakistan and iran sharply criticized wilders ' project .
nato has expressed concern the film could worsen security for foreign forces in afghanistan , including 1,650 dutch troops .
despite wilders ' own assertion , one that has been supported by a number of dutch legislators , that he did not break any blasphemy laws with the film , a court in rotterdam will hear an injunction against him on friday brought by the dutch islamic federation .
cartoonist to issue writ from secure location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard 's cartoon continues to cause outrage wilders may also find himself embroiled in another court case brought against him by the cartoonist kurt westergaard , whose mohammed caricature , which opens and closes the film , sparked violent protests by muslims worldwide in 2006 .
" my cartoon has been misused again .
it has been pulled from its original context and set in a completely different one , " westergaard told danish broadcaster dr.
" it is a drawing aimed specifically against islamic terror that uses interpretations of the koran and islam as spiritual ammunition , " westergaard , who remains in hiding after death threats , said .
" wilders has not asked me for permission , so it is simply a case of violation of copyright rules , " westergaard said , adding he would contact legal experts friday . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de islamic world -pipe- 28.03.2008 dutch muslims react with restraint to mp 's controversial film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right mp geert wilders claims his film is not an attack on muslims but on radicalism muslims in the netherlands have reacted calmly to the internet release of a controversial film critical of islam by dutch far-right mp geert wilders , but elsewhere passions run high . the wilders film , titled " fitna " -lsb- strife -rsb- , made its debut via british video-sharing website liveleak and soon spread to the globally popular youtube site where it quickly generated heated debate among viewers and much divided opinion .
the 17-minute film , which wilders claims is not intended as an attack on muslims but on radical islam , features violent imagery of the terrorist attacks in new york and madrid intertwined with koranic texts .
the film opens and ends with a cartoon of the prophet mohammad with a bomb under his turban , originally published in danish newspapers , accompanied by the sound of ticking .
images of hijacked airplanes flying into the world trade centre in new york on september 11 , 2001 , soon follow with sound bites from phone calls to the emergency services on that day .
the film then continues with grizzly images of bloodstained bodies in the aftermath of the madrid train bombings in march 2004 in which 191 people were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excerpts from the koran are shown with images from 9/11 it intersperses these with images of a koran and the text of a sura from islam 's holiest tome , which translated from arabic implores the faithful to " terrorize the enemies of allah . "
the film carries no commentary and relies purely on the pictures of the terrorist attacks , as well as a beheading and a vision of a future holland where homosexuals and alternative thinkers are tortured , to carry wilders ' perceived vision of " reality . "
" i am a politician , " wilders said recently .
" i think that islam and the koran present a danger for our country and i want to warn against it .
i think i have made a good film within the boundaries of the law .
if something should now happen , then it is solely the responsibility of those people who use violence . "
dutch government distances itself from wilders the dutch government , fearful of reprisals similar to those which followed the reproduction across europe of the cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed , pressured wilders not to release the movie but to little effect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende rejected wilders ' interpretation of islam " this film equates islam with violence and we reject this interpretation , " said prime minister jan peter balkenende .
" the vast majority of muslims reject extremism and violence .
in fact the victims are often also muslims " initial reactions from the muslim community in the netherlands were restrained .
the evening after the film 's release passed without incident , in contrast to the unrest that swept the country following the murder by an islamic militant in 2004 of film director theo van gogh , another dutch artist who was accused of offending islam .
however , iran and indonesia slammed the film .
iran called it film heinous , blasphemous and anti-islamic and called on european governments to block any further showing . indonesia , the world 's most populous muslim nation and a former dutch colony , also condemned the film .
" we are of the view that the film has a racist flavour and is an insult to islam , hidden under the cover of freedom of expression , " a foreign ministry spokesman said .
" we call on indonesian people not to be incited . "
prime minister balkenende praised the efforts of his government to defuse muslim anger in the months preceding the release of the film and welcomed the initial muslim response .
" the government is heartened by the initial restrained reactions of dutch muslim organizations , " he said .
" the dutch government stands for a society in which freedom and respect go hand in hand ...
let us solve problems by working together . "
dutch politicians distanced themselves from wilders and his film .
" the netherlands does not need wilders as a filmmaker , " said mark rutte , leader of the dutch liberal vvd party - of which wilders himself was a member until being thrown out in september 2004 .
" we need wilders as a legislator , to debate about the netherlands and to find solutions for serious problems , including the problems of integration and immigration . "
minister of integration ella vogelaar said the film could increase people 's fears of islamic radicalism .
" the first half of the film contained shocking material , " she said .
dutch muslims wait , international anger simmers muslim groups have appealed for calm and mosques plan to open their doors to the public on friday to defuse tension .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch muslims have recated with restraint to the film fouad sidali , a leading member of the muslim community in holland , called for moderate responses .
" we muslims in the netherlands are opposed to any forms of violence and aggression , " sidali said .
" we are dutch ; we love our country and abide by the constitution . "
moslems in other areas of the world , however , have not been as magnanimous .
before the film 's release , demonstrators had already taken to the streets from afghanistan to indonesia to burn dutch and danish flags , and the governments of pakistan and iran sharply criticized wilders ' project .
nato has expressed concern the film could worsen security for foreign forces in afghanistan , including 1,650 dutch troops .
despite wilders ' own assertion , one that has been supported by a number of dutch legislators , that he did not break any blasphemy laws with the film , a court in rotterdam will hear an injunction against him on friday brought by the dutch islamic federation .
cartoonist to issue writ from secure location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard 's cartoon continues to cause outrage wilders may also find himself embroiled in another court case brought against him by the cartoonist kurt westergaard , whose mohammed caricature , which opens and closes the film , sparked violent protests by muslims worldwide in 2006 .
" my cartoon has been misused again .
it has been pulled from its original context and set in a completely different one , " westergaard told danish broadcaster dr.
" it is a drawing aimed specifically against islamic terror that uses interpretations of the koran and islam as spiritual ammunition , " westergaard , who remains in hiding after death threats , said .
" wilders has not asked me for permission , so it is simply a case of violation of copyright rules , " westergaard said , adding he would contact legal experts friday . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they currently only have the rights to construct the train cars , but purchasing additional rights from thyssenkrupp would mean they could produce complete transrapid systems and sell them elsewhere . however , it would also be necessary to obtain the control technology developed by siemens , as well as the engine know-how . chinese expert says deal unlikely a chinese transport export on friday however said that such a deal between beijing and thyssenkrupp was " unlikely . "
xie weida , deputy director of the railway institute at shanghai 's tongji university , said the core technology would be extremely expensive but conceded that buying it could benefit china . a planned extension of the shanghai transrapid line by world expo , which the city will host in 2010 , was recently postponed by mayor han zheng . according to the welt report , an eight- or nine-figure deal between beijing and thyssenkrupp could potentially spare the 220 jobs in germany that are threatened by the closure of the project . " i can not guarantee that we will not lose out to china , " said thomas schlenz , the head of thyssenkrupp 's works council .
" there is a danger that they can pick up this technology and run with it . "
he added that about 1,000 new jobs would have been created in germany had the transrapid plan been carried out . klaus-heiner roehl from the iw economic research institute , however , said that it will likely " be difficult to sell something abroad that was rejected at home . " the blame game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human error caused the 2006 accident six months ago , the heads of siemens , thyssenkrupp and hochtief construction group had said the plan to build the transrapid in munich would total 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- , but federal transport minister wolfgang tiefensee announced on thursday , march 27 , that costs had risen unexpectedly to nearly double , making the venture too pricy to continue with . the hope was that a successful transrapid in germany would provide the showcase necessary to market the high-speed technology to the rest of the world . news of the decision to scrap the flagship train link in munich developed by thyseenkrupp and siemens has triggered angry recriminations among politicians in the southern state of bavaria about who is to blame for the project 's abrupt demise . bavaria 's premier guenter beckstein of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- slammed the industrial consortium developing the technology for the failure of the munich train project , which his predecessor edmund stoiber had pushed through shortly before stepping down . " those who could n't keep their promises " are responsible for putting the project on ice , beckstein told the friday edition of the passauer neue presse .
he added that " no other routes will be built in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 28.03.2008 real work for no money : a growing reality for young germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interns often do the work of full-time staff new debate has broken out about german companies using interns who are poorly paid , if they 're paid at all , to do work that once was done by full-time staff .
germany 's labor minister wants to do something about it . nora neye , 27 , is a member of germany 's so-called " internship generation , " although it 's not a club she particularly wanted to join .
she 's among the many young germans in their 20s and early 30s who have university degrees but have had little luck finding full-time work . instead , they have embarked on a series of internships , often unpaid , hoping that one of them might lead to a permanent job .
at the end of each , it 's common that graduates leave disappointed or embittered , and usually a lot poorer . " finishing your degree and then finding proper work seems more and more difficult , " she said .
" if you have n't done quite a number of internships , you 're not going to find a job . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internships have become the norm as new graduates outnumber jobs so neye , after getting bachelor 's and master 's degrees in the humanities , got on the internship train herself , doing two-month stints at publishing houses and media organizations .
some were helpful ; some were not .
none led to a job . but it was firms ' attitude that there was a nearly endless source of highly qualified labor they can use on the cheap that angered her most . " companies believe more and more they can do whatever and do n't have to pay for it , " she said . new guidelines germany 's labor minister olaf scholz wants to cut down on what he and other critics call intern exploitation .
he has called for new regulations that would require interns with university degrees be paid appropriately , that their duties and goals be outlined at the outset , and that they not be treated as cheap replacements for regular employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholz wants to instate a series of protections for interns " internships are useful , but there 's been some abuse and we have to do something about it , " he told reporters . scholz , a member of the center-left social democratic party , pointed to a study conducted by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health -lrb- baua -rrb- , which asked 2,000 young people between 18 and 34 about their intern experiences .
although all had university degrees , 51 percent were not paid for their internships , and another 12 percent thought they were paid too little . he said he did not want to do away with internships or put in place a minimum wage for them , rather he was only interested in seeing that interns were treated fairly , since they are a growing group . while 17 percent of 30 to 34-year-olds have experience as an intern , 25 percent of those between 18 and 24 have an internship behind them . " there 's a general culture of doing more and more internships and it 's very problematic , " said former intern neye .
" employers see you after you 've finished your degree these days and say ' why have you only done five internships and not 10 ? " ' new economic model ? internships in germany have traditionally been seen as a way to introduce young people to professional working life .
for university graduates , they have been thought of as bridges to permanent employment , especially since these interns are n't just making coffee and copies , they 're doing real work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work-pay balance with many interns is off " they have a solid education and the required knowledge and therefore generally are given significant tasks , " said rene rudolf of the youth arm of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- . but he and others say many companies have abandoned the principle of interns transitioning to full-time employees .
bettina könig , who heads an initiative that aims to improve internships called fair work , said when the german economy was sputtering in 2001 , jobs were scarce , firms were afraid to hire , and graduates gladly took internships , even for low or no pay , just to get experience and perhaps impress a higher-up . " and now even that the economy is better , this kind of bad model has established itself in many companies , " she said .
" i do n't see it changing without some kind of government intervention . " fair work runs a web site where interns can post their own experiences .
reports of 40 or 50-hour weeks with no pay and no time off yet fulfilling most or all the duties of a full-time staff person are not unusual . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nice facade , bad intern policy - german historical museum last year , the group 's annual prize of the worst internship of the year , money-grubber 2007 , went to the german historical museum in berlin . there , a history graduate worked 39-hour weeks for six months without insurance , vacation or sick leave .
she had to sign an agreement that all work that she did during the time was for the exclusive use of the museum . over or under-regulation but some politicians and employer groups are against any kind of new regulation being placed on business .
german education minister annette schavan of the center-right christian democratic party has warned against imposing more " bureaucratic rules " and has cast doubt on the validity of the baua study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say interns are considered low-wage , high-skilled labor the head of the bda employers ' association , gerhard braun , told the financial times deutschland that more regulation and the establishment of pay rules would cause companies to discontinue their internship programs . but for others , the suggested changes do n't go far enough . rudolf of the dgb trade union group wants to see a three-month time limit placed on internships , pay requirements , and a clear understanding of what an internship is .
it should be a learning relationship with a company , not a pure work relationship . if the firm wants that , they should go out and hire somebody , he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de islamic world -pipe- 28.03.2008 dutch muslims react with restraint to mp 's controversial film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right mp geert wilders claims his film is not an attack on muslims but on radicalism muslims in the netherlands have reacted calmly to the internet release of a controversial film critical of islam by dutch far-right mp geert wilders , but elsewhere passions run high . the wilders film , titled " fitna " -lsb- strife -rsb- , made its debut via british video-sharing website liveleak and soon spread to the globally popular youtube site where it quickly generated heated debate among viewers and much divided opinion .
the 17-minute film , which wilders claims is not intended as an attack on muslims but on radical islam , features violent imagery of the terrorist attacks in new york and madrid intertwined with koranic texts .
the film opens and ends with a cartoon of the prophet mohammad with a bomb under his turban , originally published in danish newspapers , accompanied by the sound of ticking .
images of hijacked airplanes flying into the world trade centre in new york on september 11 , 2001 , soon follow with sound bites from phone calls to the emergency services on that day .
the film then continues with grizzly images of bloodstained bodies in the aftermath of the madrid train bombings in march 2004 in which 191 people were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excerpts from the koran are shown with images from 9/11 it intersperses these with images of a koran and the text of a sura from islam 's holiest tome , which translated from arabic implores the faithful to " terrorize the enemies of allah . "
the film carries no commentary and relies purely on the pictures of the terrorist attacks , as well as a beheading and a vision of a future holland where homosexuals and alternative thinkers are tortured , to carry wilders ' perceived vision of " reality . "
" i am a politician , " wilders said recently .
" i think that islam and the koran present a danger for our country and i want to warn against it .
i think i have made a good film within the boundaries of the law .
if something should now happen , then it is solely the responsibility of those people who use violence . "
dutch government distances itself from wilders the dutch government , fearful of reprisals similar to those which followed the reproduction across europe of the cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed , pressured wilders not to release the movie but to little effect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende rejected wilders ' interpretation of islam " this film equates islam with violence and we reject this interpretation , " said prime minister jan peter balkenende .
" the vast majority of muslims reject extremism and violence .
in fact the victims are often also muslims " initial reactions from the muslim community in the netherlands were restrained .
the evening after the film 's release passed without incident , in contrast to the unrest that swept the country following the murder by an islamic militant in 2004 of film director theo van gogh , another dutch artist who was accused of offending islam .
however , iran and indonesia slammed the film .
iran called it film heinous , blasphemous and anti-islamic and called on european governments to block any further showing . indonesia , the world 's most populous muslim nation and a former dutch colony , also condemned the film .
" we are of the view that the film has a racist flavour and is an insult to islam , hidden under the cover of freedom of expression , " a foreign ministry spokesman said .
" we call on indonesian people not to be incited . "
prime minister balkenende praised the efforts of his government to defuse muslim anger in the months preceding the release of the film and welcomed the initial muslim response .
" the government is heartened by the initial restrained reactions of dutch muslim organizations , " he said .
" the dutch government stands for a society in which freedom and respect go hand in hand ...
let us solve problems by working together . "
dutch politicians distanced themselves from wilders and his film .
" the netherlands does not need wilders as a filmmaker , " said mark rutte , leader of the dutch liberal vvd party - of which wilders himself was a member until being thrown out in september 2004 .
" we need wilders as a legislator , to debate about the netherlands and to find solutions for serious problems , including the problems of integration and immigration . "
minister of integration ella vogelaar said the film could increase people 's fears of islamic radicalism .
" the first half of the film contained shocking material , " she said .

they currently only have the rights to construct the train cars , but purchasing additional rights from thyssenkrupp would mean they could produce complete transrapid systems and sell them elsewhere . however , it would also be necessary to obtain the control technology developed by siemens , as well as the engine know-how . chinese expert says deal unlikely a chinese transport export on friday however said that such a deal between beijing and thyssenkrupp was " unlikely . "
xie weida , deputy director of the railway institute at shanghai 's tongji university , said the core technology would be extremely expensive but conceded that buying it could benefit china . a planned extension of the shanghai transrapid line by world expo , which the city will host in 2010 , was recently postponed by mayor han zheng . according to the welt report , an eight- or nine-figure deal between beijing and thyssenkrupp could potentially spare the 220 jobs in germany that are threatened by the closure of the project . " i can not guarantee that we will not lose out to china , " said thomas schlenz , the head of thyssenkrupp 's works council .
" there is a danger that they can pick up this technology and run with it . "
he added that about 1,000 new jobs would have been created in germany had the transrapid plan been carried out . klaus-heiner roehl from the iw economic research institute , however , said that it will likely " be difficult to sell something abroad that was rejected at home . " the blame game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human error caused the 2006 accident six months ago , the heads of siemens , thyssenkrupp and hochtief construction group had said the plan to build the transrapid in munich would total 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- , but federal transport minister wolfgang tiefensee announced on thursday , march 27 , that costs had risen unexpectedly to nearly double , making the venture too pricy to continue with . the hope was that a successful transrapid in germany would provide the showcase necessary to market the high-speed technology to the rest of the world . news of the decision to scrap the flagship train link in munich developed by thyseenkrupp and siemens has triggered angry recriminations among politicians in the southern state of bavaria about who is to blame for the project 's abrupt demise . bavaria 's premier guenter beckstein of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- slammed the industrial consortium developing the technology for the failure of the munich train project , which his predecessor edmund stoiber had pushed through shortly before stepping down . " those who could n't keep their promises " are responsible for putting the project on ice , beckstein told the friday edition of the passauer neue presse .
he added that " no other routes will be built in germany .
the munich project was the last chance . " csu secretary general christine haderthauer joined the bavarian premier in placing blame on the project 's industrial partners . " apparently , industry did n't want a flagship project , but to make a profit , " she told berliner zeitung . opposition to train project the csu , bavarian sister-party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , had long been under fire for the controversial endeavor and critics had accused former bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who stepped down last year , of trying to make the transrapid his personal legacy . " bavaria 's conservative party led a propaganda campaign for the transrapid for years and splurged taxpayers ' money on it , " said franz maget , head of the social democratic party in bavaria . in november , some 13,000 people attended a demonstration against the project in munich , where the new high-speed train would have linked the airport with the city center .
public disapproval was fuelled by a transrapid accident that occurred due to human failure during a test run in 2006 ; 23 people were killed . german engineers started developing the magnetic levitation system in 1969 and millions of euros of federal and private money has been invested in research and development since then . using the magnetic levitation technology , the train floats on a magnetic cushion just above the rail , traveling up to three times faster than standard steel-wheel trains .
the project would have shaved travel time between the munich airport and the city center down to 10 minutes from 40 minutes . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 17-minute film , which wilders claims is not intended as an attack on muslims but on radical islam , features violent imagery of the terrorist attacks in new york and madrid intertwined with koranic texts .
the film opens and ends with a cartoon of the prophet mohammad with a bomb under his turban , originally published in danish newspapers , accompanied by the sound of ticking .
images of hijacked airplanes flying into the world trade centre in new york on september 11 , 2001 , soon follow with sound bites from phone calls to the emergency services on that day .
the film then continues with grizzly images of bloodstained bodies in the aftermath of the madrid train bombings in march 2004 in which 191 people were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excerpts from the koran are shown with images from 9/11 it intersperses these with images of a koran and the text of a sura from islam 's holiest tome , which translated from arabic implores the faithful to " terrorize the enemies of allah . "
the film carries no commentary and relies purely on the pictures of the terrorist attacks , as well as a beheading and a vision of a future holland where homosexuals and alternative thinkers are tortured , to carry wilders ' perceived vision of " reality . "
" i am a politician , " wilders said recently .
" i think that islam and the koran present a danger for our country and i want to warn against it .
i think i have made a good film within the boundaries of the law .
if something should now happen , then it is solely the responsibility of those people who use violence . "
dutch government distances itself from wilders the dutch government , fearful of reprisals similar to those which followed the reproduction across europe of the cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed , pressured wilders not to release the movie but to little effect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende rejected wilders ' interpretation of islam " this film equates islam with violence and we reject this interpretation , " said prime minister jan peter balkenende .
" the vast majority of muslims reject extremism and violence .
in fact the victims are often also muslims " initial reactions from the muslim community in the netherlands were restrained .
the evening after the film 's release passed without incident , in contrast to the unrest that swept the country following the murder by an islamic militant in 2004 of film director theo van gogh , another dutch artist who was accused of offending islam .
however , iran and indonesia slammed the film .
iran called it film heinous , blasphemous and anti-islamic and called on european governments to block any further showing . indonesia , the world 's most populous muslim nation and a former dutch colony , also condemned the film .
" we are of the view that the film has a racist flavour and is an insult to islam , hidden under the cover of freedom of expression , " a foreign ministry spokesman said .
" we call on indonesian people not to be incited . "
prime minister balkenende praised the efforts of his government to defuse muslim anger in the months preceding the release of the film and welcomed the initial muslim response .
" the government is heartened by the initial restrained reactions of dutch muslim organizations , " he said .
" the dutch government stands for a society in which freedom and respect go hand in hand ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de islamic world -pipe- 28.03.2008 dutch muslims react with restraint to mp 's controversial film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right mp geert wilders claims his film is not an attack on muslims but on radicalism muslims in the netherlands have reacted calmly to the internet release of a controversial film critical of islam by dutch far-right mp geert wilders , but elsewhere passions run high . the wilders film , titled " fitna " -lsb- strife -rsb- , made its debut via british video-sharing website liveleak and soon spread to the globally popular youtube site where it quickly generated heated debate among viewers and much divided opinion .
the 17-minute film , which wilders claims is not intended as an attack on muslims but on radical islam , features violent imagery of the terrorist attacks in new york and madrid intertwined with koranic texts .
the film opens and ends with a cartoon of the prophet mohammad with a bomb under his turban , originally published in danish newspapers , accompanied by the sound of ticking .
images of hijacked airplanes flying into the world trade centre in new york on september 11 , 2001 , soon follow with sound bites from phone calls to the emergency services on that day .
the film then continues with grizzly images of bloodstained bodies in the aftermath of the madrid train bombings in march 2004 in which 191 people were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excerpts from the koran are shown with images from 9/11 it intersperses these with images of a koran and the text of a sura from islam 's holiest tome , which translated from arabic implores the faithful to " terrorize the enemies of allah . "
the film carries no commentary and relies purely on the pictures of the terrorist attacks , as well as a beheading and a vision of a future holland where homosexuals and alternative thinkers are tortured , to carry wilders ' perceived vision of " reality . "
" i am a politician , " wilders said recently .
" i think that islam and the koran present a danger for our country and i want to warn against it .
i think i have made a good film within the boundaries of the law .
if something should now happen , then it is solely the responsibility of those people who use violence . "
dutch government distances itself from wilders the dutch government , fearful of reprisals similar to those which followed the reproduction across europe of the cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed , pressured wilders not to release the movie but to little effect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende rejected wilders ' interpretation of islam " this film equates islam with violence and we reject this interpretation , " said prime minister jan peter balkenende .
" the vast majority of muslims reject extremism and violence .
in fact the victims are often also muslims " initial reactions from the muslim community in the netherlands were restrained .
the evening after the film 's release passed without incident , in contrast to the unrest that swept the country following the murder by an islamic militant in 2004 of film director theo van gogh , another dutch artist who was accused of offending islam .
however , iran and indonesia slammed the film .
iran called it film heinous , blasphemous and anti-islamic and called on european governments to block any further showing . indonesia , the world 's most populous muslim nation and a former dutch colony , also condemned the film .
" we are of the view that the film has a racist flavour and is an insult to islam , hidden under the cover of freedom of expression , " a foreign ministry spokesman said .
" we call on indonesian people not to be incited . "
prime minister balkenende praised the efforts of his government to defuse muslim anger in the months preceding the release of the film and welcomed the initial muslim response .
" the government is heartened by the initial restrained reactions of dutch muslim organizations , " he said .
" the dutch government stands for a society in which freedom and respect go hand in hand ...
let us solve problems by working together . "
dutch politicians distanced themselves from wilders and his film .
" the netherlands does not need wilders as a filmmaker , " said mark rutte , leader of the dutch liberal vvd party - of which wilders himself was a member until being thrown out in september 2004 .
" we need wilders as a legislator , to debate about the netherlands and to find solutions for serious problems , including the problems of integration and immigration . "
minister of integration ella vogelaar said the film could increase people 's fears of islamic radicalism .
" the first half of the film contained shocking material , " she said .
dutch muslims wait , international anger simmers muslim groups have appealed for calm and mosques plan to open their doors to the public on friday to defuse tension .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch muslims have recated with restraint to the film fouad sidali , a leading member of the muslim community in holland , called for moderate responses .
" we muslims in the netherlands are opposed to any forms of violence and aggression , " sidali said .
" we are dutch ; we love our country and abide by the constitution . "
moslems in other areas of the world , however , have not been as magnanimous .
before the film 's release , demonstrators had already taken to the streets from afghanistan to indonesia to burn dutch and danish flags , and the governments of pakistan and iran sharply criticized wilders ' project .
nato has expressed concern the film could worsen security for foreign forces in afghanistan , including 1,650 dutch troops .
despite wilders ' own assertion , one that has been supported by a number of dutch legislators , that he did not break any blasphemy laws with the film , a court in rotterdam will hear an injunction against him on friday brought by the dutch islamic federation .

" my cartoon has been misused again .
it has been pulled from its original context and set in a completely different one , " westergaard told danish broadcaster dr.
" it is a drawing aimed specifically against islamic terror that uses interpretations of the koran and islam as spiritual ammunition , " westergaard , who remains in hiding after death threats , said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 28.03.2008 real work for no money : a growing reality for young germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interns often do the work of full-time staff new debate has broken out about german companies using interns who are poorly paid , if they 're paid at all , to do work that once was done by full-time staff .
germany 's labor minister wants to do something about it . nora neye , 27 , is a member of germany 's so-called " internship generation , " although it 's not a club she particularly wanted to join .
she 's among the many young germans in their 20s and early 30s who have university degrees but have had little luck finding full-time work . instead , they have embarked on a series of internships , often unpaid , hoping that one of them might lead to a permanent job .
at the end of each , it 's common that graduates leave disappointed or embittered , and usually a lot poorer . " finishing your degree and then finding proper work seems more and more difficult , " she said .
" if you have n't done quite a number of internships , you 're not going to find a job . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internships have become the norm as new graduates outnumber jobs so neye , after getting bachelor 's and master 's degrees in the humanities , got on the internship train herself , doing two-month stints at publishing houses and media organizations .
some were helpful ; some were not .

germany 's labor minister wants to do something about it . nora neye , 27 , is a member of germany 's so-called " internship generation , " although it 's not a club she particularly wanted to join .
she 's among the many young germans in their 20s and early 30s who have university degrees but have had little luck finding full-time work . instead , they have embarked on a series of internships , often unpaid , hoping that one of them might lead to a permanent job .
at the end of each , it 's common that graduates leave disappointed or embittered , and usually a lot poorer . " finishing your degree and then finding proper work seems more and more difficult , " she said .
" if you have n't done quite a number of internships , you 're not going to find a job . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internships have become the norm as new graduates outnumber jobs so neye , after getting bachelor 's and master 's degrees in the humanities , got on the internship train herself , doing two-month stints at publishing houses and media organizations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de islamic world -pipe- 28.03.2008 dutch muslims react with restraint to mp 's controversial film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right mp geert wilders claims his film is not an attack on muslims but on radicalism muslims in the netherlands have reacted calmly to the internet release of a controversial film critical of islam by dutch far-right mp geert wilders , but elsewhere passions run high . the wilders film , titled " fitna " -lsb- strife -rsb- , made its debut via british video-sharing website liveleak and soon spread to the globally popular youtube site where it quickly generated heated debate among viewers and much divided opinion .
the 17-minute film , which wilders claims is not intended as an attack on muslims but on radical islam , features violent imagery of the terrorist attacks in new york and madrid intertwined with koranic texts .
the film opens and ends with a cartoon of the prophet mohammad with a bomb under his turban , originally published in danish newspapers , accompanied by the sound of ticking .
images of hijacked airplanes flying into the world trade centre in new york on september 11 , 2001 , soon follow with sound bites from phone calls to the emergency services on that day .
the film then continues with grizzly images of bloodstained bodies in the aftermath of the madrid train bombings in march 2004 in which 191 people were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excerpts from the koran are shown with images from 9/11 it intersperses these with images of a koran and the text of a sura from islam 's holiest tome , which translated from arabic implores the faithful to " terrorize the enemies of allah . "
the film carries no commentary and relies purely on the pictures of the terrorist attacks , as well as a beheading and a vision of a future holland where homosexuals and alternative thinkers are tortured , to carry wilders ' perceived vision of " reality . "
" i am a politician , " wilders said recently .
" i think that islam and the koran present a danger for our country and i want to warn against it .
i think i have made a good film within the boundaries of the law .
if something should now happen , then it is solely the responsibility of those people who use violence . "
dutch government distances itself from wilders the dutch government , fearful of reprisals similar to those which followed the reproduction across europe of the cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed , pressured wilders not to release the movie but to little effect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende rejected wilders ' interpretation of islam " this film equates islam with violence and we reject this interpretation , " said prime minister jan peter balkenende .
" the vast majority of muslims reject extremism and violence .
in fact the victims are often also muslims " initial reactions from the muslim community in the netherlands were restrained .
the evening after the film 's release passed without incident , in contrast to the unrest that swept the country following the murder by an islamic militant in 2004 of film director theo van gogh , another dutch artist who was accused of offending islam .
however , iran and indonesia slammed the film .
iran called it film heinous , blasphemous and anti-islamic and called on european governments to block any further showing . indonesia , the world 's most populous muslim nation and a former dutch colony , also condemned the film .
" we are of the view that the film has a racist flavour and is an insult to islam , hidden under the cover of freedom of expression , " a foreign ministry spokesman said .
" we call on indonesian people not to be incited . "
prime minister balkenende praised the efforts of his government to defuse muslim anger in the months preceding the release of the film and welcomed the initial muslim response .
" the government is heartened by the initial restrained reactions of dutch muslim organizations , " he said .
" the dutch government stands for a society in which freedom and respect go hand in hand ...
let us solve problems by working together . "
dutch politicians distanced themselves from wilders and his film .
" the netherlands does not need wilders as a filmmaker , " said mark rutte , leader of the dutch liberal vvd party - of which wilders himself was a member until being thrown out in september 2004 .
" we need wilders as a legislator , to debate about the netherlands and to find solutions for serious problems , including the problems of integration and immigration . "
minister of integration ella vogelaar said the film could increase people 's fears of islamic radicalism .
" the first half of the film contained shocking material , " she said .
dutch muslims wait , international anger simmers muslim groups have appealed for calm and mosques plan to open their doors to the public on friday to defuse tension .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch muslims have recated with restraint to the film fouad sidali , a leading member of the muslim community in holland , called for moderate responses .
" we muslims in the netherlands are opposed to any forms of violence and aggression , " sidali said .
" we are dutch ; we love our country and abide by the constitution . "
moslems in other areas of the world , however , have not been as magnanimous .
before the film 's release , demonstrators had already taken to the streets from afghanistan to indonesia to burn dutch and danish flags , and the governments of pakistan and iran sharply criticized wilders ' project .
nato has expressed concern the film could worsen security for foreign forces in afghanistan , including 1,650 dutch troops .
despite wilders ' own assertion , one that has been supported by a number of dutch legislators , that he did not break any blasphemy laws with the film , a court in rotterdam will hear an injunction against him on friday brought by the dutch islamic federation .
cartoonist to issue writ from secure location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard 's cartoon continues to cause outrage wilders may also find himself embroiled in another court case brought against him by the cartoonist kurt westergaard , whose mohammed caricature , which opens and closes the film , sparked violent protests by muslims worldwide in 2006 .
" my cartoon has been misused again .
it has been pulled from its original context and set in a completely different one , " westergaard told danish broadcaster dr.
" it is a drawing aimed specifically against islamic terror that uses interpretations of the koran and islam as spiritual ammunition , " westergaard , who remains in hiding after death threats , said .
" wilders has not asked me for permission , so it is simply a case of violation of copyright rules , " westergaard said , adding he would contact legal experts friday . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's labor minister wants to do something about it . nora neye , 27 , is a member of germany 's so-called " internship generation , " although it 's not a club she particularly wanted to join .
she 's among the many young germans in their 20s and early 30s who have university degrees but have had little luck finding full-time work . instead , they have embarked on a series of internships , often unpaid , hoping that one of them might lead to a permanent job .
at the end of each , it 's common that graduates leave disappointed or embittered , and usually a lot poorer . " finishing your degree and then finding proper work seems more and more difficult , " she said .
" if you have n't done quite a number of internships , you 're not going to find a job . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internships have become the norm as new graduates outnumber jobs so neye , after getting bachelor 's and master 's degrees in the humanities , got on the internship train herself , doing two-month stints at publishing houses and media organizations .
some were helpful ; some were not .
none led to a job . but it was firms ' attitude that there was a nearly endless source of highly qualified labor they can use on the cheap that angered her most . " companies believe more and more they can do whatever and do n't have to pay for it , " she said . new guidelines germany 's labor minister olaf scholz wants to cut down on what he and other critics call intern exploitation .
he has called for new regulations that would require interns with university degrees be paid appropriately , that their duties and goals be outlined at the outset , and that they not be treated as cheap replacements for regular employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholz wants to instate a series of protections for interns " internships are useful , but there 's been some abuse and we have to do something about it , " he told reporters . scholz , a member of the center-left social democratic party , pointed to a study conducted by germany 's federal institute for occupational safety and health -lrb- baua -rrb- , which asked 2,000 young people between 18 and 34 about their intern experiences .
although all had university degrees , 51 percent were not paid for their internships , and another 12 percent thought they were paid too little . he said he did not want to do away with internships or put in place a minimum wage for them , rather he was only interested in seeing that interns were treated fairly , since they are a growing group . while 17 percent of 30 to 34-year-olds have experience as an intern , 25 percent of those between 18 and 24 have an internship behind them . " there 's a general culture of doing more and more internships and it 's very problematic , " said former intern neye .
" employers see you after you 've finished your degree these days and say ' why have you only done five internships and not 10 ? " ' new economic model ? internships in germany have traditionally been seen as a way to introduce young people to professional working life .
for university graduates , they have been thought of as bridges to permanent employment , especially since these interns are n't just making coffee and copies , they 're doing real work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work-pay balance with many interns is off " they have a solid education and the required knowledge and therefore generally are given significant tasks , " said rene rudolf of the youth arm of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- . but he and others say many companies have abandoned the principle of interns transitioning to full-time employees .
bettina könig , who heads an initiative that aims to improve internships called fair work , said when the german economy was sputtering in 2001 , jobs were scarce , firms were afraid to hire , and graduates gladly took internships , even for low or no pay , just to get experience and perhaps impress a higher-up . " and now even that the economy is better , this kind of bad model has established itself in many companies , " she said .
" i do n't see it changing without some kind of government intervention . " fair work runs a web site where interns can post their own experiences .

they said there was progress on issues such as combating terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
but they said russia 's objections to us plans for missile defence bases in eastern europe remained .
the talks precede a meeting between presidents george w bush and vladimir putin in russia next week .
the talks between diplomats from both sides in washington were aimed at agreeing a joint text in time for that meeting .
access offered the bbc 's jonathan beale says progress on broader co-operation may be a breakthrough , but an agreement on missile defence still seems elusive .
how defence system works the us says the system is needed to counter a potential threat from rogue states like iran , but moscow fears it could be used against russia .
a senior us diplomat said that while russia disagreed with us intentions , they have been prepared to talk about transparency and confidence building measures .
the us has offered to give russian officials access to the sites planned in the czech republic and poland .
speaking earlier in moscow , russia 's foreign minister sergey lavrov said that the best way to assuage russia 's concerns would be to abandon the plans .

brake said at-work drivers often " feel pressurised " to get somewhere faster , putting lives at risk .
its survey of 4,500 drivers found 61 % of motorists driving as part of their work did not keep a safe enough distance behind the vehicle in front .
the charity wants the punishment for speeding increased to a £ 1,000 fine and six penalty points .
the survey found 61 % of at-work drivers admitted failing to leave the recommended two-second gap between them and the vehicle in front , compared to 40 % of other drivers .
in addition , 74 % of at-work drivers admitted speeding at 80mph or more on motorways , compared with around half of other drivers .
a life is more important than being late liz voysey the research , which was undertaken with the breakdown and recovery firm green flag , also showed 77 % of at-work drivers admitted driving at 35mph in a 30mph limit , compared with 62 % of other drivers .
according to brake , tailgating was a contributory factor in at least 54 deaths in 2006 , and speeding plays a part in more than a quarter of deaths on uk roads .
' horrifying ' liz voysey 's 19-year-old daughter amy was killed in a road crash in 2004 .
a lorry had collided with her car , leaving her stranded in the outside lane of a dual carriageway .
amy waited with her hazard lights on , unable to manoeuvre to safety .
she was hit by a van being driven by a lift repair engineer , speeding at more than 80mph .
mrs voysey said : " a life is more important than being late . "
work pressures are no excuse for impatient and aggressive driving cathy keeler , brake " driving too close and speeding means you do n't give yourself room to react in a crisis and the faster you 're travelling when you crash , the more terrible the consequences will be , " she said .
brake is calling for a range of new measures to be introduced , including all unsafe driving to be legally classed as dangerous driving .
it is also urging the department for transport to publish its research into satellite-controlled vehicle speed limiters .
the organisation also said firms which pressurise employees into tailgating or speeding should be penalised for breaching their duty of care or even , in some circumstances , prosecuted under new corporate manslaughter legislation .
cathy keeler , head of campaigns for brake , said : " it 's horrifying that so many drivers admit breaking such basic road rules as leaving a two-second gap or sticking to the speed limit , especially when they drive for work .
" work pressures are no excuse for impatient and aggressive driving .
given the terrible death toll of nine people killed every day on our roads , there can be no room for complacency . "
the brake and green flag survey questioned 4,640 drivers - 2,510 were people who drove for work , excluding commuters .

brake said at-work drivers often " feel pressurised " to get somewhere faster , putting lives at risk .
its survey of 4,500 drivers found 61 % of motorists driving as part of their work did not keep a safe enough distance behind the vehicle in front .
the charity wants the punishment for speeding increased to a £ 1,000 fine and six penalty points .
the survey found 61 % of at-work drivers admitted failing to leave the recommended two-second gap between them and the vehicle in front , compared to 40 % of other drivers .
in addition , 74 % of at-work drivers admitted speeding at 80mph or more on motorways , compared with around half of other drivers .
a life is more important than being late liz voysey the research , which was undertaken with the breakdown and recovery firm green flag , also showed 77 % of at-work drivers admitted driving at 35mph in a 30mph limit , compared with 62 % of other drivers .
according to brake , tailgating was a contributory factor in at least 54 deaths in 2006 , and speeding plays a part in more than a quarter of deaths on uk roads .
' horrifying ' liz voysey 's 19-year-old daughter amy was killed in a road crash in 2004 .
a lorry had collided with her car , leaving her stranded in the outside lane of a dual carriageway .
amy waited with her hazard lights on , unable to manoeuvre to safety .
she was hit by a van being driven by a lift repair engineer , speeding at more than 80mph .
mrs voysey said : " a life is more important than being late . "
work pressures are no excuse for impatient and aggressive driving cathy keeler , brake " driving too close and speeding means you do n't give yourself room to react in a crisis and the faster you 're travelling when you crash , the more terrible the consequences will be , " she said .
brake is calling for a range of new measures to be introduced , including all unsafe driving to be legally classed as dangerous driving .
it is also urging the department for transport to publish its research into satellite-controlled vehicle speed limiters .
the organisation also said firms which pressurise employees into tailgating or speeding should be penalised for breaching their duty of care or even , in some circumstances , prosecuted under new corporate manslaughter legislation .
cathy keeler , head of campaigns for brake , said : " it 's horrifying that so many drivers admit breaking such basic road rules as leaving a two-second gap or sticking to the speed limit , especially when they drive for work .
" work pressures are no excuse for impatient and aggressive driving .
given the terrible death toll of nine people killed every day on our roads , there can be no room for complacency . "
the brake and green flag survey questioned 4,640 drivers - 2,510 were people who drove for work , excluding commuters .

the survey claimed cardiff council paid the most in 2006-7 for its chief executive byron davies £ 151,186 .
blaenau gwent and anglesey were the only authorities found not to pay any staff more than £ 100,000 a year .
cbi wales said it did not think the salaries were excessive provided they were linked to performance .
the uk-wide survey is part of the tpa 's campaign for lower council taxes .
councils have been asked for comment .
according to the tpa , carmarthenshire council are the second highest payers in wales after chief executive mark james received a total of £ 148,867 in 2006-7 .
merthyr tydfil was third after paying its chief executive alistair neill £ 131,476 over the same period .
pay details the highest overall earner in the survey was revealed as former swansea council chief executive tim thorogood who left his post in 2006 .
he picked up £ 167,156.70 in 2005-6 which included £ 62,623.50 in the form of a severance package , said the survey .
council top earners cardiff chief executive byron davies - £ 151,186 carmarthenshire chief executive mark james - £ 148,867 ceredigion chief executive owen watkin - £ 102,618 conwy chief executive derek barker - £ 101,036 denbighshire chief executive ian miller - £ 109,385 flintshire occupational physician p oliver - £ 105,725 gwynedd chief executive harry thomas - £ 105,725 merthyr tydfil chief executive alistair neill - £ 131,476 monmouthshire chief executive colin berg - £ 103,515 neath port talbot chief executive ken sawyers - £ 125,000 newport chief executive chris freegard - £ 120,524 powys chief executive mark kerr - £ 108,454 wrexham chief executive isobel garner - £ 103,269 " town hall rich list " - welsh council top earners 2006-7 in alphabetical order .
source : tax payers ' allowance / foi the council explained that the payment was a one-off annual salary due to mr thorogood 's pay-off and that the current council leader was not earning anywhere near that amount .
the tpa put the list together after sending freedom of information requests to more than 450 local authorities across the uk in december 2007 .
the requests asked for employee pay details for the two most recent financial years - 2005-06 and 2006-07 - with the tpa compiling the list on the back of the responses it received .
the organisation was formed in 2004 to represent taxpayers and fight for lower taxes .
this is the second " rich list " it has created as part of its campaign .
tpa chief executive matthew elliott said : " taxpayers have a right to know how much senior town hall officials are being paid because only then can we judge whether they deserve their remuneration .
" too often , council executives are rewarded handsomely even when they fail .
families and pensioners are struggling with the demands of yet another council tax rise , and councils owe it to them to cut back on executive pay hikes . "
' performance ' councils who failed to respond to the survey included caerphilly , pembrokeshire , rhondda cynon taf , torfaen and vale of glamorgan .
a carmarthenshire county council spokesman said : " we reduced the number of director posts by 15 % and the number of head of service posts by over 30 % since 2003 , saving nearly £ 1m each year on its salaries bill .
" the council is a huge business , spending some £ 535m each year .
it has nearly 9,000 employees , providing 200 different services to the county .
" we need the best chief officers and their remuneration reflects both the scale and success of the transformation in service delivery and regeneration over recent years . "
a spokeswoman for merthyr tydfil council said : " wales needs to be competitive in the public sector as in the private sector .
" it is widely recognised that a local authority chief executive in an equivalent position in the private sector would be salaried around three times the public sector level and receive a range of other substantive benefits such as bonuses in addition . "
the welsh local government association has also been asked to comment .
david rosser , director of the confederation of british industry in wales , said the focus should not be on the amount executives were paid but on the responsibilties they had and whether an element of performance was built into their salary .
he said : " i do n't think £ 100,000 a year for someone running an organisation with several thousand staff sounds particularly excessive .
" but if that then becomes a job for life , with no real relation with their performance , then that 's a different issue .
" reward for failure is a bad thing whether in the public or private sector but to say families are hard-pressed and we should cut exectives ' salaries does n't make much sense to me . "

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- england -pipe- toll of teenage drinking revealed bbc news / england graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- uk politics -pipe- education -pipe- magazine 09:05 gmt , friday , 28 march 2008 toll of teenage drinking revealed teenagers are drinking an average of 44 bottles of wine or 177 pints of beer a year each , a study suggests .
almost 10,000 15-to-16-year-olds in the north west of england were questioned as part of the study into underage drinking and violence .
the report , produced by liverpool john moores university , found as many as 40 % of teenagers in poor areas binge drink .
recent high-profile murders in the region were carried out by teenagers who had been drinking heavily .
on thursday , brendan harris , 15 , was convicted of murdering 20-year-old sophie lancaster in a lancashire park after drinking two litres of cider , peach schnapps and lager .
in february , three teenagers were jailed for life for murdering garry newlove , 47 , from warrington , in an act that the judge described as " drunken aggression " carried out for entertainment . "
these figures highlight the sheer quantity of alcohol being consumed by under-age drinkers across the north west . "
professor mark bellis the latest report into teenage drinking was produced by the university 's centre for public health in conjunction with the home office and trading standards north west .
researchers also estimate that of 190,000 15-to-16-year-olds in england , 57,000 binge by drinking five or more drinks in one session .
just under half of those surveyed drank at least once a week , with 40 % of girls and 42 % of boys later involved in violence .
the report also found that poor children were 45 % more likely to be violent after drinking than children in affluent areas .
' ongoing challenge ' professor mark bellis , co-author of the report , said : " these figures highlight the sheer quantity of alcohol being consumed by under-age drinkers across the north west .
" sadly , there is still practically no information publicly available on what is a safe amount of alcohol for children to consume or on how parents can best moderate their children 's drinking .
" without a clear message that under-age drunkenness will not be tolerated , we will continue to see the high levels of alcohol bingeing and related violence identified in this study . "
dominic harrison , deputy regional director of public health in north west , said the research confirmed the " almost daily experience " of people who saw the rising problem of young , drunk people across the region .
" the principal cause of the increased risk is lower prices and increased availability , but culture and the increasing social tolerance of drunken behaviour is also a factor , " he said .
more than a third of the teenagers questioned admitted buying their own alcohol - described as an " ongoing challenge " for trading standards officers .
education vital north west officer richard lindley said : " under-18s continue to obtain alcohol by asking strangers outside shops and also friends who either look , or are over 18 , to buy for them .
" these purchasers need to be aware they are fuelling problems in our communities and committing criminal offences themselves for which they can face police fines . "
a department of health spokesperson said : " tackling the culture of harmful and binge drinking is a priority for government and we are working with the alcohol industry and other stakeholders to implement a comprehensive strategy to tackle it .
" these include a new public information campaign , an independent review of alcohol pricing and promotion , toughened enforcement of underage sales and more help for people who want to drink less .
" alcohol education continues to be a vital element of our approach .
" our guidance to schools is clear that pupils ' education about alcohol and its effects should start in primary school , before drinking patterns become established and should be revisited as pupils ' understanding and experience increases . "

almost 10,000 15-to-16-year-olds in the north west of england were questioned as part of the study into underage drinking and violence .
the report , produced by liverpool john moores university , found as many as 40 % of teenagers in poor areas binge drink .
recent high-profile murders in the region were carried out by teenagers who had been drinking heavily .
on thursday , brendan harris , 15 , was convicted of murdering 20-year-old sophie lancaster in a lancashire park after drinking two litres of cider , peach schnapps and lager .
in february , three teenagers were jailed for life for murdering garry newlove , 47 , from warrington , in an act that the judge described as " drunken aggression " carried out for entertainment .
these figures highlight the sheer quantity of alcohol being consumed by under-age drinkers across the north west .
professor mark bellis the latest report into teenage drinking was produced by the university 's centre for public health in conjunction with the home office and trading standards north west .
researchers also estimate that of 190,000 15-to-16-year-olds in england , 57,000 binge by drinking five or more drinks in one session .
just under half of those surveyed drank at least once a week , with 40 % of girls and 42 % of boys later involved in violence .
the report also found that poor children were 45 % more likely to be violent after drinking than children in affluent areas .
' ongoing challenge ' professor mark bellis , co-author of the report , said : " these figures highlight the sheer quantity of alcohol being consumed by under-age drinkers across the north west .
" sadly , there is still practically no information publicly available on what is a safe amount of alcohol for children to consume or on how parents can best moderate their children 's drinking .
" without a clear message that under-age drunkenness will not be tolerated , we will continue to see the high levels of alcohol bingeing and related violence identified in this study . "
dominic harrison , deputy regional director of public health in north west , said the research confirmed the " almost daily experience " of people who saw the rising problem of young , drunk people across the region .
" the principal cause of the increased risk is lower prices and increased availability , but culture and the increasing social tolerance of drunken behaviour is also a factor , " he said .
more than a third of the teenagers questioned admitted buying their own alcohol - described as an " ongoing challenge " for trading standards officers .
education vital north west officer richard lindley said : " under-18s continue to obtain alcohol by asking strangers outside shops and also friends who either look , or are over 18 , to buy for them .
" these purchasers need to be aware they are fuelling problems in our communities and committing criminal offences themselves for which they can face police fines . "
a department of health spokesperson said : " tackling the culture of harmful and binge drinking is a priority for government and we are working with the alcohol industry and other stakeholders to implement a comprehensive strategy to tackle it .
" these include a new public information campaign , an independent review of alcohol pricing and promotion , toughened enforcement of underage sales and more help for people who want to drink less .

almost 10,000 15-to-16-year-olds in the north west of england were questioned as part of the study into underage drinking and violence .
the report , produced by liverpool john moores university , found as many as 40 % of teenagers in poor areas binge drink .
recent high-profile murders in the region were carried out by teenagers who had been drinking heavily .
on thursday , brendan harris , 15 , was convicted of murdering 20-year-old sophie lancaster in a lancashire park after drinking two litres of cider , peach schnapps and lager .
in february , three teenagers were jailed for life for murdering garry newlove , 47 , from warrington , in an act that the judge described as " drunken aggression " carried out for entertainment .
these figures highlight the sheer quantity of alcohol being consumed by under-age drinkers across the north west .
professor mark bellis the latest report into teenage drinking was produced by the university 's centre for public health in conjunction with the home office and trading standards north west .
researchers also estimate that of 190,000 15-to-16-year-olds in england , 57,000 binge by drinking five or more drinks in one session .
just under half of those surveyed drank at least once a week , with 40 % of girls and 42 % of boys later involved in violence .
the report also found that poor children were 45 % more likely to be violent after drinking than children in affluent areas .
' ongoing challenge ' professor mark bellis , co-author of the report , said : " these figures highlight the sheer quantity of alcohol being consumed by under-age drinkers across the north west .
" sadly , there is still practically no information publicly available on what is a safe amount of alcohol for children to consume or on how parents can best moderate their children 's drinking .
" without a clear message that under-age drunkenness will not be tolerated , we will continue to see the high levels of alcohol bingeing and related violence identified in this study . "
dominic harrison , deputy regional director of public health in north west , said the research confirmed the " almost daily experience " of people who saw the rising problem of young , drunk people across the region .
" the principal cause of the increased risk is lower prices and increased availability , but culture and the increasing social tolerance of drunken behaviour is also a factor , " he said .
more than a third of the teenagers questioned admitted buying their own alcohol - described as an " ongoing challenge " for trading standards officers .
education vital north west officer richard lindley said : " under-18s continue to obtain alcohol by asking strangers outside shops and also friends who either look , or are over 18 , to buy for them .
" these purchasers need to be aware they are fuelling problems in our communities and committing criminal offences themselves for which they can face police fines . "
a department of health spokesperson said : " tackling the culture of harmful and binge drinking is a priority for government and we are working with the alcohol industry and other stakeholders to implement a comprehensive strategy to tackle it .
" these include a new public information campaign , an independent review of alcohol pricing and promotion , toughened enforcement of underage sales and more help for people who want to drink less .
" alcohol education continues to be a vital element of our approach .
" our guidance to schools is clear that pupils ' education about alcohol and its effects should start in primary school , before drinking patterns become established and should be revisited as pupils ' understanding and experience increases . "

" sadly , there is still practically no information publicly available on what is a safe amount of alcohol for children to consume or on how parents can best moderate their children 's drinking .
" without a clear message that under-age drunkenness will not be tolerated , we will continue to see the high levels of alcohol bingeing and related violence identified in this study . "
dominic harrison , deputy regional director of public health in north west , said the research confirmed the " almost daily experience " of people who saw the rising problem of young , drunk people across the region .
" the principal cause of the increased risk is lower prices and increased availability , but culture and the increasing social tolerance of drunken behaviour is also a factor , " he said .
more than a third of the teenagers questioned admitted buying their own alcohol - described as an " ongoing challenge " for trading standards officers .
education vital north west officer richard lindley said : " under-18s continue to obtain alcohol by asking strangers outside shops and also friends who either look , or are over 18 , to buy for them .
" these purchasers need to be aware they are fuelling problems in our communities and committing criminal offences themselves for which they can face police fines . "
a department of health spokesperson said : " tackling the culture of harmful and binge drinking is a priority for government and we are working with the alcohol industry and other stakeholders to implement a comprehensive strategy to tackle it .
" these include a new public information campaign , an independent review of alcohol pricing and promotion , toughened enforcement of underage sales and more help for people who want to drink less .
" alcohol education continues to be a vital element of our approach .
" our guidance to schools is clear that pupils ' education about alcohol and its effects should start in primary school , before drinking patterns become established and should be revisited as pupils ' understanding and experience increases . "

but the case has been seen to expose the difficulty of controlling the vast expanses of the sahara as al-qaeda 's north africa affiliate seeks to make its presence felt across the maghreb .
the group , which was blamed for a number of spectacular suicide bombings in algeria last year , has raised its profile once more after claiming the kidnapping .
it is now thought to be holding wolfgang ebner , 51 , and andrea kloiber , 43 , at an undisclosed location in northern mali .
according to statements posted on the internet , the kidnappers have demanded that militants held in algeria and tunisia be freed in return for the release of the austrians .
they have twice deferred a deadline , stating most recently that their request must be met by 6 april .
there have been unconfirmed reports that the group is also asking for a ransom .
seeking headlines the al-qaeda organisation in the land of the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- emerged from the remnants of the islamist insurgency that began in algeria in the 1990s .
it adopted its current name early last year as - after years of being worn down by the algerian security forces - it began to scale up bombings and increase its flow of propaganda .
but recent attacks had been largely restricted to northern algeria .
jean-francois daguzin , a senior research fellow at the foundation for strategic research in paris , said that last month 's kidnapping showed the group was trying to spread its influence , drawing together smaller militant factions from across the region .
" the desire is to create an insurrectional space , and to attract attention by targeting foreigners , " he said .
the case of the austrians is not without precedent .
between february and may 2003 , a group of militants from the salafist group for call and combat - aqim 's precursor - captured 32 european tourists travelling across the sahara and held them for several months .
one of the hostages is reported to have died of heat exhaustion , before the militants released the last of the tourists in august of that year after reportedly receiving a ransom of 5m euros from the german government .
german officials refused to confirm or deny the reports .
that incident focused attention on the security threat in the sahara , and prompted efforts to tighten controls .
the us government had identified the sahel area , which borders the sahara desert and including mali , niger , chad and mauritania as a potential terrorist haven , setting up the pan-sahel initiative as a counter measure .
this developed into the expanded trans-saharan counter terrorism initiative , which also covers algeria , morocco , tunisia , senegal and ghana .
the programme is " designed to help develop the internal security forces necessary to control borders and combat terrorism and other illegal activity , " according to the us military .
difficult terrain although some observers have questioned how great the radical threat in the region really is , the disappearance of the austrian tourists appears to show that there are still gaps along the porous desert borders .
" the sahara is a dangerous place if only because various groups recognise that the states do n't exercise a monopoly on power , " said geoff porter , an analyst for the eurasia group in new york " they ca n't , they do n't have the capacity . "
senior austrian diplomat anton prohaska has been sent to bamako but he said that there were still questions about how the kidnappers had transported the austrians across hundreds of kilometres of desert , some of which are militarised , and it was possible that regional governments had facilitated the transfer of the hostages to neutral ground .
the austrian authorities say they are still not clear about exactly where the two tourists , who last contacted their relatives on 18 february , had disappeared .
once it was reported that they were being held in mali , they dispatched a team of emissaries to the capital , bamako , where there is no austrian embassy .
austria 's government has been seeking help as it tries to get to handle a complex case in unfamiliar terrain .
" we established contacts with governments , ngos , individuals , and people who are knowledgeable about the area , " said peter launsky-tieffenthal , a spokesman for the austrian foreign ministry .
" it 's really a major effort involving all sorts of parties in the region and beyond . "
there have been unconfirmed reports that saif al-islam gaddafi , son of the libyan leader muammar gaddafi , is one of those involved in negotiations .
targeting tourists last week there was also an outbreak of violence in northern mali as tuareg rebels , who are seeking more autonomy and a greater share of resources across the region , attacked a malian army convoy .
the austrians are thought to be in the remote desert of northern mali austrian authorities say they have no indication that the unrest has affected the kidnap case , but they are following the situation closely .
in one of their statements , the kidnappers warned western tourists not to visit tunisia and other north african countries , including morocco , algeria and mauritania .
a photograph released in conjunction with the statement shows a woman - said to be ms kloiber - wearing a blue headscarf with her face digitally obscured .
this may be because showing a woman 's face is prohibited under radical islamist beliefs .
the case is particularly worrying for tunisia , which has a thriving tourist industry .
apart from a suicide attack in 2002 on the island of djerba , the country has been largely successful in keeping a lid on islamic extremism .
austria has raised its travel warning for the south of tunisia , though the foreign ministry noted that most tourism is directed to the mediterranean coast in the north .
" tunisia has always been the safest country in the maghreb , " said mr daguzin .
" this shows that despite all their efforts to show that there is complete security , aqim is able to strike wherever it wants . "

but the case has been seen to expose the difficulty of controlling the vast expanses of the sahara as al-qaeda 's north africa affiliate seeks to make its presence felt across the maghreb .
the group , which was blamed for a number of spectacular suicide bombings in algeria last year , has raised its profile once more after claiming the kidnapping .
it is now thought to be holding wolfgang ebner , 51 , and andrea kloiber , 43 , at an undisclosed location in northern mali .
according to statements posted on the internet , the kidnappers have demanded that militants held in algeria and tunisia be freed in return for the release of the austrians .
they have twice deferred a deadline , stating most recently that their request must be met by 6 april .
there have been unconfirmed reports that the group is also asking for a ransom .
seeking headlines the al-qaeda organisation in the land of the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- emerged from the remnants of the islamist insurgency that began in algeria in the 1990s .
it adopted its current name early last year as - after years of being worn down by the algerian security forces - it began to scale up bombings and increase its flow of propaganda .
but recent attacks had been largely restricted to northern algeria .
jean-francois daguzin , a senior research fellow at the foundation for strategic research in paris , said that last month 's kidnapping showed the group was trying to spread its influence , drawing together smaller militant factions from across the region .
" the desire is to create an insurrectional space , and to attract attention by targeting foreigners , " he said .
the case of the austrians is not without precedent .
between february and may 2003 , a group of militants from the salafist group for call and combat - aqim 's precursor - captured 32 european tourists travelling across the sahara and held them for several months .
one of the hostages is reported to have died of heat exhaustion , before the militants released the last of the tourists in august of that year after reportedly receiving a ransom of 5m euros from the german government .
german officials refused to confirm or deny the reports .
that incident focused attention on the security threat in the sahara , and prompted efforts to tighten controls .
the us government had identified the sahel area , which borders the sahara desert and including mali , niger , chad and mauritania as a potential terrorist haven , setting up the pan-sahel initiative as a counter measure .
this developed into the expanded trans-saharan counter terrorism initiative , which also covers algeria , morocco , tunisia , senegal and ghana .
the programme is " designed to help develop the internal security forces necessary to control borders and combat terrorism and other illegal activity , " according to the us military .
difficult terrain although some observers have questioned how great the radical threat in the region really is , the disappearance of the austrian tourists appears to show that there are still gaps along the porous desert borders .
" the sahara is a dangerous place if only because various groups recognise that the states do n't exercise a monopoly on power , " said geoff porter , an analyst for the eurasia group in new york " they ca n't , they do n't have the capacity . "
senior austrian diplomat anton prohaska has been sent to bamako but he said that there were still questions about how the kidnappers had transported the austrians across hundreds of kilometres of desert , some of which are militarised , and it was possible that regional governments had facilitated the transfer of the hostages to neutral ground .
the austrian authorities say they are still not clear about exactly where the two tourists , who last contacted their relatives on 18 february , had disappeared .
once it was reported that they were being held in mali , they dispatched a team of emissaries to the capital , bamako , where there is no austrian embassy .
austria 's government has been seeking help as it tries to get to handle a complex case in unfamiliar terrain .
" we established contacts with governments , ngos , individuals , and people who are knowledgeable about the area , " said peter launsky-tieffenthal , a spokesman for the austrian foreign ministry .
" it 's really a major effort involving all sorts of parties in the region and beyond . "
there have been unconfirmed reports that saif al-islam gaddafi , son of the libyan leader muammar gaddafi , is one of those involved in negotiations .
targeting tourists last week there was also an outbreak of violence in northern mali as tuareg rebels , who are seeking more autonomy and a greater share of resources across the region , attacked a malian army convoy .
the austrians are thought to be in the remote desert of northern mali austrian authorities say they have no indication that the unrest has affected the kidnap case , but they are following the situation closely .
in one of their statements , the kidnappers warned western tourists not to visit tunisia and other north african countries , including morocco , algeria and mauritania .
a photograph released in conjunction with the statement shows a woman - said to be ms kloiber - wearing a blue headscarf with her face digitally obscured .
this may be because showing a woman 's face is prohibited under radical islamist beliefs .
the case is particularly worrying for tunisia , which has a thriving tourist industry .
apart from a suicide attack in 2002 on the island of djerba , the country has been largely successful in keeping a lid on islamic extremism .
austria has raised its travel warning for the south of tunisia , though the foreign ministry noted that most tourism is directed to the mediterranean coast in the north .
" tunisia has always been the safest country in the maghreb , " said mr daguzin .
" this shows that despite all their efforts to show that there is complete security , aqim is able to strike wherever it wants . "

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- sunset for korean sunshine policy ?
bbc news / asia-pacific graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 09:44 gmt , friday , 28 march 2008 sunset for korean sunshine policy ?
as north korea test-fires missiles and expels south korean officials , korea analyst aidan foster-carter asks whether a decade of co-operation between the two states has come to an end .
on thursday , before dawn , north korea summarily expelled 11 south korean government officials from the kaesong industrial complex .
the complex is just north of the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- between the two countries , and is a rare example of north-south co-operation .
technically the two countries are still at war , and for years they were at daggers drawn .
in 1968 , north korean commandos got within a mile of the presidential blue house in seoul , and in 1983 , agents from pyongyang tried to kill seoul 's then military dictator chun doo-hwan .
the koreas also occasionally tried peace .
but brief rapprochements in 1985 and 1990-92 , when a wide-ranging accord was signed but never implemented , did not last long .
new dawn ?
that all changed a decade ago .
the veteran dissident kim dae-jung , elected president in 1997 at his fourth attempt , adopted what he called a sunshine policy towards the north .
the image comes from a greek fable by aesop .
the sun bet the wind that warm sunshine was a better way to get a man to take off his heavy coat than blowing a howling gale .
in practice , this meant that the south gave rice , fertiliser and more to its northern neighbour , on a loss-leader basis , to build confidence without setting conditions or demanding immediate reciprocity .
kim dae-jung also allowed southern businesses , ngos and others to go north .
chung ju-yung , the redoubtable founder of south korea 's hyundai conglomerate , built a resort at mt kumgang on the east coast .
after a slow start , well over a million south koreans have visited .
tour buses now cross the dmz daily , and from this month you can even drive your own car into north korea .
the next president , roh moo-hyun , continued the sunshine approach .
like his predecessor , he went to pyongyang to meet the north 's leader kim jong-il - although strictly it was the turn of the " dear leader " to come to seoul .
that summit saw an agreement to expand business co-operation .
besides the kumgang and kaesong zones , there were ambitious plans for joint shipbuilding , mining , and repairing the north 's crumbling roads and railways .
tougher approach all that changed , though , on 19 december , when south korean voters overwhelmingly rejected a decade of centre-left rule and chose a conservative , lee myung-bak , as president . "
the trouble is , as mr lee will find , neither sticks nor carrots work with north korea " though mainly fought on domestic issues , the election showed that there was growing disillusion with sunshine .
despite a decade of aid , north korea had opened a little - but hardly softened .
pyongyang still flatly denies holding any south koreans , even though seoul knows it has at least 1,000 - mostly old prisoners of war and fishermen abducted since 1953 .
above all , north korea 's nuclear test in 2006 was a slap in the face for seoul .
critics say that southern no-strings aid , some in cash , helped kim jong-il build his nuclear arsenal .
lee myung-bak has vowed to change that .
humanitarian aid is to continue , but deeper ties will depend on the north giving up its nuclear weapons .
six-party talks have been stalled for three months , since pyongyang missed a year-end deadline to declare all its nuclear activities .
the new unification minister , kim ha-joong , recently said that kaesong would not be expanded unless the nuclear issue was resolved .
that prompted the north 's latest move to expel the centre 's managers .
the two koreas 1910 : korean peninsula colonised by japan 1945 : divided into us-backed south and soviet-backed north 1950-1953 : korean war , no peace deal signed 1987 : north korea bombs a south airliner , killing 115 1990s : south korea introduces conciliatory sunshine policy 2000 : kim jong-il and kim dae-jung hold first leaders ' summit 2007 : kim jong-il and roh moo-hyun hold second leaders ' summit history of the korean war pyongyang will also be angry if , as expected , the south votes for a un resolution criticising its dire human rights abuses .
in recent years , seoul has drawn flak for abstaining on this issue .
in fact , critics say sunshine has not helped oppressed north koreans , but rather bolstered the regime which oppressed them .
stick or carrot ?
until now the media in north korea , which normally castigates southern conservatives as traitors and pro-us flunkeys , had been silent on lee myung-bak - unsure what to make of his rather mixed signals .
no old-style cold warrior , mr lee has floated plans to invest in the north and raise it out of poverty - if , and only if , the dear leader gives up his nukes .
the kaesong expulsions are thus a shot across mr lee 's bows - and carefully calibrated .
only the south 's bureaucrats have been kicked out .
otherwise it is business as usual at kaesong , for now .
both sides need the money , though the north 's need is far greater .
if seoul also raises the north 's human rights abuses , pyongyang will retaliate further .
mr lee has already suggested linking aid to the return of its abductees .
japan , which has far fewer kidnap victims , has put this top of its agenda and imposed sanctions on north korea .
the trouble is , as mr lee will find , neither sticks nor carrots work with north korea .
if giving handouts merely made kim jong-il greedy and arrogant , conversely there is no evidence that pressure or painting him into a corner works any better .
indeed , some fear that a cornered rat is more likely to lash out in desperation .
on the nuclear issue and more widely , it is pyongyang that has painted itself into a corner .
but even southern conservatives fear the chaos that would follow regime collapse .
as south korea 's new president is learning , tough talk on the north is easy - but finding a workable balance between carrot and stick is far harder .
he himself is not that interested in the north - he had planned to close the unification ministry , folding it into the foreign ministry - and one wonders if he will just leave north korea to stew in its own noxious juice .
if he does , it is ordinary north koreans who will suffer .
with floods causing a poor harvest last year , endemic malnutrition could tip over into renewed famine .
yet a proud pyongyang had not yet asked the south for the usual fertiliser and rice aid .
presumably it now has no plan to - for fertiliser the season is already almost too late .
unconscionable as north korea 's behaviour is , a return to the old inter-korean hostility hardly seems progress .
sunshine , however flawed , prised the northern door a little ajar .

as north korea test-fires missiles and expels south korean officials , korea analyst aidan foster-carter asks whether a decade of co-operation between the two states has come to an end .
the kaesong industrial park employs 23,000 north koreans on thursday , before dawn , north korea summarily expelled 11 south korean government officials from the kaesong industrial complex .
the complex is just north of the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- between the two countries , and is a rare example of north-south co-operation .
technically the two countries are still at war , and for years they were at daggers drawn .
in 1968 , north korean commandos got within a mile of the presidential blue house in seoul , and in 1983 , agents from pyongyang tried to kill seoul 's then military dictator chun doo-hwan .
the koreas also occasionally tried peace .
but brief rapprochements in 1985 and 1990-92 , when a wide-ranging accord was signed but never implemented , did not last long .
new dawn ?
that all changed a decade ago .
the veteran dissident kim dae-jung , elected president in 1997 at his fourth attempt , adopted what he called a sunshine policy towards the north .
the image comes from a greek fable by aesop .
the sun bet the wind that warm sunshine was a better way to get a man to take off his heavy coat than blowing a howling gale .
in practice , this meant that the south gave rice , fertiliser and more to its northern neighbour , on a loss-leader basis , to build confidence without setting conditions or demanding immediate reciprocity .
lee myung-bak is taking a different line from his predecessors kim dae-jung also allowed southern businesses , ngos and others to go north .
chung ju-yung , the redoubtable founder of south korea 's hyundai conglomerate , built a resort at mt kumgang on the east coast .
after a slow start , well over a million south koreans have visited .
tour buses now cross the dmz daily , and from this month you can even drive your own car into north korea .
the next president , roh moo-hyun , continued the sunshine approach .
like his predecessor , he went to pyongyang to meet the north 's leader kim jong-il - although strictly it was the turn of the " dear leader " to come to seoul .
that summit saw an agreement to expand business co-operation .
besides the kumgang and kaesong zones , there were ambitious plans for joint shipbuilding , mining , and repairing the north 's crumbling roads and railways .
tougher approach all that changed , though , on 19 december , when south korean voters overwhelmingly rejected a decade of centre-left rule and chose a conservative , lee myung-bak , as president .
the trouble is , as mr lee will find , neither sticks nor carrots work with north korea though mainly fought on domestic issues , the election showed that there was growing disillusion with sunshine .
despite a decade of aid , north korea had opened a little - but hardly softened .
pyongyang still flatly denies holding any south koreans , even though seoul knows it has at least 1,000 - mostly old prisoners of war and fishermen abducted since 1953 .
above all , north korea 's nuclear test in 2006 was a slap in the face for seoul .
critics say that southern no-strings aid , some in cash , helped kim jong-il build his nuclear arsenal .
lee myung-bak has vowed to change that .
humanitarian aid is to continue , but deeper ties will depend on the north giving up its nuclear weapons .
six-party talks have been stalled for three months , since pyongyang missed a year-end deadline to declare all its nuclear activities .
the new unification minister , kim ha-joong , recently said that kaesong would not be expanded unless the nuclear issue was resolved .
that prompted the north 's latest move to expel the centre 's managers .
the two koreas 1910 : korean peninsula colonised by japan 1945 : divided into us-backed south and soviet-backed north 1950-1953 : korean war , no peace deal signed 1987 : north korea bombs a south airliner , killing 115 1990s : south korea introduces conciliatory sunshine policy 2000 : kim jong-il and kim dae-jung hold first leaders ' summit 2007 : kim jong-il and roh moo-hyun hold second leaders ' summit history of the korean war pyongyang will also be angry if , as expected , the south votes for a un resolution criticising its dire human rights abuses .
in recent years , seoul has drawn flak for abstaining on this issue .
in fact , critics say sunshine has not helped oppressed north koreans , but rather bolstered the regime which oppressed them .
stick or carrot ?
until now the media in north korea , which normally castigates southern conservatives as traitors and pro-us flunkeys , had been silent on lee myung-bak - unsure what to make of his rather mixed signals .
no old-style cold warrior , mr lee has floated plans to invest in the north and raise it out of poverty - if , and only if , the dear leader gives up his nukes .
the kaesong expulsions are thus a shot across mr lee 's bows - and carefully calibrated .
only the south 's bureaucrats have been kicked out .
otherwise it is business as usual at kaesong , for now .
both sides need the money , though the north 's need is far greater .
if seoul also raises the north 's human rights abuses , pyongyang will retaliate further .
mr lee has already suggested linking aid to the return of its abductees .
japan , which has far fewer kidnap victims , has put this top of its agenda and imposed sanctions on north korea .
the trouble is , as mr lee will find , neither sticks nor carrots work with north korea .
if giving handouts merely made kim jong-il greedy and arrogant , conversely there is no evidence that pressure or painting him into a corner works any better .
indeed , some fear that a cornered rat is more likely to lash out in desperation .
on the nuclear issue and more widely , it is pyongyang that has painted itself into a corner .
but even southern conservatives fear the chaos that would follow regime collapse .
as south korea 's new president is learning , tough talk on the north is easy - but finding a workable balance between carrot and stick is far harder .
he himself is not that interested in the north - he had planned to close the unification ministry , folding it into the foreign ministry - and one wonders if he will just leave north korea to stew in its own noxious juice .
if he does , it is ordinary north koreans who will suffer .
with floods causing a poor harvest last year , endemic malnutrition could tip over into renewed famine .
yet a proud pyongyang had not yet asked the south for the usual fertiliser and rice aid .
presumably it now has no plan to - for fertiliser the season is already almost too late .
unconscionable as north korea 's behaviour is , a return to the old inter-korean hostility hardly seems progress .
sunshine , however flawed , prised the northern door a little ajar .
its asymmetries are easy to criticise .
but does lee myung-bak have a better plan ?

lee myung-bak is taking a different line from his predecessors kim dae-jung also allowed southern businesses , ngos and others to go north .
chung ju-yung , the redoubtable founder of south korea 's hyundai conglomerate , built a resort at mt kumgang on the east coast .
after a slow start , well over a million south koreans have visited .
tour buses now cross the dmz daily , and from this month you can even drive your own car into north korea .
the next president , roh moo-hyun , continued the sunshine approach .
like his predecessor , he went to pyongyang to meet the north 's leader kim jong-il - although strictly it was the turn of the " dear leader " to come to seoul .
that summit saw an agreement to expand business co-operation .
besides the kumgang and kaesong zones , there were ambitious plans for joint shipbuilding , mining , and repairing the north 's crumbling roads and railways .
tougher approach all that changed , though , on 19 december , when south korean voters overwhelmingly rejected a decade of centre-left rule and chose a conservative , lee myung-bak , as president .
the trouble is , as mr lee will find , neither sticks nor carrots work with north korea though mainly fought on domestic issues , the election showed that there was growing disillusion with sunshine .
despite a decade of aid , north korea had opened a little - but hardly softened .
pyongyang still flatly denies holding any south koreans , even though seoul knows it has at least 1,000 - mostly old prisoners of war and fishermen abducted since 1953 .
above all , north korea 's nuclear test in 2006 was a slap in the face for seoul .
critics say that southern no-strings aid , some in cash , helped kim jong-il build his nuclear arsenal .
lee myung-bak has vowed to change that .
humanitarian aid is to continue , but deeper ties will depend on the north giving up its nuclear weapons .
six-party talks have been stalled for three months , since pyongyang missed a year-end deadline to declare all its nuclear activities .
the new unification minister , kim ha-joong , recently said that kaesong would not be expanded unless the nuclear issue was resolved .
that prompted the north 's latest move to expel the centre 's managers .
the two koreas 1910 : korean peninsula colonised by japan 1945 : divided into us-backed south and soviet-backed north 1950-1953 : korean war , no peace deal signed 1987 : north korea bombs a south airliner , killing 115 1990s : south korea introduces conciliatory sunshine policy 2000 : kim jong-il and kim dae-jung hold first leaders ' summit 2007 : kim jong-il and roh moo-hyun hold second leaders ' summit history of the korean war pyongyang will also be angry if , as expected , the south votes for a un resolution criticising its dire human rights abuses .
in recent years , seoul has drawn flak for abstaining on this issue .
in fact , critics say sunshine has not helped oppressed north koreans , but rather bolstered the regime which oppressed them .
stick or carrot ?
until now the media in north korea , which normally castigates southern conservatives as traitors and pro-us flunkeys , had been silent on lee myung-bak - unsure what to make of his rather mixed signals .
no old-style cold warrior , mr lee has floated plans to invest in the north and raise it out of poverty - if , and only if , the dear leader gives up his nukes .
the kaesong expulsions are thus a shot across mr lee 's bows - and carefully calibrated .
only the south 's bureaucrats have been kicked out .
otherwise it is business as usual at kaesong , for now .
both sides need the money , though the north 's need is far greater .
if seoul also raises the north 's human rights abuses , pyongyang will retaliate further .
mr lee has already suggested linking aid to the return of its abductees .
japan , which has far fewer kidnap victims , has put this top of its agenda and imposed sanctions on north korea .
the trouble is , as mr lee will find , neither sticks nor carrots work with north korea .
if giving handouts merely made kim jong-il greedy and arrogant , conversely there is no evidence that pressure or painting him into a corner works any better .
indeed , some fear that a cornered rat is more likely to lash out in desperation .
on the nuclear issue and more widely , it is pyongyang that has painted itself into a corner .
but even southern conservatives fear the chaos that would follow regime collapse .
as south korea 's new president is learning , tough talk on the north is easy - but finding a workable balance between carrot and stick is far harder .
he himself is not that interested in the north - he had planned to close the unification ministry , folding it into the foreign ministry - and one wonders if he will just leave north korea to stew in its own noxious juice .
if he does , it is ordinary north koreans who will suffer .
with floods causing a poor harvest last year , endemic malnutrition could tip over into renewed famine .
yet a proud pyongyang had not yet asked the south for the usual fertiliser and rice aid .
presumably it now has no plan to - for fertiliser the season is already almost too late .
unconscionable as north korea 's behaviour is , a return to the old inter-korean hostility hardly seems progress .
sunshine , however flawed , prised the northern door a little ajar .
its asymmetries are easy to criticise .
but does lee myung-bak have a better plan ?

as north korea test-fires missiles and expels south korean officials , korea analyst aidan foster-carter asks whether a decade of co-operation between the two states has come to an end .
the kaesong industrial park employs 23,000 north koreans on thursday , before dawn , north korea summarily expelled 11 south korean government officials from the kaesong industrial complex .
the complex is just north of the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- between the two countries , and is a rare example of north-south co-operation .
technically the two countries are still at war , and for years they were at daggers drawn .
in 1968 , north korean commandos got within a mile of the presidential blue house in seoul , and in 1983 , agents from pyongyang tried to kill seoul 's then military dictator chun doo-hwan .
the koreas also occasionally tried peace .
but brief rapprochements in 1985 and 1990-92 , when a wide-ranging accord was signed but never implemented , did not last long .
new dawn ?
that all changed a decade ago .
the veteran dissident kim dae-jung , elected president in 1997 at his fourth attempt , adopted what he called a sunshine policy towards the north .
the image comes from a greek fable by aesop .
the sun bet the wind that warm sunshine was a better way to get a man to take off his heavy coat than blowing a howling gale .

the mortgage lender said prices fell by 0.6 % in march , cutting the annual rate of increase to 1.1 % - its lowest rate since march 1996 .
after five months of price falls , it said prices would continue to drop .
this marked a shift from its previous prediction that there would be no overall change by the end of this year .
the nationwide survey said the average uk house price had fallen slightly to £ 179,110 .
the three-month on three-month price change - which is considered a better indication of the underlying strength of the market - showed a fall of 1.5 % ' more downbeat ' nationwide chief economist fionnuala earley admitted that the building society had reassessed its forecast of no change in prices by the end of the year , now predicting a fall in prices .
" the outlook for uk house prices is clearly more downbeat than at the time of our november forecast , " she said .
" a moderate fall in prices at this stage should not be unwelcome and should help to ensure greater stability in the market going forward . "
despite the slowdown , prices are still 11 % higher than two years ago and 47 % higher than five years ago , the nationwide said .
" a clear change in sentiment since the late summer has led to the sharp slowing in house price growth , prices are now 1.5 % lower than three months ago , " said ms earley .
" expectations of higher house prices will have undoubtedly encouraged some speculative demand in the housing market over the years .
" but with lower house price growth expected now and in the future , the effect will work the other way , causing at least some of this demand to fall away , " she added .
higher interest rates on thursday , the building society announced that it was raising its interest rates on all its fixed-rate and tracker deals . "
the mpc will bring forward its rate cut to april " fionnuala earley , nationwide chief economist these types of loans currently account for 90 % of all new mortgages being taken out by uk homebuyers .
the society said it was putting up the cost of its loans because it was having to pay more to borrow the money from other lenders in the financial markets .
the interest rate at which banks lend to each other , known as libor , has risen by half a percentage point since the last week of january .
slowdown the uk housing market now looks as if it will go through its biggest slowdown since the early 1990s .
alongside a growing expectation among buyers and sellers that prices will fall , many lenders are finding it hard to raise the money necessary to fund their mortgage operations .
despite recent cuts in interest rates by the bank of england , the cost of paying for a new mortgage - and in some cases an existing one - has risen .
most lenders are now demanding larger deposits , while some deals , such as those offered by the nationwide , are now being charged at a higher interest rate than before .
ms earley predicted that the bank of england would cut interest rates again soon .
" the collapse of bear stearns and the fallout from false rumours of problems in a major uk bank may have helped to shift the focus of the monetary policy committee -lrb- mpc -rrb- to the need to loosen conditions in the financial markets , " she said .
" we think these latest developments , along with the continued weakening in the housing market , will mean that the mpc will bring forward its rate cut to april , " she added .
