the future of kosovo and its independence is also linked to the vote . voting has ended sunday in a tense presidential election run-off pitting the pro-european incumbent boris tadic against the nationalist challenger , tomislav nikolic . serbs turned out at a record pace , reflecting the referendum-like mood - though the president has mostly ceremonial duties , the outcome would signal which way voters want their country steered . nearly 63 per cent of the 6.7 million registered voters had cast their ballots with one hour remaining , the private election- monitoring agency cesid said . the final showing is to overshoot by a wide margin the 61 per cent from the first round two weeks ago . four years ago , after a series of attempts at electing a president failed owing to voter apathy , serbia was forced to scrap a legal minimum turnout requirement of 50 per cent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic urged serbia to remain on course for the eu that time , in june 2004 , tadic defeated nikolic in the run-off 53 to 47 per cent on a lowly 47 per cent turnout .
but this time the stakes are higher as serbia has been wavering on its european path . in this year 's contest , nikolic won 40 per cent to tadic 's 35.5 per cent of the votes in the first round on january 20 , but polls conducted between the two votes gave tadic a razor-thin edge of less than 1 per cent . serbia must stay the eu course , says tadic tadic says that belgrade must remain on course to join the eu even if leading western nations back the looming secession of serbia 's province kosovo .
" serbia is without doubt on its way to full membership of the eu , " he said after casting his ballot sunday . tadic 's opponent nikolic leads the opposition serbian radical party , the largest force in parliament and a key part of the former regime of slobodan milosevic . he says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west if it recognizes an independent and would instead seek closer ties with powers such as russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic said serbia was much closer to russia serbia is " much closer to russia , to a partner that does not impose conditions and can enable our development , " nikolic said after voting in belgrade .
the 6.7 million registered voters had to choose between the pro-european incumbent boris tadic and the ultra-nationalist tomislav nikolic .
tadic , who says that serbia must remain on its eu-course regardless of western support of kosovo 's secession , heads the democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , the senior partner in the cabinet coalition with prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia .
nikolic leads the opposition serbian radicals -lrb- srs -rrb- , the strongest single party in the country , which was a key part of slobodan milosevic 's regime until it was toppled in 2000 .
nikolic says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west over kosovo .
the difference in the run-off is however expected to be dramatically slight - some reports said that it could be less than 1 per cent and that the election may be decided by as few as 20,000 votes .
a referendum on east or west though the office of the president in serbia carries little real authority , the election carries a referendum-like quality because serbia has been wavering between east and west in its course .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has not had the support of his senior partner the conservative prime minister vojsilav kostunica has supported neither his senior coalition partner tadic , nor nikolic , with whom he shares a mistrust of the west .
kostunica , as nikolic , says that belgrade should stop its already stalled approach to european union membership because leading western countries support the secession of kosovo from serbia .
kosovo leaders , representing the 90-per-cent albanian majority , are expected to declare independence in the days or weeks after sunday 's vote in serbia .
with his once undisputed popularity now dramatically reduced , kostunica is likely to avoid early elections .
if tadic triumphs , the present coalition may continue as over the past year .
ds would however gain more credibility to steering serbia toward integration with eu , which stalled not only over kosovo , but also because serbia continues refusing to arrest wanted war crimes suspects .
fears a nikolic win would return serbia to isolation if nikolic wins , kostunica may try to drop tadic and the smallest partner in the existing coalition , the reformist g17 and replace them with nikolic and the srs , along with slobodan milosevic 's socialists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu serbs fear where nikolic may take them the pro-european camp in serbia has warned that nikolic 's win would effectively return serbia to isolation .
backing tadic and despite serbia 's failure to close the war crimes chapter , the eu has offered serbia a broad political and economic cooperation deal for signing on february 7 .
should nikolic win , however , the offer would " lose any meaning , " italian deputy foreign minister famiano crucianelli has said .
polling ends at 8 pm local time .
early results are normally expected within a few hours , but may this time be delayed if the score turns out to be as close as was anticipated . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" serbia is without doubt on its way to full membership of the eu , " he said after casting his ballot sunday . tadic 's opponent nikolic leads the opposition serbian radical party , the largest force in parliament and a key part of the former regime of slobodan milosevic . he says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west if it recognizes an independent and would instead seek closer ties with powers such as russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic said serbia was much closer to russia serbia is " much closer to russia , to a partner that does not impose conditions and can enable our development , " nikolic said after voting in belgrade .
the 6.7 million registered voters had to choose between the pro-european incumbent boris tadic and the ultra-nationalist tomislav nikolic .
tadic , who says that serbia must remain on its eu-course regardless of western support of kosovo 's secession , heads the democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , the senior partner in the cabinet coalition with prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia .
nikolic leads the opposition serbian radicals -lrb- srs -rrb- , the strongest single party in the country , which was a key part of slobodan milosevic 's regime until it was toppled in 2000 .
nikolic says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west over kosovo .
the difference in the run-off is however expected to be dramatically slight - some reports said that it could be less than 1 per cent and that the election may be decided by as few as 20,000 votes .
a referendum on east or west though the office of the president in serbia carries little real authority , the election carries a referendum-like quality because serbia has been wavering between east and west in its course .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has not had the support of his senior partner the conservative prime minister vojsilav kostunica has supported neither his senior coalition partner tadic , nor nikolic , with whom he shares a mistrust of the west .
kostunica , as nikolic , says that belgrade should stop its already stalled approach to european union membership because leading western countries support the secession of kosovo from serbia .
kosovo leaders , representing the 90-per-cent albanian majority , are expected to declare independence in the days or weeks after sunday 's vote in serbia .
with his once undisputed popularity now dramatically reduced , kostunica is likely to avoid early elections .
if tadic triumphs , the present coalition may continue as over the past year .
ds would however gain more credibility to steering serbia toward integration with eu , which stalled not only over kosovo , but also because serbia continues refusing to arrest wanted war crimes suspects .
fears a nikolic win would return serbia to isolation if nikolic wins , kostunica may try to drop tadic and the smallest partner in the existing coalition , the reformist g17 and replace them with nikolic and the srs , along with slobodan milosevic 's socialists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu serbs fear where nikolic may take them the pro-european camp in serbia has warned that nikolic 's win would effectively return serbia to isolation .
backing tadic and despite serbia 's failure to close the war crimes chapter , the eu has offered serbia a broad political and economic cooperation deal for signing on february 7 .
should nikolic win , however , the offer would " lose any meaning , " italian deputy foreign minister famiano crucianelli has said .

in europe 's largest science park , the experiment to merge science and industry is now taking off . located on the eastern outskirts of berlin , adlershof is a quick 20-minute train ride from the city center .
in gdr times adlershof was berlin 's celebrated socialist science mecca .
so when germany 's reunification threatened its further existence , the area embarked on an experiment : the creation of a science park , merging solar technology research with solar industry , in one winning equation . since 1993 , berlin has invested billions of euros in the area - billions the heavily indebted city does n't have .
but adlershof 's public relations manager , peter strunk said it was money well-invested in a bold vision , born of necessity . " this science park project was created to prevent us from social catastrophe after reunification , " strunk said .
" there were so many research facilities located here so instead of closing them down , a decision was made to create an integrated landscape of science and business , to re-establish those industrial structures that had to be dismantled . " a pioneering urban project the science park is embedded in adlershof 's overall urban planning concept , covering over four square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 square miles -rrb- .
its fresh urban landscape is still so new that it looks like a city whose virtual , graphic animation existence has simply been mounted onto the material world . adlershof is stream-lined and squeaky clean , with no mom and pop shops , quirky corners , or rough edges to add a bit of charm and irregularity to its neat , urban profile .
its main avenue is strewn with sleek , modern buildings of glass and steel housing scientific institutions and high tech companies . off the main strip are freshly-plowed streets named in honor of science icons , like albert einstein and max born .

klaus lips , the scientist leading thin-film solar cell reseach at the institute , was educated in marburg , germany , worked in colorado , but returned to germany when offered a position here . lips said adlershof is a solar scientist 's paradise , due to the close proximity of research and industry , and the unique , open dialogue and collaboration that exists between the two . " we work together with companies and establish network projects in which researchers , industry , and university students work together , " lips said , pointing out that the synergy of adlershof 's solar community especially benefits the upcoming generation of solar science researchers . " our young students have excellent job opportunities here , because upcoming companies are looking for trained people , " he added . success story the solar cell company sulfurcell 's founding in 2003 was based on research done on at the hahn-meitner institute .
the company started small , but now employs 100 engineers and factory operators to manufacture thin-film , cis solar cell modules and solar roof tiles . sulfurcell 's ceo nikolaus meyer is a scientist-turned-businessman , involved in the research that led to the company 's creation , and stands firmly behind his product . " cis stands for copper indium disulfide , a new semi-conductor that allows you to use a very thin , conductor layer on glass to produce electricity , " meyer said . sales of sulfurcell 's initial production have been so successful that plans are underway to erect a larger , more automated production plant this year .
meyer said he is confident he 'll be able to bring down the price of his product , to compete with the prices of conventionally produced power within the next five years . meyer said it would have been impossible to set-up and operate his company anywhere but adlershof .

in europe 's largest science park , the experiment to merge science and industry is now taking off . located on the eastern outskirts of berlin , adlershof is a quick 20-minute train ride from the city center .
in gdr times adlershof was berlin 's celebrated socialist science mecca .
so when germany 's reunification threatened its further existence , the area embarked on an experiment : the creation of a science park , merging solar technology research with solar industry , in one winning equation . since 1993 , berlin has invested billions of euros in the area - billions the heavily indebted city does n't have .
but adlershof 's public relations manager , peter strunk said it was money well-invested in a bold vision , born of necessity . " this science park project was created to prevent us from social catastrophe after reunification , " strunk said .
" there were so many research facilities located here so instead of closing them down , a decision was made to create an integrated landscape of science and business , to re-establish those industrial structures that had to be dismantled . " a pioneering urban project the science park is embedded in adlershof 's overall urban planning concept , covering over four square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 square miles -rrb- .
its fresh urban landscape is still so new that it looks like a city whose virtual , graphic animation existence has simply been mounted onto the material world . adlershof is stream-lined and squeaky clean , with no mom and pop shops , quirky corners , or rough edges to add a bit of charm and irregularity to its neat , urban profile .
its main avenue is strewn with sleek , modern buildings of glass and steel housing scientific institutions and high tech companies . off the main strip are freshly-plowed streets named in honor of science icons , like albert einstein and max born .
and there 's 66 hectares -lrb- 163 acres -rrb- of land still left undeveloped , waiting to be sold , or rented . staying on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is a main customer of german solar technology one research institute with a long tradition in adlershof is the hahn-meitner institute .
klaus lips , the scientist leading thin-film solar cell reseach at the institute , was educated in marburg , germany , worked in colorado , but returned to germany when offered a position here . lips said adlershof is a solar scientist 's paradise , due to the close proximity of research and industry , and the unique , open dialogue and collaboration that exists between the two . " we work together with companies and establish network projects in which researchers , industry , and university students work together , " lips said , pointing out that the synergy of adlershof 's solar community especially benefits the upcoming generation of solar science researchers . " our young students have excellent job opportunities here , because upcoming companies are looking for trained people , " he added . success story the solar cell company sulfurcell 's founding in 2003 was based on research done on at the hahn-meitner institute .
the company started small , but now employs 100 engineers and factory operators to manufacture thin-film , cis solar cell modules and solar roof tiles . sulfurcell 's ceo nikolaus meyer is a scientist-turned-businessman , involved in the research that led to the company 's creation , and stands firmly behind his product . " cis stands for copper indium disulfide , a new semi-conductor that allows you to use a very thin , conductor layer on glass to produce electricity , " meyer said . sales of sulfurcell 's initial production have been so successful that plans are underway to erect a larger , more automated production plant this year .
meyer said he is confident he 'll be able to bring down the price of his product , to compete with the prices of conventionally produced power within the next five years . meyer said it would have been impossible to set-up and operate his company anywhere but adlershof .
he said the constant support and input of the area 's research institutes are what keep his product state-of-the-art , and thereby competitive . slowly getting noticed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the world 's largest solar parks sits near leipzig , germany in the former east germany , the institute for silicon crystal research enjoyed close ties to the humboldt university 's science faculties nearby , and much of the institute 's current staff are humboldt graduates . recently the institute 's research growing silicon crystals layers directly onto glass panels caught the attention of the international energy company british petroleum , which is now financing their further research . this month , solon , germany 's largest solar cell company , also moved its extensive operations to adlershof .
a new start-up company named inventux is beginning operations there , and two major us solar power companies have shown recently interest in investing in the area . on a roll lips said he 's convinced that german advances in solar technology will enable the country to supply 25 percent of its electricity needs with solar power alone , within the next two decades . meyer from sulfurcell said he believes clean-tech and renewable energy will be germany 's major industries , in the future . " we have seen only the beginning of this industry , and that the technology developed in germany , is creating an excellent foundation for the future success of the industry , " he said . if adlershof 's solar industry continues to grow at its current rate , it has the chance to become the place to be for all significant solar technology players , and europe 's first solaropolis , in the years to come . leah mcdonnell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the future of kosovo and its independence is also linked to the vote . voting has ended sunday in a tense presidential election run-off pitting the pro-european incumbent boris tadic against the nationalist challenger , tomislav nikolic . serbs turned out at a record pace , reflecting the referendum-like mood - though the president has mostly ceremonial duties , the outcome would signal which way voters want their country steered . nearly 63 per cent of the 6.7 million registered voters had cast their ballots with one hour remaining , the private election- monitoring agency cesid said . the final showing is to overshoot by a wide margin the 61 per cent from the first round two weeks ago . four years ago , after a series of attempts at electing a president failed owing to voter apathy , serbia was forced to scrap a legal minimum turnout requirement of 50 per cent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic urged serbia to remain on course for the eu that time , in june 2004 , tadic defeated nikolic in the run-off 53 to 47 per cent on a lowly 47 per cent turnout .
but this time the stakes are higher as serbia has been wavering on its european path . in this year 's contest , nikolic won 40 per cent to tadic 's 35.5 per cent of the votes in the first round on january 20 , but polls conducted between the two votes gave tadic a razor-thin edge of less than 1 per cent . serbia must stay the eu course , says tadic tadic says that belgrade must remain on course to join the eu even if leading western nations back the looming secession of serbia 's province kosovo .
" serbia is without doubt on its way to full membership of the eu , " he said after casting his ballot sunday . tadic 's opponent nikolic leads the opposition serbian radical party , the largest force in parliament and a key part of the former regime of slobodan milosevic . he says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west if it recognizes an independent and would instead seek closer ties with powers such as russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic said serbia was much closer to russia serbia is " much closer to russia , to a partner that does not impose conditions and can enable our development , " nikolic said after voting in belgrade .
the 6.7 million registered voters had to choose between the pro-european incumbent boris tadic and the ultra-nationalist tomislav nikolic .
tadic , who says that serbia must remain on its eu-course regardless of western support of kosovo 's secession , heads the democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , the senior partner in the cabinet coalition with prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia .
nikolic leads the opposition serbian radicals -lrb- srs -rrb- , the strongest single party in the country , which was a key part of slobodan milosevic 's regime until it was toppled in 2000 .
nikolic says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west over kosovo .
the difference in the run-off is however expected to be dramatically slight - some reports said that it could be less than 1 per cent and that the election may be decided by as few as 20,000 votes .
a referendum on east or west though the office of the president in serbia carries little real authority , the election carries a referendum-like quality because serbia has been wavering between east and west in its course .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has not had the support of his senior partner the conservative prime minister vojsilav kostunica has supported neither his senior coalition partner tadic , nor nikolic , with whom he shares a mistrust of the west .
kostunica , as nikolic , says that belgrade should stop its already stalled approach to european union membership because leading western countries support the secession of kosovo from serbia .
kosovo leaders , representing the 90-per-cent albanian majority , are expected to declare independence in the days or weeks after sunday 's vote in serbia .
with his once undisputed popularity now dramatically reduced , kostunica is likely to avoid early elections .
if tadic triumphs , the present coalition may continue as over the past year .
ds would however gain more credibility to steering serbia toward integration with eu , which stalled not only over kosovo , but also because serbia continues refusing to arrest wanted war crimes suspects .
fears a nikolic win would return serbia to isolation if nikolic wins , kostunica may try to drop tadic and the smallest partner in the existing coalition , the reformist g17 and replace them with nikolic and the srs , along with slobodan milosevic 's socialists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu serbs fear where nikolic may take them the pro-european camp in serbia has warned that nikolic 's win would effectively return serbia to isolation .
backing tadic and despite serbia 's failure to close the war crimes chapter , the eu has offered serbia a broad political and economic cooperation deal for signing on february 7 .
should nikolic win , however , the offer would " lose any meaning , " italian deputy foreign minister famiano crucianelli has said .

a referendum on east or west though the office of the president in serbia carries little real authority , the election carries a referendum-like quality because serbia has been wavering between east and west in its course .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has not had the support of his senior partner the conservative prime minister vojsilav kostunica has supported neither his senior coalition partner tadic , nor nikolic , with whom he shares a mistrust of the west .
kostunica , as nikolic , says that belgrade should stop its already stalled approach to european union membership because leading western countries support the secession of kosovo from serbia .
kosovo leaders , representing the 90-per-cent albanian majority , are expected to declare independence in the days or weeks after sunday 's vote in serbia .
with his once undisputed popularity now dramatically reduced , kostunica is likely to avoid early elections .
if tadic triumphs , the present coalition may continue as over the past year .
ds would however gain more credibility to steering serbia toward integration with eu , which stalled not only over kosovo , but also because serbia continues refusing to arrest wanted war crimes suspects .
fears a nikolic win would return serbia to isolation if nikolic wins , kostunica may try to drop tadic and the smallest partner in the existing coalition , the reformist g17 and replace them with nikolic and the srs , along with slobodan milosevic 's socialists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu serbs fear where nikolic may take them the pro-european camp in serbia has warned that nikolic 's win would effectively return serbia to isolation .
backing tadic and despite serbia 's failure to close the war crimes chapter , the eu has offered serbia a broad political and economic cooperation deal for signing on february 7 .
should nikolic win , however , the offer would " lose any meaning , " italian deputy foreign minister famiano crucianelli has said .
polling ends at 8 pm local time .
early results are normally expected within a few hours , but may this time be delayed if the score turns out to be as close as was anticipated . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in europe 's largest science park , the experiment to merge science and industry is now taking off . located on the eastern outskirts of berlin , adlershof is a quick 20-minute train ride from the city center .
in gdr times adlershof was berlin 's celebrated socialist science mecca .
so when germany 's reunification threatened its further existence , the area embarked on an experiment : the creation of a science park , merging solar technology research with solar industry , in one winning equation . since 1993 , berlin has invested billions of euros in the area - billions the heavily indebted city does n't have .
but adlershof 's public relations manager , peter strunk said it was money well-invested in a bold vision , born of necessity . " this science park project was created to prevent us from social catastrophe after reunification , " strunk said .
" there were so many research facilities located here so instead of closing them down , a decision was made to create an integrated landscape of science and business , to re-establish those industrial structures that had to be dismantled . " a pioneering urban project the science park is embedded in adlershof 's overall urban planning concept , covering over four square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 square miles -rrb- .
its fresh urban landscape is still so new that it looks like a city whose virtual , graphic animation existence has simply been mounted onto the material world . adlershof is stream-lined and squeaky clean , with no mom and pop shops , quirky corners , or rough edges to add a bit of charm and irregularity to its neat , urban profile .
its main avenue is strewn with sleek , modern buildings of glass and steel housing scientific institutions and high tech companies . off the main strip are freshly-plowed streets named in honor of science icons , like albert einstein and max born .
and there 's 66 hectares -lrb- 163 acres -rrb- of land still left undeveloped , waiting to be sold , or rented . staying on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is a main customer of german solar technology one research institute with a long tradition in adlershof is the hahn-meitner institute .
klaus lips , the scientist leading thin-film solar cell reseach at the institute , was educated in marburg , germany , worked in colorado , but returned to germany when offered a position here . lips said adlershof is a solar scientist 's paradise , due to the close proximity of research and industry , and the unique , open dialogue and collaboration that exists between the two . " we work together with companies and establish network projects in which researchers , industry , and university students work together , " lips said , pointing out that the synergy of adlershof 's solar community especially benefits the upcoming generation of solar science researchers . " our young students have excellent job opportunities here , because upcoming companies are looking for trained people , " he added . success story the solar cell company sulfurcell 's founding in 2003 was based on research done on at the hahn-meitner institute .
the company started small , but now employs 100 engineers and factory operators to manufacture thin-film , cis solar cell modules and solar roof tiles . sulfurcell 's ceo nikolaus meyer is a scientist-turned-businessman , involved in the research that led to the company 's creation , and stands firmly behind his product . " cis stands for copper indium disulfide , a new semi-conductor that allows you to use a very thin , conductor layer on glass to produce electricity , " meyer said . sales of sulfurcell 's initial production have been so successful that plans are underway to erect a larger , more automated production plant this year .
meyer said he is confident he 'll be able to bring down the price of his product , to compete with the prices of conventionally produced power within the next five years . meyer said it would have been impossible to set-up and operate his company anywhere but adlershof .
he said the constant support and input of the area 's research institutes are what keep his product state-of-the-art , and thereby competitive . slowly getting noticed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the world 's largest solar parks sits near leipzig , germany in the former east germany , the institute for silicon crystal research enjoyed close ties to the humboldt university 's science faculties nearby , and much of the institute 's current staff are humboldt graduates . recently the institute 's research growing silicon crystals layers directly onto glass panels caught the attention of the international energy company british petroleum , which is now financing their further research . this month , solon , germany 's largest solar cell company , also moved its extensive operations to adlershof .
a new start-up company named inventux is beginning operations there , and two major us solar power companies have shown recently interest in investing in the area . on a roll lips said he 's convinced that german advances in solar technology will enable the country to supply 25 percent of its electricity needs with solar power alone , within the next two decades . meyer from sulfurcell said he believes clean-tech and renewable energy will be germany 's major industries , in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 03.02.2008 cinema is always political , says star director costa-gavras großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costa-gavras ' next movie will be filmed in greece , his country of birth all movies are political , film director costa-gavras told dw ahead of the berlin film festival .
politics is power and power makes the world go round - and is the focus of his own films , he said . constantin gavras , better known as costa-gavras , has been named president of the jury at this year 's berlin film festival , which runs from feb .
7-17 .
born in greece in 1933 , his career as a film director took off with the 1969 movie " z. " dw-tv : costa-gavras , of course you will be watching a lot of films during the festival , but can you tell us what else your job as a jury president entails ? costa-gavras : i watch the movies , i 'll discuss with the jury and we 'll try to award the best movie , that 's all .
i 'm trying to be there as a " viewer , " not as a technician or someone who knows the cinema , which is not so easy , of course .
i try to be like any viewer - to be free of any ideological or aesthetical ideas .
the best movie has to get the award . the berlin film festival sees itself more as a political festival in that it gives political cinema a lot of attention .
does that correspond with your general idea of film-making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 58th berlin film festival opens on feb .
7 i think all festivals are political festivals in a way .
the berlin film festival is a bit more so , because they go and set a direction , which i think the cinema needs .
the general idea is that festivals should promote movies with a social content , not only movies which are just entertainment .
if you go back to the history of cinema , the most important movies have been more social-political . your films were once hailed as liberation from hollywood 's dictatorship .
but where does political cinema stand today ? it depends on the money .
right now , it sometimes depends on the united states .
it depends on the stars .
in the last three or four years we have seen very distinct movies about the problems in iraq and the oil problems because the big stars decided to do it .
the major companies did n't want to do it , but they felt obliged to make these movies because they wanted to please the stars - pleasing the stars means they can work together with them again and again . that 's a very new thing for cinema .
before , it was the directors or even the political situation around the world that used to push the companies and the producers to produce movies with strong political content . so , one can say that there is more political cinema in hollywood ... there is more in hollywood at the moment and i think in europe , too , because there are more and more big problems .
i think there is a kind of movement .
but personally i believe that all movies are political .
even the action movies .
they have a kind of social effect on the young public and the public in general .
that 's also political . what can cinema achieve now in a world where we are witnessing an increase of violence and a growing lack of political awareness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress diane kruger joins costa-gavras in the jury i think the cinema has to bring emotions to the public and speak rightly about the problems and then the audience can decide what to do .
the audience must be free and independent .
i do n't believe the cinema should impose ideas they do n't like .
i think the cinema is entertainment but it 's necessary to have some content too . does political cinema rule out entertainment and humor , or can they work together ? absolutely .
look at moliere , for example .
both work together .
in shakespeare you find the same things , or if you go through brecht , for example .
all the important theater has done that , and you can say the same thing about the cinema .
all the big directors - fritz lang , renoir , john ford , kazan , all of them - their movies have both and it works . in your films you have investigated the mechanisms of power during dictatorships and other times of suppression , like the holocaust for instance .
which issues interest you most today ? in our society , the most important issue is power - who has the power to do good or bad things .
i think all of us have power .
we have power over some people under us and other people have power over us because they are stronger than we are .
this pyramid of power - that 's politics .
take a big company like nokia , for example .
when they leave the country and leave thousands of people on the streets without jobs - that 's power .
this is the main issue in our society : the power we have and how we use it . so , power is your main issue . it 's the only issue , in my opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " amen " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- is one of costa-gavras ' films that looks at the role of power coming back to the berlin film festival , your job as jury president will start on feb .
7 .
what are you most looking forward to ? you know , when i go to the cinema i sit and i say , now make me happy , make me furious , make me laugh , make me cry .
those feelings are the best moments in a movie . after the festival , you are going to shoot your next movie .
can you tell us what " eden is west " is about ? it 's very difficult to explain a movie in a few seconds .
it 's a movie about today ; it 's a road-movie .
it 's about a young man who likes to go to parties because he thinks the western world is paradise and he discovers that it 's not much of a paradise . your birthday is during the festival , on feb .
13 .
will you celebrate ?
what 's your birthday wish ? you know , i think , after a certain age , it 's not necessary to celebrate the age or the birthdays .
but it 's there , so what can i do ? so you have no plans and no wishes ? yes , one wish : not to celebrate . okay , but maybe you will see a good movie on that day . that would be a good celebration - a good present . interview : hans christoph von bock -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in gdr times adlershof was berlin 's celebrated socialist science mecca .
so when germany 's reunification threatened its further existence , the area embarked on an experiment : the creation of a science park , merging solar technology research with solar industry , in one winning equation . since 1993 , berlin has invested billions of euros in the area - billions the heavily indebted city does n't have .
but adlershof 's public relations manager , peter strunk said it was money well-invested in a bold vision , born of necessity . " this science park project was created to prevent us from social catastrophe after reunification , " strunk said .
" there were so many research facilities located here so instead of closing them down , a decision was made to create an integrated landscape of science and business , to re-establish those industrial structures that had to be dismantled . " a pioneering urban project the science park is embedded in adlershof 's overall urban planning concept , covering over four square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 square miles -rrb- .
its fresh urban landscape is still so new that it looks like a city whose virtual , graphic animation existence has simply been mounted onto the material world . adlershof is stream-lined and squeaky clean , with no mom and pop shops , quirky corners , or rough edges to add a bit of charm and irregularity to its neat , urban profile .
its main avenue is strewn with sleek , modern buildings of glass and steel housing scientific institutions and high tech companies . off the main strip are freshly-plowed streets named in honor of science icons , like albert einstein and max born .
and there 's 66 hectares -lrb- 163 acres -rrb- of land still left undeveloped , waiting to be sold , or rented . staying on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is a main customer of german solar technology one research institute with a long tradition in adlershof is the hahn-meitner institute .
klaus lips , the scientist leading thin-film solar cell reseach at the institute , was educated in marburg , germany , worked in colorado , but returned to germany when offered a position here . lips said adlershof is a solar scientist 's paradise , due to the close proximity of research and industry , and the unique , open dialogue and collaboration that exists between the two . " we work together with companies and establish network projects in which researchers , industry , and university students work together , " lips said , pointing out that the synergy of adlershof 's solar community especially benefits the upcoming generation of solar science researchers . " our young students have excellent job opportunities here , because upcoming companies are looking for trained people , " he added . success story the solar cell company sulfurcell 's founding in 2003 was based on research done on at the hahn-meitner institute .
the company started small , but now employs 100 engineers and factory operators to manufacture thin-film , cis solar cell modules and solar roof tiles . sulfurcell 's ceo nikolaus meyer is a scientist-turned-businessman , involved in the research that led to the company 's creation , and stands firmly behind his product . " cis stands for copper indium disulfide , a new semi-conductor that allows you to use a very thin , conductor layer on glass to produce electricity , " meyer said . sales of sulfurcell 's initial production have been so successful that plans are underway to erect a larger , more automated production plant this year .
meyer said he is confident he 'll be able to bring down the price of his product , to compete with the prices of conventionally produced power within the next five years . meyer said it would have been impossible to set-up and operate his company anywhere but adlershof .
he said the constant support and input of the area 's research institutes are what keep his product state-of-the-art , and thereby competitive . slowly getting noticed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the world 's largest solar parks sits near leipzig , germany in the former east germany , the institute for silicon crystal research enjoyed close ties to the humboldt university 's science faculties nearby , and much of the institute 's current staff are humboldt graduates . recently the institute 's research growing silicon crystals layers directly onto glass panels caught the attention of the international energy company british petroleum , which is now financing their further research . this month , solon , germany 's largest solar cell company , also moved its extensive operations to adlershof .
a new start-up company named inventux is beginning operations there , and two major us solar power companies have shown recently interest in investing in the area . on a roll lips said he 's convinced that german advances in solar technology will enable the country to supply 25 percent of its electricity needs with solar power alone , within the next two decades . meyer from sulfurcell said he believes clean-tech and renewable energy will be germany 's major industries , in the future . " we have seen only the beginning of this industry , and that the technology developed in germany , is creating an excellent foundation for the future success of the industry , " he said . if adlershof 's solar industry continues to grow at its current rate , it has the chance to become the place to be for all significant solar technology players , and europe 's first solaropolis , in the years to come . leah mcdonnell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's currently the " fifth season " in cologne , and the usual rules are suspended .
this year , that means revelers can flout germany 's smoking ban . as the cologne carnival enters its most manic phase with women 's carnival day on thursday , germany 's new restrictions on smoking in bars and restaurants will be temporarily relaxed .
after all , given the general mayhem set to prevail in the city for the next few days , it would be a little incongruous to penalize partygoers hitting the streets of cologne for their annual carnival-season pub crawl ahead of rose monday simply for smoking .
police have their work cut out for them , stopping fights , breath-alizing drunk drivers and trying to prevent male revelers relieving themselves against walls and in gutters .
compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carnival is a chance to do exactly what you want it 's a compromise wholly in keeping with the carnival spirit - which is all about indulgence before abstinence .
historically , the date of rose monday is determined by the church calendar , taking place on the monday before ash wednesday , which in turn marks the beginning of lent leading up to good friday and easter .
so with the prospect of self-control looming , the carnival season is a semi-lawless time when everyone gets a chance to lose their inhibitions .
obviously , that means quite a few people are going to want to smoke .
moreover , a survey by north rhine-westphalia 's hospitality industry reveals that 80 percent of bar regulars in the state are smokers .
legal loophole as of jan .
1 , 2008 , the third of germans who smoke have been banned from doing so in the pubs and restaurants of most of the country 's 16 states , with the rest of the country to follow later this year .
pubs are now required to confine smokers to separate rooms , although the ban will not take effect in north rhine-westphalia , where cologne is located , until july 1 .
but crucially , the state legislature has decided that the ban on smoking in main rooms will never apply during traditional festivals .
drunk and disorderly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are too busy to enforce the rules it 's just as well .
every year , determined drinkers in fancy dress crowd through the city 's pubs and thick clouds of smoke are part of the experience the tipsy crowds often cheer at any mischief , and can turn hostile towards men in uniform , reports german news agency dpa .
while children enjoy watching the costume parades and the older generation might book a table at a variety show , the young crowd celebrates the six days of high carnival with all-night binges in the city 's many bars .
unenforceable " the enforceability of a smoking ban during carnival would have been just about zero , " hubert heller , proprietor of heller 's bierhaus , and two other leading cologne pubs told dpa .
heller said the police will concentrate during the six days on serious crime and he believes bylaws officers will postpone minor complaints until after the organized mayhem has finished . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politics is power and power makes the world go round - and is the focus of his own films , he said . constantin gavras , better known as costa-gavras , has been named president of the jury at this year 's berlin film festival , which runs from feb .
7-17 .
born in greece in 1933 , his career as a film director took off with the 1969 movie " z. " dw-tv : costa-gavras , of course you will be watching a lot of films during the festival , but can you tell us what else your job as a jury president entails ? costa-gavras : i watch the movies , i 'll discuss with the jury and we 'll try to award the best movie , that 's all .
i 'm trying to be there as a " viewer , " not as a technician or someone who knows the cinema , which is not so easy , of course .
i try to be like any viewer - to be free of any ideological or aesthetical ideas .
the best movie has to get the award . the berlin film festival sees itself more as a political festival in that it gives political cinema a lot of attention .
does that correspond with your general idea of film-making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 58th berlin film festival opens on feb .
7 i think all festivals are political festivals in a way .
the berlin film festival is a bit more so , because they go and set a direction , which i think the cinema needs .
the general idea is that festivals should promote movies with a social content , not only movies which are just entertainment .
if you go back to the history of cinema , the most important movies have been more social-political . your films were once hailed as liberation from hollywood 's dictatorship .
but where does political cinema stand today ? it depends on the money .
right now , it sometimes depends on the united states .
it depends on the stars .
in the last three or four years we have seen very distinct movies about the problems in iraq and the oil problems because the big stars decided to do it .
the major companies did n't want to do it , but they felt obliged to make these movies because they wanted to please the stars - pleasing the stars means they can work together with them again and again . that 's a very new thing for cinema .
before , it was the directors or even the political situation around the world that used to push the companies and the producers to produce movies with strong political content . so , one can say that there is more political cinema in hollywood ... there is more in hollywood at the moment and i think in europe , too , because there are more and more big problems .
i think there is a kind of movement .
but personally i believe that all movies are political .
even the action movies .
they have a kind of social effect on the young public and the public in general .
that 's also political . what can cinema achieve now in a world where we are witnessing an increase of violence and a growing lack of political awareness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress diane kruger joins costa-gavras in the jury i think the cinema has to bring emotions to the public and speak rightly about the problems and then the audience can decide what to do .
the audience must be free and independent .
i do n't believe the cinema should impose ideas they do n't like .
i think the cinema is entertainment but it 's necessary to have some content too . does political cinema rule out entertainment and humor , or can they work together ? absolutely .
look at moliere , for example .
both work together .
in shakespeare you find the same things , or if you go through brecht , for example .
all the important theater has done that , and you can say the same thing about the cinema .
all the big directors - fritz lang , renoir , john ford , kazan , all of them - their movies have both and it works . in your films you have investigated the mechanisms of power during dictatorships and other times of suppression , like the holocaust for instance .
which issues interest you most today ? in our society , the most important issue is power - who has the power to do good or bad things .
i think all of us have power .
we have power over some people under us and other people have power over us because they are stronger than we are .
this pyramid of power - that 's politics .
take a big company like nokia , for example .
when they leave the country and leave thousands of people on the streets without jobs - that 's power .
this is the main issue in our society : the power we have and how we use it . so , power is your main issue . it 's the only issue , in my opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " amen " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- is one of costa-gavras ' films that looks at the role of power coming back to the berlin film festival , your job as jury president will start on feb .
7 .
what are you most looking forward to ? you know , when i go to the cinema i sit and i say , now make me happy , make me furious , make me laugh , make me cry .
those feelings are the best moments in a movie . after the festival , you are going to shoot your next movie .
can you tell us what " eden is west " is about ? it 's very difficult to explain a movie in a few seconds .
it 's a movie about today ; it 's a road-movie .
it 's about a young man who likes to go to parties because he thinks the western world is paradise and he discovers that it 's not much of a paradise . your birthday is during the festival , on feb .
13 .
will you celebrate ?
what 's your birthday wish ? you know , i think , after a certain age , it 's not necessary to celebrate the age or the birthdays .
but it 's there , so what can i do ? so you have no plans and no wishes ? yes , one wish : not to celebrate . okay , but maybe you will see a good movie on that day . that would be a good celebration - a good present . interview : hans christoph von bock -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's currently the " fifth season " in cologne , and the usual rules are suspended .
this year , that means revelers can flout germany 's smoking ban . as the cologne carnival enters its most manic phase with women 's carnival day on thursday , germany 's new restrictions on smoking in bars and restaurants will be temporarily relaxed .
after all , given the general mayhem set to prevail in the city for the next few days , it would be a little incongruous to penalize partygoers hitting the streets of cologne for their annual carnival-season pub crawl ahead of rose monday simply for smoking .
police have their work cut out for them , stopping fights , breath-alizing drunk drivers and trying to prevent male revelers relieving themselves against walls and in gutters .
compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carnival is a chance to do exactly what you want it 's a compromise wholly in keeping with the carnival spirit - which is all about indulgence before abstinence .
historically , the date of rose monday is determined by the church calendar , taking place on the monday before ash wednesday , which in turn marks the beginning of lent leading up to good friday and easter .
so with the prospect of self-control looming , the carnival season is a semi-lawless time when everyone gets a chance to lose their inhibitions .
obviously , that means quite a few people are going to want to smoke .
moreover , a survey by north rhine-westphalia 's hospitality industry reveals that 80 percent of bar regulars in the state are smokers .
legal loophole as of jan .
1 , 2008 , the third of germans who smoke have been banned from doing so in the pubs and restaurants of most of the country 's 16 states , with the rest of the country to follow later this year .
pubs are now required to confine smokers to separate rooms , although the ban will not take effect in north rhine-westphalia , where cologne is located , until july 1 .
but crucially , the state legislature has decided that the ban on smoking in main rooms will never apply during traditional festivals .
drunk and disorderly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are too busy to enforce the rules it 's just as well .
every year , determined drinkers in fancy dress crowd through the city 's pubs and thick clouds of smoke are part of the experience the tipsy crowds often cheer at any mischief , and can turn hostile towards men in uniform , reports german news agency dpa .
while children enjoy watching the costume parades and the older generation might book a table at a variety show , the young crowd celebrates the six days of high carnival with all-night binges in the city 's many bars .
unenforceable " the enforceability of a smoking ban during carnival would have been just about zero , " hubert heller , proprietor of heller 's bierhaus , and two other leading cologne pubs told dpa .
heller said the police will concentrate during the six days on serious crime and he believes bylaws officers will postpone minor complaints until after the organized mayhem has finished . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politics is power and power makes the world go round - and is the focus of his own films , he said . constantin gavras , better known as costa-gavras , has been named president of the jury at this year 's berlin film festival , which runs from feb .
7-17 .
born in greece in 1933 , his career as a film director took off with the 1969 movie " z. " dw-tv : costa-gavras , of course you will be watching a lot of films during the festival , but can you tell us what else your job as a jury president entails ? costa-gavras : i watch the movies , i 'll discuss with the jury and we 'll try to award the best movie , that 's all .
i 'm trying to be there as a " viewer , " not as a technician or someone who knows the cinema , which is not so easy , of course .
i try to be like any viewer - to be free of any ideological or aesthetical ideas .
the best movie has to get the award . the berlin film festival sees itself more as a political festival in that it gives political cinema a lot of attention .
does that correspond with your general idea of film-making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 58th berlin film festival opens on feb .
7 i think all festivals are political festivals in a way .
the berlin film festival is a bit more so , because they go and set a direction , which i think the cinema needs .
the general idea is that festivals should promote movies with a social content , not only movies which are just entertainment .
if you go back to the history of cinema , the most important movies have been more social-political . your films were once hailed as liberation from hollywood 's dictatorship .
but where does political cinema stand today ? it depends on the money .
right now , it sometimes depends on the united states .
it depends on the stars .
in the last three or four years we have seen very distinct movies about the problems in iraq and the oil problems because the big stars decided to do it .
the major companies did n't want to do it , but they felt obliged to make these movies because they wanted to please the stars - pleasing the stars means they can work together with them again and again . that 's a very new thing for cinema .
before , it was the directors or even the political situation around the world that used to push the companies and the producers to produce movies with strong political content . so , one can say that there is more political cinema in hollywood ... there is more in hollywood at the moment and i think in europe , too , because there are more and more big problems .
i think there is a kind of movement .
but personally i believe that all movies are political .
even the action movies .
they have a kind of social effect on the young public and the public in general .
that 's also political . what can cinema achieve now in a world where we are witnessing an increase of violence and a growing lack of political awareness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress diane kruger joins costa-gavras in the jury i think the cinema has to bring emotions to the public and speak rightly about the problems and then the audience can decide what to do .
the audience must be free and independent .
i do n't believe the cinema should impose ideas they do n't like .
i think the cinema is entertainment but it 's necessary to have some content too . does political cinema rule out entertainment and humor , or can they work together ? absolutely .
look at moliere , for example .
both work together .
in shakespeare you find the same things , or if you go through brecht , for example .
all the important theater has done that , and you can say the same thing about the cinema .
all the big directors - fritz lang , renoir , john ford , kazan , all of them - their movies have both and it works . in your films you have investigated the mechanisms of power during dictatorships and other times of suppression , like the holocaust for instance .
which issues interest you most today ? in our society , the most important issue is power - who has the power to do good or bad things .
i think all of us have power .
we have power over some people under us and other people have power over us because they are stronger than we are .
this pyramid of power - that 's politics .
take a big company like nokia , for example .
when they leave the country and leave thousands of people on the streets without jobs - that 's power .
this is the main issue in our society : the power we have and how we use it . so , power is your main issue . it 's the only issue , in my opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " amen " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- is one of costa-gavras ' films that looks at the role of power coming back to the berlin film festival , your job as jury president will start on feb .
7 .
what are you most looking forward to ? you know , when i go to the cinema i sit and i say , now make me happy , make me furious , make me laugh , make me cry .
those feelings are the best moments in a movie . after the festival , you are going to shoot your next movie .
can you tell us what " eden is west " is about ? it 's very difficult to explain a movie in a few seconds .
it 's a movie about today ; it 's a road-movie .
it 's about a young man who likes to go to parties because he thinks the western world is paradise and he discovers that it 's not much of a paradise . your birthday is during the festival , on feb .
13 .
will you celebrate ?
what 's your birthday wish ? you know , i think , after a certain age , it 's not necessary to celebrate the age or the birthdays .
but it 's there , so what can i do ? so you have no plans and no wishes ? yes , one wish : not to celebrate . okay , but maybe you will see a good movie on that day . that would be a good celebration - a good present . interview : hans christoph von bock -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 03.02.2008 cinema is always political , says star director costa-gavras großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costa-gavras ' next movie will be filmed in greece , his country of birth all movies are political , film director costa-gavras told dw ahead of the berlin film festival .
politics is power and power makes the world go round - and is the focus of his own films , he said . constantin gavras , better known as costa-gavras , has been named president of the jury at this year 's berlin film festival , which runs from feb .
7-17 .
born in greece in 1933 , his career as a film director took off with the 1969 movie " z. " dw-tv : costa-gavras , of course you will be watching a lot of films during the festival , but can you tell us what else your job as a jury president entails ? costa-gavras : i watch the movies , i 'll discuss with the jury and we 'll try to award the best movie , that 's all .
i 'm trying to be there as a " viewer , " not as a technician or someone who knows the cinema , which is not so easy , of course .
i try to be like any viewer - to be free of any ideological or aesthetical ideas .
the best movie has to get the award . the berlin film festival sees itself more as a political festival in that it gives political cinema a lot of attention .
does that correspond with your general idea of film-making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 58th berlin film festival opens on feb .
7 i think all festivals are political festivals in a way .
the berlin film festival is a bit more so , because they go and set a direction , which i think the cinema needs .
the general idea is that festivals should promote movies with a social content , not only movies which are just entertainment .
if you go back to the history of cinema , the most important movies have been more social-political . your films were once hailed as liberation from hollywood 's dictatorship .
but where does political cinema stand today ? it depends on the money .
right now , it sometimes depends on the united states .
it depends on the stars .
in the last three or four years we have seen very distinct movies about the problems in iraq and the oil problems because the big stars decided to do it .
the major companies did n't want to do it , but they felt obliged to make these movies because they wanted to please the stars - pleasing the stars means they can work together with them again and again . that 's a very new thing for cinema .
before , it was the directors or even the political situation around the world that used to push the companies and the producers to produce movies with strong political content . so , one can say that there is more political cinema in hollywood ... there is more in hollywood at the moment and i think in europe , too , because there are more and more big problems .
i think there is a kind of movement .
but personally i believe that all movies are political .
even the action movies .
they have a kind of social effect on the young public and the public in general .
that 's also political . what can cinema achieve now in a world where we are witnessing an increase of violence and a growing lack of political awareness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress diane kruger joins costa-gavras in the jury i think the cinema has to bring emotions to the public and speak rightly about the problems and then the audience can decide what to do .
the audience must be free and independent .
i do n't believe the cinema should impose ideas they do n't like .
i think the cinema is entertainment but it 's necessary to have some content too . does political cinema rule out entertainment and humor , or can they work together ? absolutely .
look at moliere , for example .
both work together .
in shakespeare you find the same things , or if you go through brecht , for example .
all the important theater has done that , and you can say the same thing about the cinema .
all the big directors - fritz lang , renoir , john ford , kazan , all of them - their movies have both and it works . in your films you have investigated the mechanisms of power during dictatorships and other times of suppression , like the holocaust for instance .
which issues interest you most today ? in our society , the most important issue is power - who has the power to do good or bad things .
i think all of us have power .
we have power over some people under us and other people have power over us because they are stronger than we are .
this pyramid of power - that 's politics .
take a big company like nokia , for example .
when they leave the country and leave thousands of people on the streets without jobs - that 's power .
this is the main issue in our society : the power we have and how we use it . so , power is your main issue . it 's the only issue , in my opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " amen " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- is one of costa-gavras ' films that looks at the role of power coming back to the berlin film festival , your job as jury president will start on feb .
7 .
what are you most looking forward to ? you know , when i go to the cinema i sit and i say , now make me happy , make me furious , make me laugh , make me cry .
those feelings are the best moments in a movie . after the festival , you are going to shoot your next movie .
can you tell us what " eden is west " is about ? it 's very difficult to explain a movie in a few seconds .
it 's a movie about today ; it 's a road-movie .
it 's about a young man who likes to go to parties because he thinks the western world is paradise and he discovers that it 's not much of a paradise . your birthday is during the festival , on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 03.02.2008 cinema is always political , says star director costa-gavras großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costa-gavras ' next movie will be filmed in greece , his country of birth all movies are political , film director costa-gavras told dw ahead of the berlin film festival .
politics is power and power makes the world go round - and is the focus of his own films , he said . constantin gavras , better known as costa-gavras , has been named president of the jury at this year 's berlin film festival , which runs from feb .
7-17 .
born in greece in 1933 , his career as a film director took off with the 1969 movie " z. " dw-tv : costa-gavras , of course you will be watching a lot of films during the festival , but can you tell us what else your job as a jury president entails ? costa-gavras : i watch the movies , i 'll discuss with the jury and we 'll try to award the best movie , that 's all .
i 'm trying to be there as a " viewer , " not as a technician or someone who knows the cinema , which is not so easy , of course .
i try to be like any viewer - to be free of any ideological or aesthetical ideas .
the best movie has to get the award . the berlin film festival sees itself more as a political festival in that it gives political cinema a lot of attention .
does that correspond with your general idea of film-making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 58th berlin film festival opens on feb .
7 i think all festivals are political festivals in a way .
the berlin film festival is a bit more so , because they go and set a direction , which i think the cinema needs .
the general idea is that festivals should promote movies with a social content , not only movies which are just entertainment .
if you go back to the history of cinema , the most important movies have been more social-political . your films were once hailed as liberation from hollywood 's dictatorship .
but where does political cinema stand today ? it depends on the money .
right now , it sometimes depends on the united states .
it depends on the stars .
in the last three or four years we have seen very distinct movies about the problems in iraq and the oil problems because the big stars decided to do it .
the major companies did n't want to do it , but they felt obliged to make these movies because they wanted to please the stars - pleasing the stars means they can work together with them again and again . that 's a very new thing for cinema .
before , it was the directors or even the political situation around the world that used to push the companies and the producers to produce movies with strong political content . so , one can say that there is more political cinema in hollywood ... there is more in hollywood at the moment and i think in europe , too , because there are more and more big problems .
i think there is a kind of movement .
but personally i believe that all movies are political .
even the action movies .
they have a kind of social effect on the young public and the public in general .
that 's also political . what can cinema achieve now in a world where we are witnessing an increase of violence and a growing lack of political awareness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress diane kruger joins costa-gavras in the jury i think the cinema has to bring emotions to the public and speak rightly about the problems and then the audience can decide what to do .
the audience must be free and independent .
i do n't believe the cinema should impose ideas they do n't like .
i think the cinema is entertainment but it 's necessary to have some content too . does political cinema rule out entertainment and humor , or can they work together ? absolutely .
look at moliere , for example .
both work together .
in shakespeare you find the same things , or if you go through brecht , for example .
all the important theater has done that , and you can say the same thing about the cinema .
all the big directors - fritz lang , renoir , john ford , kazan , all of them - their movies have both and it works . in your films you have investigated the mechanisms of power during dictatorships and other times of suppression , like the holocaust for instance .
which issues interest you most today ? in our society , the most important issue is power - who has the power to do good or bad things .
i think all of us have power .
we have power over some people under us and other people have power over us because they are stronger than we are .
this pyramid of power - that 's politics .
take a big company like nokia , for example .
when they leave the country and leave thousands of people on the streets without jobs - that 's power .
this is the main issue in our society : the power we have and how we use it . so , power is your main issue . it 's the only issue , in my opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " amen " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- is one of costa-gavras ' films that looks at the role of power coming back to the berlin film festival , your job as jury president will start on feb .
7 .
what are you most looking forward to ? you know , when i go to the cinema i sit and i say , now make me happy , make me furious , make me laugh , make me cry .
those feelings are the best moments in a movie . after the festival , you are going to shoot your next movie .
can you tell us what " eden is west " is about ? it 's very difficult to explain a movie in a few seconds .
it 's a movie about today ; it 's a road-movie .
it 's about a young man who likes to go to parties because he thinks the western world is paradise and he discovers that it 's not much of a paradise . your birthday is during the festival , on feb .

in europe 's largest science park , the experiment to merge science and industry is now taking off . located on the eastern outskirts of berlin , adlershof is a quick 20-minute train ride from the city center .
in gdr times adlershof was berlin 's celebrated socialist science mecca .
so when germany 's reunification threatened its further existence , the area embarked on an experiment : the creation of a science park , merging solar technology research with solar industry , in one winning equation . since 1993 , berlin has invested billions of euros in the area - billions the heavily indebted city does n't have .
but adlershof 's public relations manager , peter strunk said it was money well-invested in a bold vision , born of necessity . " this science park project was created to prevent us from social catastrophe after reunification , " strunk said .
" there were so many research facilities located here so instead of closing them down , a decision was made to create an integrated landscape of science and business , to re-establish those industrial structures that had to be dismantled . " a pioneering urban project the science park is embedded in adlershof 's overall urban planning concept , covering over four square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 square miles -rrb- .
its fresh urban landscape is still so new that it looks like a city whose virtual , graphic animation existence has simply been mounted onto the material world . adlershof is stream-lined and squeaky clean , with no mom and pop shops , quirky corners , or rough edges to add a bit of charm and irregularity to its neat , urban profile .
its main avenue is strewn with sleek , modern buildings of glass and steel housing scientific institutions and high tech companies . off the main strip are freshly-plowed streets named in honor of science icons , like albert einstein and max born .
and there 's 66 hectares -lrb- 163 acres -rrb- of land still left undeveloped , waiting to be sold , or rented . staying on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is a main customer of german solar technology one research institute with a long tradition in adlershof is the hahn-meitner institute .
klaus lips , the scientist leading thin-film solar cell reseach at the institute , was educated in marburg , germany , worked in colorado , but returned to germany when offered a position here . lips said adlershof is a solar scientist 's paradise , due to the close proximity of research and industry , and the unique , open dialogue and collaboration that exists between the two . " we work together with companies and establish network projects in which researchers , industry , and university students work together , " lips said , pointing out that the synergy of adlershof 's solar community especially benefits the upcoming generation of solar science researchers . " our young students have excellent job opportunities here , because upcoming companies are looking for trained people , " he added . success story the solar cell company sulfurcell 's founding in 2003 was based on research done on at the hahn-meitner institute .
the company started small , but now employs 100 engineers and factory operators to manufacture thin-film , cis solar cell modules and solar roof tiles . sulfurcell 's ceo nikolaus meyer is a scientist-turned-businessman , involved in the research that led to the company 's creation , and stands firmly behind his product . " cis stands for copper indium disulfide , a new semi-conductor that allows you to use a very thin , conductor layer on glass to produce electricity , " meyer said . sales of sulfurcell 's initial production have been so successful that plans are underway to erect a larger , more automated production plant this year .
meyer said he is confident he 'll be able to bring down the price of his product , to compete with the prices of conventionally produced power within the next five years . meyer said it would have been impossible to set-up and operate his company anywhere but adlershof .
he said the constant support and input of the area 's research institutes are what keep his product state-of-the-art , and thereby competitive . slowly getting noticed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the world 's largest solar parks sits near leipzig , germany in the former east germany , the institute for silicon crystal research enjoyed close ties to the humboldt university 's science faculties nearby , and much of the institute 's current staff are humboldt graduates . recently the institute 's research growing silicon crystals layers directly onto glass panels caught the attention of the international energy company british petroleum , which is now financing their further research . this month , solon , germany 's largest solar cell company , also moved its extensive operations to adlershof .
a new start-up company named inventux is beginning operations there , and two major us solar power companies have shown recently interest in investing in the area . on a roll lips said he 's convinced that german advances in solar technology will enable the country to supply 25 percent of its electricity needs with solar power alone , within the next two decades . meyer from sulfurcell said he believes clean-tech and renewable energy will be germany 's major industries , in the future . " we have seen only the beginning of this industry , and that the technology developed in germany , is creating an excellent foundation for the future success of the industry , " he said . if adlershof 's solar industry continues to grow at its current rate , it has the chance to become the place to be for all significant solar technology players , and europe 's first solaropolis , in the years to come . leah mcdonnell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we played quite well going forward and created chances but did n't finish it off and let the game out of our hands , " werder coach thomas schaaf said . schaaf had to juggle his team selection after injuries and other absences to key players but did not include midfielder mesut ozil , signed from schalke on thursday . bochum almost went in front when naldo deflected a cross which keeper tim wiese managed to deflect onto the bar with his leg . but after diego was foiled by jan lastuvka in goal and aaron hunt shot wide , jensen hit the net with a rising drive from just inside the area . bochum late show dents bremen 's title push bremen appeared well in control but auer netted from close range after a cross from japanese new signing shinji ono , who had come off the subs ' bench a minute earlier . ono was again the provider with a corner headed in by yahia to complete the misery for bremen and move bochum to 11th place , out of immediate relegation danger . bremen stay on 36 points , three points behind leaders bayern munich and three ahead of bayer leverkusen and sv hamburg , with schalke now fifth on 32 points . bayern , who earned a 2-1 win at hansa rostock friday evening , now meet bremen in munich next sunday , while leverkusen entertain hamburg on saturday in next weekend 's other big game . germany coach löw saw kuranyi in fine form in gelsenkirchen against his former club stuttgart as schalke ran out 4-1 winners . the striker , who has only just recovered from a lung infection , headed home powerfully from an ivan rakitic free-kick in the 32nd minute and then scrambled the ball home from close range in the 52nd . stuttgart got back in the game nine minutes later with a 30-metre free-kick from antonia da silva over the head of goalkeeper manuel neuer who was caught off his line . but schalke made sure when another rakitic free-kick was headed in on 76 minutes by heiko westermann - called up by löw for the germany squad for the first for wednesday 's friendly against austria . new signing ze roberto came off the substitutes ' bench in the 90th minute to complete the scoring for schalke in stoppage time .

in europe 's largest science park , the experiment to merge science and industry is now taking off . located on the eastern outskirts of berlin , adlershof is a quick 20-minute train ride from the city center .
in gdr times adlershof was berlin 's celebrated socialist science mecca .
so when germany 's reunification threatened its further existence , the area embarked on an experiment : the creation of a science park , merging solar technology research with solar industry , in one winning equation . since 1993 , berlin has invested billions of euros in the area - billions the heavily indebted city does n't have .
but adlershof 's public relations manager , peter strunk said it was money well-invested in a bold vision , born of necessity . " this science park project was created to prevent us from social catastrophe after reunification , " strunk said .
" there were so many research facilities located here so instead of closing them down , a decision was made to create an integrated landscape of science and business , to re-establish those industrial structures that had to be dismantled . " a pioneering urban project the science park is embedded in adlershof 's overall urban planning concept , covering over four square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 square miles -rrb- .
its fresh urban landscape is still so new that it looks like a city whose virtual , graphic animation existence has simply been mounted onto the material world . adlershof is stream-lined and squeaky clean , with no mom and pop shops , quirky corners , or rough edges to add a bit of charm and irregularity to its neat , urban profile .
its main avenue is strewn with sleek , modern buildings of glass and steel housing scientific institutions and high tech companies . off the main strip are freshly-plowed streets named in honor of science icons , like albert einstein and max born .
and there 's 66 hectares -lrb- 163 acres -rrb- of land still left undeveloped , waiting to be sold , or rented . staying on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is a main customer of german solar technology one research institute with a long tradition in adlershof is the hahn-meitner institute .
klaus lips , the scientist leading thin-film solar cell reseach at the institute , was educated in marburg , germany , worked in colorado , but returned to germany when offered a position here . lips said adlershof is a solar scientist 's paradise , due to the close proximity of research and industry , and the unique , open dialogue and collaboration that exists between the two . " we work together with companies and establish network projects in which researchers , industry , and university students work together , " lips said , pointing out that the synergy of adlershof 's solar community especially benefits the upcoming generation of solar science researchers . " our young students have excellent job opportunities here , because upcoming companies are looking for trained people , " he added . success story the solar cell company sulfurcell 's founding in 2003 was based on research done on at the hahn-meitner institute .

the future of kosovo and its independence is also linked to the vote . voting has ended sunday in a tense presidential election run-off pitting the pro-european incumbent boris tadic against the nationalist challenger , tomislav nikolic . serbs turned out at a record pace , reflecting the referendum-like mood - though the president has mostly ceremonial duties , the outcome would signal which way voters want their country steered . nearly 63 per cent of the 6.7 million registered voters had cast their ballots with one hour remaining , the private election- monitoring agency cesid said . the final showing is to overshoot by a wide margin the 61 per cent from the first round two weeks ago . four years ago , after a series of attempts at electing a president failed owing to voter apathy , serbia was forced to scrap a legal minimum turnout requirement of 50 per cent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic urged serbia to remain on course for the eu that time , in june 2004 , tadic defeated nikolic in the run-off 53 to 47 per cent on a lowly 47 per cent turnout .
but this time the stakes are higher as serbia has been wavering on its european path . in this year 's contest , nikolic won 40 per cent to tadic 's 35.5 per cent of the votes in the first round on january 20 , but polls conducted between the two votes gave tadic a razor-thin edge of less than 1 per cent . serbia must stay the eu course , says tadic tadic says that belgrade must remain on course to join the eu even if leading western nations back the looming secession of serbia 's province kosovo .
" serbia is without doubt on its way to full membership of the eu , " he said after casting his ballot sunday . tadic 's opponent nikolic leads the opposition serbian radical party , the largest force in parliament and a key part of the former regime of slobodan milosevic . he says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west if it recognizes an independent and would instead seek closer ties with powers such as russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic said serbia was much closer to russia serbia is " much closer to russia , to a partner that does not impose conditions and can enable our development , " nikolic said after voting in belgrade .
the 6.7 million registered voters had to choose between the pro-european incumbent boris tadic and the ultra-nationalist tomislav nikolic .
tadic , who says that serbia must remain on its eu-course regardless of western support of kosovo 's secession , heads the democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , the senior partner in the cabinet coalition with prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia .
nikolic leads the opposition serbian radicals -lrb- srs -rrb- , the strongest single party in the country , which was a key part of slobodan milosevic 's regime until it was toppled in 2000 .
nikolic says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west over kosovo .
the difference in the run-off is however expected to be dramatically slight - some reports said that it could be less than 1 per cent and that the election may be decided by as few as 20,000 votes .
a referendum on east or west though the office of the president in serbia carries little real authority , the election carries a referendum-like quality because serbia has been wavering between east and west in its course .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has not had the support of his senior partner the conservative prime minister vojsilav kostunica has supported neither his senior coalition partner tadic , nor nikolic , with whom he shares a mistrust of the west .
kostunica , as nikolic , says that belgrade should stop its already stalled approach to european union membership because leading western countries support the secession of kosovo from serbia .
kosovo leaders , representing the 90-per-cent albanian majority , are expected to declare independence in the days or weeks after sunday 's vote in serbia .
with his once undisputed popularity now dramatically reduced , kostunica is likely to avoid early elections .
if tadic triumphs , the present coalition may continue as over the past year .
ds would however gain more credibility to steering serbia toward integration with eu , which stalled not only over kosovo , but also because serbia continues refusing to arrest wanted war crimes suspects .
fears a nikolic win would return serbia to isolation if nikolic wins , kostunica may try to drop tadic and the smallest partner in the existing coalition , the reformist g17 and replace them with nikolic and the srs , along with slobodan milosevic 's socialists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu serbs fear where nikolic may take them the pro-european camp in serbia has warned that nikolic 's win would effectively return serbia to isolation .
backing tadic and despite serbia 's failure to close the war crimes chapter , the eu has offered serbia a broad political and economic cooperation deal for signing on february 7 .
should nikolic win , however , the offer would " lose any meaning , " italian deputy foreign minister famiano crucianelli has said .
polling ends at 8 pm local time .
early results are normally expected within a few hours , but may this time be delayed if the score turns out to be as close as was anticipated . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in europe 's largest science park , the experiment to merge science and industry is now taking off . located on the eastern outskirts of berlin , adlershof is a quick 20-minute train ride from the city center .
in gdr times adlershof was berlin 's celebrated socialist science mecca .
so when germany 's reunification threatened its further existence , the area embarked on an experiment : the creation of a science park , merging solar technology research with solar industry , in one winning equation . since 1993 , berlin has invested billions of euros in the area - billions the heavily indebted city does n't have .
but adlershof 's public relations manager , peter strunk said it was money well-invested in a bold vision , born of necessity . " this science park project was created to prevent us from social catastrophe after reunification , " strunk said .
" there were so many research facilities located here so instead of closing them down , a decision was made to create an integrated landscape of science and business , to re-establish those industrial structures that had to be dismantled . " a pioneering urban project the science park is embedded in adlershof 's overall urban planning concept , covering over four square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 square miles -rrb- .
its fresh urban landscape is still so new that it looks like a city whose virtual , graphic animation existence has simply been mounted onto the material world . adlershof is stream-lined and squeaky clean , with no mom and pop shops , quirky corners , or rough edges to add a bit of charm and irregularity to its neat , urban profile .
its main avenue is strewn with sleek , modern buildings of glass and steel housing scientific institutions and high tech companies . off the main strip are freshly-plowed streets named in honor of science icons , like albert einstein and max born .
and there 's 66 hectares -lrb- 163 acres -rrb- of land still left undeveloped , waiting to be sold , or rented . staying on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is a main customer of german solar technology one research institute with a long tradition in adlershof is the hahn-meitner institute .
klaus lips , the scientist leading thin-film solar cell reseach at the institute , was educated in marburg , germany , worked in colorado , but returned to germany when offered a position here . lips said adlershof is a solar scientist 's paradise , due to the close proximity of research and industry , and the unique , open dialogue and collaboration that exists between the two . " we work together with companies and establish network projects in which researchers , industry , and university students work together , " lips said , pointing out that the synergy of adlershof 's solar community especially benefits the upcoming generation of solar science researchers . " our young students have excellent job opportunities here , because upcoming companies are looking for trained people , " he added . success story the solar cell company sulfurcell 's founding in 2003 was based on research done on at the hahn-meitner institute .
the company started small , but now employs 100 engineers and factory operators to manufacture thin-film , cis solar cell modules and solar roof tiles . sulfurcell 's ceo nikolaus meyer is a scientist-turned-businessman , involved in the research that led to the company 's creation , and stands firmly behind his product . " cis stands for copper indium disulfide , a new semi-conductor that allows you to use a very thin , conductor layer on glass to produce electricity , " meyer said . sales of sulfurcell 's initial production have been so successful that plans are underway to erect a larger , more automated production plant this year .
meyer said he is confident he 'll be able to bring down the price of his product , to compete with the prices of conventionally produced power within the next five years . meyer said it would have been impossible to set-up and operate his company anywhere but adlershof .
he said the constant support and input of the area 's research institutes are what keep his product state-of-the-art , and thereby competitive . slowly getting noticed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the world 's largest solar parks sits near leipzig , germany in the former east germany , the institute for silicon crystal research enjoyed close ties to the humboldt university 's science faculties nearby , and much of the institute 's current staff are humboldt graduates . recently the institute 's research growing silicon crystals layers directly onto glass panels caught the attention of the international energy company british petroleum , which is now financing their further research . this month , solon , germany 's largest solar cell company , also moved its extensive operations to adlershof .

politics is power and power makes the world go round - and is the focus of his own films , he said . constantin gavras , better known as costa-gavras , has been named president of the jury at this year 's berlin film festival , which runs from feb .
7-17 .
born in greece in 1933 , his career as a film director took off with the 1969 movie " z. " dw-tv : costa-gavras , of course you will be watching a lot of films during the festival , but can you tell us what else your job as a jury president entails ? costa-gavras : i watch the movies , i 'll discuss with the jury and we 'll try to award the best movie , that 's all .
i 'm trying to be there as a " viewer , " not as a technician or someone who knows the cinema , which is not so easy , of course .
i try to be like any viewer - to be free of any ideological or aesthetical ideas .
the best movie has to get the award . the berlin film festival sees itself more as a political festival in that it gives political cinema a lot of attention .
does that correspond with your general idea of film-making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 58th berlin film festival opens on feb .
7 i think all festivals are political festivals in a way .
the berlin film festival is a bit more so , because they go and set a direction , which i think the cinema needs .
the general idea is that festivals should promote movies with a social content , not only movies which are just entertainment .
if you go back to the history of cinema , the most important movies have been more social-political . your films were once hailed as liberation from hollywood 's dictatorship .
but where does political cinema stand today ? it depends on the money .
right now , it sometimes depends on the united states .
it depends on the stars .
in the last three or four years we have seen very distinct movies about the problems in iraq and the oil problems because the big stars decided to do it .
the major companies did n't want to do it , but they felt obliged to make these movies because they wanted to please the stars - pleasing the stars means they can work together with them again and again . that 's a very new thing for cinema .
before , it was the directors or even the political situation around the world that used to push the companies and the producers to produce movies with strong political content . so , one can say that there is more political cinema in hollywood ... there is more in hollywood at the moment and i think in europe , too , because there are more and more big problems .
i think there is a kind of movement .
but personally i believe that all movies are political .
even the action movies .
they have a kind of social effect on the young public and the public in general .
that 's also political . what can cinema achieve now in a world where we are witnessing an increase of violence and a growing lack of political awareness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress diane kruger joins costa-gavras in the jury i think the cinema has to bring emotions to the public and speak rightly about the problems and then the audience can decide what to do .
the audience must be free and independent .
i do n't believe the cinema should impose ideas they do n't like .
i think the cinema is entertainment but it 's necessary to have some content too . does political cinema rule out entertainment and humor , or can they work together ? absolutely .
look at moliere , for example .
both work together .
in shakespeare you find the same things , or if you go through brecht , for example .
all the important theater has done that , and you can say the same thing about the cinema .
all the big directors - fritz lang , renoir , john ford , kazan , all of them - their movies have both and it works . in your films you have investigated the mechanisms of power during dictatorships and other times of suppression , like the holocaust for instance .
which issues interest you most today ? in our society , the most important issue is power - who has the power to do good or bad things .
i think all of us have power .
we have power over some people under us and other people have power over us because they are stronger than we are .
this pyramid of power - that 's politics .
take a big company like nokia , for example .
when they leave the country and leave thousands of people on the streets without jobs - that 's power .
this is the main issue in our society : the power we have and how we use it . so , power is your main issue . it 's the only issue , in my opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " amen " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- is one of costa-gavras ' films that looks at the role of power coming back to the berlin film festival , your job as jury president will start on feb .

what are you most looking forward to ? you know , when i go to the cinema i sit and i say , now make me happy , make me furious , make me laugh , make me cry .
those feelings are the best moments in a movie . after the festival , you are going to shoot your next movie .
can you tell us what " eden is west " is about ? it 's very difficult to explain a movie in a few seconds .
it 's a movie about today ; it 's a road-movie .
it 's about a young man who likes to go to parties because he thinks the western world is paradise and he discovers that it 's not much of a paradise . your birthday is during the festival , on feb .

will you celebrate ?
what 's your birthday wish ? you know , i think , after a certain age , it 's not necessary to celebrate the age or the birthdays .
but it 's there , so what can i do ? so you have no plans and no wishes ? yes , one wish : not to celebrate . okay , but maybe you will see a good movie on that day . that would be a good celebration - a good present . interview : hans christoph von bock -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in europe 's largest science park , the experiment to merge science and industry is now taking off . located on the eastern outskirts of berlin , adlershof is a quick 20-minute train ride from the city center .
in gdr times adlershof was berlin 's celebrated socialist science mecca .
so when germany 's reunification threatened its further existence , the area embarked on an experiment : the creation of a science park , merging solar technology research with solar industry , in one winning equation . since 1993 , berlin has invested billions of euros in the area - billions the heavily indebted city does n't have .
but adlershof 's public relations manager , peter strunk said it was money well-invested in a bold vision , born of necessity . " this science park project was created to prevent us from social catastrophe after reunification , " strunk said .
" there were so many research facilities located here so instead of closing them down , a decision was made to create an integrated landscape of science and business , to re-establish those industrial structures that had to be dismantled . " a pioneering urban project the science park is embedded in adlershof 's overall urban planning concept , covering over four square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 square miles -rrb- .
its fresh urban landscape is still so new that it looks like a city whose virtual , graphic animation existence has simply been mounted onto the material world . adlershof is stream-lined and squeaky clean , with no mom and pop shops , quirky corners , or rough edges to add a bit of charm and irregularity to its neat , urban profile .
its main avenue is strewn with sleek , modern buildings of glass and steel housing scientific institutions and high tech companies . off the main strip are freshly-plowed streets named in honor of science icons , like albert einstein and max born .

the future of kosovo and its independence is also linked to the vote . voting has ended sunday in a tense presidential election run-off pitting the pro-european incumbent boris tadic against the nationalist challenger , tomislav nikolic . serbs turned out at a record pace , reflecting the referendum-like mood - though the president has mostly ceremonial duties , the outcome would signal which way voters want their country steered . nearly 63 per cent of the 6.7 million registered voters had cast their ballots with one hour remaining , the private election- monitoring agency cesid said . the final showing is to overshoot by a wide margin the 61 per cent from the first round two weeks ago . four years ago , after a series of attempts at electing a president failed owing to voter apathy , serbia was forced to scrap a legal minimum turnout requirement of 50 per cent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic urged serbia to remain on course for the eu that time , in june 2004 , tadic defeated nikolic in the run-off 53 to 47 per cent on a lowly 47 per cent turnout .
but this time the stakes are higher as serbia has been wavering on its european path . in this year 's contest , nikolic won 40 per cent to tadic 's 35.5 per cent of the votes in the first round on january 20 , but polls conducted between the two votes gave tadic a razor-thin edge of less than 1 per cent . serbia must stay the eu course , says tadic tadic says that belgrade must remain on course to join the eu even if leading western nations back the looming secession of serbia 's province kosovo .
" serbia is without doubt on its way to full membership of the eu , " he said after casting his ballot sunday . tadic 's opponent nikolic leads the opposition serbian radical party , the largest force in parliament and a key part of the former regime of slobodan milosevic . he says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west if it recognizes an independent and would instead seek closer ties with powers such as russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic said serbia was much closer to russia serbia is " much closer to russia , to a partner that does not impose conditions and can enable our development , " nikolic said after voting in belgrade .
the 6.7 million registered voters had to choose between the pro-european incumbent boris tadic and the ultra-nationalist tomislav nikolic .
tadic , who says that serbia must remain on its eu-course regardless of western support of kosovo 's secession , heads the democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , the senior partner in the cabinet coalition with prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia .
nikolic leads the opposition serbian radicals -lrb- srs -rrb- , the strongest single party in the country , which was a key part of slobodan milosevic 's regime until it was toppled in 2000 .
nikolic says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west over kosovo .
the difference in the run-off is however expected to be dramatically slight - some reports said that it could be less than 1 per cent and that the election may be decided by as few as 20,000 votes .
a referendum on east or west though the office of the president in serbia carries little real authority , the election carries a referendum-like quality because serbia has been wavering between east and west in its course .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has not had the support of his senior partner the conservative prime minister vojsilav kostunica has supported neither his senior coalition partner tadic , nor nikolic , with whom he shares a mistrust of the west .
kostunica , as nikolic , says that belgrade should stop its already stalled approach to european union membership because leading western countries support the secession of kosovo from serbia .
kosovo leaders , representing the 90-per-cent albanian majority , are expected to declare independence in the days or weeks after sunday 's vote in serbia .
with his once undisputed popularity now dramatically reduced , kostunica is likely to avoid early elections .
if tadic triumphs , the present coalition may continue as over the past year .
ds would however gain more credibility to steering serbia toward integration with eu , which stalled not only over kosovo , but also because serbia continues refusing to arrest wanted war crimes suspects .
fears a nikolic win would return serbia to isolation if nikolic wins , kostunica may try to drop tadic and the smallest partner in the existing coalition , the reformist g17 and replace them with nikolic and the srs , along with slobodan milosevic 's socialists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu serbs fear where nikolic may take them the pro-european camp in serbia has warned that nikolic 's win would effectively return serbia to isolation .
backing tadic and despite serbia 's failure to close the war crimes chapter , the eu has offered serbia a broad political and economic cooperation deal for signing on february 7 .
should nikolic win , however , the offer would " lose any meaning , " italian deputy foreign minister famiano crucianelli has said .
polling ends at 8 pm local time .
early results are normally expected within a few hours , but may this time be delayed if the score turns out to be as close as was anticipated . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politics is power and power makes the world go round - and is the focus of his own films , he said . constantin gavras , better known as costa-gavras , has been named president of the jury at this year 's berlin film festival , which runs from feb .
7-17 .
born in greece in 1933 , his career as a film director took off with the 1969 movie " z. " dw-tv : costa-gavras , of course you will be watching a lot of films during the festival , but can you tell us what else your job as a jury president entails ? costa-gavras : i watch the movies , i 'll discuss with the jury and we 'll try to award the best movie , that 's all .
i 'm trying to be there as a " viewer , " not as a technician or someone who knows the cinema , which is not so easy , of course .
i try to be like any viewer - to be free of any ideological or aesthetical ideas .
the best movie has to get the award . the berlin film festival sees itself more as a political festival in that it gives political cinema a lot of attention .
does that correspond with your general idea of film-making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 58th berlin film festival opens on feb .
7 i think all festivals are political festivals in a way .
the berlin film festival is a bit more so , because they go and set a direction , which i think the cinema needs .
the general idea is that festivals should promote movies with a social content , not only movies which are just entertainment .
if you go back to the history of cinema , the most important movies have been more social-political . your films were once hailed as liberation from hollywood 's dictatorship .
but where does political cinema stand today ? it depends on the money .
right now , it sometimes depends on the united states .
it depends on the stars .
in the last three or four years we have seen very distinct movies about the problems in iraq and the oil problems because the big stars decided to do it .
the major companies did n't want to do it , but they felt obliged to make these movies because they wanted to please the stars - pleasing the stars means they can work together with them again and again . that 's a very new thing for cinema .
before , it was the directors or even the political situation around the world that used to push the companies and the producers to produce movies with strong political content . so , one can say that there is more political cinema in hollywood ... there is more in hollywood at the moment and i think in europe , too , because there are more and more big problems .
i think there is a kind of movement .
but personally i believe that all movies are political .
even the action movies .
they have a kind of social effect on the young public and the public in general .
that 's also political . what can cinema achieve now in a world where we are witnessing an increase of violence and a growing lack of political awareness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress diane kruger joins costa-gavras in the jury i think the cinema has to bring emotions to the public and speak rightly about the problems and then the audience can decide what to do .
the audience must be free and independent .
i do n't believe the cinema should impose ideas they do n't like .
i think the cinema is entertainment but it 's necessary to have some content too . does political cinema rule out entertainment and humor , or can they work together ? absolutely .
look at moliere , for example .
both work together .
in shakespeare you find the same things , or if you go through brecht , for example .
all the important theater has done that , and you can say the same thing about the cinema .
all the big directors - fritz lang , renoir , john ford , kazan , all of them - their movies have both and it works . in your films you have investigated the mechanisms of power during dictatorships and other times of suppression , like the holocaust for instance .
which issues interest you most today ? in our society , the most important issue is power - who has the power to do good or bad things .
i think all of us have power .
we have power over some people under us and other people have power over us because they are stronger than we are .
this pyramid of power - that 's politics .
take a big company like nokia , for example .
when they leave the country and leave thousands of people on the streets without jobs - that 's power .
this is the main issue in our society : the power we have and how we use it . so , power is your main issue . it 's the only issue , in my opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " amen " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- is one of costa-gavras ' films that looks at the role of power coming back to the berlin film festival , your job as jury president will start on feb .
7 .
what are you most looking forward to ? you know , when i go to the cinema i sit and i say , now make me happy , make me furious , make me laugh , make me cry .
those feelings are the best moments in a movie . after the festival , you are going to shoot your next movie .
can you tell us what " eden is west " is about ? it 's very difficult to explain a movie in a few seconds .
it 's a movie about today ; it 's a road-movie .
it 's about a young man who likes to go to parties because he thinks the western world is paradise and he discovers that it 's not much of a paradise . your birthday is during the festival , on feb .
13 .
will you celebrate ?
what 's your birthday wish ? you know , i think , after a certain age , it 's not necessary to celebrate the age or the birthdays .
but it 's there , so what can i do ? so you have no plans and no wishes ? yes , one wish : not to celebrate . okay , but maybe you will see a good movie on that day . that would be a good celebration - a good present . interview : hans christoph von bock -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in europe 's largest science park , the experiment to merge science and industry is now taking off . located on the eastern outskirts of berlin , adlershof is a quick 20-minute train ride from the city center .
in gdr times adlershof was berlin 's celebrated socialist science mecca .
so when germany 's reunification threatened its further existence , the area embarked on an experiment : the creation of a science park , merging solar technology research with solar industry , in one winning equation . since 1993 , berlin has invested billions of euros in the area - billions the heavily indebted city does n't have .
but adlershof 's public relations manager , peter strunk said it was money well-invested in a bold vision , born of necessity . " this science park project was created to prevent us from social catastrophe after reunification , " strunk said .
" there were so many research facilities located here so instead of closing them down , a decision was made to create an integrated landscape of science and business , to re-establish those industrial structures that had to be dismantled . " a pioneering urban project the science park is embedded in adlershof 's overall urban planning concept , covering over four square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 square miles -rrb- .
its fresh urban landscape is still so new that it looks like a city whose virtual , graphic animation existence has simply been mounted onto the material world . adlershof is stream-lined and squeaky clean , with no mom and pop shops , quirky corners , or rough edges to add a bit of charm and irregularity to its neat , urban profile .
its main avenue is strewn with sleek , modern buildings of glass and steel housing scientific institutions and high tech companies . off the main strip are freshly-plowed streets named in honor of science icons , like albert einstein and max born .
and there 's 66 hectares -lrb- 163 acres -rrb- of land still left undeveloped , waiting to be sold , or rented . staying on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is a main customer of german solar technology one research institute with a long tradition in adlershof is the hahn-meitner institute .
klaus lips , the scientist leading thin-film solar cell reseach at the institute , was educated in marburg , germany , worked in colorado , but returned to germany when offered a position here . lips said adlershof is a solar scientist 's paradise , due to the close proximity of research and industry , and the unique , open dialogue and collaboration that exists between the two . " we work together with companies and establish network projects in which researchers , industry , and university students work together , " lips said , pointing out that the synergy of adlershof 's solar community especially benefits the upcoming generation of solar science researchers . " our young students have excellent job opportunities here , because upcoming companies are looking for trained people , " he added . success story the solar cell company sulfurcell 's founding in 2003 was based on research done on at the hahn-meitner institute .
the company started small , but now employs 100 engineers and factory operators to manufacture thin-film , cis solar cell modules and solar roof tiles . sulfurcell 's ceo nikolaus meyer is a scientist-turned-businessman , involved in the research that led to the company 's creation , and stands firmly behind his product . " cis stands for copper indium disulfide , a new semi-conductor that allows you to use a very thin , conductor layer on glass to produce electricity , " meyer said . sales of sulfurcell 's initial production have been so successful that plans are underway to erect a larger , more automated production plant this year .
meyer said he is confident he 'll be able to bring down the price of his product , to compete with the prices of conventionally produced power within the next five years . meyer said it would have been impossible to set-up and operate his company anywhere but adlershof .

politics is power and power makes the world go round - and is the focus of his own films , he said . constantin gavras , better known as costa-gavras , has been named president of the jury at this year 's berlin film festival , which runs from feb .
7-17 .
born in greece in 1933 , his career as a film director took off with the 1969 movie " z. " dw-tv : costa-gavras , of course you will be watching a lot of films during the festival , but can you tell us what else your job as a jury president entails ? costa-gavras : i watch the movies , i 'll discuss with the jury and we 'll try to award the best movie , that 's all .
i 'm trying to be there as a " viewer , " not as a technician or someone who knows the cinema , which is not so easy , of course .
i try to be like any viewer - to be free of any ideological or aesthetical ideas .
the best movie has to get the award . the berlin film festival sees itself more as a political festival in that it gives political cinema a lot of attention .
does that correspond with your general idea of film-making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 58th berlin film festival opens on feb .
7 i think all festivals are political festivals in a way .
the berlin film festival is a bit more so , because they go and set a direction , which i think the cinema needs .
the general idea is that festivals should promote movies with a social content , not only movies which are just entertainment .
if you go back to the history of cinema , the most important movies have been more social-political . your films were once hailed as liberation from hollywood 's dictatorship .
but where does political cinema stand today ? it depends on the money .
right now , it sometimes depends on the united states .
it depends on the stars .
in the last three or four years we have seen very distinct movies about the problems in iraq and the oil problems because the big stars decided to do it .
the major companies did n't want to do it , but they felt obliged to make these movies because they wanted to please the stars - pleasing the stars means they can work together with them again and again . that 's a very new thing for cinema .
before , it was the directors or even the political situation around the world that used to push the companies and the producers to produce movies with strong political content . so , one can say that there is more political cinema in hollywood ... there is more in hollywood at the moment and i think in europe , too , because there are more and more big problems .
i think there is a kind of movement .
but personally i believe that all movies are political .
even the action movies .
they have a kind of social effect on the young public and the public in general .
that 's also political . what can cinema achieve now in a world where we are witnessing an increase of violence and a growing lack of political awareness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress diane kruger joins costa-gavras in the jury i think the cinema has to bring emotions to the public and speak rightly about the problems and then the audience can decide what to do .
the audience must be free and independent .
i do n't believe the cinema should impose ideas they do n't like .
i think the cinema is entertainment but it 's necessary to have some content too . does political cinema rule out entertainment and humor , or can they work together ? absolutely .
look at moliere , for example .
both work together .
in shakespeare you find the same things , or if you go through brecht , for example .
all the important theater has done that , and you can say the same thing about the cinema .
all the big directors - fritz lang , renoir , john ford , kazan , all of them - their movies have both and it works . in your films you have investigated the mechanisms of power during dictatorships and other times of suppression , like the holocaust for instance .
which issues interest you most today ? in our society , the most important issue is power - who has the power to do good or bad things .
i think all of us have power .
we have power over some people under us and other people have power over us because they are stronger than we are .
this pyramid of power - that 's politics .
take a big company like nokia , for example .
when they leave the country and leave thousands of people on the streets without jobs - that 's power .
this is the main issue in our society : the power we have and how we use it . so , power is your main issue . it 's the only issue , in my opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " amen " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- is one of costa-gavras ' films that looks at the role of power coming back to the berlin film festival , your job as jury president will start on feb .
7 .
what are you most looking forward to ? you know , when i go to the cinema i sit and i say , now make me happy , make me furious , make me laugh , make me cry .
those feelings are the best moments in a movie . after the festival , you are going to shoot your next movie .
can you tell us what " eden is west " is about ? it 's very difficult to explain a movie in a few seconds .
it 's a movie about today ; it 's a road-movie .
it 's about a young man who likes to go to parties because he thinks the western world is paradise and he discovers that it 's not much of a paradise . your birthday is during the festival , on feb .
13 .
will you celebrate ?
what 's your birthday wish ? you know , i think , after a certain age , it 's not necessary to celebrate the age or the birthdays .
but it 's there , so what can i do ? so you have no plans and no wishes ? yes , one wish : not to celebrate . okay , but maybe you will see a good movie on that day . that would be a good celebration - a good present . interview : hans christoph von bock -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the future of kosovo and its independence is also linked to the vote . voting has ended sunday in a tense presidential election run-off pitting the pro-european incumbent boris tadic against the nationalist challenger , tomislav nikolic . serbs turned out at a record pace , reflecting the referendum-like mood - though the president has mostly ceremonial duties , the outcome would signal which way voters want their country steered . nearly 63 per cent of the 6.7 million registered voters had cast their ballots with one hour remaining , the private election- monitoring agency cesid said . the final showing is to overshoot by a wide margin the 61 per cent from the first round two weeks ago . four years ago , after a series of attempts at electing a president failed owing to voter apathy , serbia was forced to scrap a legal minimum turnout requirement of 50 per cent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic urged serbia to remain on course for the eu that time , in june 2004 , tadic defeated nikolic in the run-off 53 to 47 per cent on a lowly 47 per cent turnout .
but this time the stakes are higher as serbia has been wavering on its european path . in this year 's contest , nikolic won 40 per cent to tadic 's 35.5 per cent of the votes in the first round on january 20 , but polls conducted between the two votes gave tadic a razor-thin edge of less than 1 per cent . serbia must stay the eu course , says tadic tadic says that belgrade must remain on course to join the eu even if leading western nations back the looming secession of serbia 's province kosovo .
" serbia is without doubt on its way to full membership of the eu , " he said after casting his ballot sunday . tadic 's opponent nikolic leads the opposition serbian radical party , the largest force in parliament and a key part of the former regime of slobodan milosevic . he says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west if it recognizes an independent and would instead seek closer ties with powers such as russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic said serbia was much closer to russia serbia is " much closer to russia , to a partner that does not impose conditions and can enable our development , " nikolic said after voting in belgrade .
the 6.7 million registered voters had to choose between the pro-european incumbent boris tadic and the ultra-nationalist tomislav nikolic .
tadic , who says that serbia must remain on its eu-course regardless of western support of kosovo 's secession , heads the democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , the senior partner in the cabinet coalition with prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia .
nikolic leads the opposition serbian radicals -lrb- srs -rrb- , the strongest single party in the country , which was a key part of slobodan milosevic 's regime until it was toppled in 2000 .
nikolic says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west over kosovo .
the difference in the run-off is however expected to be dramatically slight - some reports said that it could be less than 1 per cent and that the election may be decided by as few as 20,000 votes .
a referendum on east or west though the office of the president in serbia carries little real authority , the election carries a referendum-like quality because serbia has been wavering between east and west in its course .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has not had the support of his senior partner the conservative prime minister vojsilav kostunica has supported neither his senior coalition partner tadic , nor nikolic , with whom he shares a mistrust of the west .
kostunica , as nikolic , says that belgrade should stop its already stalled approach to european union membership because leading western countries support the secession of kosovo from serbia .
kosovo leaders , representing the 90-per-cent albanian majority , are expected to declare independence in the days or weeks after sunday 's vote in serbia .
with his once undisputed popularity now dramatically reduced , kostunica is likely to avoid early elections .
if tadic triumphs , the present coalition may continue as over the past year .
ds would however gain more credibility to steering serbia toward integration with eu , which stalled not only over kosovo , but also because serbia continues refusing to arrest wanted war crimes suspects .
fears a nikolic win would return serbia to isolation if nikolic wins , kostunica may try to drop tadic and the smallest partner in the existing coalition , the reformist g17 and replace them with nikolic and the srs , along with slobodan milosevic 's socialists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu serbs fear where nikolic may take them the pro-european camp in serbia has warned that nikolic 's win would effectively return serbia to isolation .
backing tadic and despite serbia 's failure to close the war crimes chapter , the eu has offered serbia a broad political and economic cooperation deal for signing on february 7 .
should nikolic win , however , the offer would " lose any meaning , " italian deputy foreign minister famiano crucianelli has said .
polling ends at 8 pm local time .
early results are normally expected within a few hours , but may this time be delayed if the score turns out to be as close as was anticipated . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the future of kosovo and its independence is also linked to the vote . voting has ended sunday in a tense presidential election run-off pitting the pro-european incumbent boris tadic against the nationalist challenger , tomislav nikolic . serbs turned out at a record pace , reflecting the referendum-like mood - though the president has mostly ceremonial duties , the outcome would signal which way voters want their country steered . nearly 63 per cent of the 6.7 million registered voters had cast their ballots with one hour remaining , the private election- monitoring agency cesid said . the final showing is to overshoot by a wide margin the 61 per cent from the first round two weeks ago . four years ago , after a series of attempts at electing a president failed owing to voter apathy , serbia was forced to scrap a legal minimum turnout requirement of 50 per cent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic urged serbia to remain on course for the eu that time , in june 2004 , tadic defeated nikolic in the run-off 53 to 47 per cent on a lowly 47 per cent turnout .
but this time the stakes are higher as serbia has been wavering on its european path . in this year 's contest , nikolic won 40 per cent to tadic 's 35.5 per cent of the votes in the first round on january 20 , but polls conducted between the two votes gave tadic a razor-thin edge of less than 1 per cent . serbia must stay the eu course , says tadic tadic says that belgrade must remain on course to join the eu even if leading western nations back the looming secession of serbia 's province kosovo .
" serbia is without doubt on its way to full membership of the eu , " he said after casting his ballot sunday . tadic 's opponent nikolic leads the opposition serbian radical party , the largest force in parliament and a key part of the former regime of slobodan milosevic . he says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west if it recognizes an independent and would instead seek closer ties with powers such as russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic said serbia was much closer to russia serbia is " much closer to russia , to a partner that does not impose conditions and can enable our development , " nikolic said after voting in belgrade .
the 6.7 million registered voters had to choose between the pro-european incumbent boris tadic and the ultra-nationalist tomislav nikolic .
tadic , who says that serbia must remain on its eu-course regardless of western support of kosovo 's secession , heads the democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , the senior partner in the cabinet coalition with prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia .
nikolic leads the opposition serbian radicals -lrb- srs -rrb- , the strongest single party in the country , which was a key part of slobodan milosevic 's regime until it was toppled in 2000 .
nikolic says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west over kosovo .
the difference in the run-off is however expected to be dramatically slight - some reports said that it could be less than 1 per cent and that the election may be decided by as few as 20,000 votes .
a referendum on east or west though the office of the president in serbia carries little real authority , the election carries a referendum-like quality because serbia has been wavering between east and west in its course .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has not had the support of his senior partner the conservative prime minister vojsilav kostunica has supported neither his senior coalition partner tadic , nor nikolic , with whom he shares a mistrust of the west .
kostunica , as nikolic , says that belgrade should stop its already stalled approach to european union membership because leading western countries support the secession of kosovo from serbia .
kosovo leaders , representing the 90-per-cent albanian majority , are expected to declare independence in the days or weeks after sunday 's vote in serbia .
with his once undisputed popularity now dramatically reduced , kostunica is likely to avoid early elections .
if tadic triumphs , the present coalition may continue as over the past year .
ds would however gain more credibility to steering serbia toward integration with eu , which stalled not only over kosovo , but also because serbia continues refusing to arrest wanted war crimes suspects .
fears a nikolic win would return serbia to isolation if nikolic wins , kostunica may try to drop tadic and the smallest partner in the existing coalition , the reformist g17 and replace them with nikolic and the srs , along with slobodan milosevic 's socialists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu serbs fear where nikolic may take them the pro-european camp in serbia has warned that nikolic 's win would effectively return serbia to isolation .
backing tadic and despite serbia 's failure to close the war crimes chapter , the eu has offered serbia a broad political and economic cooperation deal for signing on february 7 .
should nikolic win , however , the offer would " lose any meaning , " italian deputy foreign minister famiano crucianelli has said .
polling ends at 8 pm local time .

in europe 's largest science park , the experiment to merge science and industry is now taking off . located on the eastern outskirts of berlin , adlershof is a quick 20-minute train ride from the city center .
in gdr times adlershof was berlin 's celebrated socialist science mecca .
so when germany 's reunification threatened its further existence , the area embarked on an experiment : the creation of a science park , merging solar technology research with solar industry , in one winning equation . since 1993 , berlin has invested billions of euros in the area - billions the heavily indebted city does n't have .
but adlershof 's public relations manager , peter strunk said it was money well-invested in a bold vision , born of necessity . " this science park project was created to prevent us from social catastrophe after reunification , " strunk said .
" there were so many research facilities located here so instead of closing them down , a decision was made to create an integrated landscape of science and business , to re-establish those industrial structures that had to be dismantled . " a pioneering urban project the science park is embedded in adlershof 's overall urban planning concept , covering over four square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 square miles -rrb- .
its fresh urban landscape is still so new that it looks like a city whose virtual , graphic animation existence has simply been mounted onto the material world . adlershof is stream-lined and squeaky clean , with no mom and pop shops , quirky corners , or rough edges to add a bit of charm and irregularity to its neat , urban profile .
its main avenue is strewn with sleek , modern buildings of glass and steel housing scientific institutions and high tech companies . off the main strip are freshly-plowed streets named in honor of science icons , like albert einstein and max born .
and there 's 66 hectares -lrb- 163 acres -rrb- of land still left undeveloped , waiting to be sold , or rented . staying on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is a main customer of german solar technology one research institute with a long tradition in adlershof is the hahn-meitner institute .
klaus lips , the scientist leading thin-film solar cell reseach at the institute , was educated in marburg , germany , worked in colorado , but returned to germany when offered a position here . lips said adlershof is a solar scientist 's paradise , due to the close proximity of research and industry , and the unique , open dialogue and collaboration that exists between the two . " we work together with companies and establish network projects in which researchers , industry , and university students work together , " lips said , pointing out that the synergy of adlershof 's solar community especially benefits the upcoming generation of solar science researchers .

it 's currently the " fifth season " in cologne , and the usual rules are suspended .
this year , that means revelers can flout germany 's smoking ban . as the cologne carnival enters its most manic phase with women 's carnival day on thursday , germany 's new restrictions on smoking in bars and restaurants will be temporarily relaxed .
after all , given the general mayhem set to prevail in the city for the next few days , it would be a little incongruous to penalize partygoers hitting the streets of cologne for their annual carnival-season pub crawl ahead of rose monday simply for smoking .
police have their work cut out for them , stopping fights , breath-alizing drunk drivers and trying to prevent male revelers relieving themselves against walls and in gutters .
compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carnival is a chance to do exactly what you want it 's a compromise wholly in keeping with the carnival spirit - which is all about indulgence before abstinence .
historically , the date of rose monday is determined by the church calendar , taking place on the monday before ash wednesday , which in turn marks the beginning of lent leading up to good friday and easter .

every year , determined drinkers in fancy dress crowd through the city 's pubs and thick clouds of smoke are part of the experience the tipsy crowds often cheer at any mischief , and can turn hostile towards men in uniform , reports german news agency dpa .
while children enjoy watching the costume parades and the older generation might book a table at a variety show , the young crowd celebrates the six days of high carnival with all-night binges in the city 's many bars .
unenforceable " the enforceability of a smoking ban during carnival would have been just about zero , " hubert heller , proprietor of heller 's bierhaus , and two other leading cologne pubs told dpa .

in europe 's largest science park , the experiment to merge science and industry is now taking off . located on the eastern outskirts of berlin , adlershof is a quick 20-minute train ride from the city center .
in gdr times adlershof was berlin 's celebrated socialist science mecca .
so when germany 's reunification threatened its further existence , the area embarked on an experiment : the creation of a science park , merging solar technology research with solar industry , in one winning equation . since 1993 , berlin has invested billions of euros in the area - billions the heavily indebted city does n't have .
but adlershof 's public relations manager , peter strunk said it was money well-invested in a bold vision , born of necessity . " this science park project was created to prevent us from social catastrophe after reunification , " strunk said .
" there were so many research facilities located here so instead of closing them down , a decision was made to create an integrated landscape of science and business , to re-establish those industrial structures that had to be dismantled . " a pioneering urban project the science park is embedded in adlershof 's overall urban planning concept , covering over four square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 square miles -rrb- .
its fresh urban landscape is still so new that it looks like a city whose virtual , graphic animation existence has simply been mounted onto the material world . adlershof is stream-lined and squeaky clean , with no mom and pop shops , quirky corners , or rough edges to add a bit of charm and irregularity to its neat , urban profile .
its main avenue is strewn with sleek , modern buildings of glass and steel housing scientific institutions and high tech companies . off the main strip are freshly-plowed streets named in honor of science icons , like albert einstein and max born .
and there 's 66 hectares -lrb- 163 acres -rrb- of land still left undeveloped , waiting to be sold , or rented . staying on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is a main customer of german solar technology one research institute with a long tradition in adlershof is the hahn-meitner institute .
klaus lips , the scientist leading thin-film solar cell reseach at the institute , was educated in marburg , germany , worked in colorado , but returned to germany when offered a position here . lips said adlershof is a solar scientist 's paradise , due to the close proximity of research and industry , and the unique , open dialogue and collaboration that exists between the two . " we work together with companies and establish network projects in which researchers , industry , and university students work together , " lips said , pointing out that the synergy of adlershof 's solar community especially benefits the upcoming generation of solar science researchers . " our young students have excellent job opportunities here , because upcoming companies are looking for trained people , " he added . success story the solar cell company sulfurcell 's founding in 2003 was based on research done on at the hahn-meitner institute .
the company started small , but now employs 100 engineers and factory operators to manufacture thin-film , cis solar cell modules and solar roof tiles . sulfurcell 's ceo nikolaus meyer is a scientist-turned-businessman , involved in the research that led to the company 's creation , and stands firmly behind his product . " cis stands for copper indium disulfide , a new semi-conductor that allows you to use a very thin , conductor layer on glass to produce electricity , " meyer said . sales of sulfurcell 's initial production have been so successful that plans are underway to erect a larger , more automated production plant this year .
meyer said he is confident he 'll be able to bring down the price of his product , to compete with the prices of conventionally produced power within the next five years . meyer said it would have been impossible to set-up and operate his company anywhere but adlershof .
he said the constant support and input of the area 's research institutes are what keep his product state-of-the-art , and thereby competitive . slowly getting noticed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the world 's largest solar parks sits near leipzig , germany in the former east germany , the institute for silicon crystal research enjoyed close ties to the humboldt university 's science faculties nearby , and much of the institute 's current staff are humboldt graduates . recently the institute 's research growing silicon crystals layers directly onto glass panels caught the attention of the international energy company british petroleum , which is now financing their further research . this month , solon , germany 's largest solar cell company , also moved its extensive operations to adlershof .
a new start-up company named inventux is beginning operations there , and two major us solar power companies have shown recently interest in investing in the area . on a roll lips said he 's convinced that german advances in solar technology will enable the country to supply 25 percent of its electricity needs with solar power alone , within the next two decades . meyer from sulfurcell said he believes clean-tech and renewable energy will be germany 's major industries , in the future . " we have seen only the beginning of this industry , and that the technology developed in germany , is creating an excellent foundation for the future success of the industry , " he said . if adlershof 's solar industry continues to grow at its current rate , it has the chance to become the place to be for all significant solar technology players , and europe 's first solaropolis , in the years to come . leah mcdonnell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it looked like we were in a position .
we played quite well going forward and created chances but did n't finish it off and let the game out of our hands , " werder coach thomas schaaf said . schaaf had to juggle his team selection after injuries and other absences to key players but did not include midfielder mesut ozil , signed from schalke on thursday . bochum almost went in front when naldo deflected a cross which keeper tim wiese managed to deflect onto the bar with his leg . but after diego was foiled by jan lastuvka in goal and aaron hunt shot wide , jensen hit the net with a rising drive from just inside the area . bochum late show dents bremen 's title push bremen appeared well in control but auer netted from close range after a cross from japanese new signing shinji ono , who had come off the subs ' bench a minute earlier . ono was again the provider with a corner headed in by yahia to complete the misery for bremen and move bochum to 11th place , out of immediate relegation danger . bremen stay on 36 points , three points behind leaders bayern munich and three ahead of bayer leverkusen and sv hamburg , with schalke now fifth on 32 points . bayern , who earned a 2-1 win at hansa rostock friday evening , now meet bremen in munich next sunday , while leverkusen entertain hamburg on saturday in next weekend 's other big game . germany coach löw saw kuranyi in fine form in gelsenkirchen against his former club stuttgart as schalke ran out 4-1 winners . the striker , who has only just recovered from a lung infection , headed home powerfully from an ivan rakitic free-kick in the 32nd minute and then scrambled the ball home from close range in the 52nd . stuttgart got back in the game nine minutes later with a 30-metre free-kick from antonia da silva over the head of goalkeeper manuel neuer who was caught off his line . but schalke made sure when another rakitic free-kick was headed in on 76 minutes by heiko westermann - called up by löw for the germany squad for the first for wednesday 's friendly against austria . new signing ze roberto came off the substitutes ' bench in the 90th minute to complete the scoring for schalke in stoppage time .
hamburg miss chance to close gap in hamburg , szabolcs huszti opened the scoring from the penalty spot late in the first half for mid-table hanover before olic salvaged a draw in the 70th minute for hamburg , who have not beaten hanover at home in five attempts .

politics is power and power makes the world go round - and is the focus of his own films , he said . constantin gavras , better known as costa-gavras , has been named president of the jury at this year 's berlin film festival , which runs from feb .
7-17 .
born in greece in 1933 , his career as a film director took off with the 1969 movie " z. " dw-tv : costa-gavras , of course you will be watching a lot of films during the festival , but can you tell us what else your job as a jury president entails ? costa-gavras : i watch the movies , i 'll discuss with the jury and we 'll try to award the best movie , that 's all .
i 'm trying to be there as a " viewer , " not as a technician or someone who knows the cinema , which is not so easy , of course .
i try to be like any viewer - to be free of any ideological or aesthetical ideas .
the best movie has to get the award . the berlin film festival sees itself more as a political festival in that it gives political cinema a lot of attention .
does that correspond with your general idea of film-making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 58th berlin film festival opens on feb .
7 i think all festivals are political festivals in a way .
the berlin film festival is a bit more so , because they go and set a direction , which i think the cinema needs .
the general idea is that festivals should promote movies with a social content , not only movies which are just entertainment .
if you go back to the history of cinema , the most important movies have been more social-political . your films were once hailed as liberation from hollywood 's dictatorship .
but where does political cinema stand today ? it depends on the money .
right now , it sometimes depends on the united states .
it depends on the stars .
in the last three or four years we have seen very distinct movies about the problems in iraq and the oil problems because the big stars decided to do it .
the major companies did n't want to do it , but they felt obliged to make these movies because they wanted to please the stars - pleasing the stars means they can work together with them again and again . that 's a very new thing for cinema .
before , it was the directors or even the political situation around the world that used to push the companies and the producers to produce movies with strong political content . so , one can say that there is more political cinema in hollywood ... there is more in hollywood at the moment and i think in europe , too , because there are more and more big problems .
i think there is a kind of movement .
but personally i believe that all movies are political .
even the action movies .
they have a kind of social effect on the young public and the public in general .
that 's also political . what can cinema achieve now in a world where we are witnessing an increase of violence and a growing lack of political awareness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress diane kruger joins costa-gavras in the jury i think the cinema has to bring emotions to the public and speak rightly about the problems and then the audience can decide what to do .
the audience must be free and independent .
i do n't believe the cinema should impose ideas they do n't like .
i think the cinema is entertainment but it 's necessary to have some content too . does political cinema rule out entertainment and humor , or can they work together ? absolutely .
look at moliere , for example .
both work together .
in shakespeare you find the same things , or if you go through brecht , for example .
all the important theater has done that , and you can say the same thing about the cinema .
all the big directors - fritz lang , renoir , john ford , kazan , all of them - their movies have both and it works . in your films you have investigated the mechanisms of power during dictatorships and other times of suppression , like the holocaust for instance .
which issues interest you most today ? in our society , the most important issue is power - who has the power to do good or bad things .
i think all of us have power .
we have power over some people under us and other people have power over us because they are stronger than we are .
this pyramid of power - that 's politics .
take a big company like nokia , for example .
when they leave the country and leave thousands of people on the streets without jobs - that 's power .
this is the main issue in our society : the power we have and how we use it . so , power is your main issue . it 's the only issue , in my opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " amen " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- is one of costa-gavras ' films that looks at the role of power coming back to the berlin film festival , your job as jury president will start on feb .

what are you most looking forward to ? you know , when i go to the cinema i sit and i say , now make me happy , make me furious , make me laugh , make me cry .
those feelings are the best moments in a movie . after the festival , you are going to shoot your next movie .
can you tell us what " eden is west " is about ? it 's very difficult to explain a movie in a few seconds .
it 's a movie about today ; it 's a road-movie .
it 's about a young man who likes to go to parties because he thinks the western world is paradise and he discovers that it 's not much of a paradise . your birthday is during the festival , on feb .

the major companies did n't want to do it , but they felt obliged to make these movies because they wanted to please the stars - pleasing the stars means they can work together with them again and again . that 's a very new thing for cinema .
before , it was the directors or even the political situation around the world that used to push the companies and the producers to produce movies with strong political content . so , one can say that there is more political cinema in hollywood ... there is more in hollywood at the moment and i think in europe , too , because there are more and more big problems .
i think there is a kind of movement .
but personally i believe that all movies are political .
even the action movies .
they have a kind of social effect on the young public and the public in general .
that 's also political . what can cinema achieve now in a world where we are witnessing an increase of violence and a growing lack of political awareness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress diane kruger joins costa-gavras in the jury i think the cinema has to bring emotions to the public and speak rightly about the problems and then the audience can decide what to do .
the audience must be free and independent .
i do n't believe the cinema should impose ideas they do n't like .
i think the cinema is entertainment but it 's necessary to have some content too . does political cinema rule out entertainment and humor , or can they work together ? absolutely .
look at moliere , for example .
both work together .
in shakespeare you find the same things , or if you go through brecht , for example .
all the important theater has done that , and you can say the same thing about the cinema .
all the big directors - fritz lang , renoir , john ford , kazan , all of them - their movies have both and it works . in your films you have investigated the mechanisms of power during dictatorships and other times of suppression , like the holocaust for instance .
which issues interest you most today ? in our society , the most important issue is power - who has the power to do good or bad things .
i think all of us have power .
we have power over some people under us and other people have power over us because they are stronger than we are .
this pyramid of power - that 's politics .
take a big company like nokia , for example .
when they leave the country and leave thousands of people on the streets without jobs - that 's power .
this is the main issue in our society : the power we have and how we use it . so , power is your main issue . it 's the only issue , in my opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " amen " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- is one of costa-gavras ' films that looks at the role of power coming back to the berlin film festival , your job as jury president will start on feb .

it 's currently the " fifth season " in cologne , and the usual rules are suspended .
this year , that means revelers can flout germany 's smoking ban . as the cologne carnival enters its most manic phase with women 's carnival day on thursday , germany 's new restrictions on smoking in bars and restaurants will be temporarily relaxed .
after all , given the general mayhem set to prevail in the city for the next few days , it would be a little incongruous to penalize partygoers hitting the streets of cologne for their annual carnival-season pub crawl ahead of rose monday simply for smoking .
police have their work cut out for them , stopping fights , breath-alizing drunk drivers and trying to prevent male revelers relieving themselves against walls and in gutters .
compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carnival is a chance to do exactly what you want it 's a compromise wholly in keeping with the carnival spirit - which is all about indulgence before abstinence .
historically , the date of rose monday is determined by the church calendar , taking place on the monday before ash wednesday , which in turn marks the beginning of lent leading up to good friday and easter .
so with the prospect of self-control looming , the carnival season is a semi-lawless time when everyone gets a chance to lose their inhibitions .
obviously , that means quite a few people are going to want to smoke .
moreover , a survey by north rhine-westphalia 's hospitality industry reveals that 80 percent of bar regulars in the state are smokers .
legal loophole as of jan .
1 , 2008 , the third of germans who smoke have been banned from doing so in the pubs and restaurants of most of the country 's 16 states , with the rest of the country to follow later this year .
pubs are now required to confine smokers to separate rooms , although the ban will not take effect in north rhine-westphalia , where cologne is located , until july 1 .
but crucially , the state legislature has decided that the ban on smoking in main rooms will never apply during traditional festivals .

while children enjoy watching the costume parades and the older generation might book a table at a variety show , the young crowd celebrates the six days of high carnival with all-night binges in the city 's many bars .

before , it was the directors or even the political situation around the world that used to push the companies and the producers to produce movies with strong political content . so , one can say that there is more political cinema in hollywood ... there is more in hollywood at the moment and i think in europe , too , because there are more and more big problems .
i think there is a kind of movement .
but personally i believe that all movies are political .
even the action movies .
they have a kind of social effect on the young public and the public in general .
that 's also political . what can cinema achieve now in a world where we are witnessing an increase of violence and a growing lack of political awareness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress diane kruger joins costa-gavras in the jury i think the cinema has to bring emotions to the public and speak rightly about the problems and then the audience can decide what to do .
the audience must be free and independent .
i do n't believe the cinema should impose ideas they do n't like .
i think the cinema is entertainment but it 's necessary to have some content too . does political cinema rule out entertainment and humor , or can they work together ? absolutely .
look at moliere , for example .
both work together .
in shakespeare you find the same things , or if you go through brecht , for example .
all the important theater has done that , and you can say the same thing about the cinema .
all the big directors - fritz lang , renoir , john ford , kazan , all of them - their movies have both and it works . in your films you have investigated the mechanisms of power during dictatorships and other times of suppression , like the holocaust for instance .
which issues interest you most today ? in our society , the most important issue is power - who has the power to do good or bad things .
i think all of us have power .
we have power over some people under us and other people have power over us because they are stronger than we are .
this pyramid of power - that 's politics .
take a big company like nokia , for example .
when they leave the country and leave thousands of people on the streets without jobs - that 's power .
this is the main issue in our society : the power we have and how we use it . so , power is your main issue . it 's the only issue , in my opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " amen " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- is one of costa-gavras ' films that looks at the role of power coming back to the berlin film festival , your job as jury president will start on feb .

what are you most looking forward to ? you know , when i go to the cinema i sit and i say , now make me happy , make me furious , make me laugh , make me cry .
those feelings are the best moments in a movie . after the festival , you are going to shoot your next movie .
can you tell us what " eden is west " is about ? it 's very difficult to explain a movie in a few seconds .
it 's a movie about today ; it 's a road-movie .
it 's about a young man who likes to go to parties because he thinks the western world is paradise and he discovers that it 's not much of a paradise . your birthday is during the festival , on feb .
13 .
will you celebrate ?
what 's your birthday wish ? you know , i think , after a certain age , it 's not necessary to celebrate the age or the birthdays .
but it 's there , so what can i do ? so you have no plans and no wishes ? yes , one wish : not to celebrate . okay , but maybe you will see a good movie on that day . that would be a good celebration - a good present . interview : hans christoph von bock -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politics is power and power makes the world go round - and is the focus of his own films , he said . constantin gavras , better known as costa-gavras , has been named president of the jury at this year 's berlin film festival , which runs from feb .
7-17 .

i 'm trying to be there as a " viewer , " not as a technician or someone who knows the cinema , which is not so easy , of course .
i try to be like any viewer - to be free of any ideological or aesthetical ideas .
the best movie has to get the award . the berlin film festival sees itself more as a political festival in that it gives political cinema a lot of attention .
does that correspond with your general idea of film-making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 58th berlin film festival opens on feb .

the berlin film festival is a bit more so , because they go and set a direction , which i think the cinema needs .
the general idea is that festivals should promote movies with a social content , not only movies which are just entertainment .
if you go back to the history of cinema , the most important movies have been more social-political . your films were once hailed as liberation from hollywood 's dictatorship .

right now , it sometimes depends on the united states .
it depends on the stars .

it 's currently the " fifth season " in cologne , and the usual rules are suspended .
this year , that means revelers can flout germany 's smoking ban . as the cologne carnival enters its most manic phase with women 's carnival day on thursday , germany 's new restrictions on smoking in bars and restaurants will be temporarily relaxed .
after all , given the general mayhem set to prevail in the city for the next few days , it would be a little incongruous to penalize partygoers hitting the streets of cologne for their annual carnival-season pub crawl ahead of rose monday simply for smoking .
police have their work cut out for them , stopping fights , breath-alizing drunk drivers and trying to prevent male revelers relieving themselves against walls and in gutters .
compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carnival is a chance to do exactly what you want it 's a compromise wholly in keeping with the carnival spirit - which is all about indulgence before abstinence .
historically , the date of rose monday is determined by the church calendar , taking place on the monday before ash wednesday , which in turn marks the beginning of lent leading up to good friday and easter .
so with the prospect of self-control looming , the carnival season is a semi-lawless time when everyone gets a chance to lose their inhibitions .
obviously , that means quite a few people are going to want to smoke .
moreover , a survey by north rhine-westphalia 's hospitality industry reveals that 80 percent of bar regulars in the state are smokers .
legal loophole as of jan .
1 , 2008 , the third of germans who smoke have been banned from doing so in the pubs and restaurants of most of the country 's 16 states , with the rest of the country to follow later this year .
pubs are now required to confine smokers to separate rooms , although the ban will not take effect in north rhine-westphalia , where cologne is located , until july 1 .
but crucially , the state legislature has decided that the ban on smoking in main rooms will never apply during traditional festivals .
drunk and disorderly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are too busy to enforce the rules it 's just as well .
every year , determined drinkers in fancy dress crowd through the city 's pubs and thick clouds of smoke are part of the experience the tipsy crowds often cheer at any mischief , and can turn hostile towards men in uniform , reports german news agency dpa .
while children enjoy watching the costume parades and the older generation might book a table at a variety show , the young crowd celebrates the six days of high carnival with all-night binges in the city 's many bars .
unenforceable " the enforceability of a smoking ban during carnival would have been just about zero , " hubert heller , proprietor of heller 's bierhaus , and two other leading cologne pubs told dpa .
heller said the police will concentrate during the six days on serious crime and he believes bylaws officers will postpone minor complaints until after the organized mayhem has finished . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politics is power and power makes the world go round - and is the focus of his own films , he said . constantin gavras , better known as costa-gavras , has been named president of the jury at this year 's berlin film festival , which runs from feb .
7-17 .
born in greece in 1933 , his career as a film director took off with the 1969 movie " z. " dw-tv : costa-gavras , of course you will be watching a lot of films during the festival , but can you tell us what else your job as a jury president entails ? costa-gavras : i watch the movies , i 'll discuss with the jury and we 'll try to award the best movie , that 's all .
i 'm trying to be there as a " viewer , " not as a technician or someone who knows the cinema , which is not so easy , of course .
i try to be like any viewer - to be free of any ideological or aesthetical ideas .
the best movie has to get the award . the berlin film festival sees itself more as a political festival in that it gives political cinema a lot of attention .
does that correspond with your general idea of film-making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 58th berlin film festival opens on feb .
7 i think all festivals are political festivals in a way .
the berlin film festival is a bit more so , because they go and set a direction , which i think the cinema needs .
the general idea is that festivals should promote movies with a social content , not only movies which are just entertainment .
if you go back to the history of cinema , the most important movies have been more social-political . your films were once hailed as liberation from hollywood 's dictatorship .
but where does political cinema stand today ? it depends on the money .
right now , it sometimes depends on the united states .
it depends on the stars .
in the last three or four years we have seen very distinct movies about the problems in iraq and the oil problems because the big stars decided to do it .
the major companies did n't want to do it , but they felt obliged to make these movies because they wanted to please the stars - pleasing the stars means they can work together with them again and again . that 's a very new thing for cinema .
before , it was the directors or even the political situation around the world that used to push the companies and the producers to produce movies with strong political content . so , one can say that there is more political cinema in hollywood ... there is more in hollywood at the moment and i think in europe , too , because there are more and more big problems .
i think there is a kind of movement .
but personally i believe that all movies are political .
even the action movies .
they have a kind of social effect on the young public and the public in general .
that 's also political . what can cinema achieve now in a world where we are witnessing an increase of violence and a growing lack of political awareness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress diane kruger joins costa-gavras in the jury i think the cinema has to bring emotions to the public and speak rightly about the problems and then the audience can decide what to do .
the audience must be free and independent .
i do n't believe the cinema should impose ideas they do n't like .
i think the cinema is entertainment but it 's necessary to have some content too . does political cinema rule out entertainment and humor , or can they work together ? absolutely .
look at moliere , for example .
both work together .
in shakespeare you find the same things , or if you go through brecht , for example .
all the important theater has done that , and you can say the same thing about the cinema .
all the big directors - fritz lang , renoir , john ford , kazan , all of them - their movies have both and it works . in your films you have investigated the mechanisms of power during dictatorships and other times of suppression , like the holocaust for instance .
which issues interest you most today ? in our society , the most important issue is power - who has the power to do good or bad things .
i think all of us have power .
we have power over some people under us and other people have power over us because they are stronger than we are .
this pyramid of power - that 's politics .
take a big company like nokia , for example .
when they leave the country and leave thousands of people on the streets without jobs - that 's power .
this is the main issue in our society : the power we have and how we use it . so , power is your main issue . it 's the only issue , in my opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " amen " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- is one of costa-gavras ' films that looks at the role of power coming back to the berlin film festival , your job as jury president will start on feb .

" it looked like we were in a position .

in europe 's largest science park , the experiment to merge science and industry is now taking off . located on the eastern outskirts of berlin , adlershof is a quick 20-minute train ride from the city center .
in gdr times adlershof was berlin 's celebrated socialist science mecca .
so when germany 's reunification threatened its further existence , the area embarked on an experiment : the creation of a science park , merging solar technology research with solar industry , in one winning equation . since 1993 , berlin has invested billions of euros in the area - billions the heavily indebted city does n't have .
but adlershof 's public relations manager , peter strunk said it was money well-invested in a bold vision , born of necessity . " this science park project was created to prevent us from social catastrophe after reunification , " strunk said .
" there were so many research facilities located here so instead of closing them down , a decision was made to create an integrated landscape of science and business , to re-establish those industrial structures that had to be dismantled . " a pioneering urban project the science park is embedded in adlershof 's overall urban planning concept , covering over four square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 square miles -rrb- .
its fresh urban landscape is still so new that it looks like a city whose virtual , graphic animation existence has simply been mounted onto the material world . adlershof is stream-lined and squeaky clean , with no mom and pop shops , quirky corners , or rough edges to add a bit of charm and irregularity to its neat , urban profile .
its main avenue is strewn with sleek , modern buildings of glass and steel housing scientific institutions and high tech companies . off the main strip are freshly-plowed streets named in honor of science icons , like albert einstein and max born .

klaus lips , the scientist leading thin-film solar cell reseach at the institute , was educated in marburg , germany , worked in colorado , but returned to germany when offered a position here . lips said adlershof is a solar scientist 's paradise , due to the close proximity of research and industry , and the unique , open dialogue and collaboration that exists between the two . " we work together with companies and establish network projects in which researchers , industry , and university students work together , " lips said , pointing out that the synergy of adlershof 's solar community especially benefits the upcoming generation of solar science researchers . " our young students have excellent job opportunities here , because upcoming companies are looking for trained people , " he added . success story the solar cell company sulfurcell 's founding in 2003 was based on research done on at the hahn-meitner institute .
the company started small , but now employs 100 engineers and factory operators to manufacture thin-film , cis solar cell modules and solar roof tiles . sulfurcell 's ceo nikolaus meyer is a scientist-turned-businessman , involved in the research that led to the company 's creation , and stands firmly behind his product . " cis stands for copper indium disulfide , a new semi-conductor that allows you to use a very thin , conductor layer on glass to produce electricity , " meyer said . sales of sulfurcell 's initial production have been so successful that plans are underway to erect a larger , more automated production plant this year .
meyer said he is confident he 'll be able to bring down the price of his product , to compete with the prices of conventionally produced power within the next five years . meyer said it would have been impossible to set-up and operate his company anywhere but adlershof .

it 's currently the " fifth season " in cologne , and the usual rules are suspended .
this year , that means revelers can flout germany 's smoking ban . as the cologne carnival enters its most manic phase with women 's carnival day on thursday , germany 's new restrictions on smoking in bars and restaurants will be temporarily relaxed .
after all , given the general mayhem set to prevail in the city for the next few days , it would be a little incongruous to penalize partygoers hitting the streets of cologne for their annual carnival-season pub crawl ahead of rose monday simply for smoking .
police have their work cut out for them , stopping fights , breath-alizing drunk drivers and trying to prevent male revelers relieving themselves against walls and in gutters .
compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carnival is a chance to do exactly what you want it 's a compromise wholly in keeping with the carnival spirit - which is all about indulgence before abstinence .
historically , the date of rose monday is determined by the church calendar , taking place on the monday before ash wednesday , which in turn marks the beginning of lent leading up to good friday and easter .
so with the prospect of self-control looming , the carnival season is a semi-lawless time when everyone gets a chance to lose their inhibitions .
obviously , that means quite a few people are going to want to smoke .
moreover , a survey by north rhine-westphalia 's hospitality industry reveals that 80 percent of bar regulars in the state are smokers .
legal loophole as of jan .
1 , 2008 , the third of germans who smoke have been banned from doing so in the pubs and restaurants of most of the country 's 16 states , with the rest of the country to follow later this year .
pubs are now required to confine smokers to separate rooms , although the ban will not take effect in north rhine-westphalia , where cologne is located , until july 1 .
but crucially , the state legislature has decided that the ban on smoking in main rooms will never apply during traditional festivals .
drunk and disorderly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are too busy to enforce the rules it 's just as well .
every year , determined drinkers in fancy dress crowd through the city 's pubs and thick clouds of smoke are part of the experience the tipsy crowds often cheer at any mischief , and can turn hostile towards men in uniform , reports german news agency dpa .
while children enjoy watching the costume parades and the older generation might book a table at a variety show , the young crowd celebrates the six days of high carnival with all-night binges in the city 's many bars .
unenforceable " the enforceability of a smoking ban during carnival would have been just about zero , " hubert heller , proprietor of heller 's bierhaus , and two other leading cologne pubs told dpa .
heller said the police will concentrate during the six days on serious crime and he believes bylaws officers will postpone minor complaints until after the organized mayhem has finished . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in europe 's largest science park , the experiment to merge science and industry is now taking off . located on the eastern outskirts of berlin , adlershof is a quick 20-minute train ride from the city center .
in gdr times adlershof was berlin 's celebrated socialist science mecca .
so when germany 's reunification threatened its further existence , the area embarked on an experiment : the creation of a science park , merging solar technology research with solar industry , in one winning equation . since 1993 , berlin has invested billions of euros in the area - billions the heavily indebted city does n't have .
but adlershof 's public relations manager , peter strunk said it was money well-invested in a bold vision , born of necessity . " this science park project was created to prevent us from social catastrophe after reunification , " strunk said .
" there were so many research facilities located here so instead of closing them down , a decision was made to create an integrated landscape of science and business , to re-establish those industrial structures that had to be dismantled . " a pioneering urban project the science park is embedded in adlershof 's overall urban planning concept , covering over four square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 square miles -rrb- .
its fresh urban landscape is still so new that it looks like a city whose virtual , graphic animation existence has simply been mounted onto the material world . adlershof is stream-lined and squeaky clean , with no mom and pop shops , quirky corners , or rough edges to add a bit of charm and irregularity to its neat , urban profile .
its main avenue is strewn with sleek , modern buildings of glass and steel housing scientific institutions and high tech companies . off the main strip are freshly-plowed streets named in honor of science icons , like albert einstein and max born .
and there 's 66 hectares -lrb- 163 acres -rrb- of land still left undeveloped , waiting to be sold , or rented . staying on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is a main customer of german solar technology one research institute with a long tradition in adlershof is the hahn-meitner institute .
klaus lips , the scientist leading thin-film solar cell reseach at the institute , was educated in marburg , germany , worked in colorado , but returned to germany when offered a position here . lips said adlershof is a solar scientist 's paradise , due to the close proximity of research and industry , and the unique , open dialogue and collaboration that exists between the two . " we work together with companies and establish network projects in which researchers , industry , and university students work together , " lips said , pointing out that the synergy of adlershof 's solar community especially benefits the upcoming generation of solar science researchers . " our young students have excellent job opportunities here , because upcoming companies are looking for trained people , " he added . success story the solar cell company sulfurcell 's founding in 2003 was based on research done on at the hahn-meitner institute .
the company started small , but now employs 100 engineers and factory operators to manufacture thin-film , cis solar cell modules and solar roof tiles . sulfurcell 's ceo nikolaus meyer is a scientist-turned-businessman , involved in the research that led to the company 's creation , and stands firmly behind his product . " cis stands for copper indium disulfide , a new semi-conductor that allows you to use a very thin , conductor layer on glass to produce electricity , " meyer said . sales of sulfurcell 's initial production have been so successful that plans are underway to erect a larger , more automated production plant this year .
meyer said he is confident he 'll be able to bring down the price of his product , to compete with the prices of conventionally produced power within the next five years . meyer said it would have been impossible to set-up and operate his company anywhere but adlershof .
he said the constant support and input of the area 's research institutes are what keep his product state-of-the-art , and thereby competitive . slowly getting noticed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the world 's largest solar parks sits near leipzig , germany in the former east germany , the institute for silicon crystal research enjoyed close ties to the humboldt university 's science faculties nearby , and much of the institute 's current staff are humboldt graduates . recently the institute 's research growing silicon crystals layers directly onto glass panels caught the attention of the international energy company british petroleum , which is now financing their further research . this month , solon , germany 's largest solar cell company , also moved its extensive operations to adlershof .
a new start-up company named inventux is beginning operations there , and two major us solar power companies have shown recently interest in investing in the area . on a roll lips said he 's convinced that german advances in solar technology will enable the country to supply 25 percent of its electricity needs with solar power alone , within the next two decades . meyer from sulfurcell said he believes clean-tech and renewable energy will be germany 's major industries , in the future . " we have seen only the beginning of this industry , and that the technology developed in germany , is creating an excellent foundation for the future success of the industry , " he said . if adlershof 's solar industry continues to grow at its current rate , it has the chance to become the place to be for all significant solar technology players , and europe 's first solaropolis , in the years to come . leah mcdonnell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the future of kosovo and its independence is also linked to the vote . voting has ended sunday in a tense presidential election run-off pitting the pro-european incumbent boris tadic against the nationalist challenger , tomislav nikolic . serbs turned out at a record pace , reflecting the referendum-like mood - though the president has mostly ceremonial duties , the outcome would signal which way voters want their country steered . nearly 63 per cent of the 6.7 million registered voters had cast their ballots with one hour remaining , the private election- monitoring agency cesid said . the final showing is to overshoot by a wide margin the 61 per cent from the first round two weeks ago . four years ago , after a series of attempts at electing a president failed owing to voter apathy , serbia was forced to scrap a legal minimum turnout requirement of 50 per cent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic urged serbia to remain on course for the eu that time , in june 2004 , tadic defeated nikolic in the run-off 53 to 47 per cent on a lowly 47 per cent turnout .
but this time the stakes are higher as serbia has been wavering on its european path . in this year 's contest , nikolic won 40 per cent to tadic 's 35.5 per cent of the votes in the first round on january 20 , but polls conducted between the two votes gave tadic a razor-thin edge of less than 1 per cent . serbia must stay the eu course , says tadic tadic says that belgrade must remain on course to join the eu even if leading western nations back the looming secession of serbia 's province kosovo .
" serbia is without doubt on its way to full membership of the eu , " he said after casting his ballot sunday . tadic 's opponent nikolic leads the opposition serbian radical party , the largest force in parliament and a key part of the former regime of slobodan milosevic . he says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west if it recognizes an independent and would instead seek closer ties with powers such as russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic said serbia was much closer to russia serbia is " much closer to russia , to a partner that does not impose conditions and can enable our development , " nikolic said after voting in belgrade .
the 6.7 million registered voters had to choose between the pro-european incumbent boris tadic and the ultra-nationalist tomislav nikolic .
tadic , who says that serbia must remain on its eu-course regardless of western support of kosovo 's secession , heads the democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , the senior partner in the cabinet coalition with prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia .
nikolic leads the opposition serbian radicals -lrb- srs -rrb- , the strongest single party in the country , which was a key part of slobodan milosevic 's regime until it was toppled in 2000 .
nikolic says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west over kosovo .
the difference in the run-off is however expected to be dramatically slight - some reports said that it could be less than 1 per cent and that the election may be decided by as few as 20,000 votes .
a referendum on east or west though the office of the president in serbia carries little real authority , the election carries a referendum-like quality because serbia has been wavering between east and west in its course .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has not had the support of his senior partner the conservative prime minister vojsilav kostunica has supported neither his senior coalition partner tadic , nor nikolic , with whom he shares a mistrust of the west .
kostunica , as nikolic , says that belgrade should stop its already stalled approach to european union membership because leading western countries support the secession of kosovo from serbia .
kosovo leaders , representing the 90-per-cent albanian majority , are expected to declare independence in the days or weeks after sunday 's vote in serbia .
with his once undisputed popularity now dramatically reduced , kostunica is likely to avoid early elections .
if tadic triumphs , the present coalition may continue as over the past year .
ds would however gain more credibility to steering serbia toward integration with eu , which stalled not only over kosovo , but also because serbia continues refusing to arrest wanted war crimes suspects .
fears a nikolic win would return serbia to isolation if nikolic wins , kostunica may try to drop tadic and the smallest partner in the existing coalition , the reformist g17 and replace them with nikolic and the srs , along with slobodan milosevic 's socialists .

it 's currently the " fifth season " in cologne , and the usual rules are suspended .
this year , that means revelers can flout germany 's smoking ban . as the cologne carnival enters its most manic phase with women 's carnival day on thursday , germany 's new restrictions on smoking in bars and restaurants will be temporarily relaxed .
after all , given the general mayhem set to prevail in the city for the next few days , it would be a little incongruous to penalize partygoers hitting the streets of cologne for their annual carnival-season pub crawl ahead of rose monday simply for smoking .
police have their work cut out for them , stopping fights , breath-alizing drunk drivers and trying to prevent male revelers relieving themselves against walls and in gutters .
compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carnival is a chance to do exactly what you want it 's a compromise wholly in keeping with the carnival spirit - which is all about indulgence before abstinence .
historically , the date of rose monday is determined by the church calendar , taking place on the monday before ash wednesday , which in turn marks the beginning of lent leading up to good friday and easter .
so with the prospect of self-control looming , the carnival season is a semi-lawless time when everyone gets a chance to lose their inhibitions .
obviously , that means quite a few people are going to want to smoke .
moreover , a survey by north rhine-westphalia 's hospitality industry reveals that 80 percent of bar regulars in the state are smokers .
legal loophole as of jan .
1 , 2008 , the third of germans who smoke have been banned from doing so in the pubs and restaurants of most of the country 's 16 states , with the rest of the country to follow later this year .
pubs are now required to confine smokers to separate rooms , although the ban will not take effect in north rhine-westphalia , where cologne is located , until july 1 .
but crucially , the state legislature has decided that the ban on smoking in main rooms will never apply during traditional festivals .
drunk and disorderly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are too busy to enforce the rules it 's just as well .
every year , determined drinkers in fancy dress crowd through the city 's pubs and thick clouds of smoke are part of the experience the tipsy crowds often cheer at any mischief , and can turn hostile towards men in uniform , reports german news agency dpa .
while children enjoy watching the costume parades and the older generation might book a table at a variety show , the young crowd celebrates the six days of high carnival with all-night binges in the city 's many bars .
unenforceable " the enforceability of a smoking ban during carnival would have been just about zero , " hubert heller , proprietor of heller 's bierhaus , and two other leading cologne pubs told dpa .
heller said the police will concentrate during the six days on serious crime and he believes bylaws officers will postpone minor complaints until after the organized mayhem has finished . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the future of kosovo and its independence is also linked to the vote . voting has ended sunday in a tense presidential election run-off pitting the pro-european incumbent boris tadic against the nationalist challenger , tomislav nikolic . serbs turned out at a record pace , reflecting the referendum-like mood - though the president has mostly ceremonial duties , the outcome would signal which way voters want their country steered . nearly 63 per cent of the 6.7 million registered voters had cast their ballots with one hour remaining , the private election- monitoring agency cesid said . the final showing is to overshoot by a wide margin the 61 per cent from the first round two weeks ago . four years ago , after a series of attempts at electing a president failed owing to voter apathy , serbia was forced to scrap a legal minimum turnout requirement of 50 per cent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic urged serbia to remain on course for the eu that time , in june 2004 , tadic defeated nikolic in the run-off 53 to 47 per cent on a lowly 47 per cent turnout .
but this time the stakes are higher as serbia has been wavering on its european path . in this year 's contest , nikolic won 40 per cent to tadic 's 35.5 per cent of the votes in the first round on january 20 , but polls conducted between the two votes gave tadic a razor-thin edge of less than 1 per cent . serbia must stay the eu course , says tadic tadic says that belgrade must remain on course to join the eu even if leading western nations back the looming secession of serbia 's province kosovo .
" serbia is without doubt on its way to full membership of the eu , " he said after casting his ballot sunday . tadic 's opponent nikolic leads the opposition serbian radical party , the largest force in parliament and a key part of the former regime of slobodan milosevic . he says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west if it recognizes an independent and would instead seek closer ties with powers such as russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic said serbia was much closer to russia serbia is " much closer to russia , to a partner that does not impose conditions and can enable our development , " nikolic said after voting in belgrade .
the 6.7 million registered voters had to choose between the pro-european incumbent boris tadic and the ultra-nationalist tomislav nikolic .
tadic , who says that serbia must remain on its eu-course regardless of western support of kosovo 's secession , heads the democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , the senior partner in the cabinet coalition with prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia .
nikolic leads the opposition serbian radicals -lrb- srs -rrb- , the strongest single party in the country , which was a key part of slobodan milosevic 's regime until it was toppled in 2000 .
nikolic says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west over kosovo .
the difference in the run-off is however expected to be dramatically slight - some reports said that it could be less than 1 per cent and that the election may be decided by as few as 20,000 votes .
a referendum on east or west though the office of the president in serbia carries little real authority , the election carries a referendum-like quality because serbia has been wavering between east and west in its course .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has not had the support of his senior partner the conservative prime minister vojsilav kostunica has supported neither his senior coalition partner tadic , nor nikolic , with whom he shares a mistrust of the west .
kostunica , as nikolic , says that belgrade should stop its already stalled approach to european union membership because leading western countries support the secession of kosovo from serbia .
kosovo leaders , representing the 90-per-cent albanian majority , are expected to declare independence in the days or weeks after sunday 's vote in serbia .
with his once undisputed popularity now dramatically reduced , kostunica is likely to avoid early elections .
if tadic triumphs , the present coalition may continue as over the past year .
ds would however gain more credibility to steering serbia toward integration with eu , which stalled not only over kosovo , but also because serbia continues refusing to arrest wanted war crimes suspects .
fears a nikolic win would return serbia to isolation if nikolic wins , kostunica may try to drop tadic and the smallest partner in the existing coalition , the reformist g17 and replace them with nikolic and the srs , along with slobodan milosevic 's socialists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu serbs fear where nikolic may take them the pro-european camp in serbia has warned that nikolic 's win would effectively return serbia to isolation .
backing tadic and despite serbia 's failure to close the war crimes chapter , the eu has offered serbia a broad political and economic cooperation deal for signing on february 7 .
should nikolic win , however , the offer would " lose any meaning , " italian deputy foreign minister famiano crucianelli has said .
polling ends at 8 pm local time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 03.02.2008 berlin aims to become europe 's capital of solar technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar modules like these are designed in berlin berlin 's adlershof district is striving to become the place to be when it comes to solar technology .
in europe 's largest science park , the experiment to merge science and industry is now taking off . located on the eastern outskirts of berlin , adlershof is a quick 20-minute train ride from the city center .
in gdr times adlershof was berlin 's celebrated socialist science mecca .
so when germany 's reunification threatened its further existence , the area embarked on an experiment : the creation of a science park , merging solar technology research with solar industry , in one winning equation . since 1993 , berlin has invested billions of euros in the area - billions the heavily indebted city does n't have .
but adlershof 's public relations manager , peter strunk said it was money well-invested in a bold vision , born of necessity . " this science park project was created to prevent us from social catastrophe after reunification , " strunk said .
" there were so many research facilities located here so instead of closing them down , a decision was made to create an integrated landscape of science and business , to re-establish those industrial structures that had to be dismantled . " a pioneering urban project the science park is embedded in adlershof 's overall urban planning concept , covering over four square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 square miles -rrb- .
its fresh urban landscape is still so new that it looks like a city whose virtual , graphic animation existence has simply been mounted onto the material world . adlershof is stream-lined and squeaky clean , with no mom and pop shops , quirky corners , or rough edges to add a bit of charm and irregularity to its neat , urban profile .
its main avenue is strewn with sleek , modern buildings of glass and steel housing scientific institutions and high tech companies . off the main strip are freshly-plowed streets named in honor of science icons , like albert einstein and max born .
and there 's 66 hectares -lrb- 163 acres -rrb- of land still left undeveloped , waiting to be sold , or rented . staying on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is a main customer of german solar technology one research institute with a long tradition in adlershof is the hahn-meitner institute .
klaus lips , the scientist leading thin-film solar cell reseach at the institute , was educated in marburg , germany , worked in colorado , but returned to germany when offered a position here . lips said adlershof is a solar scientist 's paradise , due to the close proximity of research and industry , and the unique , open dialogue and collaboration that exists between the two . " we work together with companies and establish network projects in which researchers , industry , and university students work together , " lips said , pointing out that the synergy of adlershof 's solar community especially benefits the upcoming generation of solar science researchers . " our young students have excellent job opportunities here , because upcoming companies are looking for trained people , " he added . success story the solar cell company sulfurcell 's founding in 2003 was based on research done on at the hahn-meitner institute .
the company started small , but now employs 100 engineers and factory operators to manufacture thin-film , cis solar cell modules and solar roof tiles . sulfurcell 's ceo nikolaus meyer is a scientist-turned-businessman , involved in the research that led to the company 's creation , and stands firmly behind his product .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 03.02.2008 cinema is always political , says star director costa-gavras großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costa-gavras ' next movie will be filmed in greece , his country of birth all movies are political , film director costa-gavras told dw ahead of the berlin film festival .
politics is power and power makes the world go round - and is the focus of his own films , he said . constantin gavras , better known as costa-gavras , has been named president of the jury at this year 's berlin film festival , which runs from feb .
7-17 .
born in greece in 1933 , his career as a film director took off with the 1969 movie " z. " dw-tv : costa-gavras , of course you will be watching a lot of films during the festival , but can you tell us what else your job as a jury president entails ? costa-gavras : i watch the movies , i 'll discuss with the jury and we 'll try to award the best movie , that 's all .
i 'm trying to be there as a " viewer , " not as a technician or someone who knows the cinema , which is not so easy , of course .
i try to be like any viewer - to be free of any ideological or aesthetical ideas .
the best movie has to get the award . the berlin film festival sees itself more as a political festival in that it gives political cinema a lot of attention .
does that correspond with your general idea of film-making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 58th berlin film festival opens on feb .
7 i think all festivals are political festivals in a way .
the berlin film festival is a bit more so , because they go and set a direction , which i think the cinema needs .
the general idea is that festivals should promote movies with a social content , not only movies which are just entertainment .
if you go back to the history of cinema , the most important movies have been more social-political . your films were once hailed as liberation from hollywood 's dictatorship .
but where does political cinema stand today ? it depends on the money .
right now , it sometimes depends on the united states .
it depends on the stars .
in the last three or four years we have seen very distinct movies about the problems in iraq and the oil problems because the big stars decided to do it .
the major companies did n't want to do it , but they felt obliged to make these movies because they wanted to please the stars - pleasing the stars means they can work together with them again and again . that 's a very new thing for cinema .
before , it was the directors or even the political situation around the world that used to push the companies and the producers to produce movies with strong political content . so , one can say that there is more political cinema in hollywood ... there is more in hollywood at the moment and i think in europe , too , because there are more and more big problems .
i think there is a kind of movement .
but personally i believe that all movies are political .
even the action movies .
they have a kind of social effect on the young public and the public in general .
that 's also political . what can cinema achieve now in a world where we are witnessing an increase of violence and a growing lack of political awareness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress diane kruger joins costa-gavras in the jury i think the cinema has to bring emotions to the public and speak rightly about the problems and then the audience can decide what to do .
the audience must be free and independent .
i do n't believe the cinema should impose ideas they do n't like .
i think the cinema is entertainment but it 's necessary to have some content too . does political cinema rule out entertainment and humor , or can they work together ? absolutely .
look at moliere , for example .
both work together .
in shakespeare you find the same things , or if you go through brecht , for example .
all the important theater has done that , and you can say the same thing about the cinema .
all the big directors - fritz lang , renoir , john ford , kazan , all of them - their movies have both and it works . in your films you have investigated the mechanisms of power during dictatorships and other times of suppression , like the holocaust for instance .
which issues interest you most today ? in our society , the most important issue is power - who has the power to do good or bad things .
i think all of us have power .
we have power over some people under us and other people have power over us because they are stronger than we are .
this pyramid of power - that 's politics .
take a big company like nokia , for example .
when they leave the country and leave thousands of people on the streets without jobs - that 's power .
this is the main issue in our society : the power we have and how we use it . so , power is your main issue . it 's the only issue , in my opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " amen " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- is one of costa-gavras ' films that looks at the role of power coming back to the berlin film festival , your job as jury president will start on feb .
7 .
what are you most looking forward to ? you know , when i go to the cinema i sit and i say , now make me happy , make me furious , make me laugh , make me cry .
those feelings are the best moments in a movie . after the festival , you are going to shoot your next movie .
can you tell us what " eden is west " is about ? it 's very difficult to explain a movie in a few seconds .
it 's a movie about today ; it 's a road-movie .
it 's about a young man who likes to go to parties because he thinks the western world is paradise and he discovers that it 's not much of a paradise . your birthday is during the festival , on feb .
13 .
will you celebrate ?
what 's your birthday wish ? you know , i think , after a certain age , it 's not necessary to celebrate the age or the birthdays .
but it 's there , so what can i do ? so you have no plans and no wishes ? yes , one wish : not to celebrate . okay , but maybe you will see a good movie on that day . that would be a good celebration - a good present . interview : hans christoph von bock -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the future of kosovo and its independence is also linked to the vote . voting has ended sunday in a tense presidential election run-off pitting the pro-european incumbent boris tadic against the nationalist challenger , tomislav nikolic . serbs turned out at a record pace , reflecting the referendum-like mood - though the president has mostly ceremonial duties , the outcome would signal which way voters want their country steered . nearly 63 per cent of the 6.7 million registered voters had cast their ballots with one hour remaining , the private election- monitoring agency cesid said . the final showing is to overshoot by a wide margin the 61 per cent from the first round two weeks ago . four years ago , after a series of attempts at electing a president failed owing to voter apathy , serbia was forced to scrap a legal minimum turnout requirement of 50 per cent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic urged serbia to remain on course for the eu that time , in june 2004 , tadic defeated nikolic in the run-off 53 to 47 per cent on a lowly 47 per cent turnout .
but this time the stakes are higher as serbia has been wavering on its european path . in this year 's contest , nikolic won 40 per cent to tadic 's 35.5 per cent of the votes in the first round on january 20 , but polls conducted between the two votes gave tadic a razor-thin edge of less than 1 per cent . serbia must stay the eu course , says tadic tadic says that belgrade must remain on course to join the eu even if leading western nations back the looming secession of serbia 's province kosovo .
" serbia is without doubt on its way to full membership of the eu , " he said after casting his ballot sunday . tadic 's opponent nikolic leads the opposition serbian radical party , the largest force in parliament and a key part of the former regime of slobodan milosevic . he says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west if it recognizes an independent and would instead seek closer ties with powers such as russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic said serbia was much closer to russia serbia is " much closer to russia , to a partner that does not impose conditions and can enable our development , " nikolic said after voting in belgrade .
the 6.7 million registered voters had to choose between the pro-european incumbent boris tadic and the ultra-nationalist tomislav nikolic .
tadic , who says that serbia must remain on its eu-course regardless of western support of kosovo 's secession , heads the democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , the senior partner in the cabinet coalition with prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia .
nikolic leads the opposition serbian radicals -lrb- srs -rrb- , the strongest single party in the country , which was a key part of slobodan milosevic 's regime until it was toppled in 2000 .
nikolic says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west over kosovo .
the difference in the run-off is however expected to be dramatically slight - some reports said that it could be less than 1 per cent and that the election may be decided by as few as 20,000 votes .
a referendum on east or west though the office of the president in serbia carries little real authority , the election carries a referendum-like quality because serbia has been wavering between east and west in its course .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has not had the support of his senior partner the conservative prime minister vojsilav kostunica has supported neither his senior coalition partner tadic , nor nikolic , with whom he shares a mistrust of the west .
kostunica , as nikolic , says that belgrade should stop its already stalled approach to european union membership because leading western countries support the secession of kosovo from serbia .
kosovo leaders , representing the 90-per-cent albanian majority , are expected to declare independence in the days or weeks after sunday 's vote in serbia .
with his once undisputed popularity now dramatically reduced , kostunica is likely to avoid early elections .
if tadic triumphs , the present coalition may continue as over the past year .
ds would however gain more credibility to steering serbia toward integration with eu , which stalled not only over kosovo , but also because serbia continues refusing to arrest wanted war crimes suspects .
fears a nikolic win would return serbia to isolation if nikolic wins , kostunica may try to drop tadic and the smallest partner in the existing coalition , the reformist g17 and replace them with nikolic and the srs , along with slobodan milosevic 's socialists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu serbs fear where nikolic may take them the pro-european camp in serbia has warned that nikolic 's win would effectively return serbia to isolation .
backing tadic and despite serbia 's failure to close the war crimes chapter , the eu has offered serbia a broad political and economic cooperation deal for signing on february 7 .
should nikolic win , however , the offer would " lose any meaning , " italian deputy foreign minister famiano crucianelli has said .
polling ends at 8 pm local time .
early results are normally expected within a few hours , but may this time be delayed if the score turns out to be as close as was anticipated . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 03.02.2008 cinema is always political , says star director costa-gavras großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costa-gavras ' next movie will be filmed in greece , his country of birth all movies are political , film director costa-gavras told dw ahead of the berlin film festival .
politics is power and power makes the world go round - and is the focus of his own films , he said . constantin gavras , better known as costa-gavras , has been named president of the jury at this year 's berlin film festival , which runs from feb .
7-17 .
born in greece in 1933 , his career as a film director took off with the 1969 movie " z. " dw-tv : costa-gavras , of course you will be watching a lot of films during the festival , but can you tell us what else your job as a jury president entails ? costa-gavras : i watch the movies , i 'll discuss with the jury and we 'll try to award the best movie , that 's all .
i 'm trying to be there as a " viewer , " not as a technician or someone who knows the cinema , which is not so easy , of course .
i try to be like any viewer - to be free of any ideological or aesthetical ideas .
the best movie has to get the award . the berlin film festival sees itself more as a political festival in that it gives political cinema a lot of attention .
does that correspond with your general idea of film-making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 58th berlin film festival opens on feb .
7 i think all festivals are political festivals in a way .
the berlin film festival is a bit more so , because they go and set a direction , which i think the cinema needs .
the general idea is that festivals should promote movies with a social content , not only movies which are just entertainment .
if you go back to the history of cinema , the most important movies have been more social-political . your films were once hailed as liberation from hollywood 's dictatorship .
but where does political cinema stand today ? it depends on the money .
right now , it sometimes depends on the united states .
it depends on the stars .
in the last three or four years we have seen very distinct movies about the problems in iraq and the oil problems because the big stars decided to do it .
the major companies did n't want to do it , but they felt obliged to make these movies because they wanted to please the stars - pleasing the stars means they can work together with them again and again . that 's a very new thing for cinema .
before , it was the directors or even the political situation around the world that used to push the companies and the producers to produce movies with strong political content . so , one can say that there is more political cinema in hollywood ... there is more in hollywood at the moment and i think in europe , too , because there are more and more big problems .
i think there is a kind of movement .
but personally i believe that all movies are political .
even the action movies .
they have a kind of social effect on the young public and the public in general .
that 's also political . what can cinema achieve now in a world where we are witnessing an increase of violence and a growing lack of political awareness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress diane kruger joins costa-gavras in the jury i think the cinema has to bring emotions to the public and speak rightly about the problems and then the audience can decide what to do .
the audience must be free and independent .
i do n't believe the cinema should impose ideas they do n't like .
i think the cinema is entertainment but it 's necessary to have some content too . does political cinema rule out entertainment and humor , or can they work together ? absolutely .
look at moliere , for example .
both work together .
in shakespeare you find the same things , or if you go through brecht , for example .
all the important theater has done that , and you can say the same thing about the cinema .
all the big directors - fritz lang , renoir , john ford , kazan , all of them - their movies have both and it works . in your films you have investigated the mechanisms of power during dictatorships and other times of suppression , like the holocaust for instance .
which issues interest you most today ? in our society , the most important issue is power - who has the power to do good or bad things .
i think all of us have power .
we have power over some people under us and other people have power over us because they are stronger than we are .
this pyramid of power - that 's politics .
take a big company like nokia , for example .
when they leave the country and leave thousands of people on the streets without jobs - that 's power .
this is the main issue in our society : the power we have and how we use it . so , power is your main issue . it 's the only issue , in my opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " amen " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- is one of costa-gavras ' films that looks at the role of power coming back to the berlin film festival , your job as jury president will start on feb .
7 .
what are you most looking forward to ? you know , when i go to the cinema i sit and i say , now make me happy , make me furious , make me laugh , make me cry .
those feelings are the best moments in a movie . after the festival , you are going to shoot your next movie .
can you tell us what " eden is west " is about ? it 's very difficult to explain a movie in a few seconds .
it 's a movie about today ; it 's a road-movie .
it 's about a young man who likes to go to parties because he thinks the western world is paradise and he discovers that it 's not much of a paradise . your birthday is during the festival , on feb .
13 .
will you celebrate ?
what 's your birthday wish ? you know , i think , after a certain age , it 's not necessary to celebrate the age or the birthdays .
but it 's there , so what can i do ? so you have no plans and no wishes ? yes , one wish : not to celebrate . okay , but maybe you will see a good movie on that day . that would be a good celebration - a good present . interview : hans christoph von bock -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the big headlines were reserved for frankfurt debutant martin fenin who scored a hat-trick to sink berlin . werder bremen had defender naldo sent off as they crashed to a 2-1 home defeat to lowly vfl bochum sunday , leaving bayern munich three points clear at the top of the german bundesliga . meanwhile kevin kuranyi scored twice before watching germany coach joachim löw as schalke 04 downed ailing champions vfb stuttgart 4-1 . werder , who were eliminated from the german cup against borussia dortmund on tuesday , were shocked by bochum who came from behind to earn their first-ever bundesliga victory in bremen . denmark midfielder daniel jensen struck a minute before half-time for the home side but benjamin auer leveled for bochum in the 68th minute and anthar yahia headed the winner six minutes from time . brazilian naldo was shown a red card for a professional foul two minutes after auer 's goal as a game bremen had controlled slipped from their grip . " it looked like we were in a position .
we played quite well going forward and created chances but did n't finish it off and let the game out of our hands , " werder coach thomas schaaf said . schaaf had to juggle his team selection after injuries and other absences to key players but did not include midfielder mesut ozil , signed from schalke on thursday . bochum almost went in front when naldo deflected a cross which keeper tim wiese managed to deflect onto the bar with his leg . but after diego was foiled by jan lastuvka in goal and aaron hunt shot wide , jensen hit the net with a rising drive from just inside the area . bochum late show dents bremen 's title push bremen appeared well in control but auer netted from close range after a cross from japanese new signing shinji ono , who had come off the subs ' bench a minute earlier . ono was again the provider with a corner headed in by yahia to complete the misery for bremen and move bochum to 11th place , out of immediate relegation danger . bremen stay on 36 points , three points behind leaders bayern munich and three ahead of bayer leverkusen and sv hamburg , with schalke now fifth on 32 points . bayern , who earned a 2-1 win at hansa rostock friday evening , now meet bremen in munich next sunday , while leverkusen entertain hamburg on saturday in next weekend 's other big game . germany coach löw saw kuranyi in fine form in gelsenkirchen against his former club stuttgart as schalke ran out 4-1 winners . the striker , who has only just recovered from a lung infection , headed home powerfully from an ivan rakitic free-kick in the 32nd minute and then scrambled the ball home from close range in the 52nd . stuttgart got back in the game nine minutes later with a 30-metre free-kick from antonia da silva over the head of goalkeeper manuel neuer who was caught off his line . but schalke made sure when another rakitic free-kick was headed in on 76 minutes by heiko westermann - called up by löw for the germany squad for the first for wednesday 's friendly against austria . new signing ze roberto came off the substitutes ' bench in the 90th minute to complete the scoring for schalke in stoppage time .
hamburg miss chance to close gap in hamburg , szabolcs huszti opened the scoring from the penalty spot late in the first half for mid-table hanover before olic salvaged a draw in the 70th minute for hamburg , who have not beaten hanover at home in five attempts .
hamburg dropped from third to fourth place as bayer leverkusen got a 3-2 comeback victory at lowly energie cottbus to move ahead on goal difference .

the future of kosovo and its independence is also linked to the vote . voting has ended sunday in a tense presidential election run-off pitting the pro-european incumbent boris tadic against the nationalist challenger , tomislav nikolic . serbs turned out at a record pace , reflecting the referendum-like mood - though the president has mostly ceremonial duties , the outcome would signal which way voters want their country steered . nearly 63 per cent of the 6.7 million registered voters had cast their ballots with one hour remaining , the private election- monitoring agency cesid said . the final showing is to overshoot by a wide margin the 61 per cent from the first round two weeks ago . four years ago , after a series of attempts at electing a president failed owing to voter apathy , serbia was forced to scrap a legal minimum turnout requirement of 50 per cent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic urged serbia to remain on course for the eu that time , in june 2004 , tadic defeated nikolic in the run-off 53 to 47 per cent on a lowly 47 per cent turnout .
but this time the stakes are higher as serbia has been wavering on its european path . in this year 's contest , nikolic won 40 per cent to tadic 's 35.5 per cent of the votes in the first round on january 20 , but polls conducted between the two votes gave tadic a razor-thin edge of less than 1 per cent . serbia must stay the eu course , says tadic tadic says that belgrade must remain on course to join the eu even if leading western nations back the looming secession of serbia 's province kosovo .
" serbia is without doubt on its way to full membership of the eu , " he said after casting his ballot sunday . tadic 's opponent nikolic leads the opposition serbian radical party , the largest force in parliament and a key part of the former regime of slobodan milosevic . he says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west if it recognizes an independent and would instead seek closer ties with powers such as russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic said serbia was much closer to russia serbia is " much closer to russia , to a partner that does not impose conditions and can enable our development , " nikolic said after voting in belgrade .
the 6.7 million registered voters had to choose between the pro-european incumbent boris tadic and the ultra-nationalist tomislav nikolic .
tadic , who says that serbia must remain on its eu-course regardless of western support of kosovo 's secession , heads the democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , the senior partner in the cabinet coalition with prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia .
nikolic leads the opposition serbian radicals -lrb- srs -rrb- , the strongest single party in the country , which was a key part of slobodan milosevic 's regime until it was toppled in 2000 .
nikolic says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west over kosovo .
the difference in the run-off is however expected to be dramatically slight - some reports said that it could be less than 1 per cent and that the election may be decided by as few as 20,000 votes .
a referendum on east or west though the office of the president in serbia carries little real authority , the election carries a referendum-like quality because serbia has been wavering between east and west in its course .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has not had the support of his senior partner the conservative prime minister vojsilav kostunica has supported neither his senior coalition partner tadic , nor nikolic , with whom he shares a mistrust of the west .
kostunica , as nikolic , says that belgrade should stop its already stalled approach to european union membership because leading western countries support the secession of kosovo from serbia .
kosovo leaders , representing the 90-per-cent albanian majority , are expected to declare independence in the days or weeks after sunday 's vote in serbia .
with his once undisputed popularity now dramatically reduced , kostunica is likely to avoid early elections .
if tadic triumphs , the present coalition may continue as over the past year .
ds would however gain more credibility to steering serbia toward integration with eu , which stalled not only over kosovo , but also because serbia continues refusing to arrest wanted war crimes suspects .
fears a nikolic win would return serbia to isolation if nikolic wins , kostunica may try to drop tadic and the smallest partner in the existing coalition , the reformist g17 and replace them with nikolic and the srs , along with slobodan milosevic 's socialists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu serbs fear where nikolic may take them the pro-european camp in serbia has warned that nikolic 's win would effectively return serbia to isolation .
backing tadic and despite serbia 's failure to close the war crimes chapter , the eu has offered serbia a broad political and economic cooperation deal for signing on february 7 .
should nikolic win , however , the offer would " lose any meaning , " italian deputy foreign minister famiano crucianelli has said .

the future of kosovo and its independence is also linked to the vote . voting has ended sunday in a tense presidential election run-off pitting the pro-european incumbent boris tadic against the nationalist challenger , tomislav nikolic . serbs turned out at a record pace , reflecting the referendum-like mood - though the president has mostly ceremonial duties , the outcome would signal which way voters want their country steered . nearly 63 per cent of the 6.7 million registered voters had cast their ballots with one hour remaining , the private election- monitoring agency cesid said . the final showing is to overshoot by a wide margin the 61 per cent from the first round two weeks ago . four years ago , after a series of attempts at electing a president failed owing to voter apathy , serbia was forced to scrap a legal minimum turnout requirement of 50 per cent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic urged serbia to remain on course for the eu that time , in june 2004 , tadic defeated nikolic in the run-off 53 to 47 per cent on a lowly 47 per cent turnout .
but this time the stakes are higher as serbia has been wavering on its european path . in this year 's contest , nikolic won 40 per cent to tadic 's 35.5 per cent of the votes in the first round on january 20 , but polls conducted between the two votes gave tadic a razor-thin edge of less than 1 per cent . serbia must stay the eu course , says tadic tadic says that belgrade must remain on course to join the eu even if leading western nations back the looming secession of serbia 's province kosovo .
" serbia is without doubt on its way to full membership of the eu , " he said after casting his ballot sunday . tadic 's opponent nikolic leads the opposition serbian radical party , the largest force in parliament and a key part of the former regime of slobodan milosevic . he says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west if it recognizes an independent and would instead seek closer ties with powers such as russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic said serbia was much closer to russia serbia is " much closer to russia , to a partner that does not impose conditions and can enable our development , " nikolic said after voting in belgrade .
the 6.7 million registered voters had to choose between the pro-european incumbent boris tadic and the ultra-nationalist tomislav nikolic .
tadic , who says that serbia must remain on its eu-course regardless of western support of kosovo 's secession , heads the democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , the senior partner in the cabinet coalition with prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia .
nikolic leads the opposition serbian radicals -lrb- srs -rrb- , the strongest single party in the country , which was a key part of slobodan milosevic 's regime until it was toppled in 2000 .
nikolic says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west over kosovo .
the difference in the run-off is however expected to be dramatically slight - some reports said that it could be less than 1 per cent and that the election may be decided by as few as 20,000 votes .
a referendum on east or west though the office of the president in serbia carries little real authority , the election carries a referendum-like quality because serbia has been wavering between east and west in its course .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has not had the support of his senior partner the conservative prime minister vojsilav kostunica has supported neither his senior coalition partner tadic , nor nikolic , with whom he shares a mistrust of the west .
kostunica , as nikolic , says that belgrade should stop its already stalled approach to european union membership because leading western countries support the secession of kosovo from serbia .
kosovo leaders , representing the 90-per-cent albanian majority , are expected to declare independence in the days or weeks after sunday 's vote in serbia .
with his once undisputed popularity now dramatically reduced , kostunica is likely to avoid early elections .
if tadic triumphs , the present coalition may continue as over the past year .
ds would however gain more credibility to steering serbia toward integration with eu , which stalled not only over kosovo , but also because serbia continues refusing to arrest wanted war crimes suspects .
fears a nikolic win would return serbia to isolation if nikolic wins , kostunica may try to drop tadic and the smallest partner in the existing coalition , the reformist g17 and replace them with nikolic and the srs , along with slobodan milosevic 's socialists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu serbs fear where nikolic may take them the pro-european camp in serbia has warned that nikolic 's win would effectively return serbia to isolation .
backing tadic and despite serbia 's failure to close the war crimes chapter , the eu has offered serbia a broad political and economic cooperation deal for signing on february 7 .
should nikolic win , however , the offer would " lose any meaning , " italian deputy foreign minister famiano crucianelli has said .
polling ends at 8 pm local time .
early results are normally expected within a few hours , but may this time be delayed if the score turns out to be as close as was anticipated . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it looked like we were in a position .
we played quite well going forward and created chances but did n't finish it off and let the game out of our hands , " werder coach thomas schaaf said . schaaf had to juggle his team selection after injuries and other absences to key players but did not include midfielder mesut ozil , signed from schalke on thursday . bochum almost went in front when naldo deflected a cross which keeper tim wiese managed to deflect onto the bar with his leg . but after diego was foiled by jan lastuvka in goal and aaron hunt shot wide , jensen hit the net with a rising drive from just inside the area . bochum late show dents bremen 's title push bremen appeared well in control but auer netted from close range after a cross from japanese new signing shinji ono , who had come off the subs ' bench a minute earlier . ono was again the provider with a corner headed in by yahia to complete the misery for bremen and move bochum to 11th place , out of immediate relegation danger . bremen stay on 36 points , three points behind leaders bayern munich and three ahead of bayer leverkusen and sv hamburg , with schalke now fifth on 32 points . bayern , who earned a 2-1 win at hansa rostock friday evening , now meet bremen in munich next sunday , while leverkusen entertain hamburg on saturday in next weekend 's other big game . germany coach löw saw kuranyi in fine form in gelsenkirchen against his former club stuttgart as schalke ran out 4-1 winners . the striker , who has only just recovered from a lung infection , headed home powerfully from an ivan rakitic free-kick in the 32nd minute and then scrambled the ball home from close range in the 52nd . stuttgart got back in the game nine minutes later with a 30-metre free-kick from antonia da silva over the head of goalkeeper manuel neuer who was caught off his line . but schalke made sure when another rakitic free-kick was headed in on 76 minutes by heiko westermann - called up by löw for the germany squad for the first for wednesday 's friendly against austria . new signing ze roberto came off the substitutes ' bench in the 90th minute to complete the scoring for schalke in stoppage time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 03.02.2008 voting ends in serbia 's presidential election face-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the presidential election run-off between tadic and nikolic is currently too close to call voting has ended in the tense presidential election run-off in which serbia could signal its european course in the next five years .
the future of kosovo and its independence is also linked to the vote . voting has ended sunday in a tense presidential election run-off pitting the pro-european incumbent boris tadic against the nationalist challenger , tomislav nikolic . serbs turned out at a record pace , reflecting the referendum-like mood - though the president has mostly ceremonial duties , the outcome would signal which way voters want their country steered . nearly 63 per cent of the 6.7 million registered voters had cast their ballots with one hour remaining , the private election- monitoring agency cesid said . the final showing is to overshoot by a wide margin the 61 per cent from the first round two weeks ago . four years ago , after a series of attempts at electing a president failed owing to voter apathy , serbia was forced to scrap a legal minimum turnout requirement of 50 per cent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic urged serbia to remain on course for the eu that time , in june 2004 , tadic defeated nikolic in the run-off 53 to 47 per cent on a lowly 47 per cent turnout .
but this time the stakes are higher as serbia has been wavering on its european path . in this year 's contest , nikolic won 40 per cent to tadic 's 35.5 per cent of the votes in the first round on january 20 , but polls conducted between the two votes gave tadic a razor-thin edge of less than 1 per cent . serbia must stay the eu course , says tadic tadic says that belgrade must remain on course to join the eu even if leading western nations back the looming secession of serbia 's province kosovo .
" serbia is without doubt on its way to full membership of the eu , " he said after casting his ballot sunday . tadic 's opponent nikolic leads the opposition serbian radical party , the largest force in parliament and a key part of the former regime of slobodan milosevic . he says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west if it recognizes an independent and would instead seek closer ties with powers such as russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic said serbia was much closer to russia serbia is " much closer to russia , to a partner that does not impose conditions and can enable our development , " nikolic said after voting in belgrade .
the 6.7 million registered voters had to choose between the pro-european incumbent boris tadic and the ultra-nationalist tomislav nikolic .
tadic , who says that serbia must remain on its eu-course regardless of western support of kosovo 's secession , heads the democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , the senior partner in the cabinet coalition with prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia .
nikolic leads the opposition serbian radicals -lrb- srs -rrb- , the strongest single party in the country , which was a key part of slobodan milosevic 's regime until it was toppled in 2000 .
nikolic says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west over kosovo .
the difference in the run-off is however expected to be dramatically slight - some reports said that it could be less than 1 per cent and that the election may be decided by as few as 20,000 votes .
a referendum on east or west though the office of the president in serbia carries little real authority , the election carries a referendum-like quality because serbia has been wavering between east and west in its course .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has not had the support of his senior partner the conservative prime minister vojsilav kostunica has supported neither his senior coalition partner tadic , nor nikolic , with whom he shares a mistrust of the west .
kostunica , as nikolic , says that belgrade should stop its already stalled approach to european union membership because leading western countries support the secession of kosovo from serbia .
kosovo leaders , representing the 90-per-cent albanian majority , are expected to declare independence in the days or weeks after sunday 's vote in serbia .
with his once undisputed popularity now dramatically reduced , kostunica is likely to avoid early elections .
if tadic triumphs , the present coalition may continue as over the past year .
ds would however gain more credibility to steering serbia toward integration with eu , which stalled not only over kosovo , but also because serbia continues refusing to arrest wanted war crimes suspects .
fears a nikolic win would return serbia to isolation if nikolic wins , kostunica may try to drop tadic and the smallest partner in the existing coalition , the reformist g17 and replace them with nikolic and the srs , along with slobodan milosevic 's socialists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu serbs fear where nikolic may take them the pro-european camp in serbia has warned that nikolic 's win would effectively return serbia to isolation .
backing tadic and despite serbia 's failure to close the war crimes chapter , the eu has offered serbia a broad political and economic cooperation deal for signing on february 7 .
should nikolic win , however , the offer would " lose any meaning , " italian deputy foreign minister famiano crucianelli has said .
polling ends at 8 pm local time .
early results are normally expected within a few hours , but may this time be delayed if the score turns out to be as close as was anticipated . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the future of kosovo and its independence is also linked to the vote . voting has ended sunday in a tense presidential election run-off pitting the pro-european incumbent boris tadic against the nationalist challenger , tomislav nikolic . serbs turned out at a record pace , reflecting the referendum-like mood - though the president has mostly ceremonial duties , the outcome would signal which way voters want their country steered . nearly 63 per cent of the 6.7 million registered voters had cast their ballots with one hour remaining , the private election- monitoring agency cesid said . the final showing is to overshoot by a wide margin the 61 per cent from the first round two weeks ago . four years ago , after a series of attempts at electing a president failed owing to voter apathy , serbia was forced to scrap a legal minimum turnout requirement of 50 per cent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic urged serbia to remain on course for the eu that time , in june 2004 , tadic defeated nikolic in the run-off 53 to 47 per cent on a lowly 47 per cent turnout .
but this time the stakes are higher as serbia has been wavering on its european path . in this year 's contest , nikolic won 40 per cent to tadic 's 35.5 per cent of the votes in the first round on january 20 , but polls conducted between the two votes gave tadic a razor-thin edge of less than 1 per cent . serbia must stay the eu course , says tadic tadic says that belgrade must remain on course to join the eu even if leading western nations back the looming secession of serbia 's province kosovo .
" serbia is without doubt on its way to full membership of the eu , " he said after casting his ballot sunday . tadic 's opponent nikolic leads the opposition serbian radical party , the largest force in parliament and a key part of the former regime of slobodan milosevic . he says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west if it recognizes an independent and would instead seek closer ties with powers such as russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic said serbia was much closer to russia serbia is " much closer to russia , to a partner that does not impose conditions and can enable our development , " nikolic said after voting in belgrade .
the 6.7 million registered voters had to choose between the pro-european incumbent boris tadic and the ultra-nationalist tomislav nikolic .
tadic , who says that serbia must remain on its eu-course regardless of western support of kosovo 's secession , heads the democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , the senior partner in the cabinet coalition with prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia .
nikolic leads the opposition serbian radicals -lrb- srs -rrb- , the strongest single party in the country , which was a key part of slobodan milosevic 's regime until it was toppled in 2000 .
nikolic says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west over kosovo .
the difference in the run-off is however expected to be dramatically slight - some reports said that it could be less than 1 per cent and that the election may be decided by as few as 20,000 votes .
a referendum on east or west though the office of the president in serbia carries little real authority , the election carries a referendum-like quality because serbia has been wavering between east and west in its course .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has not had the support of his senior partner the conservative prime minister vojsilav kostunica has supported neither his senior coalition partner tadic , nor nikolic , with whom he shares a mistrust of the west .
kostunica , as nikolic , says that belgrade should stop its already stalled approach to european union membership because leading western countries support the secession of kosovo from serbia .
kosovo leaders , representing the 90-per-cent albanian majority , are expected to declare independence in the days or weeks after sunday 's vote in serbia .
with his once undisputed popularity now dramatically reduced , kostunica is likely to avoid early elections .
if tadic triumphs , the present coalition may continue as over the past year .
ds would however gain more credibility to steering serbia toward integration with eu , which stalled not only over kosovo , but also because serbia continues refusing to arrest wanted war crimes suspects .
fears a nikolic win would return serbia to isolation if nikolic wins , kostunica may try to drop tadic and the smallest partner in the existing coalition , the reformist g17 and replace them with nikolic and the srs , along with slobodan milosevic 's socialists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu serbs fear where nikolic may take them the pro-european camp in serbia has warned that nikolic 's win would effectively return serbia to isolation .

should nikolic win , however , the offer would " lose any meaning , " italian deputy foreign minister famiano crucianelli has said .

in europe 's largest science park , the experiment to merge science and industry is now taking off . located on the eastern outskirts of berlin , adlershof is a quick 20-minute train ride from the city center .
in gdr times adlershof was berlin 's celebrated socialist science mecca .
so when germany 's reunification threatened its further existence , the area embarked on an experiment : the creation of a science park , merging solar technology research with solar industry , in one winning equation . since 1993 , berlin has invested billions of euros in the area - billions the heavily indebted city does n't have .
but adlershof 's public relations manager , peter strunk said it was money well-invested in a bold vision , born of necessity . " this science park project was created to prevent us from social catastrophe after reunification , " strunk said .
" there were so many research facilities located here so instead of closing them down , a decision was made to create an integrated landscape of science and business , to re-establish those industrial structures that had to be dismantled . " a pioneering urban project the science park is embedded in adlershof 's overall urban planning concept , covering over four square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 square miles -rrb- .
its fresh urban landscape is still so new that it looks like a city whose virtual , graphic animation existence has simply been mounted onto the material world . adlershof is stream-lined and squeaky clean , with no mom and pop shops , quirky corners , or rough edges to add a bit of charm and irregularity to its neat , urban profile .
its main avenue is strewn with sleek , modern buildings of glass and steel housing scientific institutions and high tech companies . off the main strip are freshly-plowed streets named in honor of science icons , like albert einstein and max born .
and there 's 66 hectares -lrb- 163 acres -rrb- of land still left undeveloped , waiting to be sold , or rented . staying on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is a main customer of german solar technology one research institute with a long tradition in adlershof is the hahn-meitner institute .
klaus lips , the scientist leading thin-film solar cell reseach at the institute , was educated in marburg , germany , worked in colorado , but returned to germany when offered a position here . lips said adlershof is a solar scientist 's paradise , due to the close proximity of research and industry , and the unique , open dialogue and collaboration that exists between the two . " we work together with companies and establish network projects in which researchers , industry , and university students work together , " lips said , pointing out that the synergy of adlershof 's solar community especially benefits the upcoming generation of solar science researchers . " our young students have excellent job opportunities here , because upcoming companies are looking for trained people , " he added . success story the solar cell company sulfurcell 's founding in 2003 was based on research done on at the hahn-meitner institute .
the company started small , but now employs 100 engineers and factory operators to manufacture thin-film , cis solar cell modules and solar roof tiles . sulfurcell 's ceo nikolaus meyer is a scientist-turned-businessman , involved in the research that led to the company 's creation , and stands firmly behind his product . " cis stands for copper indium disulfide , a new semi-conductor that allows you to use a very thin , conductor layer on glass to produce electricity , " meyer said . sales of sulfurcell 's initial production have been so successful that plans are underway to erect a larger , more automated production plant this year .
meyer said he is confident he 'll be able to bring down the price of his product , to compete with the prices of conventionally produced power within the next five years . meyer said it would have been impossible to set-up and operate his company anywhere but adlershof .
he said the constant support and input of the area 's research institutes are what keep his product state-of-the-art , and thereby competitive . slowly getting noticed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the world 's largest solar parks sits near leipzig , germany in the former east germany , the institute for silicon crystal research enjoyed close ties to the humboldt university 's science faculties nearby , and much of the institute 's current staff are humboldt graduates . recently the institute 's research growing silicon crystals layers directly onto glass panels caught the attention of the international energy company british petroleum , which is now financing their further research . this month , solon , germany 's largest solar cell company , also moved its extensive operations to adlershof .
a new start-up company named inventux is beginning operations there , and two major us solar power companies have shown recently interest in investing in the area . on a roll lips said he 's convinced that german advances in solar technology will enable the country to supply 25 percent of its electricity needs with solar power alone , within the next two decades . meyer from sulfurcell said he believes clean-tech and renewable energy will be germany 's major industries , in the future . " we have seen only the beginning of this industry , and that the technology developed in germany , is creating an excellent foundation for the future success of the industry , " he said . if adlershof 's solar industry continues to grow at its current rate , it has the chance to become the place to be for all significant solar technology players , and europe 's first solaropolis , in the years to come . leah mcdonnell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politics is power and power makes the world go round - and is the focus of his own films , he said . constantin gavras , better known as costa-gavras , has been named president of the jury at this year 's berlin film festival , which runs from feb .
7-17 .
born in greece in 1933 , his career as a film director took off with the 1969 movie " z. " dw-tv : costa-gavras , of course you will be watching a lot of films during the festival , but can you tell us what else your job as a jury president entails ? costa-gavras : i watch the movies , i 'll discuss with the jury and we 'll try to award the best movie , that 's all .
i 'm trying to be there as a " viewer , " not as a technician or someone who knows the cinema , which is not so easy , of course .
i try to be like any viewer - to be free of any ideological or aesthetical ideas .
the best movie has to get the award . the berlin film festival sees itself more as a political festival in that it gives political cinema a lot of attention .
does that correspond with your general idea of film-making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 58th berlin film festival opens on feb .
7 i think all festivals are political festivals in a way .
the berlin film festival is a bit more so , because they go and set a direction , which i think the cinema needs .
the general idea is that festivals should promote movies with a social content , not only movies which are just entertainment .
if you go back to the history of cinema , the most important movies have been more social-political . your films were once hailed as liberation from hollywood 's dictatorship .
but where does political cinema stand today ? it depends on the money .
right now , it sometimes depends on the united states .
it depends on the stars .
in the last three or four years we have seen very distinct movies about the problems in iraq and the oil problems because the big stars decided to do it .
the major companies did n't want to do it , but they felt obliged to make these movies because they wanted to please the stars - pleasing the stars means they can work together with them again and again . that 's a very new thing for cinema .
before , it was the directors or even the political situation around the world that used to push the companies and the producers to produce movies with strong political content . so , one can say that there is more political cinema in hollywood ... there is more in hollywood at the moment and i think in europe , too , because there are more and more big problems .
i think there is a kind of movement .
but personally i believe that all movies are political .
even the action movies .
they have a kind of social effect on the young public and the public in general .
that 's also political . what can cinema achieve now in a world where we are witnessing an increase of violence and a growing lack of political awareness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress diane kruger joins costa-gavras in the jury i think the cinema has to bring emotions to the public and speak rightly about the problems and then the audience can decide what to do .
the audience must be free and independent .
i do n't believe the cinema should impose ideas they do n't like .
i think the cinema is entertainment but it 's necessary to have some content too . does political cinema rule out entertainment and humor , or can they work together ? absolutely .
look at moliere , for example .
both work together .
in shakespeare you find the same things , or if you go through brecht , for example .
all the important theater has done that , and you can say the same thing about the cinema .
all the big directors - fritz lang , renoir , john ford , kazan , all of them - their movies have both and it works . in your films you have investigated the mechanisms of power during dictatorships and other times of suppression , like the holocaust for instance .
which issues interest you most today ? in our society , the most important issue is power - who has the power to do good or bad things .
i think all of us have power .
we have power over some people under us and other people have power over us because they are stronger than we are .
this pyramid of power - that 's politics .
take a big company like nokia , for example .
when they leave the country and leave thousands of people on the streets without jobs - that 's power .
this is the main issue in our society : the power we have and how we use it . so , power is your main issue . it 's the only issue , in my opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " amen " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- is one of costa-gavras ' films that looks at the role of power coming back to the berlin film festival , your job as jury president will start on feb .
7 .
what are you most looking forward to ? you know , when i go to the cinema i sit and i say , now make me happy , make me furious , make me laugh , make me cry .
those feelings are the best moments in a movie . after the festival , you are going to shoot your next movie .
can you tell us what " eden is west " is about ? it 's very difficult to explain a movie in a few seconds .
it 's a movie about today ; it 's a road-movie .
it 's about a young man who likes to go to parties because he thinks the western world is paradise and he discovers that it 's not much of a paradise . your birthday is during the festival , on feb .
13 .
will you celebrate ?
what 's your birthday wish ? you know , i think , after a certain age , it 's not necessary to celebrate the age or the birthdays .
but it 's there , so what can i do ? so you have no plans and no wishes ? yes , one wish : not to celebrate . okay , but maybe you will see a good movie on that day . that would be a good celebration - a good present . interview : hans christoph von bock -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in europe 's largest science park , the experiment to merge science and industry is now taking off . located on the eastern outskirts of berlin , adlershof is a quick 20-minute train ride from the city center .
in gdr times adlershof was berlin 's celebrated socialist science mecca .
so when germany 's reunification threatened its further existence , the area embarked on an experiment : the creation of a science park , merging solar technology research with solar industry , in one winning equation . since 1993 , berlin has invested billions of euros in the area - billions the heavily indebted city does n't have .

it 's currently the " fifth season " in cologne , and the usual rules are suspended .
this year , that means revelers can flout germany 's smoking ban . as the cologne carnival enters its most manic phase with women 's carnival day on thursday , germany 's new restrictions on smoking in bars and restaurants will be temporarily relaxed .
after all , given the general mayhem set to prevail in the city for the next few days , it would be a little incongruous to penalize partygoers hitting the streets of cologne for their annual carnival-season pub crawl ahead of rose monday simply for smoking .
police have their work cut out for them , stopping fights , breath-alizing drunk drivers and trying to prevent male revelers relieving themselves against walls and in gutters .
compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carnival is a chance to do exactly what you want it 's a compromise wholly in keeping with the carnival spirit - which is all about indulgence before abstinence .
historically , the date of rose monday is determined by the church calendar , taking place on the monday before ash wednesday , which in turn marks the beginning of lent leading up to good friday and easter .
so with the prospect of self-control looming , the carnival season is a semi-lawless time when everyone gets a chance to lose their inhibitions .
obviously , that means quite a few people are going to want to smoke .
moreover , a survey by north rhine-westphalia 's hospitality industry reveals that 80 percent of bar regulars in the state are smokers .
legal loophole as of jan .
1 , 2008 , the third of germans who smoke have been banned from doing so in the pubs and restaurants of most of the country 's 16 states , with the rest of the country to follow later this year .
pubs are now required to confine smokers to separate rooms , although the ban will not take effect in north rhine-westphalia , where cologne is located , until july 1 .
but crucially , the state legislature has decided that the ban on smoking in main rooms will never apply during traditional festivals .
drunk and disorderly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are too busy to enforce the rules it 's just as well .
every year , determined drinkers in fancy dress crowd through the city 's pubs and thick clouds of smoke are part of the experience the tipsy crowds often cheer at any mischief , and can turn hostile towards men in uniform , reports german news agency dpa .
while children enjoy watching the costume parades and the older generation might book a table at a variety show , the young crowd celebrates the six days of high carnival with all-night binges in the city 's many bars .
unenforceable " the enforceability of a smoking ban during carnival would have been just about zero , " hubert heller , proprietor of heller 's bierhaus , and two other leading cologne pubs told dpa .
heller said the police will concentrate during the six days on serious crime and he believes bylaws officers will postpone minor complaints until after the organized mayhem has finished . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politics is power and power makes the world go round - and is the focus of his own films , he said . constantin gavras , better known as costa-gavras , has been named president of the jury at this year 's berlin film festival , which runs from feb .
7-17 .
born in greece in 1933 , his career as a film director took off with the 1969 movie " z. " dw-tv : costa-gavras , of course you will be watching a lot of films during the festival , but can you tell us what else your job as a jury president entails ? costa-gavras : i watch the movies , i 'll discuss with the jury and we 'll try to award the best movie , that 's all .
i 'm trying to be there as a " viewer , " not as a technician or someone who knows the cinema , which is not so easy , of course .
i try to be like any viewer - to be free of any ideological or aesthetical ideas .
the best movie has to get the award . the berlin film festival sees itself more as a political festival in that it gives political cinema a lot of attention .
does that correspond with your general idea of film-making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 58th berlin film festival opens on feb .
7 i think all festivals are political festivals in a way .
the berlin film festival is a bit more so , because they go and set a direction , which i think the cinema needs .
the general idea is that festivals should promote movies with a social content , not only movies which are just entertainment .
if you go back to the history of cinema , the most important movies have been more social-political . your films were once hailed as liberation from hollywood 's dictatorship .
but where does political cinema stand today ? it depends on the money .
right now , it sometimes depends on the united states .
it depends on the stars .
in the last three or four years we have seen very distinct movies about the problems in iraq and the oil problems because the big stars decided to do it .
the major companies did n't want to do it , but they felt obliged to make these movies because they wanted to please the stars - pleasing the stars means they can work together with them again and again . that 's a very new thing for cinema .
before , it was the directors or even the political situation around the world that used to push the companies and the producers to produce movies with strong political content . so , one can say that there is more political cinema in hollywood ... there is more in hollywood at the moment and i think in europe , too , because there are more and more big problems .
i think there is a kind of movement .
but personally i believe that all movies are political .
even the action movies .
they have a kind of social effect on the young public and the public in general .
that 's also political . what can cinema achieve now in a world where we are witnessing an increase of violence and a growing lack of political awareness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress diane kruger joins costa-gavras in the jury i think the cinema has to bring emotions to the public and speak rightly about the problems and then the audience can decide what to do .
the audience must be free and independent .
i do n't believe the cinema should impose ideas they do n't like .
i think the cinema is entertainment but it 's necessary to have some content too . does political cinema rule out entertainment and humor , or can they work together ? absolutely .
look at moliere , for example .
both work together .
in shakespeare you find the same things , or if you go through brecht , for example .
all the important theater has done that , and you can say the same thing about the cinema .
all the big directors - fritz lang , renoir , john ford , kazan , all of them - their movies have both and it works . in your films you have investigated the mechanisms of power during dictatorships and other times of suppression , like the holocaust for instance .
which issues interest you most today ? in our society , the most important issue is power - who has the power to do good or bad things .
i think all of us have power .
we have power over some people under us and other people have power over us because they are stronger than we are .
this pyramid of power - that 's politics .
take a big company like nokia , for example .
when they leave the country and leave thousands of people on the streets without jobs - that 's power .
this is the main issue in our society : the power we have and how we use it . so , power is your main issue . it 's the only issue , in my opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " amen " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- is one of costa-gavras ' films that looks at the role of power coming back to the berlin film festival , your job as jury president will start on feb .

what are you most looking forward to ? you know , when i go to the cinema i sit and i say , now make me happy , make me furious , make me laugh , make me cry .
those feelings are the best moments in a movie . after the festival , you are going to shoot your next movie .
can you tell us what " eden is west " is about ? it 's very difficult to explain a movie in a few seconds .
it 's a movie about today ; it 's a road-movie .
it 's about a young man who likes to go to parties because he thinks the western world is paradise and he discovers that it 's not much of a paradise . your birthday is during the festival , on feb .

will you celebrate ?
what 's your birthday wish ? you know , i think , after a certain age , it 's not necessary to celebrate the age or the birthdays .

the future of kosovo and its independence is also linked to the vote . voting has ended sunday in a tense presidential election run-off pitting the pro-european incumbent boris tadic against the nationalist challenger , tomislav nikolic . serbs turned out at a record pace , reflecting the referendum-like mood - though the president has mostly ceremonial duties , the outcome would signal which way voters want their country steered . nearly 63 per cent of the 6.7 million registered voters had cast their ballots with one hour remaining , the private election- monitoring agency cesid said . the final showing is to overshoot by a wide margin the 61 per cent from the first round two weeks ago . four years ago , after a series of attempts at electing a president failed owing to voter apathy , serbia was forced to scrap a legal minimum turnout requirement of 50 per cent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic urged serbia to remain on course for the eu that time , in june 2004 , tadic defeated nikolic in the run-off 53 to 47 per cent on a lowly 47 per cent turnout .
but this time the stakes are higher as serbia has been wavering on its european path . in this year 's contest , nikolic won 40 per cent to tadic 's 35.5 per cent of the votes in the first round on january 20 , but polls conducted between the two votes gave tadic a razor-thin edge of less than 1 per cent . serbia must stay the eu course , says tadic tadic says that belgrade must remain on course to join the eu even if leading western nations back the looming secession of serbia 's province kosovo .
" serbia is without doubt on its way to full membership of the eu , " he said after casting his ballot sunday . tadic 's opponent nikolic leads the opposition serbian radical party , the largest force in parliament and a key part of the former regime of slobodan milosevic . he says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west if it recognizes an independent and would instead seek closer ties with powers such as russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic said serbia was much closer to russia serbia is " much closer to russia , to a partner that does not impose conditions and can enable our development , " nikolic said after voting in belgrade .
the 6.7 million registered voters had to choose between the pro-european incumbent boris tadic and the ultra-nationalist tomislav nikolic .
tadic , who says that serbia must remain on its eu-course regardless of western support of kosovo 's secession , heads the democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , the senior partner in the cabinet coalition with prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia .
nikolic leads the opposition serbian radicals -lrb- srs -rrb- , the strongest single party in the country , which was a key part of slobodan milosevic 's regime until it was toppled in 2000 .
nikolic says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west over kosovo .
the difference in the run-off is however expected to be dramatically slight - some reports said that it could be less than 1 per cent and that the election may be decided by as few as 20,000 votes .
a referendum on east or west though the office of the president in serbia carries little real authority , the election carries a referendum-like quality because serbia has been wavering between east and west in its course .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has not had the support of his senior partner the conservative prime minister vojsilav kostunica has supported neither his senior coalition partner tadic , nor nikolic , with whom he shares a mistrust of the west .
kostunica , as nikolic , says that belgrade should stop its already stalled approach to european union membership because leading western countries support the secession of kosovo from serbia .
kosovo leaders , representing the 90-per-cent albanian majority , are expected to declare independence in the days or weeks after sunday 's vote in serbia .
with his once undisputed popularity now dramatically reduced , kostunica is likely to avoid early elections .
if tadic triumphs , the present coalition may continue as over the past year .
ds would however gain more credibility to steering serbia toward integration with eu , which stalled not only over kosovo , but also because serbia continues refusing to arrest wanted war crimes suspects .
fears a nikolic win would return serbia to isolation if nikolic wins , kostunica may try to drop tadic and the smallest partner in the existing coalition , the reformist g17 and replace them with nikolic and the srs , along with slobodan milosevic 's socialists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu serbs fear where nikolic may take them the pro-european camp in serbia has warned that nikolic 's win would effectively return serbia to isolation .
backing tadic and despite serbia 's failure to close the war crimes chapter , the eu has offered serbia a broad political and economic cooperation deal for signing on february 7 .
should nikolic win , however , the offer would " lose any meaning , " italian deputy foreign minister famiano crucianelli has said .
polling ends at 8 pm local time .
early results are normally expected within a few hours , but may this time be delayed if the score turns out to be as close as was anticipated . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the future of kosovo and its independence is also linked to the vote . voting has ended sunday in a tense presidential election run-off pitting the pro-european incumbent boris tadic against the nationalist challenger , tomislav nikolic . serbs turned out at a record pace , reflecting the referendum-like mood - though the president has mostly ceremonial duties , the outcome would signal which way voters want their country steered . nearly 63 per cent of the 6.7 million registered voters had cast their ballots with one hour remaining , the private election- monitoring agency cesid said . the final showing is to overshoot by a wide margin the 61 per cent from the first round two weeks ago . four years ago , after a series of attempts at electing a president failed owing to voter apathy , serbia was forced to scrap a legal minimum turnout requirement of 50 per cent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic urged serbia to remain on course for the eu that time , in june 2004 , tadic defeated nikolic in the run-off 53 to 47 per cent on a lowly 47 per cent turnout .
but this time the stakes are higher as serbia has been wavering on its european path . in this year 's contest , nikolic won 40 per cent to tadic 's 35.5 per cent of the votes in the first round on january 20 , but polls conducted between the two votes gave tadic a razor-thin edge of less than 1 per cent . serbia must stay the eu course , says tadic tadic says that belgrade must remain on course to join the eu even if leading western nations back the looming secession of serbia 's province kosovo .
" serbia is without doubt on its way to full membership of the eu , " he said after casting his ballot sunday . tadic 's opponent nikolic leads the opposition serbian radical party , the largest force in parliament and a key part of the former regime of slobodan milosevic . he says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west if it recognizes an independent and would instead seek closer ties with powers such as russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic said serbia was much closer to russia serbia is " much closer to russia , to a partner that does not impose conditions and can enable our development , " nikolic said after voting in belgrade .
the 6.7 million registered voters had to choose between the pro-european incumbent boris tadic and the ultra-nationalist tomislav nikolic .
tadic , who says that serbia must remain on its eu-course regardless of western support of kosovo 's secession , heads the democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , the senior partner in the cabinet coalition with prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia .
nikolic leads the opposition serbian radicals -lrb- srs -rrb- , the strongest single party in the country , which was a key part of slobodan milosevic 's regime until it was toppled in 2000 .
nikolic says belgrade should freeze its relations with the west over kosovo .
the difference in the run-off is however expected to be dramatically slight - some reports said that it could be less than 1 per cent and that the election may be decided by as few as 20,000 votes .
a referendum on east or west though the office of the president in serbia carries little real authority , the election carries a referendum-like quality because serbia has been wavering between east and west in its course .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has not had the support of his senior partner the conservative prime minister vojsilav kostunica has supported neither his senior coalition partner tadic , nor nikolic , with whom he shares a mistrust of the west .
kostunica , as nikolic , says that belgrade should stop its already stalled approach to european union membership because leading western countries support the secession of kosovo from serbia .
kosovo leaders , representing the 90-per-cent albanian majority , are expected to declare independence in the days or weeks after sunday 's vote in serbia .
with his once undisputed popularity now dramatically reduced , kostunica is likely to avoid early elections .
if tadic triumphs , the present coalition may continue as over the past year .
ds would however gain more credibility to steering serbia toward integration with eu , which stalled not only over kosovo , but also because serbia continues refusing to arrest wanted war crimes suspects .
fears a nikolic win would return serbia to isolation if nikolic wins , kostunica may try to drop tadic and the smallest partner in the existing coalition , the reformist g17 and replace them with nikolic and the srs , along with slobodan milosevic 's socialists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu serbs fear where nikolic may take them the pro-european camp in serbia has warned that nikolic 's win would effectively return serbia to isolation .
backing tadic and despite serbia 's failure to close the war crimes chapter , the eu has offered serbia a broad political and economic cooperation deal for signing on february 7 .
should nikolic win , however , the offer would " lose any meaning , " italian deputy foreign minister famiano crucianelli has said .
polling ends at 8 pm local time .
early results are normally expected within a few hours , but may this time be delayed if the score turns out to be as close as was anticipated . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in europe 's largest science park , the experiment to merge science and industry is now taking off . located on the eastern outskirts of berlin , adlershof is a quick 20-minute train ride from the city center .
in gdr times adlershof was berlin 's celebrated socialist science mecca .
so when germany 's reunification threatened its further existence , the area embarked on an experiment : the creation of a science park , merging solar technology research with solar industry , in one winning equation . since 1993 , berlin has invested billions of euros in the area - billions the heavily indebted city does n't have .
but adlershof 's public relations manager , peter strunk said it was money well-invested in a bold vision , born of necessity . " this science park project was created to prevent us from social catastrophe after reunification , " strunk said .

politics is power and power makes the world go round - and is the focus of his own films , he said . constantin gavras , better known as costa-gavras , has been named president of the jury at this year 's berlin film festival , which runs from feb .
7-17 .
born in greece in 1933 , his career as a film director took off with the 1969 movie " z. " dw-tv : costa-gavras , of course you will be watching a lot of films during the festival , but can you tell us what else your job as a jury president entails ? costa-gavras : i watch the movies , i 'll discuss with the jury and we 'll try to award the best movie , that 's all .
i 'm trying to be there as a " viewer , " not as a technician or someone who knows the cinema , which is not so easy , of course .
i try to be like any viewer - to be free of any ideological or aesthetical ideas .
the best movie has to get the award . the berlin film festival sees itself more as a political festival in that it gives political cinema a lot of attention .
does that correspond with your general idea of film-making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 58th berlin film festival opens on feb .
7 i think all festivals are political festivals in a way .
the berlin film festival is a bit more so , because they go and set a direction , which i think the cinema needs .
the general idea is that festivals should promote movies with a social content , not only movies which are just entertainment .
if you go back to the history of cinema , the most important movies have been more social-political . your films were once hailed as liberation from hollywood 's dictatorship .
but where does political cinema stand today ? it depends on the money .
right now , it sometimes depends on the united states .
it depends on the stars .
in the last three or four years we have seen very distinct movies about the problems in iraq and the oil problems because the big stars decided to do it .
the major companies did n't want to do it , but they felt obliged to make these movies because they wanted to please the stars - pleasing the stars means they can work together with them again and again . that 's a very new thing for cinema .
before , it was the directors or even the political situation around the world that used to push the companies and the producers to produce movies with strong political content . so , one can say that there is more political cinema in hollywood ... there is more in hollywood at the moment and i think in europe , too , because there are more and more big problems .
i think there is a kind of movement .
but personally i believe that all movies are political .
even the action movies .
they have a kind of social effect on the young public and the public in general .
that 's also political . what can cinema achieve now in a world where we are witnessing an increase of violence and a growing lack of political awareness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress diane kruger joins costa-gavras in the jury i think the cinema has to bring emotions to the public and speak rightly about the problems and then the audience can decide what to do .
the audience must be free and independent .
i do n't believe the cinema should impose ideas they do n't like .
i think the cinema is entertainment but it 's necessary to have some content too . does political cinema rule out entertainment and humor , or can they work together ? absolutely .
look at moliere , for example .
both work together .
in shakespeare you find the same things , or if you go through brecht , for example .
all the important theater has done that , and you can say the same thing about the cinema .
all the big directors - fritz lang , renoir , john ford , kazan , all of them - their movies have both and it works . in your films you have investigated the mechanisms of power during dictatorships and other times of suppression , like the holocaust for instance .
which issues interest you most today ? in our society , the most important issue is power - who has the power to do good or bad things .
i think all of us have power .
we have power over some people under us and other people have power over us because they are stronger than we are .
this pyramid of power - that 's politics .
take a big company like nokia , for example .
when they leave the country and leave thousands of people on the streets without jobs - that 's power .
this is the main issue in our society : the power we have and how we use it . so , power is your main issue . it 's the only issue , in my opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " amen " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- is one of costa-gavras ' films that looks at the role of power coming back to the berlin film festival , your job as jury president will start on feb .
7 .
what are you most looking forward to ? you know , when i go to the cinema i sit and i say , now make me happy , make me furious , make me laugh , make me cry .
those feelings are the best moments in a movie . after the festival , you are going to shoot your next movie .
can you tell us what " eden is west " is about ? it 's very difficult to explain a movie in a few seconds .
it 's a movie about today ; it 's a road-movie .
it 's about a young man who likes to go to parties because he thinks the western world is paradise and he discovers that it 's not much of a paradise . your birthday is during the festival , on feb .
13 .
will you celebrate ?
what 's your birthday wish ? you know , i think , after a certain age , it 's not necessary to celebrate the age or the birthdays .
but it 's there , so what can i do ? so you have no plans and no wishes ? yes , one wish : not to celebrate . okay , but maybe you will see a good movie on that day . that would be a good celebration - a good present . interview : hans christoph von bock -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 03.02.2008 one last gasp of freedom for smokers at cologne carnival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is probably the least silly thing they 'll do this weekend what 's a carnival if not an opportunity to eat , drink and be merry ?
it 's currently the " fifth season " in cologne , and the usual rules are suspended .
this year , that means revelers can flout germany 's smoking ban . as the cologne carnival enters its most manic phase with women 's carnival day on thursday , germany 's new restrictions on smoking in bars and restaurants will be temporarily relaxed .
after all , given the general mayhem set to prevail in the city for the next few days , it would be a little incongruous to penalize partygoers hitting the streets of cologne for their annual carnival-season pub crawl ahead of rose monday simply for smoking .
police have their work cut out for them , stopping fights , breath-alizing drunk drivers and trying to prevent male revelers relieving themselves against walls and in gutters .
compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carnival is a chance to do exactly what you want it 's a compromise wholly in keeping with the carnival spirit - which is all about indulgence before abstinence .
historically , the date of rose monday is determined by the church calendar , taking place on the monday before ash wednesday , which in turn marks the beginning of lent leading up to good friday and easter .
so with the prospect of self-control looming , the carnival season is a semi-lawless time when everyone gets a chance to lose their inhibitions .
obviously , that means quite a few people are going to want to smoke .
moreover , a survey by north rhine-westphalia 's hospitality industry reveals that 80 percent of bar regulars in the state are smokers .
legal loophole as of jan .
1 , 2008 , the third of germans who smoke have been banned from doing so in the pubs and restaurants of most of the country 's 16 states , with the rest of the country to follow later this year .
pubs are now required to confine smokers to separate rooms , although the ban will not take effect in north rhine-westphalia , where cologne is located , until july 1 .
but crucially , the state legislature has decided that the ban on smoking in main rooms will never apply during traditional festivals .
drunk and disorderly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are too busy to enforce the rules it 's just as well .
every year , determined drinkers in fancy dress crowd through the city 's pubs and thick clouds of smoke are part of the experience the tipsy crowds often cheer at any mischief , and can turn hostile towards men in uniform , reports german news agency dpa .
while children enjoy watching the costume parades and the older generation might book a table at a variety show , the young crowd celebrates the six days of high carnival with all-night binges in the city 's many bars .
unenforceable " the enforceability of a smoking ban during carnival would have been just about zero , " hubert heller , proprietor of heller 's bierhaus , and two other leading cologne pubs told dpa .
heller said the police will concentrate during the six days on serious crime and he believes bylaws officers will postpone minor complaints until after the organized mayhem has finished . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in europe 's largest science park , the experiment to merge science and industry is now taking off . located on the eastern outskirts of berlin , adlershof is a quick 20-minute train ride from the city center .
in gdr times adlershof was berlin 's celebrated socialist science mecca .
so when germany 's reunification threatened its further existence , the area embarked on an experiment : the creation of a science park , merging solar technology research with solar industry , in one winning equation . since 1993 , berlin has invested billions of euros in the area - billions the heavily indebted city does n't have .
but adlershof 's public relations manager , peter strunk said it was money well-invested in a bold vision , born of necessity . " this science park project was created to prevent us from social catastrophe after reunification , " strunk said .
" there were so many research facilities located here so instead of closing them down , a decision was made to create an integrated landscape of science and business , to re-establish those industrial structures that had to be dismantled . " a pioneering urban project the science park is embedded in adlershof 's overall urban planning concept , covering over four square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 square miles -rrb- .
its fresh urban landscape is still so new that it looks like a city whose virtual , graphic animation existence has simply been mounted onto the material world . adlershof is stream-lined and squeaky clean , with no mom and pop shops , quirky corners , or rough edges to add a bit of charm and irregularity to its neat , urban profile .
its main avenue is strewn with sleek , modern buildings of glass and steel housing scientific institutions and high tech companies . off the main strip are freshly-plowed streets named in honor of science icons , like albert einstein and max born .
and there 's 66 hectares -lrb- 163 acres -rrb- of land still left undeveloped , waiting to be sold , or rented . staying on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is a main customer of german solar technology one research institute with a long tradition in adlershof is the hahn-meitner institute .

" dw-tv : costa-gavras , of course you will be watching a lot of films during the festival , but can you tell us what else your job as a jury president entails ? costa-gavras : i watch the movies , i 'll discuss with the jury and we 'll try to award the best movie , that 's all .
i 'm trying to be there as a " viewer , " not as a technician or someone who knows the cinema , which is not so easy , of course .
i try to be like any viewer - to be free of any ideological or aesthetical ideas .
the best movie has to get the award . the berlin film festival sees itself more as a political festival in that it gives political cinema a lot of attention .
does that correspond with your general idea of film-making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 58th berlin film festival opens on feb .
7 i think all festivals are political festivals in a way .
the berlin film festival is a bit more so , because they go and set a direction , which i think the cinema needs .
the general idea is that festivals should promote movies with a social content , not only movies which are just entertainment .
if you go back to the history of cinema , the most important movies have been more social-political . your films were once hailed as liberation from hollywood 's dictatorship .
but where does political cinema stand today ? it depends on the money .
right now , it sometimes depends on the united states .
it depends on the stars .
in the last three or four years we have seen very distinct movies about the problems in iraq and the oil problems because the big stars decided to do it .
the major companies did n't want to do it , but they felt obliged to make these movies because they wanted to please the stars - pleasing the stars means they can work together with them again and again . that 's a very new thing for cinema .
before , it was the directors or even the political situation around the world that used to push the companies and the producers to produce movies with strong political content . so , one can say that there is more political cinema in hollywood ... there is more in hollywood at the moment and i think in europe , too , because there are more and more big problems .
i think there is a kind of movement .
but personally i believe that all movies are political .
even the action movies .
they have a kind of social effect on the young public and the public in general .
that 's also political . what can cinema achieve now in a world where we are witnessing an increase of violence and a growing lack of political awareness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress diane kruger joins costa-gavras in the jury i think the cinema has to bring emotions to the public and speak rightly about the problems and then the audience can decide what to do .
the audience must be free and independent .
i do n't believe the cinema should impose ideas they do n't like .
i think the cinema is entertainment but it 's necessary to have some content too . does political cinema rule out entertainment and humor , or can they work together ? absolutely .
look at moliere , for example .
both work together .
in shakespeare you find the same things , or if you go through brecht , for example .
all the important theater has done that , and you can say the same thing about the cinema .
all the big directors - fritz lang , renoir , john ford , kazan , all of them - their movies have both and it works . in your films you have investigated the mechanisms of power during dictatorships and other times of suppression , like the holocaust for instance .
which issues interest you most today ? in our society , the most important issue is power - who has the power to do good or bad things .
i think all of us have power .
we have power over some people under us and other people have power over us because they are stronger than we are .
this pyramid of power - that 's politics .
take a big company like nokia , for example .
when they leave the country and leave thousands of people on the streets without jobs - that 's power .
this is the main issue in our society : the power we have and how we use it . so , power is your main issue . it 's the only issue , in my opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " amen " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- is one of costa-gavras ' films that looks at the role of power coming back to the berlin film festival , your job as jury president will start on feb .
7 .
what are you most looking forward to ? you know , when i go to the cinema i sit and i say , now make me happy , make me furious , make me laugh , make me cry .
those feelings are the best moments in a movie . after the festival , you are going to shoot your next movie .
can you tell us what " eden is west " is about ? it 's very difficult to explain a movie in a few seconds .
it 's a movie about today ; it 's a road-movie .
it 's about a young man who likes to go to parties because he thinks the western world is paradise and he discovers that it 's not much of a paradise . your birthday is during the festival , on feb .
13 .
will you celebrate ?
what 's your birthday wish ? you know , i think , after a certain age , it 's not necessary to celebrate the age or the birthdays .
but it 's there , so what can i do ? so you have no plans and no wishes ? yes , one wish : not to celebrate . okay , but maybe you will see a good movie on that day . that would be a good celebration - a good present . interview : hans christoph von bock -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's currently the " fifth season " in cologne , and the usual rules are suspended .
this year , that means revelers can flout germany 's smoking ban . as the cologne carnival enters its most manic phase with women 's carnival day on thursday , germany 's new restrictions on smoking in bars and restaurants will be temporarily relaxed .
after all , given the general mayhem set to prevail in the city for the next few days , it would be a little incongruous to penalize partygoers hitting the streets of cologne for their annual carnival-season pub crawl ahead of rose monday simply for smoking .
police have their work cut out for them , stopping fights , breath-alizing drunk drivers and trying to prevent male revelers relieving themselves against walls and in gutters .
compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carnival is a chance to do exactly what you want it 's a compromise wholly in keeping with the carnival spirit - which is all about indulgence before abstinence .
historically , the date of rose monday is determined by the church calendar , taking place on the monday before ash wednesday , which in turn marks the beginning of lent leading up to good friday and easter .
so with the prospect of self-control looming , the carnival season is a semi-lawless time when everyone gets a chance to lose their inhibitions .
obviously , that means quite a few people are going to want to smoke .
moreover , a survey by north rhine-westphalia 's hospitality industry reveals that 80 percent of bar regulars in the state are smokers .
legal loophole as of jan .
1 , 2008 , the third of germans who smoke have been banned from doing so in the pubs and restaurants of most of the country 's 16 states , with the rest of the country to follow later this year .
pubs are now required to confine smokers to separate rooms , although the ban will not take effect in north rhine-westphalia , where cologne is located , until july 1 .
but crucially , the state legislature has decided that the ban on smoking in main rooms will never apply during traditional festivals .
drunk and disorderly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are too busy to enforce the rules it 's just as well .
every year , determined drinkers in fancy dress crowd through the city 's pubs and thick clouds of smoke are part of the experience the tipsy crowds often cheer at any mischief , and can turn hostile towards men in uniform , reports german news agency dpa .
while children enjoy watching the costume parades and the older generation might book a table at a variety show , the young crowd celebrates the six days of high carnival with all-night binges in the city 's many bars .
unenforceable " the enforceability of a smoking ban during carnival would have been just about zero , " hubert heller , proprietor of heller 's bierhaus , and two other leading cologne pubs told dpa .
heller said the police will concentrate during the six days on serious crime and he believes bylaws officers will postpone minor complaints until after the organized mayhem has finished . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in europe 's largest science park , the experiment to merge science and industry is now taking off . located on the eastern outskirts of berlin , adlershof is a quick 20-minute train ride from the city center .
in gdr times adlershof was berlin 's celebrated socialist science mecca .
so when germany 's reunification threatened its further existence , the area embarked on an experiment : the creation of a science park , merging solar technology research with solar industry , in one winning equation . since 1993 , berlin has invested billions of euros in the area - billions the heavily indebted city does n't have .
but adlershof 's public relations manager , peter strunk said it was money well-invested in a bold vision , born of necessity . " this science park project was created to prevent us from social catastrophe after reunification , " strunk said .
" there were so many research facilities located here so instead of closing them down , a decision was made to create an integrated landscape of science and business , to re-establish those industrial structures that had to be dismantled . " a pioneering urban project the science park is embedded in adlershof 's overall urban planning concept , covering over four square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 square miles -rrb- .
its fresh urban landscape is still so new that it looks like a city whose virtual , graphic animation existence has simply been mounted onto the material world . adlershof is stream-lined and squeaky clean , with no mom and pop shops , quirky corners , or rough edges to add a bit of charm and irregularity to its neat , urban profile .
its main avenue is strewn with sleek , modern buildings of glass and steel housing scientific institutions and high tech companies . off the main strip are freshly-plowed streets named in honor of science icons , like albert einstein and max born .
and there 's 66 hectares -lrb- 163 acres -rrb- of land still left undeveloped , waiting to be sold , or rented . staying on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is a main customer of german solar technology one research institute with a long tradition in adlershof is the hahn-meitner institute .
klaus lips , the scientist leading thin-film solar cell reseach at the institute , was educated in marburg , germany , worked in colorado , but returned to germany when offered a position here . lips said adlershof is a solar scientist 's paradise , due to the close proximity of research and industry , and the unique , open dialogue and collaboration that exists between the two . " we work together with companies and establish network projects in which researchers , industry , and university students work together , " lips said , pointing out that the synergy of adlershof 's solar community especially benefits the upcoming generation of solar science researchers . " our young students have excellent job opportunities here , because upcoming companies are looking for trained people , " he added . success story the solar cell company sulfurcell 's founding in 2003 was based on research done on at the hahn-meitner institute .
the company started small , but now employs 100 engineers and factory operators to manufacture thin-film , cis solar cell modules and solar roof tiles . sulfurcell 's ceo nikolaus meyer is a scientist-turned-businessman , involved in the research that led to the company 's creation , and stands firmly behind his product . " cis stands for copper indium disulfide , a new semi-conductor that allows you to use a very thin , conductor layer on glass to produce electricity , " meyer said . sales of sulfurcell 's initial production have been so successful that plans are underway to erect a larger , more automated production plant this year .
meyer said he is confident he 'll be able to bring down the price of his product , to compete with the prices of conventionally produced power within the next five years . meyer said it would have been impossible to set-up and operate his company anywhere but adlershof .
he said the constant support and input of the area 's research institutes are what keep his product state-of-the-art , and thereby competitive . slowly getting noticed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the world 's largest solar parks sits near leipzig , germany in the former east germany , the institute for silicon crystal research enjoyed close ties to the humboldt university 's science faculties nearby , and much of the institute 's current staff are humboldt graduates . recently the institute 's research growing silicon crystals layers directly onto glass panels caught the attention of the international energy company british petroleum , which is now financing their further research . this month , solon , germany 's largest solar cell company , also moved its extensive operations to adlershof .
a new start-up company named inventux is beginning operations there , and two major us solar power companies have shown recently interest in investing in the area . on a roll lips said he 's convinced that german advances in solar technology will enable the country to supply 25 percent of its electricity needs with solar power alone , within the next two decades . meyer from sulfurcell said he believes clean-tech and renewable energy will be germany 's major industries , in the future . " we have seen only the beginning of this industry , and that the technology developed in germany , is creating an excellent foundation for the future success of the industry , " he said . if adlershof 's solar industry continues to grow at its current rate , it has the chance to become the place to be for all significant solar technology players , and europe 's first solaropolis , in the years to come . leah mcdonnell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 03.02.2008 cinema is always political , says star director costa-gavras großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costa-gavras ' next movie will be filmed in greece , his country of birth all movies are political , film director costa-gavras told dw ahead of the berlin film festival .
politics is power and power makes the world go round - and is the focus of his own films , he said . constantin gavras , better known as costa-gavras , has been named president of the jury at this year 's berlin film festival , which runs from feb .
7-17 .
born in greece in 1933 , his career as a film director took off with the 1969 movie " z. " dw-tv : costa-gavras , of course you will be watching a lot of films during the festival , but can you tell us what else your job as a jury president entails ? costa-gavras : i watch the movies , i 'll discuss with the jury and we 'll try to award the best movie , that 's all .
i 'm trying to be there as a " viewer , " not as a technician or someone who knows the cinema , which is not so easy , of course .
i try to be like any viewer - to be free of any ideological or aesthetical ideas .
the best movie has to get the award . the berlin film festival sees itself more as a political festival in that it gives political cinema a lot of attention .
does that correspond with your general idea of film-making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 58th berlin film festival opens on feb .
7 i think all festivals are political festivals in a way .
the berlin film festival is a bit more so , because they go and set a direction , which i think the cinema needs .
the general idea is that festivals should promote movies with a social content , not only movies which are just entertainment .
if you go back to the history of cinema , the most important movies have been more social-political . your films were once hailed as liberation from hollywood 's dictatorship .
but where does political cinema stand today ? it depends on the money .
right now , it sometimes depends on the united states .
it depends on the stars .
in the last three or four years we have seen very distinct movies about the problems in iraq and the oil problems because the big stars decided to do it .
the major companies did n't want to do it , but they felt obliged to make these movies because they wanted to please the stars - pleasing the stars means they can work together with them again and again . that 's a very new thing for cinema .
before , it was the directors or even the political situation around the world that used to push the companies and the producers to produce movies with strong political content . so , one can say that there is more political cinema in hollywood ... there is more in hollywood at the moment and i think in europe , too , because there are more and more big problems .
i think there is a kind of movement .
but personally i believe that all movies are political .
even the action movies .
they have a kind of social effect on the young public and the public in general .
that 's also political . what can cinema achieve now in a world where we are witnessing an increase of violence and a growing lack of political awareness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress diane kruger joins costa-gavras in the jury i think the cinema has to bring emotions to the public and speak rightly about the problems and then the audience can decide what to do .
the audience must be free and independent .
i do n't believe the cinema should impose ideas they do n't like .
i think the cinema is entertainment but it 's necessary to have some content too . does political cinema rule out entertainment and humor , or can they work together ? absolutely .
look at moliere , for example .
both work together .
in shakespeare you find the same things , or if you go through brecht , for example .
all the important theater has done that , and you can say the same thing about the cinema .
all the big directors - fritz lang , renoir , john ford , kazan , all of them - their movies have both and it works . in your films you have investigated the mechanisms of power during dictatorships and other times of suppression , like the holocaust for instance .
which issues interest you most today ? in our society , the most important issue is power - who has the power to do good or bad things .
i think all of us have power .
we have power over some people under us and other people have power over us because they are stronger than we are .
this pyramid of power - that 's politics .
take a big company like nokia , for example .
when they leave the country and leave thousands of people on the streets without jobs - that 's power .
this is the main issue in our society : the power we have and how we use it . so , power is your main issue . it 's the only issue , in my opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " amen " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- is one of costa-gavras ' films that looks at the role of power coming back to the berlin film festival , your job as jury president will start on feb .
7 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 03.02.2008 cinema is always political , says star director costa-gavras großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costa-gavras ' next movie will be filmed in greece , his country of birth all movies are political , film director costa-gavras told dw ahead of the berlin film festival .
politics is power and power makes the world go round - and is the focus of his own films , he said . constantin gavras , better known as costa-gavras , has been named president of the jury at this year 's berlin film festival , which runs from feb .
7-17 .
born in greece in 1933 , his career as a film director took off with the 1969 movie " z. " dw-tv : costa-gavras , of course you will be watching a lot of films during the festival , but can you tell us what else your job as a jury president entails ? costa-gavras : i watch the movies , i 'll discuss with the jury and we 'll try to award the best movie , that 's all .
i 'm trying to be there as a " viewer , " not as a technician or someone who knows the cinema , which is not so easy , of course .
i try to be like any viewer - to be free of any ideological or aesthetical ideas .
the best movie has to get the award . the berlin film festival sees itself more as a political festival in that it gives political cinema a lot of attention .
does that correspond with your general idea of film-making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 58th berlin film festival opens on feb .
7 i think all festivals are political festivals in a way .
the berlin film festival is a bit more so , because they go and set a direction , which i think the cinema needs .
the general idea is that festivals should promote movies with a social content , not only movies which are just entertainment .
if you go back to the history of cinema , the most important movies have been more social-political . your films were once hailed as liberation from hollywood 's dictatorship .
but where does political cinema stand today ? it depends on the money .
right now , it sometimes depends on the united states .
it depends on the stars .
in the last three or four years we have seen very distinct movies about the problems in iraq and the oil problems because the big stars decided to do it .
the major companies did n't want to do it , but they felt obliged to make these movies because they wanted to please the stars - pleasing the stars means they can work together with them again and again . that 's a very new thing for cinema .
before , it was the directors or even the political situation around the world that used to push the companies and the producers to produce movies with strong political content . so , one can say that there is more political cinema in hollywood ... there is more in hollywood at the moment and i think in europe , too , because there are more and more big problems .
i think there is a kind of movement .
but personally i believe that all movies are political .
even the action movies .
they have a kind of social effect on the young public and the public in general .
that 's also political . what can cinema achieve now in a world where we are witnessing an increase of violence and a growing lack of political awareness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress diane kruger joins costa-gavras in the jury i think the cinema has to bring emotions to the public and speak rightly about the problems and then the audience can decide what to do .
the audience must be free and independent .
i do n't believe the cinema should impose ideas they do n't like .
i think the cinema is entertainment but it 's necessary to have some content too . does political cinema rule out entertainment and humor , or can they work together ? absolutely .
look at moliere , for example .
both work together .
in shakespeare you find the same things , or if you go through brecht , for example .
all the important theater has done that , and you can say the same thing about the cinema .
all the big directors - fritz lang , renoir , john ford , kazan , all of them - their movies have both and it works . in your films you have investigated the mechanisms of power during dictatorships and other times of suppression , like the holocaust for instance .
which issues interest you most today ? in our society , the most important issue is power - who has the power to do good or bad things .
i think all of us have power .
we have power over some people under us and other people have power over us because they are stronger than we are .
this pyramid of power - that 's politics .
take a big company like nokia , for example .
when they leave the country and leave thousands of people on the streets without jobs - that 's power .
this is the main issue in our society : the power we have and how we use it . so , power is your main issue . it 's the only issue , in my opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " amen " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- is one of costa-gavras ' films that looks at the role of power coming back to the berlin film festival , your job as jury president will start on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 03.02.2008 berlin aims to become europe 's capital of solar technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar modules like these are designed in berlin berlin 's adlershof district is striving to become the place to be when it comes to solar technology .
in europe 's largest science park , the experiment to merge science and industry is now taking off . located on the eastern outskirts of berlin , adlershof is a quick 20-minute train ride from the city center .
in gdr times adlershof was berlin 's celebrated socialist science mecca .
so when germany 's reunification threatened its further existence , the area embarked on an experiment : the creation of a science park , merging solar technology research with solar industry , in one winning equation . since 1993 , berlin has invested billions of euros in the area - billions the heavily indebted city does n't have .
but adlershof 's public relations manager , peter strunk said it was money well-invested in a bold vision , born of necessity . " this science park project was created to prevent us from social catastrophe after reunification , " strunk said .
" there were so many research facilities located here so instead of closing them down , a decision was made to create an integrated landscape of science and business , to re-establish those industrial structures that had to be dismantled . " a pioneering urban project the science park is embedded in adlershof 's overall urban planning concept , covering over four square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 square miles -rrb- .
its fresh urban landscape is still so new that it looks like a city whose virtual , graphic animation existence has simply been mounted onto the material world . adlershof is stream-lined and squeaky clean , with no mom and pop shops , quirky corners , or rough edges to add a bit of charm and irregularity to its neat , urban profile .
its main avenue is strewn with sleek , modern buildings of glass and steel housing scientific institutions and high tech companies . off the main strip are freshly-plowed streets named in honor of science icons , like albert einstein and max born .
and there 's 66 hectares -lrb- 163 acres -rrb- of land still left undeveloped , waiting to be sold , or rented . staying on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is a main customer of german solar technology one research institute with a long tradition in adlershof is the hahn-meitner institute .
klaus lips , the scientist leading thin-film solar cell reseach at the institute , was educated in marburg , germany , worked in colorado , but returned to germany when offered a position here . lips said adlershof is a solar scientist 's paradise , due to the close proximity of research and industry , and the unique , open dialogue and collaboration that exists between the two . " we work together with companies and establish network projects in which researchers , industry , and university students work together , " lips said , pointing out that the synergy of adlershof 's solar community especially benefits the upcoming generation of solar science researchers . " our young students have excellent job opportunities here , because upcoming companies are looking for trained people , " he added . success story the solar cell company sulfurcell 's founding in 2003 was based on research done on at the hahn-meitner institute .
the company started small , but now employs 100 engineers and factory operators to manufacture thin-film , cis solar cell modules and solar roof tiles . sulfurcell 's ceo nikolaus meyer is a scientist-turned-businessman , involved in the research that led to the company 's creation , and stands firmly behind his product . " cis stands for copper indium disulfide , a new semi-conductor that allows you to use a very thin , conductor layer on glass to produce electricity , " meyer said . sales of sulfurcell 's initial production have been so successful that plans are underway to erect a larger , more automated production plant this year .
meyer said he is confident he 'll be able to bring down the price of his product , to compete with the prices of conventionally produced power within the next five years . meyer said it would have been impossible to set-up and operate his company anywhere but adlershof .
he said the constant support and input of the area 's research institutes are what keep his product state-of-the-art , and thereby competitive . slowly getting noticed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the world 's largest solar parks sits near leipzig , germany in the former east germany , the institute for silicon crystal research enjoyed close ties to the humboldt university 's science faculties nearby , and much of the institute 's current staff are humboldt graduates . recently the institute 's research growing silicon crystals layers directly onto glass panels caught the attention of the international energy company british petroleum , which is now financing their further research . this month , solon , germany 's largest solar cell company , also moved its extensive operations to adlershof .
a new start-up company named inventux is beginning operations there , and two major us solar power companies have shown recently interest in investing in the area . on a roll lips said he 's convinced that german advances in solar technology will enable the country to supply 25 percent of its electricity needs with solar power alone , within the next two decades . meyer from sulfurcell said he believes clean-tech and renewable energy will be germany 's major industries , in the future . " we have seen only the beginning of this industry , and that the technology developed in germany , is creating an excellent foundation for the future success of the industry , " he said . if adlershof 's solar industry continues to grow at its current rate , it has the chance to become the place to be for all significant solar technology players , and europe 's first solaropolis , in the years to come . leah mcdonnell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politics is power and power makes the world go round - and is the focus of his own films , he said . constantin gavras , better known as costa-gavras , has been named president of the jury at this year 's berlin film festival , which runs from feb .
7-17 .
born in greece in 1933 , his career as a film director took off with the 1969 movie " z. " dw-tv : costa-gavras , of course you will be watching a lot of films during the festival , but can you tell us what else your job as a jury president entails ? costa-gavras : i watch the movies , i 'll discuss with the jury and we 'll try to award the best movie , that 's all .
i 'm trying to be there as a " viewer , " not as a technician or someone who knows the cinema , which is not so easy , of course .
i try to be like any viewer - to be free of any ideological or aesthetical ideas .
the best movie has to get the award . the berlin film festival sees itself more as a political festival in that it gives political cinema a lot of attention .
does that correspond with your general idea of film-making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 58th berlin film festival opens on feb .
7 i think all festivals are political festivals in a way .
the berlin film festival is a bit more so , because they go and set a direction , which i think the cinema needs .
the general idea is that festivals should promote movies with a social content , not only movies which are just entertainment .
if you go back to the history of cinema , the most important movies have been more social-political . your films were once hailed as liberation from hollywood 's dictatorship .
but where does political cinema stand today ? it depends on the money .
right now , it sometimes depends on the united states .
it depends on the stars .
in the last three or four years we have seen very distinct movies about the problems in iraq and the oil problems because the big stars decided to do it .
the major companies did n't want to do it , but they felt obliged to make these movies because they wanted to please the stars - pleasing the stars means they can work together with them again and again . that 's a very new thing for cinema .
before , it was the directors or even the political situation around the world that used to push the companies and the producers to produce movies with strong political content . so , one can say that there is more political cinema in hollywood ... there is more in hollywood at the moment and i think in europe , too , because there are more and more big problems .
i think there is a kind of movement .
but personally i believe that all movies are political .
even the action movies .
they have a kind of social effect on the young public and the public in general .
that 's also political . what can cinema achieve now in a world where we are witnessing an increase of violence and a growing lack of political awareness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress diane kruger joins costa-gavras in the jury i think the cinema has to bring emotions to the public and speak rightly about the problems and then the audience can decide what to do .
the audience must be free and independent .
i do n't believe the cinema should impose ideas they do n't like .
i think the cinema is entertainment but it 's necessary to have some content too . does political cinema rule out entertainment and humor , or can they work together ? absolutely .
look at moliere , for example .
both work together .
in shakespeare you find the same things , or if you go through brecht , for example .
all the important theater has done that , and you can say the same thing about the cinema .
all the big directors - fritz lang , renoir , john ford , kazan , all of them - their movies have both and it works . in your films you have investigated the mechanisms of power during dictatorships and other times of suppression , like the holocaust for instance .
which issues interest you most today ? in our society , the most important issue is power - who has the power to do good or bad things .
i think all of us have power .
we have power over some people under us and other people have power over us because they are stronger than we are .
this pyramid of power - that 's politics .
take a big company like nokia , for example .
when they leave the country and leave thousands of people on the streets without jobs - that 's power .
this is the main issue in our society : the power we have and how we use it . so , power is your main issue . it 's the only issue , in my opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " amen " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- is one of costa-gavras ' films that looks at the role of power coming back to the berlin film festival , your job as jury president will start on feb .
7 .
what are you most looking forward to ? you know , when i go to the cinema i sit and i say , now make me happy , make me furious , make me laugh , make me cry .
those feelings are the best moments in a movie . after the festival , you are going to shoot your next movie .
can you tell us what " eden is west " is about ? it 's very difficult to explain a movie in a few seconds .
it 's a movie about today ; it 's a road-movie .
it 's about a young man who likes to go to parties because he thinks the western world is paradise and he discovers that it 's not much of a paradise . your birthday is during the festival , on feb .
13 .
will you celebrate ?
what 's your birthday wish ? you know , i think , after a certain age , it 's not necessary to celebrate the age or the birthdays .
but it 's there , so what can i do ? so you have no plans and no wishes ? yes , one wish : not to celebrate . okay , but maybe you will see a good movie on that day . that would be a good celebration - a good present . interview : hans christoph von bock -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in europe 's largest science park , the experiment to merge science and industry is now taking off . located on the eastern outskirts of berlin , adlershof is a quick 20-minute train ride from the city center .
in gdr times adlershof was berlin 's celebrated socialist science mecca .
so when germany 's reunification threatened its further existence , the area embarked on an experiment : the creation of a science park , merging solar technology research with solar industry , in one winning equation . since 1993 , berlin has invested billions of euros in the area - billions the heavily indebted city does n't have .
but adlershof 's public relations manager , peter strunk said it was money well-invested in a bold vision , born of necessity . " this science park project was created to prevent us from social catastrophe after reunification , " strunk said .
" there were so many research facilities located here so instead of closing them down , a decision was made to create an integrated landscape of science and business , to re-establish those industrial structures that had to be dismantled . " a pioneering urban project the science park is embedded in adlershof 's overall urban planning concept , covering over four square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 square miles -rrb- .
its fresh urban landscape is still so new that it looks like a city whose virtual , graphic animation existence has simply been mounted onto the material world . adlershof is stream-lined and squeaky clean , with no mom and pop shops , quirky corners , or rough edges to add a bit of charm and irregularity to its neat , urban profile .
its main avenue is strewn with sleek , modern buildings of glass and steel housing scientific institutions and high tech companies . off the main strip are freshly-plowed streets named in honor of science icons , like albert einstein and max born .
and there 's 66 hectares -lrb- 163 acres -rrb- of land still left undeveloped , waiting to be sold , or rented . staying on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is a main customer of german solar technology one research institute with a long tradition in adlershof is the hahn-meitner institute .
klaus lips , the scientist leading thin-film solar cell reseach at the institute , was educated in marburg , germany , worked in colorado , but returned to germany when offered a position here . lips said adlershof is a solar scientist 's paradise , due to the close proximity of research and industry , and the unique , open dialogue and collaboration that exists between the two . " we work together with companies and establish network projects in which researchers , industry , and university students work together , " lips said , pointing out that the synergy of adlershof 's solar community especially benefits the upcoming generation of solar science researchers . " our young students have excellent job opportunities here , because upcoming companies are looking for trained people , " he added . success story the solar cell company sulfurcell 's founding in 2003 was based on research done on at the hahn-meitner institute .
the company started small , but now employs 100 engineers and factory operators to manufacture thin-film , cis solar cell modules and solar roof tiles . sulfurcell 's ceo nikolaus meyer is a scientist-turned-businessman , involved in the research that led to the company 's creation , and stands firmly behind his product . " cis stands for copper indium disulfide , a new semi-conductor that allows you to use a very thin , conductor layer on glass to produce electricity , " meyer said . sales of sulfurcell 's initial production have been so successful that plans are underway to erect a larger , more automated production plant this year .
meyer said he is confident he 'll be able to bring down the price of his product , to compete with the prices of conventionally produced power within the next five years . meyer said it would have been impossible to set-up and operate his company anywhere but adlershof .
he said the constant support and input of the area 's research institutes are what keep his product state-of-the-art , and thereby competitive . slowly getting noticed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the world 's largest solar parks sits near leipzig , germany in the former east germany , the institute for silicon crystal research enjoyed close ties to the humboldt university 's science faculties nearby , and much of the institute 's current staff are humboldt graduates . recently the institute 's research growing silicon crystals layers directly onto glass panels caught the attention of the international energy company british petroleum , which is now financing their further research . this month , solon , germany 's largest solar cell company , also moved its extensive operations to adlershof .
a new start-up company named inventux is beginning operations there , and two major us solar power companies have shown recently interest in investing in the area . on a roll lips said he 's convinced that german advances in solar technology will enable the country to supply 25 percent of its electricity needs with solar power alone , within the next two decades . meyer from sulfurcell said he believes clean-tech and renewable energy will be germany 's major industries , in the future . " we have seen only the beginning of this industry , and that the technology developed in germany , is creating an excellent foundation for the future success of the industry , " he said . if adlershof 's solar industry continues to grow at its current rate , it has the chance to become the place to be for all significant solar technology players , and europe 's first solaropolis , in the years to come . leah mcdonnell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 03.02.2008 one last gasp of freedom for smokers at cologne carnival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is probably the least silly thing they 'll do this weekend what 's a carnival if not an opportunity to eat , drink and be merry ?
it 's currently the " fifth season " in cologne , and the usual rules are suspended .
this year , that means revelers can flout germany 's smoking ban . as the cologne carnival enters its most manic phase with women 's carnival day on thursday , germany 's new restrictions on smoking in bars and restaurants will be temporarily relaxed .
after all , given the general mayhem set to prevail in the city for the next few days , it would be a little incongruous to penalize partygoers hitting the streets of cologne for their annual carnival-season pub crawl ahead of rose monday simply for smoking .
police have their work cut out for them , stopping fights , breath-alizing drunk drivers and trying to prevent male revelers relieving themselves against walls and in gutters .
compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carnival is a chance to do exactly what you want it 's a compromise wholly in keeping with the carnival spirit - which is all about indulgence before abstinence .
historically , the date of rose monday is determined by the church calendar , taking place on the monday before ash wednesday , which in turn marks the beginning of lent leading up to good friday and easter .
so with the prospect of self-control looming , the carnival season is a semi-lawless time when everyone gets a chance to lose their inhibitions .
obviously , that means quite a few people are going to want to smoke .
moreover , a survey by north rhine-westphalia 's hospitality industry reveals that 80 percent of bar regulars in the state are smokers .
legal loophole as of jan .
1 , 2008 , the third of germans who smoke have been banned from doing so in the pubs and restaurants of most of the country 's 16 states , with the rest of the country to follow later this year .
pubs are now required to confine smokers to separate rooms , although the ban will not take effect in north rhine-westphalia , where cologne is located , until july 1 .
but crucially , the state legislature has decided that the ban on smoking in main rooms will never apply during traditional festivals .
drunk and disorderly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are too busy to enforce the rules it 's just as well .
every year , determined drinkers in fancy dress crowd through the city 's pubs and thick clouds of smoke are part of the experience the tipsy crowds often cheer at any mischief , and can turn hostile towards men in uniform , reports german news agency dpa .
while children enjoy watching the costume parades and the older generation might book a table at a variety show , the young crowd celebrates the six days of high carnival with all-night binges in the city 's many bars .
unenforceable " the enforceability of a smoking ban during carnival would have been just about zero , " hubert heller , proprietor of heller 's bierhaus , and two other leading cologne pubs told dpa .
heller said the police will concentrate during the six days on serious crime and he believes bylaws officers will postpone minor complaints until after the organized mayhem has finished . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politics is power and power makes the world go round - and is the focus of his own films , he said . constantin gavras , better known as costa-gavras , has been named president of the jury at this year 's berlin film festival , which runs from feb .
7-17 .
born in greece in 1933 , his career as a film director took off with the 1969 movie " z. " dw-tv : costa-gavras , of course you will be watching a lot of films during the festival , but can you tell us what else your job as a jury president entails ? costa-gavras : i watch the movies , i 'll discuss with the jury and we 'll try to award the best movie , that 's all .
i 'm trying to be there as a " viewer , " not as a technician or someone who knows the cinema , which is not so easy , of course .
i try to be like any viewer - to be free of any ideological or aesthetical ideas .
the best movie has to get the award . the berlin film festival sees itself more as a political festival in that it gives political cinema a lot of attention .
does that correspond with your general idea of film-making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 58th berlin film festival opens on feb .
7 i think all festivals are political festivals in a way .
the berlin film festival is a bit more so , because they go and set a direction , which i think the cinema needs .
the general idea is that festivals should promote movies with a social content , not only movies which are just entertainment .
if you go back to the history of cinema , the most important movies have been more social-political . your films were once hailed as liberation from hollywood 's dictatorship .
but where does political cinema stand today ? it depends on the money .
right now , it sometimes depends on the united states .
it depends on the stars .
in the last three or four years we have seen very distinct movies about the problems in iraq and the oil problems because the big stars decided to do it .
the major companies did n't want to do it , but they felt obliged to make these movies because they wanted to please the stars - pleasing the stars means they can work together with them again and again . that 's a very new thing for cinema .
before , it was the directors or even the political situation around the world that used to push the companies and the producers to produce movies with strong political content . so , one can say that there is more political cinema in hollywood ... there is more in hollywood at the moment and i think in europe , too , because there are more and more big problems .
i think there is a kind of movement .
but personally i believe that all movies are political .
even the action movies .
they have a kind of social effect on the young public and the public in general .
that 's also political . what can cinema achieve now in a world where we are witnessing an increase of violence and a growing lack of political awareness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress diane kruger joins costa-gavras in the jury i think the cinema has to bring emotions to the public and speak rightly about the problems and then the audience can decide what to do .
the audience must be free and independent .
i do n't believe the cinema should impose ideas they do n't like .
i think the cinema is entertainment but it 's necessary to have some content too . does political cinema rule out entertainment and humor , or can they work together ? absolutely .
look at moliere , for example .
both work together .
in shakespeare you find the same things , or if you go through brecht , for example .
all the important theater has done that , and you can say the same thing about the cinema .
all the big directors - fritz lang , renoir , john ford , kazan , all of them - their movies have both and it works . in your films you have investigated the mechanisms of power during dictatorships and other times of suppression , like the holocaust for instance .
which issues interest you most today ? in our society , the most important issue is power - who has the power to do good or bad things .
i think all of us have power .
we have power over some people under us and other people have power over us because they are stronger than we are .
this pyramid of power - that 's politics .
take a big company like nokia , for example .
when they leave the country and leave thousands of people on the streets without jobs - that 's power .
this is the main issue in our society : the power we have and how we use it . so , power is your main issue . it 's the only issue , in my opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " amen " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- is one of costa-gavras ' films that looks at the role of power coming back to the berlin film festival , your job as jury president will start on feb .
7 .
what are you most looking forward to ? you know , when i go to the cinema i sit and i say , now make me happy , make me furious , make me laugh , make me cry .
those feelings are the best moments in a movie . after the festival , you are going to shoot your next movie .
can you tell us what " eden is west " is about ? it 's very difficult to explain a movie in a few seconds .
it 's a movie about today ; it 's a road-movie .
it 's about a young man who likes to go to parties because he thinks the western world is paradise and he discovers that it 's not much of a paradise . your birthday is during the festival , on feb .
13 .
will you celebrate ?
what 's your birthday wish ? you know , i think , after a certain age , it 's not necessary to celebrate the age or the birthdays .
but it 's there , so what can i do ? so you have no plans and no wishes ? yes , one wish : not to celebrate . okay , but maybe you will see a good movie on that day . that would be a good celebration - a good present . interview : hans christoph von bock -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's currently the " fifth season " in cologne , and the usual rules are suspended .
this year , that means revelers can flout germany 's smoking ban . as the cologne carnival enters its most manic phase with women 's carnival day on thursday , germany 's new restrictions on smoking in bars and restaurants will be temporarily relaxed .
after all , given the general mayhem set to prevail in the city for the next few days , it would be a little incongruous to penalize partygoers hitting the streets of cologne for their annual carnival-season pub crawl ahead of rose monday simply for smoking .
police have their work cut out for them , stopping fights , breath-alizing drunk drivers and trying to prevent male revelers relieving themselves against walls and in gutters .
compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carnival is a chance to do exactly what you want it 's a compromise wholly in keeping with the carnival spirit - which is all about indulgence before abstinence .
historically , the date of rose monday is determined by the church calendar , taking place on the monday before ash wednesday , which in turn marks the beginning of lent leading up to good friday and easter .
so with the prospect of self-control looming , the carnival season is a semi-lawless time when everyone gets a chance to lose their inhibitions .
obviously , that means quite a few people are going to want to smoke .
moreover , a survey by north rhine-westphalia 's hospitality industry reveals that 80 percent of bar regulars in the state are smokers .
legal loophole as of jan .
1 , 2008 , the third of germans who smoke have been banned from doing so in the pubs and restaurants of most of the country 's 16 states , with the rest of the country to follow later this year .
pubs are now required to confine smokers to separate rooms , although the ban will not take effect in north rhine-westphalia , where cologne is located , until july 1 .
but crucially , the state legislature has decided that the ban on smoking in main rooms will never apply during traditional festivals .
drunk and disorderly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are too busy to enforce the rules it 's just as well .
every year , determined drinkers in fancy dress crowd through the city 's pubs and thick clouds of smoke are part of the experience the tipsy crowds often cheer at any mischief , and can turn hostile towards men in uniform , reports german news agency dpa .
while children enjoy watching the costume parades and the older generation might book a table at a variety show , the young crowd celebrates the six days of high carnival with all-night binges in the city 's many bars .
unenforceable " the enforceability of a smoking ban during carnival would have been just about zero , " hubert heller , proprietor of heller 's bierhaus , and two other leading cologne pubs told dpa .
heller said the police will concentrate during the six days on serious crime and he believes bylaws officers will postpone minor complaints until after the organized mayhem has finished . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
a commons standards committee said there was no record of freddie , a student , doing work at westminster in return for £ 40,000 of taxpayers ' money .
alistair graham , the former chairman of the committee , criticised the mp for old bexley and sidcup 's defence .
but he said it showed the system is " pretty rotten " .
sir alistair told bbc news : ' ' i think his general argument is , i 've just been a fall guy for a system in which many other mp 's have done similar sorts of things to myself .
" i never think that 's a very good defence of having done something wrong but it really does seem to demonstrate that the system is pretty rotten . "
whip withdrawing mr conway has been suspended from the commons for 10 days and ordered to return £ 13,161 of the money he paid his son .
he announced he will stand down as an mp at the next general election , after tory leader david cameron withdrew the conservative whip following the report .
but in an interview with the mail on sunday , mr conway said : " i still believe i have done nothing wrong . "
he said his son travelled from newcastle to help him with his mp work .
he told the paper : " i know many mps with family members who have different names registered , so they are not so obviously spotted .
some spouses work under maiden names . "
mr conway insisted both freddie , 22 , and elder son , henry 25 , whom he employed earlier , did the work they were paid for .
" a lot of students do part-time work .
he was working for his father rather than working in mcdonald 's , " he said .
" he used to come home frequently .
he would go up and down like a fiddler 's elbow while he was away .
lots of mps have family who work from home derek conway " there are mps who commute greater distances than that on a weekly basis and some are three times freddie 's age .
i do n't think it was unusual . "
mr conway may face a second inquiry into the job he gave henry , while scotland yard are considering a demand for a police probe into allegations of fraud .
' homophobic ' the standards committee report , which said freddie was " all but invisible " at westminster , concluded the arrangement was " at the least an improper use of parliamentary allowances " and " at worst , a serious diversion of public funds " .
mr conway said freddie and henry worked from the family flat in nearby victoria , adding : " lots of mps have family who work from home . "
outlining the work henry did , he said : " he 'd fillet post , scrutinise e-mails and stuff envelopes .
i am one of many mps who employ family members .
it does n't mean there 's not a job to be done or that they were n't doing it . "
mr conway also denounced as " homophobic " media reports which have referred to henry 's sexuality and rejected allegations he employed another researcher , michael pratte , because he was a friend of his sons .
mr pratte met freddie and henry only after joining his office , he said .
hain 's mother the mp also questioned the motives of some of his parliamentary critics , suggesting labour was exploiting the issue to distract the public from the donations row .
" this was a golden opportunity - clearly supported by some tories , some of whom may well have had their own agenda , " he said .
the row has prompted the leaders of all three main parties to tell mps to make it clear if they employ relatives .
former cabinet minister peter hain has since confirmed that his mother works for him as a part-time secretary .
adelaine hain , 80 , has worked for her son at the commons since 1991 and was paid £ 5,400 last year .
mr hain , who quit as pensions secretary last month over a probe into undeclared donations , said : " i 've never hidden anything .
she works really hard . "

he was working for his father rather than working in mcdonald 's , " he said .
" he used to come home frequently .
he would go up and down like a fiddler 's elbow while he was away .
lots of mps have family who work from home derek conway " there are mps who commute greater distances than that on a weekly basis and some are three times freddie 's age .
i do n't think it was unusual . "
mr conway may face a second inquiry into the job he gave henry , while scotland yard are considering a demand for a police probe into allegations of fraud .
' homophobic ' the standards committee report , which said freddie was " all but invisible " at westminster , concluded the arrangement was " at the least an improper use of parliamentary allowances " and " at worst , a serious diversion of public funds " .
mr conway said freddie and henry worked from the family flat in nearby victoria , adding : " lots of mps have family who work from home . "
outlining the work henry did , he said : " he 'd fillet post , scrutinise e-mails and stuff envelopes .
i am one of many mps who employ family members .
it does n't mean there 's not a job to be done or that they were n't doing it . "
mr conway also denounced as " homophobic " media reports which have referred to henry 's sexuality and rejected allegations he employed another researcher , michael pratte , because he was a friend of his sons .
mr pratte met freddie and henry only after joining his office , he said .
hain 's mother the mp also questioned the motives of some of his parliamentary critics , suggesting labour was exploiting the issue to distract the public from the donations row .
" this was a golden opportunity - clearly supported by some tories , some of whom may well have had their own agenda , " he said .
the row has prompted the leaders of all three main parties to tell mps to make it clear if they employ relatives .
former cabinet minister peter hain has since confirmed that his mother works for him as a part-time secretary .
adelaine hain , 80 , has worked for her son at the commons since 1991 and was paid £ 5,400 last year .
mr hain , who quit as pensions secretary last month over a probe into undeclared donations , said : " i 've never hidden anything .

"
a commons standards committee said there was no record of freddie , a student , doing work at westminster in return for £ 40,000 of taxpayers ' money .
alistair graham , the former chairman of the committee , criticised the mp for old bexley and sidcup 's defence .
but he said it showed the system is " pretty rotten " .
sir alistair told bbc news : ' ' i think his general argument is , i 've just been a fall guy for a system in which many other mp 's have done similar sorts of things to myself .
" i never think that 's a very good defence of having done something wrong but it really does seem to demonstrate that the system is pretty rotten . "
whip withdrawing mr conway has been suspended from the commons for 10 days and ordered to return £ 13,161 of the money he paid his son .
he announced he will stand down as an mp at the next general election , after tory leader david cameron withdrew the conservative whip following the report .
but in an interview with the mail on sunday , mr conway said : " i still believe i have done nothing wrong . "
he said his son travelled from newcastle to help him with his mp work .
he told the paper : " i know many mps with family members who have different names registered , so they are not so obviously spotted .
some spouses work under maiden names . "
mr conway insisted both freddie , 22 , and elder son , henry 25 , whom he employed earlier , did the work they were paid for .
" a lot of students do part-time work .
he was working for his father rather than working in mcdonald 's , " he said .

currently police can seize alcohol only from groups suspected of alcohol-related crime or disorder .
and although under-18s are not allowed to buy alcohol , there is no law preventing them from drinking it .
the proposed ban , which will mean youngsters can legally drink only at home , will be announced by home secretary jacqui smith this week .
frank soodeen , from alcohol concern , has welcomed the proposal .
he said : " the risks for young people of drinking in public are much higher than if , for example , they were at home .
so hopefully , this may reduce what we know is a rising number of hospital admissions for the under-16s .
" one of the reasons they buy in such quantities is that it 's so easy to find somewhere to drink it and obviously that 's what we need to cut back on . "
" i fully support communities ' efforts to stamp out under-age alcohol-fuelled disorder " jacqui smith the home secretary will also demand that drink manufacturers do more to stop alcohol being sold to under-18s .
a home office spokesman said : " the home secretary will listen to police and is ready to give them extra powers .
she is very keen to go for this . "
and ms smith told the news of the world : " if children are caught drinking in public they 'll have those drinks confiscated .
" i fully support communities ' efforts to stamp out under-age alcohol-fuelled disorder and the harm that it causes . "
police were given the power to seize alcohol and disperse groups suspected of alcohol-related crime or disorder under the violent crime reduction act 2006 .
and in a month-long crack-down between october and november last year , the home office said officers used power to seize the equivalent of 6,500 pints of alcohol from under-age drinkers .

tooting mp sadiq khan and babar ahmad were recorded twice in milton keynes 's woodhill prison , the sunday times says .
the us is seeking to extradite mr ahmad on suspicion of running websites raising funds for the taleban .
mr straw said it was " completely unacceptable " for an mp to be recorded while talking to a constituent .
hollowed-out table the bugging is said to have been carried out by officers from scotland yard 's anti-terrorist branch during visits by mr khan to the milton keynes jail in 2005 and 2006 .
the 37-year-old mp and government whip has campaigned for mr ahmad 's release .
the detained man faces no charges in the uk and is awaiting a decision from the european courts to discover if he will be extradited to the us .
according to the newspaper , the bugging device was hidden inside a hollowed-out table in the jail 's main visiting hall .

jack straw , justice minister , said he had no knowledge of the facts but has ordered an internal inquiry .
he added : " it is completely unacceptable for an interview to be conducted by a mp on a constituent matter or in any other issue to be recorded . "
the bugging of mps by police has been barred since 1966 .
a principle was established by harold wilson 's government , following a series of eavesdropping scandals , that conversations between constituents and their mps should be confidential .
the bugging allegations concerned meetings at which he and mr ahmad had discussed sensitive personal and legal matters .
' very regrettable ' and other mps have reacted angrily to the revelations .
khalid mahmood , mp for birmingham perry barr , said it sent out a difficult message , not just for muslim people but for british people .
" i do n't think for a minute sadiq khan would do anything not in the interests of this country .
he is a member of this country , of parliament and is a whip and what has happened is highly questionable , " he said .

hollowed-out table the bugging is said to have been carried out by officers from scotland yard 's anti-terrorist branch during visits by mr khan to the milton keynes jail in 2005 and 2006 .
the 37-year-old mp and government whip has campaigned for mr ahmad 's release .
the detained man faces no charges in the uk and is awaiting a decision from the european courts to discover if he will be extradited to the us .
according to the newspaper , the bugging device was hidden inside a hollowed-out table in the jail 's main visiting hall .
it is the wrong way for police to act khalid mahmood the paper says it has seen a document showing there were internal concerns about bugging the mp , who is also a lawyer , but it went ahead anyway .
scotland yard said it was not prepared to comment on the claims .
jack straw , justice minister , said he had no knowledge of the facts but has ordered an internal inquiry .
he added : " it is completely unacceptable for an interview to be conducted by a mp on a constituent matter or in any other issue to be recorded . "
the bugging of mps by police has been barred since 1966 .
a principle was established by harold wilson 's government , following a series of eavesdropping scandals , that conversations between constituents and their mps should be confidential .
the bugging allegations concerned meetings at which he and mr ahmad had discussed sensitive personal and legal matters .
' very regrettable ' and other mps have reacted angrily to the revelations .
khalid mahmood , mp for birmingham perry barr , said it sent out a difficult message , not just for muslim people but for british people .
" i do n't think for a minute sadiq khan would do anything not in the interests of this country .
he is a member of this country , of parliament and is a whip and what has happened is highly questionable , " he said .
" it 's very regrettable .
this member of parliament deserves the respect which he has been given by his constituents .
" if he felt there was an issue of national interest mr khan himself would have made police aware .
it is the wrong way for police to act . "
his views were echoed by thurrock mp andrew mckinlay said it was " wholly unacceptable " for mps to be under surveillance .
