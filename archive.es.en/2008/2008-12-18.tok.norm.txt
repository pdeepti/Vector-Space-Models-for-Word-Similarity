their goal : to share experiences at conferences and improve access to files . a symbolic spot was chosen to sign the deal : the european house at the brandenburg gate .
until the end of 1989 , the berlin wall stood just a few meters away . for marianne birthler , the head of the federal commission for the records of the state security service of the former east germany , it was the fulfillment of a long-held dream : to deal with cold war secret police issues on an international basis . systematic cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film " the lives of others " helped explain the era to a new generation there has been contact between the countries in the past , but nothing systematic .
the european network - which will include the documentation agency of the east german stasi , as well as their counterparts in bulgaria , poland , romania , slovakia , the czech republic , and hungary - is expected to change all that . " one of our projects will be to provide information about our work in all seven countries , either via the internet or in printed form , " birthler said .
" of course , we will also host conferences .
there could even be a joint exhibition .
we 'll have to see . " different histories , different methods while birthler has plenty of plans , each country 's method of dealing with the issue is quite different . for example , in the czech republic , communist crimes have been under investigation since the mid-1990s , and access to files just became possible 10 months ago , according to miroslav lehky of the state security records agency in prague .
and compared with the germans , the czechs have many more files . " -lrb- we have files -rrb- not only from stasi , but all repressive state organizations from the communist state .
that includes military intelligence , civil intelligence , border guards .
now we have everything together , and can analyze it .
and of course we want to open everything , " said lehky . " i want to publish names " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives are accessible in berlin today bulgaria is also playing catch-up .
the records-historians there had to struggle for a long time before they got their own building .
now they have one .
it is slated to contain an archive of all the former secret agencies .
the goal of records-official evtim kostanidov , too , is to open up the archive to anyone who wants it . " another important job is to publish the names of those people who worked for the secret police , both officially and unofficially , " he said . for her part , birthler hopes the european network will help spark initiatives , particularly in post-communist countries that are n't part of the current group . an example for others " i could imagine that our cooperation would give strength to people who need it .
just the fact that we exist , and that we 're visible on the european level , " she said .
slovenia and the baltic states are the countries that jump to mind , she says .
at this point , she notes , they are all members of the eu . europe is reunited and free , birthler said , but europe would n't be europe without an understanding of its diverse and contradictory past . marcel fuerstenau -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.12.2008 steinmeier grilled over germany 's role in iraq war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier insists germany did not aid the us war effort german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier faced hard questions thursday about germany 's role in the us-led " war on terror . "
the stakes are high for steinmeier , who would like to become germany 's next chancellor . in parliamentary hearings on thursday , dec .
18 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuffed accusations in connection to the mission of two agents of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
steinmeier once again justified the mission of the two bnd agents who , at the time , were based at the french embassy with diplomatic passports .
he said that the bnd and the german government wanted to be able to gather their own information and not be forced to rely on outside sources .
steinmeier told the committee that at the time it was completely clear to all parties involved in the mission that the political guidelines stood and that germany was not taking part in the war .
" there is no reason for me to believe that the wishes of the government were either knowingly or unknowingly violated , " he added .
germany criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency during the launch of war in iraq germany , traditionally a strong us ally , came out strongly against the invasion of iraq .
yet in the five years since the war in iraq started , berlin has been criticized for becoming covertly involved in the us fight against islamist extremists .
there have been accusations that germany 's intelligence services were aware of cia kidnappings and prisoner renditions .
most recently , a top retired us military officer said that the united states relied on german intelligence during its invasion of iraq in 2003 .
due to his role as chief of staff for then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency , placing him at the center of the current accusations of aiding the us .
high stakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans have vocally opposed the war this is the fifth time steinmeier has been called before a parliamentary committee to testify about issues relating to germany 's participation in the us-led " war on terror . "
and the stakes for steinmeier have never been higher .
the social democratic party has chosen steinmeier to run against current chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the cdu and spd currently share power in an awkward coalition government .
both sides would like a decisive electoral victory next fall , which would allow them to ditch their current partners and form coalitions with other parties .
steinmeier 's party has made a campaign issue out of its opposition to the war in iraq .
it could be disastrous for social democrats if it now turns out that german spies were secretly funneling information to us counterparts to aid in the us invasion of iraq .
long list of questionable involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has denied knowing about secret cia flights steinmeier was first called to testify two years ago as part of a closed-door parliamentary enquiry into the kidnapping of khaled el-masri .
the german-lebanese man says he was imprisoned by us agents in december 2003 in macedonia and tortured in afghanistan before being released five months later .
in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german .
steinmeier denied knowing anything about el-masri 's case until after he had been freed .
at the time , steinmeier admitted that " sometimes , difficult decisions were necessary . "
but he denied that anything was done illegally .
" that was true in the past , " steinmeier said at the time .
" and i can promise you that it will also be true in the future . "
since then , there have been several other high-profile cases in which german citizens have claimed they have been kidnapped or tortured as part of us anti-terrorism efforts .
steinmeier has also been questioned about germany 's involvement in so-called rendition flights , in which the cia secretly transported people to countries for interrogation where they were possibly tortured .
steinmeier will face tough questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri claims claims he was tortured the committee was never able to determine whether or not germany knew about the el-masri kidnapping or any of the other cases .
until now , the german foreign minister has not experienced any political backlash from the various cases .
but that current round of questioning could prove to be the most challenging for steinmeier as he has to clarify the role of two german spies during the iraq war .
earlier this week , retired us general james marks said in an interview with der spiegel magazine that information provided by german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- spies stationed in baghdad was extremely important , detailed and useful to the united states .
" reports on the defensive positions in and around baghdad and the location of troops and weapons were important , " marks told the magazine .
" we trusted information from germany more than from the cia . "
the agents sent approximately 130 reports to their commanders in germany and appeared to be aware their intelligence was being forwarded to the americans , according to the spiegel report .
that news has outraged other politicians .
" he did not take adequate measures ensure that important information from baghdad would not be forwarded to the us headquarters , " said hans-christian stroebele of the green party .
officials in berlin continue to maintain that germany was not involved in the fighting of the iraq war .
" what foreign minster steinmeier has been saying from the beginning stands : germany had good reason to be against the iraq war and for that reason was not involved in combat operations , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany able to completely avoid becoming involved ?
steinmeier has defended himself by saying that the bnd did not provide " active support of combat operations , " but that the bnd did work to " avoid an embassy or hospital from being bombed , which has nothing to do with double standards but with saving innocent people 's lives . "
the spd has signaled that it will stand behind steinmeier .
thomas oppermann , who is a member of the spd and chairs the parliamentary committee overseeing intelligence issues , said that the interview with general marks was " manipulated . "
marks has also been invited to testify before the committee . dw staff -lrb- th , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is no reason for me to believe that the wishes of the government were either knowingly or unknowingly violated , " he added .
germany criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency during the launch of war in iraq germany , traditionally a strong us ally , came out strongly against the invasion of iraq .
yet in the five years since the war in iraq started , berlin has been criticized for becoming covertly involved in the us fight against islamist extremists .
there have been accusations that germany 's intelligence services were aware of cia kidnappings and prisoner renditions .
most recently , a top retired us military officer said that the united states relied on german intelligence during its invasion of iraq in 2003 .
due to his role as chief of staff for then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency , placing him at the center of the current accusations of aiding the us .
high stakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans have vocally opposed the war this is the fifth time steinmeier has been called before a parliamentary committee to testify about issues relating to germany 's participation in the us-led " war on terror . "
and the stakes for steinmeier have never been higher .
the social democratic party has chosen steinmeier to run against current chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the cdu and spd currently share power in an awkward coalition government .
both sides would like a decisive electoral victory next fall , which would allow them to ditch their current partners and form coalitions with other parties .
steinmeier 's party has made a campaign issue out of its opposition to the war in iraq .
it could be disastrous for social democrats if it now turns out that german spies were secretly funneling information to us counterparts to aid in the us invasion of iraq .
long list of questionable involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has denied knowing about secret cia flights steinmeier was first called to testify two years ago as part of a closed-door parliamentary enquiry into the kidnapping of khaled el-masri .
the german-lebanese man says he was imprisoned by us agents in december 2003 in macedonia and tortured in afghanistan before being released five months later .
in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german .
steinmeier denied knowing anything about el-masri 's case until after he had been freed .
at the time , steinmeier admitted that " sometimes , difficult decisions were necessary . "
but he denied that anything was done illegally .
" that was true in the past , " steinmeier said at the time .
" and i can promise you that it will also be true in the future . "
since then , there have been several other high-profile cases in which german citizens have claimed they have been kidnapped or tortured as part of us anti-terrorism efforts .
steinmeier has also been questioned about germany 's involvement in so-called rendition flights , in which the cia secretly transported people to countries for interrogation where they were possibly tortured .
steinmeier will face tough questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri claims claims he was tortured the committee was never able to determine whether or not germany knew about the el-masri kidnapping or any of the other cases .
until now , the german foreign minister has not experienced any political backlash from the various cases .
but that current round of questioning could prove to be the most challenging for steinmeier as he has to clarify the role of two german spies during the iraq war .
earlier this week , retired us general james marks said in an interview with der spiegel magazine that information provided by german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- spies stationed in baghdad was extremely important , detailed and useful to the united states .
" reports on the defensive positions in and around baghdad and the location of troops and weapons were important , " marks told the magazine .
" we trusted information from germany more than from the cia . "
the agents sent approximately 130 reports to their commanders in germany and appeared to be aware their intelligence was being forwarded to the americans , according to the spiegel report .
that news has outraged other politicians .
" he did not take adequate measures ensure that important information from baghdad would not be forwarded to the us headquarters , " said hans-christian stroebele of the green party .
officials in berlin continue to maintain that germany was not involved in the fighting of the iraq war .
" what foreign minster steinmeier has been saying from the beginning stands : germany had good reason to be against the iraq war and for that reason was not involved in combat operations , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany able to completely avoid becoming involved ?
steinmeier has defended himself by saying that the bnd did not provide " active support of combat operations , " but that the bnd did work to " avoid an embassy or hospital from being bombed , which has nothing to do with double standards but with saving innocent people 's lives . "
the spd has signaled that it will stand behind steinmeier .
thomas oppermann , who is a member of the spd and chairs the parliamentary committee overseeing intelligence issues , said that the interview with general marks was " manipulated . "

"
the stakes are high for steinmeier , who would like to become germany 's next chancellor . in parliamentary hearings on thursday , dec .
18 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuffed accusations in connection to the mission of two agents of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
steinmeier once again justified the mission of the two bnd agents who , at the time , were based at the french embassy with diplomatic passports .
he said that the bnd and the german government wanted to be able to gather their own information and not be forced to rely on outside sources .
steinmeier told the committee that at the time it was completely clear to all parties involved in the mission that the political guidelines stood and that germany was not taking part in the war .

with business slumping , europe 's largest economy is bracing itself for a tough year . with the global economic downturn gaining momentum , the closely-watched ifo business confidence index marked the end of the year by chalking up its seventh consecutive monthly fall , declining to 82.6 points . " december 's fall in the german ifo business climate index brings further evidence that , far from weathering the storm , the german economy is in the midst of it , " capital economics economist jennifer mckeown told the afp news agency . analysts had expected the index , which is drawn up by the munich-based economic institute , would fall to 84 points after it plunged more than expected in november to 85.8 points .
the index stood at 90.2 points in october . a sub-index of the ifo survey was much lower at 88.8 points , compared with 94.9 in october , while expectations for the next six months also hit a record low of 76.8 points from 77.6 points , the institute said . " the dominant feature of the december decline is the worsening of the firms ' current business situation , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn in a statement . downturn expected to affect labor market considered the most accurate measure of german business confidence , the survey of 7,000 german executives comes in the wake of the publication of a slew of major indicators and data underscoring the bleak economic outlook taking shape across europe . on tuesday , a euro-zone purchasing managers ' index -lrb- pmi -rrb- for december compiled by data and research group markit fell to 38.3 points , its lowest level in the survey 's 10-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairs at unemployment offices across germany may soon be filling up again " the downturn is affecting above all the manufacturers of export and capital goods and less , up until now , retailing and construction , " sinn added .
" the pessimistic expectations of past months are becoming reality as more and more of the firms report an unsatisfactory business situation . " ifo said in its report that the auto and chemical sectors in the world 's leading exporter have been especially hard hit by the global economic slowdown .
companies have likewise reported that they expect to shed workers , halting a steady fall in german unemployment rates . " on the whole the economic downturn has worsened and will now have an impact on the labor market , " the report said . " little light at the end of the tunnel " germany might see economic activity contract by up to 3.0 percent next year , which would mark the worst recession in its post-war history , deputy economy minister walther otremba told afp on wednesday . " with the -lrb- ifo -rrb- expectations index still at a record low , there is little light at the end of the tunnel , " mckeown said .
" in all , it still looks likely that german gdp will fall by at least 1.0 percent next year and the latest forecast from the ifo institute itself of a fall of about 2.0 percent might not be too far off the mark .

" the dominant feature of the december decline is the worsening of the firms ' current business situation , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn in a statement . downturn expected to affect labor market considered the most accurate measure of german business confidence , the survey of 7,000 german executives comes in the wake of the publication of a slew of major indicators and data underscoring the bleak economic outlook taking shape across europe . on tuesday , a euro-zone purchasing managers ' index -lrb- pmi -rrb- for december compiled by data and research group markit fell to 38.3 points , its lowest level in the survey 's 10-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairs at unemployment offices across germany may soon be filling up again " the downturn is affecting above all the manufacturers of export and capital goods and less , up until now , retailing and construction , " sinn added .
" the pessimistic expectations of past months are becoming reality as more and more of the firms report an unsatisfactory business situation . " ifo said in its report that the auto and chemical sectors in the world 's leading exporter have been especially hard hit by the global economic slowdown .
companies have likewise reported that they expect to shed workers , halting a steady fall in german unemployment rates . " on the whole the economic downturn has worsened and will now have an impact on the labor market , " the report said . " little light at the end of the tunnel " germany might see economic activity contract by up to 3.0 percent next year , which would mark the worst recession in its post-war history , deputy economy minister walther otremba told afp on wednesday . " with the -lrb- ifo -rrb- expectations index still at a record low , there is little light at the end of the tunnel , " mckeown said .
" in all , it still looks likely that german gdp will fall by at least 1.0 percent next year and the latest forecast from the ifo institute itself of a fall of about 2.0 percent might not be too far off the mark .

it is a sign that the chill in relations between the alliance and the kremlin in the wake of the georgia conflict is starting to pass . the talks , labelled an " informal lunch , " will involve nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and russia 's ambassador to the alliance , dmitry rogozin , a nato official said on thursday , dec .
18 .
the meeting will be the first high-level gathering between russian and nato officials since august , when georgia and russia fought a short-lived but intense conflict over the breakaway georgian enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia .
as a result of that conflict , nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- talks were put on hold as tension was ratcheted up between the two parties over russia 's response to a georgian attempt to reassert its control over south ossetia .
although nrc technical and working-level talks were not interrupted , all meetings at the ambassadorial , ministerial and head-of-government levels have been frozen since the august war .
formal talks a possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : securing russian gas and oil is integral for security in europe , leaders say a handful of european governments - notable germany and france - have been eager to recommence high-level dialog with russia owing to its position as a major supplier of natural gas and oil to europe .
nato foreign ministers have tasked scheffer " to re-engage with russia at the political level " with a possible full return to formal talks once he reports back .
rogozin said he wanted all problematic issues between russia and nato to be " put on the table " so moscow could then decide whether it wanted to proceed with nrc meetings .
" i hope the secretary general will propose dates and themes for discussion and i will see with moscow if this is convenient , and then we will take a decision , " he told the afp news agency .
" everything has to be put on the table , " he said .
" it 's up to nato to correct its errors . "
mounting tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has vehemently opposed independence for kosovo tensions between russia and nato have been on the increase over several contentious matters , including kremlin anger at alliance pledges to absorb georgia and ukraine - both ex-soviet republics - into the 26-member bloc .
moscow views this as nato meddling in its traditional sphere of influence and as an attempt to box russia in .
russia has also strongly opposed independence from serbia for kosovo , which europe and nato have backed .
nato currently has a peacekeeping force in kosovo .
adding further fuel to the fire is a planned us anti-missile shield base which will see elements installed in poland and the czech republic .

their goal : to share experiences at conferences and improve access to files . a symbolic spot was chosen to sign the deal : the european house at the brandenburg gate .
until the end of 1989 , the berlin wall stood just a few meters away . for marianne birthler , the head of the federal commission for the records of the state security service of the former east germany , it was the fulfillment of a long-held dream : to deal with cold war secret police issues on an international basis . systematic cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film " the lives of others " helped explain the era to a new generation there has been contact between the countries in the past , but nothing systematic .
the european network - which will include the documentation agency of the east german stasi , as well as their counterparts in bulgaria , poland , romania , slovakia , the czech republic , and hungary - is expected to change all that . " one of our projects will be to provide information about our work in all seven countries , either via the internet or in printed form , " birthler said .
" of course , we will also host conferences .
there could even be a joint exhibition .
we 'll have to see . " different histories , different methods while birthler has plenty of plans , each country 's method of dealing with the issue is quite different . for example , in the czech republic , communist crimes have been under investigation since the mid-1990s , and access to files just became possible 10 months ago , according to miroslav lehky of the state security records agency in prague .
and compared with the germans , the czechs have many more files . " -lrb- we have files -rrb- not only from stasi , but all repressive state organizations from the communist state .
that includes military intelligence , civil intelligence , border guards .
now we have everything together , and can analyze it .
and of course we want to open everything , " said lehky . " i want to publish names " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives are accessible in berlin today bulgaria is also playing catch-up .
the records-historians there had to struggle for a long time before they got their own building .
now they have one .
it is slated to contain an archive of all the former secret agencies .
the goal of records-official evtim kostanidov , too , is to open up the archive to anyone who wants it . " another important job is to publish the names of those people who worked for the secret police , both officially and unofficially , " he said . for her part , birthler hopes the european network will help spark initiatives , particularly in post-communist countries that are n't part of the current group . an example for others " i could imagine that our cooperation would give strength to people who need it .
just the fact that we exist , and that we 're visible on the european level , " she said .
slovenia and the baltic states are the countries that jump to mind , she says .
at this point , she notes , they are all members of the eu . europe is reunited and free , birthler said , but europe would n't be europe without an understanding of its diverse and contradictory past . marcel fuerstenau -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it returns russian justice to the times of 1920-1950s , when independent evaluation of the situation in the country ... to say nothing of the criticism of the regime and unsanctioned communication with foreigners , was interpreted as treason to the motherland , " the statement said . opposition movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilya yashin is one of the founding members of solidarity the bill was submitted last friday , just a day before a new opposition movement , solidarity , was founded in moscow .
among those in charge of the rally in the russian capital was ilya yashin , a 28-year-old opposition politician and the head of the youth wing of the liberal yabloko party . founding solidarity was important because russians have to know what is occurring in their country , yashin told deutsche welle , adding that in russia there is an information vacuum and news broadcast on the putin-controlled television have nothing to do with reality . bringing down the regime yashin said it was important to form a large , connected opposition in order to change the current power structure . " we will never be able to bring down this mechanism of power from the inside , " he said .
" this power is so complete that it consumes everything .
it has wrecked parliament , it has robbed us of our elections , it has destroyed independent television and the justice system .
the former kgb people who rule this nation are deaf and blind to criticism from the inside . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say putin has too much power yashin called the new move putin 's cabinet is another in a long line of battles he will have to help fight .
he said he understands that success for solidarity means that his life will be in greater danger , but added that democracy is worth it . " freedom is n't going to be served up on a plate , " he said .

with business slumping , europe 's largest economy is bracing itself for a tough year . with the global economic downturn gaining momentum , the closely-watched ifo business confidence index marked the end of the year by chalking up its seventh consecutive monthly fall , declining to 82.6 points . " december 's fall in the german ifo business climate index brings further evidence that , far from weathering the storm , the german economy is in the midst of it , " capital economics economist jennifer mckeown told the afp news agency . analysts had expected the index , which is drawn up by the munich-based economic institute , would fall to 84 points after it plunged more than expected in november to 85.8 points .
the index stood at 90.2 points in october . a sub-index of the ifo survey was much lower at 88.8 points , compared with 94.9 in october , while expectations for the next six months also hit a record low of 76.8 points from 77.6 points , the institute said . " the dominant feature of the december decline is the worsening of the firms ' current business situation , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn in a statement . downturn expected to affect labor market considered the most accurate measure of german business confidence , the survey of 7,000 german executives comes in the wake of the publication of a slew of major indicators and data underscoring the bleak economic outlook taking shape across europe . on tuesday , a euro-zone purchasing managers ' index -lrb- pmi -rrb- for december compiled by data and research group markit fell to 38.3 points , its lowest level in the survey 's 10-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairs at unemployment offices across germany may soon be filling up again " the downturn is affecting above all the manufacturers of export and capital goods and less , up until now , retailing and construction , " sinn added .
" the pessimistic expectations of past months are becoming reality as more and more of the firms report an unsatisfactory business situation . " ifo said in its report that the auto and chemical sectors in the world 's leading exporter have been especially hard hit by the global economic slowdown .
companies have likewise reported that they expect to shed workers , halting a steady fall in german unemployment rates . " on the whole the economic downturn has worsened and will now have an impact on the labor market , " the report said . " little light at the end of the tunnel " germany might see economic activity contract by up to 3.0 percent next year , which would mark the worst recession in its post-war history , deputy economy minister walther otremba told afp on wednesday . " with the -lrb- ifo -rrb- expectations index still at a record low , there is little light at the end of the tunnel , " mckeown said .
" in all , it still looks likely that german gdp will fall by at least 1.0 percent next year and the latest forecast from the ifo institute itself of a fall of about 2.0 percent might not be too far off the mark .

it is a sign that the chill in relations between the alliance and the kremlin in the wake of the georgia conflict is starting to pass . the talks , labelled an " informal lunch , " will involve nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and russia 's ambassador to the alliance , dmitry rogozin , a nato official said on thursday , dec .
18 .
the meeting will be the first high-level gathering between russian and nato officials since august , when georgia and russia fought a short-lived but intense conflict over the breakaway georgian enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia .
as a result of that conflict , nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- talks were put on hold as tension was ratcheted up between the two parties over russia 's response to a georgian attempt to reassert its control over south ossetia .
although nrc technical and working-level talks were not interrupted , all meetings at the ambassadorial , ministerial and head-of-government levels have been frozen since the august war .
formal talks a possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : securing russian gas and oil is integral for security in europe , leaders say a handful of european governments - notable germany and france - have been eager to recommence high-level dialog with russia owing to its position as a major supplier of natural gas and oil to europe .
nato foreign ministers have tasked scheffer " to re-engage with russia at the political level " with a possible full return to formal talks once he reports back .
rogozin said he wanted all problematic issues between russia and nato to be " put on the table " so moscow could then decide whether it wanted to proceed with nrc meetings .
" i hope the secretary general will propose dates and themes for discussion and i will see with moscow if this is convenient , and then we will take a decision , " he told the afp news agency .
" everything has to be put on the table , " he said .
" it 's up to nato to correct its errors . "
mounting tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has vehemently opposed independence for kosovo tensions between russia and nato have been on the increase over several contentious matters , including kremlin anger at alliance pledges to absorb georgia and ukraine - both ex-soviet republics - into the 26-member bloc .
moscow views this as nato meddling in its traditional sphere of influence and as an attempt to box russia in .
russia has also strongly opposed independence from serbia for kosovo , which europe and nato have backed .
nato currently has a peacekeeping force in kosovo .
adding further fuel to the fire is a planned us anti-missile shield base which will see elements installed in poland and the czech republic .
moscow views this measure as a direct threat .
nato , meanwhile , has condemned russia 's recognition of the independence of the two breakaway georgian regions and views with distrust russian president dmitry medvedev 's proposal for a new european security pact , which the alliance believes is designed to negate the efficacy of nato . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with business slumping , europe 's largest economy is bracing itself for a tough year . with the global economic downturn gaining momentum , the closely-watched ifo business confidence index marked the end of the year by chalking up its seventh consecutive monthly fall , declining to 82.6 points . " december 's fall in the german ifo business climate index brings further evidence that , far from weathering the storm , the german economy is in the midst of it , " capital economics economist jennifer mckeown told the afp news agency . analysts had expected the index , which is drawn up by the munich-based economic institute , would fall to 84 points after it plunged more than expected in november to 85.8 points .
the index stood at 90.2 points in october . a sub-index of the ifo survey was much lower at 88.8 points , compared with 94.9 in october , while expectations for the next six months also hit a record low of 76.8 points from 77.6 points , the institute said . " the dominant feature of the december decline is the worsening of the firms ' current business situation , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn in a statement . downturn expected to affect labor market considered the most accurate measure of german business confidence , the survey of 7,000 german executives comes in the wake of the publication of a slew of major indicators and data underscoring the bleak economic outlook taking shape across europe . on tuesday , a euro-zone purchasing managers ' index -lrb- pmi -rrb- for december compiled by data and research group markit fell to 38.3 points , its lowest level in the survey 's 10-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairs at unemployment offices across germany may soon be filling up again " the downturn is affecting above all the manufacturers of export and capital goods and less , up until now , retailing and construction , " sinn added .

companies have likewise reported that they expect to shed workers , halting a steady fall in german unemployment rates . " on the whole the economic downturn has worsened and will now have an impact on the labor market , " the report said .

he said berlin should put still more money on the table in addition to the existing stimulus package it has announced .
" it would be helpful if the german government , whose reluctance i fully understand , were able to take another step " and introduce further measures to aid the economy , the head of the washington-based imf told germany 's " zdf " public television network .
he said merkel 's wait-and-see attitude while other european governments had set out plans to re-energize their economies was not the ideal approach for pulling europe 's largest economy out of recession .

it is a sign that the chill in relations between the alliance and the kremlin in the wake of the georgia conflict is starting to pass . the talks , labelled an " informal lunch , " will involve nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and russia 's ambassador to the alliance , dmitry rogozin , a nato official said on thursday , dec .
18 .
the meeting will be the first high-level gathering between russian and nato officials since august , when georgia and russia fought a short-lived but intense conflict over the breakaway georgian enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia .
as a result of that conflict , nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- talks were put on hold as tension was ratcheted up between the two parties over russia 's response to a georgian attempt to reassert its control over south ossetia .
although nrc technical and working-level talks were not interrupted , all meetings at the ambassadorial , ministerial and head-of-government levels have been frozen since the august war .

nato foreign ministers have tasked scheffer " to re-engage with russia at the political level " with a possible full return to formal talks once he reports back .
rogozin said he wanted all problematic issues between russia and nato to be " put on the table " so moscow could then decide whether it wanted to proceed with nrc meetings .
" i hope the secretary general will propose dates and themes for discussion and i will see with moscow if this is convenient , and then we will take a decision , " he told the afp news agency .

their goal : to share experiences at conferences and improve access to files . a symbolic spot was chosen to sign the deal : the european house at the brandenburg gate .
until the end of 1989 , the berlin wall stood just a few meters away . for marianne birthler , the head of the federal commission for the records of the state security service of the former east germany , it was the fulfillment of a long-held dream : to deal with cold war secret police issues on an international basis . systematic cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film " the lives of others " helped explain the era to a new generation there has been contact between the countries in the past , but nothing systematic .
the european network - which will include the documentation agency of the east german stasi , as well as their counterparts in bulgaria , poland , romania , slovakia , the czech republic , and hungary - is expected to change all that . " one of our projects will be to provide information about our work in all seven countries , either via the internet or in printed form , " birthler said .
" of course , we will also host conferences .
there could even be a joint exhibition .
we 'll have to see . " different histories , different methods while birthler has plenty of plans , each country 's method of dealing with the issue is quite different . for example , in the czech republic , communist crimes have been under investigation since the mid-1990s , and access to files just became possible 10 months ago , according to miroslav lehky of the state security records agency in prague .
and compared with the germans , the czechs have many more files . " -lrb- we have files -rrb- not only from stasi , but all repressive state organizations from the communist state .
that includes military intelligence , civil intelligence , border guards .
now we have everything together , and can analyze it .
and of course we want to open everything , " said lehky . " i want to publish names " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives are accessible in berlin today bulgaria is also playing catch-up .
the records-historians there had to struggle for a long time before they got their own building .
now they have one .
it is slated to contain an archive of all the former secret agencies .
the goal of records-official evtim kostanidov , too , is to open up the archive to anyone who wants it . " another important job is to publish the names of those people who worked for the secret police , both officially and unofficially , " he said . for her part , birthler hopes the european network will help spark initiatives , particularly in post-communist countries that are n't part of the current group . an example for others " i could imagine that our cooperation would give strength to people who need it .
just the fact that we exist , and that we 're visible on the european level , " she said .
slovenia and the baltic states are the countries that jump to mind , she says .
at this point , she notes , they are all members of the eu . europe is reunited and free , birthler said , but europe would n't be europe without an understanding of its diverse and contradictory past . marcel fuerstenau -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.12.2008 steinmeier grilled over germany 's role in iraq war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier insists germany did not aid the us war effort german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier faced hard questions thursday about germany 's role in the us-led " war on terror . "
the stakes are high for steinmeier , who would like to become germany 's next chancellor . in parliamentary hearings on thursday , dec .
18 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuffed accusations in connection to the mission of two agents of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
steinmeier once again justified the mission of the two bnd agents who , at the time , were based at the french embassy with diplomatic passports .
he said that the bnd and the german government wanted to be able to gather their own information and not be forced to rely on outside sources .
steinmeier told the committee that at the time it was completely clear to all parties involved in the mission that the political guidelines stood and that germany was not taking part in the war .
" there is no reason for me to believe that the wishes of the government were either knowingly or unknowingly violated , " he added .
germany criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency during the launch of war in iraq germany , traditionally a strong us ally , came out strongly against the invasion of iraq .
yet in the five years since the war in iraq started , berlin has been criticized for becoming covertly involved in the us fight against islamist extremists .
there have been accusations that germany 's intelligence services were aware of cia kidnappings and prisoner renditions .
most recently , a top retired us military officer said that the united states relied on german intelligence during its invasion of iraq in 2003 .
due to his role as chief of staff for then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency , placing him at the center of the current accusations of aiding the us .
high stakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans have vocally opposed the war this is the fifth time steinmeier has been called before a parliamentary committee to testify about issues relating to germany 's participation in the us-led " war on terror . "
and the stakes for steinmeier have never been higher .
the social democratic party has chosen steinmeier to run against current chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the cdu and spd currently share power in an awkward coalition government .
both sides would like a decisive electoral victory next fall , which would allow them to ditch their current partners and form coalitions with other parties .
steinmeier 's party has made a campaign issue out of its opposition to the war in iraq .
it could be disastrous for social democrats if it now turns out that german spies were secretly funneling information to us counterparts to aid in the us invasion of iraq .
long list of questionable involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has denied knowing about secret cia flights steinmeier was first called to testify two years ago as part of a closed-door parliamentary enquiry into the kidnapping of khaled el-masri .
the german-lebanese man says he was imprisoned by us agents in december 2003 in macedonia and tortured in afghanistan before being released five months later .
in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german .
steinmeier denied knowing anything about el-masri 's case until after he had been freed .
at the time , steinmeier admitted that " sometimes , difficult decisions were necessary . "
but he denied that anything was done illegally .
" that was true in the past , " steinmeier said at the time .
" and i can promise you that it will also be true in the future . "
since then , there have been several other high-profile cases in which german citizens have claimed they have been kidnapped or tortured as part of us anti-terrorism efforts .
steinmeier has also been questioned about germany 's involvement in so-called rendition flights , in which the cia secretly transported people to countries for interrogation where they were possibly tortured .
steinmeier will face tough questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri claims claims he was tortured the committee was never able to determine whether or not germany knew about the el-masri kidnapping or any of the other cases .
until now , the german foreign minister has not experienced any political backlash from the various cases .
but that current round of questioning could prove to be the most challenging for steinmeier as he has to clarify the role of two german spies during the iraq war .
earlier this week , retired us general james marks said in an interview with der spiegel magazine that information provided by german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- spies stationed in baghdad was extremely important , detailed and useful to the united states .
" reports on the defensive positions in and around baghdad and the location of troops and weapons were important , " marks told the magazine .
" we trusted information from germany more than from the cia . "
the agents sent approximately 130 reports to their commanders in germany and appeared to be aware their intelligence was being forwarded to the americans , according to the spiegel report .
that news has outraged other politicians .
" he did not take adequate measures ensure that important information from baghdad would not be forwarded to the us headquarters , " said hans-christian stroebele of the green party .
officials in berlin continue to maintain that germany was not involved in the fighting of the iraq war .
" what foreign minster steinmeier has been saying from the beginning stands : germany had good reason to be against the iraq war and for that reason was not involved in combat operations , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany able to completely avoid becoming involved ?
steinmeier has defended himself by saying that the bnd did not provide " active support of combat operations , " but that the bnd did work to " avoid an embassy or hospital from being bombed , which has nothing to do with double standards but with saving innocent people 's lives . "
the spd has signaled that it will stand behind steinmeier .
thomas oppermann , who is a member of the spd and chairs the parliamentary committee overseeing intelligence issues , said that the interview with general marks was " manipulated . "
marks has also been invited to testify before the committee . dw staff -lrb- th , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a sign that the chill in relations between the alliance and the kremlin in the wake of the georgia conflict is starting to pass . the talks , labelled an " informal lunch , " will involve nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and russia 's ambassador to the alliance , dmitry rogozin , a nato official said on thursday , dec .
18 .
the meeting will be the first high-level gathering between russian and nato officials since august , when georgia and russia fought a short-lived but intense conflict over the breakaway georgian enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia .
as a result of that conflict , nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- talks were put on hold as tension was ratcheted up between the two parties over russia 's response to a georgian attempt to reassert its control over south ossetia .
although nrc technical and working-level talks were not interrupted , all meetings at the ambassadorial , ministerial and head-of-government levels have been frozen since the august war .
formal talks a possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : securing russian gas and oil is integral for security in europe , leaders say a handful of european governments - notable germany and france - have been eager to recommence high-level dialog with russia owing to its position as a major supplier of natural gas and oil to europe .
nato foreign ministers have tasked scheffer " to re-engage with russia at the political level " with a possible full return to formal talks once he reports back .
rogozin said he wanted all problematic issues between russia and nato to be " put on the table " so moscow could then decide whether it wanted to proceed with nrc meetings .
" i hope the secretary general will propose dates and themes for discussion and i will see with moscow if this is convenient , and then we will take a decision , " he told the afp news agency .
" everything has to be put on the table , " he said .
" it 's up to nato to correct its errors . "
mounting tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has vehemently opposed independence for kosovo tensions between russia and nato have been on the increase over several contentious matters , including kremlin anger at alliance pledges to absorb georgia and ukraine - both ex-soviet republics - into the 26-member bloc .
moscow views this as nato meddling in its traditional sphere of influence and as an attempt to box russia in .
russia has also strongly opposed independence from serbia for kosovo , which europe and nato have backed .
nato currently has a peacekeeping force in kosovo .
adding further fuel to the fire is a planned us anti-missile shield base which will see elements installed in poland and the czech republic .
moscow views this measure as a direct threat .
nato , meanwhile , has condemned russia 's recognition of the independence of the two breakaway georgian regions and views with distrust russian president dmitry medvedev 's proposal for a new european security pact , which the alliance believes is designed to negate the efficacy of nato . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the stakes are high for steinmeier , who would like to become germany 's next chancellor . in parliamentary hearings on thursday , dec .
18 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuffed accusations in connection to the mission of two agents of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
steinmeier once again justified the mission of the two bnd agents who , at the time , were based at the french embassy with diplomatic passports .
he said that the bnd and the german government wanted to be able to gather their own information and not be forced to rely on outside sources .
steinmeier told the committee that at the time it was completely clear to all parties involved in the mission that the political guidelines stood and that germany was not taking part in the war .
" there is no reason for me to believe that the wishes of the government were either knowingly or unknowingly violated , " he added .
germany criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency during the launch of war in iraq germany , traditionally a strong us ally , came out strongly against the invasion of iraq .
yet in the five years since the war in iraq started , berlin has been criticized for becoming covertly involved in the us fight against islamist extremists .
there have been accusations that germany 's intelligence services were aware of cia kidnappings and prisoner renditions .
most recently , a top retired us military officer said that the united states relied on german intelligence during its invasion of iraq in 2003 .
due to his role as chief of staff for then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency , placing him at the center of the current accusations of aiding the us .
high stakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans have vocally opposed the war this is the fifth time steinmeier has been called before a parliamentary committee to testify about issues relating to germany 's participation in the us-led " war on terror . "
and the stakes for steinmeier have never been higher .
the social democratic party has chosen steinmeier to run against current chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the cdu and spd currently share power in an awkward coalition government .
both sides would like a decisive electoral victory next fall , which would allow them to ditch their current partners and form coalitions with other parties .
steinmeier 's party has made a campaign issue out of its opposition to the war in iraq .
it could be disastrous for social democrats if it now turns out that german spies were secretly funneling information to us counterparts to aid in the us invasion of iraq .
long list of questionable involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has denied knowing about secret cia flights steinmeier was first called to testify two years ago as part of a closed-door parliamentary enquiry into the kidnapping of khaled el-masri .
the german-lebanese man says he was imprisoned by us agents in december 2003 in macedonia and tortured in afghanistan before being released five months later .
in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german .
steinmeier denied knowing anything about el-masri 's case until after he had been freed .
at the time , steinmeier admitted that " sometimes , difficult decisions were necessary . "
but he denied that anything was done illegally .
" that was true in the past , " steinmeier said at the time .
" and i can promise you that it will also be true in the future . "
since then , there have been several other high-profile cases in which german citizens have claimed they have been kidnapped or tortured as part of us anti-terrorism efforts .
steinmeier has also been questioned about germany 's involvement in so-called rendition flights , in which the cia secretly transported people to countries for interrogation where they were possibly tortured .
steinmeier will face tough questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri claims claims he was tortured the committee was never able to determine whether or not germany knew about the el-masri kidnapping or any of the other cases .
until now , the german foreign minister has not experienced any political backlash from the various cases .
but that current round of questioning could prove to be the most challenging for steinmeier as he has to clarify the role of two german spies during the iraq war .
earlier this week , retired us general james marks said in an interview with der spiegel magazine that information provided by german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- spies stationed in baghdad was extremely important , detailed and useful to the united states .
" reports on the defensive positions in and around baghdad and the location of troops and weapons were important , " marks told the magazine .
" we trusted information from germany more than from the cia . "
the agents sent approximately 130 reports to their commanders in germany and appeared to be aware their intelligence was being forwarded to the americans , according to the spiegel report .
that news has outraged other politicians .
" he did not take adequate measures ensure that important information from baghdad would not be forwarded to the us headquarters , " said hans-christian stroebele of the green party .
officials in berlin continue to maintain that germany was not involved in the fighting of the iraq war .
" what foreign minster steinmeier has been saying from the beginning stands : germany had good reason to be against the iraq war and for that reason was not involved in combat operations , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany able to completely avoid becoming involved ?
steinmeier has defended himself by saying that the bnd did not provide " active support of combat operations , " but that the bnd did work to " avoid an embassy or hospital from being bombed , which has nothing to do with double standards but with saving innocent people 's lives . "
the spd has signaled that it will stand behind steinmeier .
thomas oppermann , who is a member of the spd and chairs the parliamentary committee overseeing intelligence issues , said that the interview with general marks was " manipulated . "
marks has also been invited to testify before the committee . dw staff -lrb- th , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then , there have been several other high-profile cases in which german citizens have claimed they have been kidnapped or tortured as part of us anti-terrorism efforts .
steinmeier has also been questioned about germany 's involvement in so-called rendition flights , in which the cia secretly transported people to countries for interrogation where they were possibly tortured .
steinmeier will face tough questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri claims claims he was tortured the committee was never able to determine whether or not germany knew about the el-masri kidnapping or any of the other cases .
until now , the german foreign minister has not experienced any political backlash from the various cases .
but that current round of questioning could prove to be the most challenging for steinmeier as he has to clarify the role of two german spies during the iraq war .
earlier this week , retired us general james marks said in an interview with der spiegel magazine that information provided by german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- spies stationed in baghdad was extremely important , detailed and useful to the united states .
" reports on the defensive positions in and around baghdad and the location of troops and weapons were important , " marks told the magazine .
" we trusted information from germany more than from the cia . "
the agents sent approximately 130 reports to their commanders in germany and appeared to be aware their intelligence was being forwarded to the americans , according to the spiegel report .
that news has outraged other politicians .
" he did not take adequate measures ensure that important information from baghdad would not be forwarded to the us headquarters , " said hans-christian stroebele of the green party .
officials in berlin continue to maintain that germany was not involved in the fighting of the iraq war .
" what foreign minster steinmeier has been saying from the beginning stands : germany had good reason to be against the iraq war and for that reason was not involved in combat operations , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany able to completely avoid becoming involved ?
steinmeier has defended himself by saying that the bnd did not provide " active support of combat operations , " but that the bnd did work to " avoid an embassy or hospital from being bombed , which has nothing to do with double standards but with saving innocent people 's lives . "
the spd has signaled that it will stand behind steinmeier .
thomas oppermann , who is a member of the spd and chairs the parliamentary committee overseeing intelligence issues , said that the interview with general marks was " manipulated . "
marks has also been invited to testify before the committee . dw staff -lrb- th , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with business slumping , europe 's largest economy is bracing itself for a tough year . with the global economic downturn gaining momentum , the closely-watched ifo business confidence index marked the end of the year by chalking up its seventh consecutive monthly fall , declining to 82.6 points . " december 's fall in the german ifo business climate index brings further evidence that , far from weathering the storm , the german economy is in the midst of it , " capital economics economist jennifer mckeown told the afp news agency . analysts had expected the index , which is drawn up by the munich-based economic institute , would fall to 84 points after it plunged more than expected in november to 85.8 points .
the index stood at 90.2 points in october . a sub-index of the ifo survey was much lower at 88.8 points , compared with 94.9 in october , while expectations for the next six months also hit a record low of 76.8 points from 77.6 points , the institute said . " the dominant feature of the december decline is the worsening of the firms ' current business situation , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn in a statement . downturn expected to affect labor market considered the most accurate measure of german business confidence , the survey of 7,000 german executives comes in the wake of the publication of a slew of major indicators and data underscoring the bleak economic outlook taking shape across europe . on tuesday , a euro-zone purchasing managers ' index -lrb- pmi -rrb- for december compiled by data and research group markit fell to 38.3 points , its lowest level in the survey 's 10-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairs at unemployment offices across germany may soon be filling up again " the downturn is affecting above all the manufacturers of export and capital goods and less , up until now , retailing and construction , " sinn added .
" the pessimistic expectations of past months are becoming reality as more and more of the firms report an unsatisfactory business situation . " ifo said in its report that the auto and chemical sectors in the world 's leading exporter have been especially hard hit by the global economic slowdown .
companies have likewise reported that they expect to shed workers , halting a steady fall in german unemployment rates .

with business slumping , europe 's largest economy is bracing itself for a tough year . with the global economic downturn gaining momentum , the closely-watched ifo business confidence index marked the end of the year by chalking up its seventh consecutive monthly fall , declining to 82.6 points . " december 's fall in the german ifo business climate index brings further evidence that , far from weathering the storm , the german economy is in the midst of it , " capital economics economist jennifer mckeown told the afp news agency . analysts had expected the index , which is drawn up by the munich-based economic institute , would fall to 84 points after it plunged more than expected in november to 85.8 points .
the index stood at 90.2 points in october . a sub-index of the ifo survey was much lower at 88.8 points , compared with 94.9 in october , while expectations for the next six months also hit a record low of 76.8 points from 77.6 points , the institute said . " the dominant feature of the december decline is the worsening of the firms ' current business situation , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn in a statement . downturn expected to affect labor market considered the most accurate measure of german business confidence , the survey of 7,000 german executives comes in the wake of the publication of a slew of major indicators and data underscoring the bleak economic outlook taking shape across europe . on tuesday , a euro-zone purchasing managers ' index -lrb- pmi -rrb- for december compiled by data and research group markit fell to 38.3 points , its lowest level in the survey 's 10-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairs at unemployment offices across germany may soon be filling up again " the downturn is affecting above all the manufacturers of export and capital goods and less , up until now , retailing and construction , " sinn added .
" the pessimistic expectations of past months are becoming reality as more and more of the firms report an unsatisfactory business situation . " ifo said in its report that the auto and chemical sectors in the world 's leading exporter have been especially hard hit by the global economic slowdown .
companies have likewise reported that they expect to shed workers , halting a steady fall in german unemployment rates . " on the whole the economic downturn has worsened and will now have an impact on the labor market , " the report said . " little light at the end of the tunnel " germany might see economic activity contract by up to 3.0 percent next year , which would mark the worst recession in its post-war history , deputy economy minister walther otremba told afp on wednesday . " with the -lrb- ifo -rrb- expectations index still at a record low , there is little light at the end of the tunnel , " mckeown said .

there could even be a joint exhibition .
we 'll have to see . " different histories , different methods while birthler has plenty of plans , each country 's method of dealing with the issue is quite different . for example , in the czech republic , communist crimes have been under investigation since the mid-1990s , and access to files just became possible 10 months ago , according to miroslav lehky of the state security records agency in prague .
and compared with the germans , the czechs have many more files . " -lrb- we have files -rrb- not only from stasi , but all repressive state organizations from the communist state .
that includes military intelligence , civil intelligence , border guards .
now we have everything together , and can analyze it .
and of course we want to open everything , " said lehky . " i want to publish names " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives are accessible in berlin today bulgaria is also playing catch-up .
the records-historians there had to struggle for a long time before they got their own building .
now they have one .
it is slated to contain an archive of all the former secret agencies .
the goal of records-official evtim kostanidov , too , is to open up the archive to anyone who wants it . " another important job is to publish the names of those people who worked for the secret police , both officially and unofficially , " he said . for her part , birthler hopes the european network will help spark initiatives , particularly in post-communist countries that are n't part of the current group . an example for others " i could imagine that our cooperation would give strength to people who need it .
just the fact that we exist , and that we 're visible on the european level , " she said .
slovenia and the baltic states are the countries that jump to mind , she says .
at this point , she notes , they are all members of the eu . europe is reunited and free , birthler said , but europe would n't be europe without an understanding of its diverse and contradictory past . marcel fuerstenau -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.12.2008 steinmeier grilled over germany 's role in iraq war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier insists germany did not aid the us war effort german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier faced hard questions thursday about germany 's role in the us-led " war on terror . "
the stakes are high for steinmeier , who would like to become germany 's next chancellor . in parliamentary hearings on thursday , dec .
18 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuffed accusations in connection to the mission of two agents of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
steinmeier once again justified the mission of the two bnd agents who , at the time , were based at the french embassy with diplomatic passports .
he said that the bnd and the german government wanted to be able to gather their own information and not be forced to rely on outside sources .
steinmeier told the committee that at the time it was completely clear to all parties involved in the mission that the political guidelines stood and that germany was not taking part in the war .
" there is no reason for me to believe that the wishes of the government were either knowingly or unknowingly violated , " he added .
germany criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency during the launch of war in iraq germany , traditionally a strong us ally , came out strongly against the invasion of iraq .
yet in the five years since the war in iraq started , berlin has been criticized for becoming covertly involved in the us fight against islamist extremists .
there have been accusations that germany 's intelligence services were aware of cia kidnappings and prisoner renditions .
most recently , a top retired us military officer said that the united states relied on german intelligence during its invasion of iraq in 2003 .
due to his role as chief of staff for then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency , placing him at the center of the current accusations of aiding the us .
high stakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans have vocally opposed the war this is the fifth time steinmeier has been called before a parliamentary committee to testify about issues relating to germany 's participation in the us-led " war on terror . "
and the stakes for steinmeier have never been higher .
the social democratic party has chosen steinmeier to run against current chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the cdu and spd currently share power in an awkward coalition government .
both sides would like a decisive electoral victory next fall , which would allow them to ditch their current partners and form coalitions with other parties .
steinmeier 's party has made a campaign issue out of its opposition to the war in iraq .
it could be disastrous for social democrats if it now turns out that german spies were secretly funneling information to us counterparts to aid in the us invasion of iraq .
long list of questionable involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has denied knowing about secret cia flights steinmeier was first called to testify two years ago as part of a closed-door parliamentary enquiry into the kidnapping of khaled el-masri .
the german-lebanese man says he was imprisoned by us agents in december 2003 in macedonia and tortured in afghanistan before being released five months later .
in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german .
steinmeier denied knowing anything about el-masri 's case until after he had been freed .
at the time , steinmeier admitted that " sometimes , difficult decisions were necessary . "
but he denied that anything was done illegally .
" that was true in the past , " steinmeier said at the time .
" and i can promise you that it will also be true in the future . "
since then , there have been several other high-profile cases in which german citizens have claimed they have been kidnapped or tortured as part of us anti-terrorism efforts .
steinmeier has also been questioned about germany 's involvement in so-called rendition flights , in which the cia secretly transported people to countries for interrogation where they were possibly tortured .
steinmeier will face tough questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri claims claims he was tortured the committee was never able to determine whether or not germany knew about the el-masri kidnapping or any of the other cases .
until now , the german foreign minister has not experienced any political backlash from the various cases .
but that current round of questioning could prove to be the most challenging for steinmeier as he has to clarify the role of two german spies during the iraq war .
earlier this week , retired us general james marks said in an interview with der spiegel magazine that information provided by german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- spies stationed in baghdad was extremely important , detailed and useful to the united states .
" reports on the defensive positions in and around baghdad and the location of troops and weapons were important , " marks told the magazine .
" we trusted information from germany more than from the cia . "
the agents sent approximately 130 reports to their commanders in germany and appeared to be aware their intelligence was being forwarded to the americans , according to the spiegel report .
that news has outraged other politicians .
" he did not take adequate measures ensure that important information from baghdad would not be forwarded to the us headquarters , " said hans-christian stroebele of the green party .
officials in berlin continue to maintain that germany was not involved in the fighting of the iraq war .
" what foreign minster steinmeier has been saying from the beginning stands : germany had good reason to be against the iraq war and for that reason was not involved in combat operations , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany able to completely avoid becoming involved ?
steinmeier has defended himself by saying that the bnd did not provide " active support of combat operations , " but that the bnd did work to " avoid an embassy or hospital from being bombed , which has nothing to do with double standards but with saving innocent people 's lives . "
the spd has signaled that it will stand behind steinmeier .
thomas oppermann , who is a member of the spd and chairs the parliamentary committee overseeing intelligence issues , said that the interview with general marks was " manipulated . "
marks has also been invited to testify before the committee . dw staff -lrb- th , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

until the end of 1989 , the berlin wall stood just a few meters away . for marianne birthler , the head of the federal commission for the records of the state security service of the former east germany , it was the fulfillment of a long-held dream : to deal with cold war secret police issues on an international basis . systematic cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film " the lives of others " helped explain the era to a new generation there has been contact between the countries in the past , but nothing systematic .
the european network - which will include the documentation agency of the east german stasi , as well as their counterparts in bulgaria , poland , romania , slovakia , the czech republic , and hungary - is expected to change all that . " one of our projects will be to provide information about our work in all seven countries , either via the internet or in printed form , " birthler said .
" of course , we will also host conferences .
there could even be a joint exhibition .
we 'll have to see . " different histories , different methods while birthler has plenty of plans , each country 's method of dealing with the issue is quite different . for example , in the czech republic , communist crimes have been under investigation since the mid-1990s , and access to files just became possible 10 months ago , according to miroslav lehky of the state security records agency in prague .
and compared with the germans , the czechs have many more files . " -lrb- we have files -rrb- not only from stasi , but all repressive state organizations from the communist state .
that includes military intelligence , civil intelligence , border guards .
now we have everything together , and can analyze it .
and of course we want to open everything , " said lehky . " i want to publish names " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives are accessible in berlin today bulgaria is also playing catch-up .
the records-historians there had to struggle for a long time before they got their own building .
now they have one .
it is slated to contain an archive of all the former secret agencies .
the goal of records-official evtim kostanidov , too , is to open up the archive to anyone who wants it . " another important job is to publish the names of those people who worked for the secret police , both officially and unofficially , " he said . for her part , birthler hopes the european network will help spark initiatives , particularly in post-communist countries that are n't part of the current group . an example for others " i could imagine that our cooperation would give strength to people who need it .
just the fact that we exist , and that we 're visible on the european level , " she said .
slovenia and the baltic states are the countries that jump to mind , she says .
at this point , she notes , they are all members of the eu . europe is reunited and free , birthler said , but europe would n't be europe without an understanding of its diverse and contradictory past . marcel fuerstenau -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a sign that the chill in relations between the alliance and the kremlin in the wake of the georgia conflict is starting to pass . the talks , labelled an " informal lunch , " will involve nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and russia 's ambassador to the alliance , dmitry rogozin , a nato official said on thursday , dec .
18 .
the meeting will be the first high-level gathering between russian and nato officials since august , when georgia and russia fought a short-lived but intense conflict over the breakaway georgian enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia .
as a result of that conflict , nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- talks were put on hold as tension was ratcheted up between the two parties over russia 's response to a georgian attempt to reassert its control over south ossetia .
although nrc technical and working-level talks were not interrupted , all meetings at the ambassadorial , ministerial and head-of-government levels have been frozen since the august war .

nato foreign ministers have tasked scheffer " to re-engage with russia at the political level " with a possible full return to formal talks once he reports back .
rogozin said he wanted all problematic issues between russia and nato to be " put on the table " so moscow could then decide whether it wanted to proceed with nrc meetings .
" i hope the secretary general will propose dates and themes for discussion and i will see with moscow if this is convenient , and then we will take a decision , " he told the afp news agency .
" everything has to be put on the table , " he said .
" it 's up to nato to correct its errors . "

moscow views this as nato meddling in its traditional sphere of influence and as an attempt to box russia in .
russia has also strongly opposed independence from serbia for kosovo , which europe and nato have backed .
nato currently has a peacekeeping force in kosovo .
adding further fuel to the fire is a planned us anti-missile shield base which will see elements installed in poland and the czech republic .
moscow views this measure as a direct threat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.12.2008 steinmeier grilled over germany 's role in iraq war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier insists germany did not aid the us war effort german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier faced hard questions thursday about germany 's role in the us-led " war on terror . "
the stakes are high for steinmeier , who would like to become germany 's next chancellor . in parliamentary hearings on thursday , dec .
18 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuffed accusations in connection to the mission of two agents of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
steinmeier once again justified the mission of the two bnd agents who , at the time , were based at the french embassy with diplomatic passports .
he said that the bnd and the german government wanted to be able to gather their own information and not be forced to rely on outside sources .
steinmeier told the committee that at the time it was completely clear to all parties involved in the mission that the political guidelines stood and that germany was not taking part in the war .
" there is no reason for me to believe that the wishes of the government were either knowingly or unknowingly violated , " he added .
germany criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency during the launch of war in iraq germany , traditionally a strong us ally , came out strongly against the invasion of iraq .
yet in the five years since the war in iraq started , berlin has been criticized for becoming covertly involved in the us fight against islamist extremists .
there have been accusations that germany 's intelligence services were aware of cia kidnappings and prisoner renditions .
most recently , a top retired us military officer said that the united states relied on german intelligence during its invasion of iraq in 2003 .
due to his role as chief of staff for then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency , placing him at the center of the current accusations of aiding the us .
high stakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans have vocally opposed the war this is the fifth time steinmeier has been called before a parliamentary committee to testify about issues relating to germany 's participation in the us-led " war on terror . "
and the stakes for steinmeier have never been higher .
the social democratic party has chosen steinmeier to run against current chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the cdu and spd currently share power in an awkward coalition government .
both sides would like a decisive electoral victory next fall , which would allow them to ditch their current partners and form coalitions with other parties .
steinmeier 's party has made a campaign issue out of its opposition to the war in iraq .
it could be disastrous for social democrats if it now turns out that german spies were secretly funneling information to us counterparts to aid in the us invasion of iraq .
long list of questionable involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has denied knowing about secret cia flights steinmeier was first called to testify two years ago as part of a closed-door parliamentary enquiry into the kidnapping of khaled el-masri .
the german-lebanese man says he was imprisoned by us agents in december 2003 in macedonia and tortured in afghanistan before being released five months later .
in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german .
steinmeier denied knowing anything about el-masri 's case until after he had been freed .
at the time , steinmeier admitted that " sometimes , difficult decisions were necessary . "
but he denied that anything was done illegally .
" that was true in the past , " steinmeier said at the time .
" and i can promise you that it will also be true in the future . "
since then , there have been several other high-profile cases in which german citizens have claimed they have been kidnapped or tortured as part of us anti-terrorism efforts .
steinmeier has also been questioned about germany 's involvement in so-called rendition flights , in which the cia secretly transported people to countries for interrogation where they were possibly tortured .
steinmeier will face tough questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri claims claims he was tortured the committee was never able to determine whether or not germany knew about the el-masri kidnapping or any of the other cases .
until now , the german foreign minister has not experienced any political backlash from the various cases .
but that current round of questioning could prove to be the most challenging for steinmeier as he has to clarify the role of two german spies during the iraq war .
earlier this week , retired us general james marks said in an interview with der spiegel magazine that information provided by german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- spies stationed in baghdad was extremely important , detailed and useful to the united states .
" reports on the defensive positions in and around baghdad and the location of troops and weapons were important , " marks told the magazine .
" we trusted information from germany more than from the cia . "
the agents sent approximately 130 reports to their commanders in germany and appeared to be aware their intelligence was being forwarded to the americans , according to the spiegel report .
that news has outraged other politicians .
" he did not take adequate measures ensure that important information from baghdad would not be forwarded to the us headquarters , " said hans-christian stroebele of the green party .
officials in berlin continue to maintain that germany was not involved in the fighting of the iraq war .
" what foreign minster steinmeier has been saying from the beginning stands : germany had good reason to be against the iraq war and for that reason was not involved in combat operations , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany able to completely avoid becoming involved ?
steinmeier has defended himself by saying that the bnd did not provide " active support of combat operations , " but that the bnd did work to " avoid an embassy or hospital from being bombed , which has nothing to do with double standards but with saving innocent people 's lives . "
the spd has signaled that it will stand behind steinmeier .
thomas oppermann , who is a member of the spd and chairs the parliamentary committee overseeing intelligence issues , said that the interview with general marks was " manipulated . "
marks has also been invited to testify before the committee . dw staff -lrb- th , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.12.2008 steinmeier grilled over germany 's role in iraq war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier insists germany did not aid the us war effort german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier faced hard questions thursday about germany 's role in the us-led " war on terror . "
the stakes are high for steinmeier , who would like to become germany 's next chancellor . in parliamentary hearings on thursday , dec .
18 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuffed accusations in connection to the mission of two agents of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
steinmeier once again justified the mission of the two bnd agents who , at the time , were based at the french embassy with diplomatic passports .
he said that the bnd and the german government wanted to be able to gather their own information and not be forced to rely on outside sources .
steinmeier told the committee that at the time it was completely clear to all parties involved in the mission that the political guidelines stood and that germany was not taking part in the war .
" there is no reason for me to believe that the wishes of the government were either knowingly or unknowingly violated , " he added .
germany criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency during the launch of war in iraq germany , traditionally a strong us ally , came out strongly against the invasion of iraq .
yet in the five years since the war in iraq started , berlin has been criticized for becoming covertly involved in the us fight against islamist extremists .
there have been accusations that germany 's intelligence services were aware of cia kidnappings and prisoner renditions .
most recently , a top retired us military officer said that the united states relied on german intelligence during its invasion of iraq in 2003 .
due to his role as chief of staff for then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency , placing him at the center of the current accusations of aiding the us .
high stakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans have vocally opposed the war this is the fifth time steinmeier has been called before a parliamentary committee to testify about issues relating to germany 's participation in the us-led " war on terror . "
and the stakes for steinmeier have never been higher .
the social democratic party has chosen steinmeier to run against current chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the cdu and spd currently share power in an awkward coalition government .
both sides would like a decisive electoral victory next fall , which would allow them to ditch their current partners and form coalitions with other parties .
steinmeier 's party has made a campaign issue out of its opposition to the war in iraq .
it could be disastrous for social democrats if it now turns out that german spies were secretly funneling information to us counterparts to aid in the us invasion of iraq .
long list of questionable involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has denied knowing about secret cia flights steinmeier was first called to testify two years ago as part of a closed-door parliamentary enquiry into the kidnapping of khaled el-masri .
the german-lebanese man says he was imprisoned by us agents in december 2003 in macedonia and tortured in afghanistan before being released five months later .
in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german .
steinmeier denied knowing anything about el-masri 's case until after he had been freed .
at the time , steinmeier admitted that " sometimes , difficult decisions were necessary . "
but he denied that anything was done illegally .
" that was true in the past , " steinmeier said at the time .
" and i can promise you that it will also be true in the future . "
since then , there have been several other high-profile cases in which german citizens have claimed they have been kidnapped or tortured as part of us anti-terrorism efforts .
steinmeier has also been questioned about germany 's involvement in so-called rendition flights , in which the cia secretly transported people to countries for interrogation where they were possibly tortured .
steinmeier will face tough questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri claims claims he was tortured the committee was never able to determine whether or not germany knew about the el-masri kidnapping or any of the other cases .
until now , the german foreign minister has not experienced any political backlash from the various cases .
but that current round of questioning could prove to be the most challenging for steinmeier as he has to clarify the role of two german spies during the iraq war .
earlier this week , retired us general james marks said in an interview with der spiegel magazine that information provided by german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- spies stationed in baghdad was extremely important , detailed and useful to the united states .
" reports on the defensive positions in and around baghdad and the location of troops and weapons were important , " marks told the magazine .
" we trusted information from germany more than from the cia . "
the agents sent approximately 130 reports to their commanders in germany and appeared to be aware their intelligence was being forwarded to the americans , according to the spiegel report .
that news has outraged other politicians .
" he did not take adequate measures ensure that important information from baghdad would not be forwarded to the us headquarters , " said hans-christian stroebele of the green party .
officials in berlin continue to maintain that germany was not involved in the fighting of the iraq war .
" what foreign minster steinmeier has been saying from the beginning stands : germany had good reason to be against the iraq war and for that reason was not involved in combat operations , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany able to completely avoid becoming involved ?
steinmeier has defended himself by saying that the bnd did not provide " active support of combat operations , " but that the bnd did work to " avoid an embassy or hospital from being bombed , which has nothing to do with double standards but with saving innocent people 's lives . "
the spd has signaled that it will stand behind steinmeier .
thomas oppermann , who is a member of the spd and chairs the parliamentary committee overseeing intelligence issues , said that the interview with general marks was " manipulated . "
marks has also been invited to testify before the committee . dw staff -lrb- th , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 . the imf chief urged chancellor angela merkel 's government to parallel mitigating steps taken by other eu nations to curb the global economic downturn .
he said berlin should put still more money on the table in addition to the existing stimulus package it has announced .
" it would be helpful if the german government , whose reluctance i fully understand , were able to take another step " and introduce further measures to aid the economy , the head of the washington-based imf told germany 's " zdf " public television network .
he said merkel 's wait-and-see attitude while other european governments had set out plans to re-energize their economies was not the ideal approach for pulling europe 's largest economy out of recession .
such measures " make all the more sense when they are taken by all sides at the same time , " strauss-kahn said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel remains cautious over implementing further stimulus packages too soon he added that european economies would likely experience negative growth of 1 to 2 percent in 2009 , and that " the economic consequences will be truly hard for the little guy . "
merkel wary of budget deficit so far , merkel 's grand coalition government has announced a series of measures totaling up to 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion -rrb- to help spur economic growth .
but she has also faced calls from within the ranks of her own political bloc for the government to underpin the economy by cutting taxes .
instead , however , merkel and her government have refused to take action they consider rash to help germany limp through the current global crisis , especially measures that could lead to a deepening of the nation 's budget deficit .
new year 's resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will wait to see what the us does under barack obama , merkel hinted criticism of merkel 's so-far-modest attempts to shield germany from the global downturn has triggered a slump in her popularity , prompting the chancellor to tell business leaders tuesday , dec .
16 , they could expect a firmer response from the government early next year .
in the speech to the center for european economic research , a think-tank in mannheim , germany , she acknowledged the government 's stimulus package " might not suffice , " but hinted that she wanted to coordinate future efforts with the incoming us administration under barack obama , who takes office january 20 .
" we will take action again in january - another few billion could come together , " she told them amid press reports suggesting berlin would invest up to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- more to drag the economy out of its slump . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case has renewed calls in germany for banning a far-right political party . investigators arrested a man and a woman on wednesday , dec .
18 , in the near-fatal weekend stabbing of passau police chief alois mannichl .
a 33-year-old man and his wife , aged 22 , were taken in for questioning on tuesday after police traced the stabber 's getaway car to them . lead investigator alois walch told the associated press on thursday that the pair has been ordered by a court to be held on suspicion of accessory to attempted murder in the weekend stabbing of mannichl .
investigators , however , are continuing to look for the perpetrator . though investigators did not say what exact role the suspects had played in the attack , witnesses report having seen the couple from munich in the vicinity of the police official 's house before the incident . targeting law enforcement mannichl was believed to have been targeted by far-right extremists because of his outspoken opposition to skinhead groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the stabbing , the police chief 's house became a crime scene he was stabbed in the chest at his home with his own knife , which had been left outside the door of the mannichl home to allow neighborhood children to cut slices of cake for themselves .
he is in stable condition and recovering from the attack . the assailant , whose head was shaved clean , is reported to have said at the time of the stabbing : " greetings from the national resistance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.12.2008 steinmeier grilled over germany 's role in iraq war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier insists germany did not aid the us war effort german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier faced hard questions thursday about germany 's role in the us-led " war on terror . "
the stakes are high for steinmeier , who would like to become germany 's next chancellor . in parliamentary hearings on thursday , dec .
18 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuffed accusations in connection to the mission of two agents of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
steinmeier once again justified the mission of the two bnd agents who , at the time , were based at the french embassy with diplomatic passports .
he said that the bnd and the german government wanted to be able to gather their own information and not be forced to rely on outside sources .
steinmeier told the committee that at the time it was completely clear to all parties involved in the mission that the political guidelines stood and that germany was not taking part in the war .
" there is no reason for me to believe that the wishes of the government were either knowingly or unknowingly violated , " he added .
germany criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency during the launch of war in iraq germany , traditionally a strong us ally , came out strongly against the invasion of iraq .
yet in the five years since the war in iraq started , berlin has been criticized for becoming covertly involved in the us fight against islamist extremists .
there have been accusations that germany 's intelligence services were aware of cia kidnappings and prisoner renditions .
most recently , a top retired us military officer said that the united states relied on german intelligence during its invasion of iraq in 2003 .
due to his role as chief of staff for then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency , placing him at the center of the current accusations of aiding the us .
high stakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans have vocally opposed the war this is the fifth time steinmeier has been called before a parliamentary committee to testify about issues relating to germany 's participation in the us-led " war on terror . "
and the stakes for steinmeier have never been higher .
the social democratic party has chosen steinmeier to run against current chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the cdu and spd currently share power in an awkward coalition government .
both sides would like a decisive electoral victory next fall , which would allow them to ditch their current partners and form coalitions with other parties .
steinmeier 's party has made a campaign issue out of its opposition to the war in iraq .
it could be disastrous for social democrats if it now turns out that german spies were secretly funneling information to us counterparts to aid in the us invasion of iraq .
long list of questionable involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has denied knowing about secret cia flights steinmeier was first called to testify two years ago as part of a closed-door parliamentary enquiry into the kidnapping of khaled el-masri .
the german-lebanese man says he was imprisoned by us agents in december 2003 in macedonia and tortured in afghanistan before being released five months later .
in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german .
steinmeier denied knowing anything about el-masri 's case until after he had been freed .
at the time , steinmeier admitted that " sometimes , difficult decisions were necessary . "
but he denied that anything was done illegally .
" that was true in the past , " steinmeier said at the time .
" and i can promise you that it will also be true in the future . "
since then , there have been several other high-profile cases in which german citizens have claimed they have been kidnapped or tortured as part of us anti-terrorism efforts .
steinmeier has also been questioned about germany 's involvement in so-called rendition flights , in which the cia secretly transported people to countries for interrogation where they were possibly tortured .
steinmeier will face tough questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri claims claims he was tortured the committee was never able to determine whether or not germany knew about the el-masri kidnapping or any of the other cases .
until now , the german foreign minister has not experienced any political backlash from the various cases .
but that current round of questioning could prove to be the most challenging for steinmeier as he has to clarify the role of two german spies during the iraq war .
earlier this week , retired us general james marks said in an interview with der spiegel magazine that information provided by german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- spies stationed in baghdad was extremely important , detailed and useful to the united states .
" reports on the defensive positions in and around baghdad and the location of troops and weapons were important , " marks told the magazine .
" we trusted information from germany more than from the cia . "
the agents sent approximately 130 reports to their commanders in germany and appeared to be aware their intelligence was being forwarded to the americans , according to the spiegel report .
that news has outraged other politicians .
" he did not take adequate measures ensure that important information from baghdad would not be forwarded to the us headquarters , " said hans-christian stroebele of the green party .
officials in berlin continue to maintain that germany was not involved in the fighting of the iraq war .
" what foreign minster steinmeier has been saying from the beginning stands : germany had good reason to be against the iraq war and for that reason was not involved in combat operations , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany able to completely avoid becoming involved ?
steinmeier has defended himself by saying that the bnd did not provide " active support of combat operations , " but that the bnd did work to " avoid an embassy or hospital from being bombed , which has nothing to do with double standards but with saving innocent people 's lives . "
the spd has signaled that it will stand behind steinmeier .
thomas oppermann , who is a member of the spd and chairs the parliamentary committee overseeing intelligence issues , said that the interview with general marks was " manipulated . "
marks has also been invited to testify before the committee . dw staff -lrb- th , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the stakes are high for steinmeier , who would like to become germany 's next chancellor . in parliamentary hearings on thursday , dec .
18 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuffed accusations in connection to the mission of two agents of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
steinmeier once again justified the mission of the two bnd agents who , at the time , were based at the french embassy with diplomatic passports .
he said that the bnd and the german government wanted to be able to gather their own information and not be forced to rely on outside sources .
steinmeier told the committee that at the time it was completely clear to all parties involved in the mission that the political guidelines stood and that germany was not taking part in the war .
" there is no reason for me to believe that the wishes of the government were either knowingly or unknowingly violated , " he added .
germany criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency during the launch of war in iraq germany , traditionally a strong us ally , came out strongly against the invasion of iraq .
yet in the five years since the war in iraq started , berlin has been criticized for becoming covertly involved in the us fight against islamist extremists .
there have been accusations that germany 's intelligence services were aware of cia kidnappings and prisoner renditions .
most recently , a top retired us military officer said that the united states relied on german intelligence during its invasion of iraq in 2003 .
due to his role as chief of staff for then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency , placing him at the center of the current accusations of aiding the us .
high stakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans have vocally opposed the war this is the fifth time steinmeier has been called before a parliamentary committee to testify about issues relating to germany 's participation in the us-led " war on terror . "
and the stakes for steinmeier have never been higher .
the social democratic party has chosen steinmeier to run against current chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the cdu and spd currently share power in an awkward coalition government .
both sides would like a decisive electoral victory next fall , which would allow them to ditch their current partners and form coalitions with other parties .
steinmeier 's party has made a campaign issue out of its opposition to the war in iraq .
it could be disastrous for social democrats if it now turns out that german spies were secretly funneling information to us counterparts to aid in the us invasion of iraq .
long list of questionable involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has denied knowing about secret cia flights steinmeier was first called to testify two years ago as part of a closed-door parliamentary enquiry into the kidnapping of khaled el-masri .
the german-lebanese man says he was imprisoned by us agents in december 2003 in macedonia and tortured in afghanistan before being released five months later .
in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german .
steinmeier denied knowing anything about el-masri 's case until after he had been freed .
at the time , steinmeier admitted that " sometimes , difficult decisions were necessary . "
but he denied that anything was done illegally .
" that was true in the past , " steinmeier said at the time .
" and i can promise you that it will also be true in the future . "
since then , there have been several other high-profile cases in which german citizens have claimed they have been kidnapped or tortured as part of us anti-terrorism efforts .
steinmeier has also been questioned about germany 's involvement in so-called rendition flights , in which the cia secretly transported people to countries for interrogation where they were possibly tortured .
steinmeier will face tough questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri claims claims he was tortured the committee was never able to determine whether or not germany knew about the el-masri kidnapping or any of the other cases .
until now , the german foreign minister has not experienced any political backlash from the various cases .
but that current round of questioning could prove to be the most challenging for steinmeier as he has to clarify the role of two german spies during the iraq war .
earlier this week , retired us general james marks said in an interview with der spiegel magazine that information provided by german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- spies stationed in baghdad was extremely important , detailed and useful to the united states .
" reports on the defensive positions in and around baghdad and the location of troops and weapons were important , " marks told the magazine .
" we trusted information from germany more than from the cia . "
the agents sent approximately 130 reports to their commanders in germany and appeared to be aware their intelligence was being forwarded to the americans , according to the spiegel report .
that news has outraged other politicians .
" he did not take adequate measures ensure that important information from baghdad would not be forwarded to the us headquarters , " said hans-christian stroebele of the green party .
officials in berlin continue to maintain that germany was not involved in the fighting of the iraq war .
" what foreign minster steinmeier has been saying from the beginning stands : germany had good reason to be against the iraq war and for that reason was not involved in combat operations , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany able to completely avoid becoming involved ?
steinmeier has defended himself by saying that the bnd did not provide " active support of combat operations , " but that the bnd did work to " avoid an embassy or hospital from being bombed , which has nothing to do with double standards but with saving innocent people 's lives . "
the spd has signaled that it will stand behind steinmeier .
thomas oppermann , who is a member of the spd and chairs the parliamentary committee overseeing intelligence issues , said that the interview with general marks was " manipulated . "
marks has also been invited to testify before the committee . dw staff -lrb- th , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the time , steinmeier admitted that " sometimes , difficult decisions were necessary . "
but he denied that anything was done illegally .
" that was true in the past , " steinmeier said at the time .
" and i can promise you that it will also be true in the future . "
since then , there have been several other high-profile cases in which german citizens have claimed they have been kidnapped or tortured as part of us anti-terrorism efforts .
steinmeier has also been questioned about germany 's involvement in so-called rendition flights , in which the cia secretly transported people to countries for interrogation where they were possibly tortured .
steinmeier will face tough questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri claims claims he was tortured the committee was never able to determine whether or not germany knew about the el-masri kidnapping or any of the other cases .
until now , the german foreign minister has not experienced any political backlash from the various cases .
but that current round of questioning could prove to be the most challenging for steinmeier as he has to clarify the role of two german spies during the iraq war .
earlier this week , retired us general james marks said in an interview with der spiegel magazine that information provided by german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- spies stationed in baghdad was extremely important , detailed and useful to the united states .
" reports on the defensive positions in and around baghdad and the location of troops and weapons were important , " marks told the magazine .
" we trusted information from germany more than from the cia . "
the agents sent approximately 130 reports to their commanders in germany and appeared to be aware their intelligence was being forwarded to the americans , according to the spiegel report .
that news has outraged other politicians .
" he did not take adequate measures ensure that important information from baghdad would not be forwarded to the us headquarters , " said hans-christian stroebele of the green party .
officials in berlin continue to maintain that germany was not involved in the fighting of the iraq war .
" what foreign minster steinmeier has been saying from the beginning stands : germany had good reason to be against the iraq war and for that reason was not involved in combat operations , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany able to completely avoid becoming involved ?
steinmeier has defended himself by saying that the bnd did not provide " active support of combat operations , " but that the bnd did work to " avoid an embassy or hospital from being bombed , which has nothing to do with double standards but with saving innocent people 's lives . "
the spd has signaled that it will stand behind steinmeier .

"
the stakes are high for steinmeier , who would like to become germany 's next chancellor . in parliamentary hearings on thursday , dec .
18 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuffed accusations in connection to the mission of two agents of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
steinmeier once again justified the mission of the two bnd agents who , at the time , were based at the french embassy with diplomatic passports .
he said that the bnd and the german government wanted to be able to gather their own information and not be forced to rely on outside sources .
steinmeier told the committee that at the time it was completely clear to all parties involved in the mission that the political guidelines stood and that germany was not taking part in the war .
" there is no reason for me to believe that the wishes of the government were either knowingly or unknowingly violated , " he added .
germany criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency during the launch of war in iraq germany , traditionally a strong us ally , came out strongly against the invasion of iraq .
yet in the five years since the war in iraq started , berlin has been criticized for becoming covertly involved in the us fight against islamist extremists .
there have been accusations that germany 's intelligence services were aware of cia kidnappings and prisoner renditions .
most recently , a top retired us military officer said that the united states relied on german intelligence during its invasion of iraq in 2003 .
due to his role as chief of staff for then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency , placing him at the center of the current accusations of aiding the us .
high stakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans have vocally opposed the war this is the fifth time steinmeier has been called before a parliamentary committee to testify about issues relating to germany 's participation in the us-led " war on terror . "
and the stakes for steinmeier have never been higher .
the social democratic party has chosen steinmeier to run against current chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the cdu and spd currently share power in an awkward coalition government .
both sides would like a decisive electoral victory next fall , which would allow them to ditch their current partners and form coalitions with other parties .
steinmeier 's party has made a campaign issue out of its opposition to the war in iraq .
it could be disastrous for social democrats if it now turns out that german spies were secretly funneling information to us counterparts to aid in the us invasion of iraq .
long list of questionable involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has denied knowing about secret cia flights steinmeier was first called to testify two years ago as part of a closed-door parliamentary enquiry into the kidnapping of khaled el-masri .
the german-lebanese man says he was imprisoned by us agents in december 2003 in macedonia and tortured in afghanistan before being released five months later .
in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german .
steinmeier denied knowing anything about el-masri 's case until after he had been freed .
at the time , steinmeier admitted that " sometimes , difficult decisions were necessary . "

with business slumping , europe 's largest economy is bracing itself for a tough year . with the global economic downturn gaining momentum , the closely-watched ifo business confidence index marked the end of the year by chalking up its seventh consecutive monthly fall , declining to 82.6 points . " december 's fall in the german ifo business climate index brings further evidence that , far from weathering the storm , the german economy is in the midst of it , " capital economics economist jennifer mckeown told the afp news agency . analysts had expected the index , which is drawn up by the munich-based economic institute , would fall to 84 points after it plunged more than expected in november to 85.8 points .
the index stood at 90.2 points in october . a sub-index of the ifo survey was much lower at 88.8 points , compared with 94.9 in october , while expectations for the next six months also hit a record low of 76.8 points from 77.6 points , the institute said . " the dominant feature of the december decline is the worsening of the firms ' current business situation , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn in a statement . downturn expected to affect labor market considered the most accurate measure of german business confidence , the survey of 7,000 german executives comes in the wake of the publication of a slew of major indicators and data underscoring the bleak economic outlook taking shape across europe . on tuesday , a euro-zone purchasing managers ' index -lrb- pmi -rrb- for december compiled by data and research group markit fell to 38.3 points , its lowest level in the survey 's 10-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairs at unemployment offices across germany may soon be filling up again " the downturn is affecting above all the manufacturers of export and capital goods and less , up until now , retailing and construction , " sinn added .
" the pessimistic expectations of past months are becoming reality as more and more of the firms report an unsatisfactory business situation . " ifo said in its report that the auto and chemical sectors in the world 's leading exporter have been especially hard hit by the global economic slowdown .
companies have likewise reported that they expect to shed workers , halting a steady fall in german unemployment rates . " on the whole the economic downturn has worsened and will now have an impact on the labor market , " the report said . " little light at the end of the tunnel " germany might see economic activity contract by up to 3.0 percent next year , which would mark the worst recession in its post-war history , deputy economy minister walther otremba told afp on wednesday . " with the -lrb- ifo -rrb- expectations index still at a record low , there is little light at the end of the tunnel , " mckeown said .
" in all , it still looks likely that german gdp will fall by at least 1.0 percent next year and the latest forecast from the ifo institute itself of a fall of about 2.0 percent might not be too far off the mark .

with business slumping , europe 's largest economy is bracing itself for a tough year . with the global economic downturn gaining momentum , the closely-watched ifo business confidence index marked the end of the year by chalking up its seventh consecutive monthly fall , declining to 82.6 points . " december 's fall in the german ifo business climate index brings further evidence that , far from weathering the storm , the german economy is in the midst of it , " capital economics economist jennifer mckeown told the afp news agency . analysts had expected the index , which is drawn up by the munich-based economic institute , would fall to 84 points after it plunged more than expected in november to 85.8 points .
the index stood at 90.2 points in october . a sub-index of the ifo survey was much lower at 88.8 points , compared with 94.9 in october , while expectations for the next six months also hit a record low of 76.8 points from 77.6 points , the institute said . " the dominant feature of the december decline is the worsening of the firms ' current business situation , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn in a statement . downturn expected to affect labor market considered the most accurate measure of german business confidence , the survey of 7,000 german executives comes in the wake of the publication of a slew of major indicators and data underscoring the bleak economic outlook taking shape across europe . on tuesday , a euro-zone purchasing managers ' index -lrb- pmi -rrb- for december compiled by data and research group markit fell to 38.3 points , its lowest level in the survey 's 10-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairs at unemployment offices across germany may soon be filling up again " the downturn is affecting above all the manufacturers of export and capital goods and less , up until now , retailing and construction , " sinn added .
" the pessimistic expectations of past months are becoming reality as more and more of the firms report an unsatisfactory business situation . " ifo said in its report that the auto and chemical sectors in the world 's leading exporter have been especially hard hit by the global economic slowdown .
companies have likewise reported that they expect to shed workers , halting a steady fall in german unemployment rates . " on the whole the economic downturn has worsened and will now have an impact on the labor market , " the report said . " little light at the end of the tunnel " germany might see economic activity contract by up to 3.0 percent next year , which would mark the worst recession in its post-war history , deputy economy minister walther otremba told afp on wednesday . " with the -lrb- ifo -rrb- expectations index still at a record low , there is little light at the end of the tunnel , " mckeown said .
" in all , it still looks likely that german gdp will fall by at least 1.0 percent next year and the latest forecast from the ifo institute itself of a fall of about 2.0 percent might not be too far off the mark .

18 . the imf chief urged chancellor angela merkel 's government to parallel mitigating steps taken by other eu nations to curb the global economic downturn .
he said berlin should put still more money on the table in addition to the existing stimulus package it has announced .
" it would be helpful if the german government , whose reluctance i fully understand , were able to take another step " and introduce further measures to aid the economy , the head of the washington-based imf told germany 's " zdf " public television network .
he said merkel 's wait-and-see attitude while other european governments had set out plans to re-energize their economies was not the ideal approach for pulling europe 's largest economy out of recession .
such measures " make all the more sense when they are taken by all sides at the same time , " strauss-kahn said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel remains cautious over implementing further stimulus packages too soon he added that european economies would likely experience negative growth of 1 to 2 percent in 2009 , and that " the economic consequences will be truly hard for the little guy . "
merkel wary of budget deficit so far , merkel 's grand coalition government has announced a series of measures totaling up to 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion -rrb- to help spur economic growth .
but she has also faced calls from within the ranks of her own political bloc for the government to underpin the economy by cutting taxes .
instead , however , merkel and her government have refused to take action they consider rash to help germany limp through the current global crisis , especially measures that could lead to a deepening of the nation 's budget deficit .
new year 's resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will wait to see what the us does under barack obama , merkel hinted criticism of merkel 's so-far-modest attempts to shield germany from the global downturn has triggered a slump in her popularity , prompting the chancellor to tell business leaders tuesday , dec .
16 , they could expect a firmer response from the government early next year .
in the speech to the center for european economic research , a think-tank in mannheim , germany , she acknowledged the government 's stimulus package " might not suffice , " but hinted that she wanted to coordinate future efforts with the incoming us administration under barack obama , who takes office january 20 .
" we will take action again in january - another few billion could come together , " she told them amid press reports suggesting berlin would invest up to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- more to drag the economy out of its slump . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a sign that the chill in relations between the alliance and the kremlin in the wake of the georgia conflict is starting to pass . the talks , labelled an " informal lunch , " will involve nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and russia 's ambassador to the alliance , dmitry rogozin , a nato official said on thursday , dec .
18 .
the meeting will be the first high-level gathering between russian and nato officials since august , when georgia and russia fought a short-lived but intense conflict over the breakaway georgian enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia .
as a result of that conflict , nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- talks were put on hold as tension was ratcheted up between the two parties over russia 's response to a georgian attempt to reassert its control over south ossetia .
although nrc technical and working-level talks were not interrupted , all meetings at the ambassadorial , ministerial and head-of-government levels have been frozen since the august war .
formal talks a possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : securing russian gas and oil is integral for security in europe , leaders say a handful of european governments - notable germany and france - have been eager to recommence high-level dialog with russia owing to its position as a major supplier of natural gas and oil to europe .
nato foreign ministers have tasked scheffer " to re-engage with russia at the political level " with a possible full return to formal talks once he reports back .
rogozin said he wanted all problematic issues between russia and nato to be " put on the table " so moscow could then decide whether it wanted to proceed with nrc meetings .
" i hope the secretary general will propose dates and themes for discussion and i will see with moscow if this is convenient , and then we will take a decision , " he told the afp news agency .
" everything has to be put on the table , " he said .
" it 's up to nato to correct its errors . "

moscow views this as nato meddling in its traditional sphere of influence and as an attempt to box russia in .
russia has also strongly opposed independence from serbia for kosovo , which europe and nato have backed .
nato currently has a peacekeeping force in kosovo .

it is a sign that the chill in relations between the alliance and the kremlin in the wake of the georgia conflict is starting to pass . the talks , labelled an " informal lunch , " will involve nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and russia 's ambassador to the alliance , dmitry rogozin , a nato official said on thursday , dec .
18 .
the meeting will be the first high-level gathering between russian and nato officials since august , when georgia and russia fought a short-lived but intense conflict over the breakaway georgian enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia .
as a result of that conflict , nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- talks were put on hold as tension was ratcheted up between the two parties over russia 's response to a georgian attempt to reassert its control over south ossetia .
although nrc technical and working-level talks were not interrupted , all meetings at the ambassadorial , ministerial and head-of-government levels have been frozen since the august war .
formal talks a possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : securing russian gas and oil is integral for security in europe , leaders say a handful of european governments - notable germany and france - have been eager to recommence high-level dialog with russia owing to its position as a major supplier of natural gas and oil to europe .
nato foreign ministers have tasked scheffer " to re-engage with russia at the political level " with a possible full return to formal talks once he reports back .
rogozin said he wanted all problematic issues between russia and nato to be " put on the table " so moscow could then decide whether it wanted to proceed with nrc meetings .
" i hope the secretary general will propose dates and themes for discussion and i will see with moscow if this is convenient , and then we will take a decision , " he told the afp news agency .
" everything has to be put on the table , " he said .
" it 's up to nato to correct its errors . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the highs and lows of reunification learning about communist east germany sheds light on the present head of stasi archive says countless files have yet to be read iconic berlin soccer club cancels sponsorship deal over stasi row few east germans interested in revisiting stasi atrocities history -pipe- 18.12.2008 former east bloc countries sign accord on stasi files großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group wants international cooperation on the files germany and six former east bloc countries have started a network for coming to terms with the crimes of the communist secret police .
their goal : to share experiences at conferences and improve access to files . a symbolic spot was chosen to sign the deal : the european house at the brandenburg gate .
until the end of 1989 , the berlin wall stood just a few meters away . for marianne birthler , the head of the federal commission for the records of the state security service of the former east germany , it was the fulfillment of a long-held dream : to deal with cold war secret police issues on an international basis . systematic cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film " the lives of others " helped explain the era to a new generation there has been contact between the countries in the past , but nothing systematic .
the european network - which will include the documentation agency of the east german stasi , as well as their counterparts in bulgaria , poland , romania , slovakia , the czech republic , and hungary - is expected to change all that . " one of our projects will be to provide information about our work in all seven countries , either via the internet or in printed form , " birthler said .
" of course , we will also host conferences .
there could even be a joint exhibition .
we 'll have to see . " different histories , different methods while birthler has plenty of plans , each country 's method of dealing with the issue is quite different . for example , in the czech republic , communist crimes have been under investigation since the mid-1990s , and access to files just became possible 10 months ago , according to miroslav lehky of the state security records agency in prague .
and compared with the germans , the czechs have many more files . " -lrb- we have files -rrb- not only from stasi , but all repressive state organizations from the communist state .
that includes military intelligence , civil intelligence , border guards .
now we have everything together , and can analyze it .
and of course we want to open everything , " said lehky . " i want to publish names " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives are accessible in berlin today bulgaria is also playing catch-up .
the records-historians there had to struggle for a long time before they got their own building .
now they have one .
it is slated to contain an archive of all the former secret agencies .
the goal of records-official evtim kostanidov , too , is to open up the archive to anyone who wants it . " another important job is to publish the names of those people who worked for the secret police , both officially and unofficially , " he said . for her part , birthler hopes the european network will help spark initiatives , particularly in post-communist countries that are n't part of the current group . an example for others " i could imagine that our cooperation would give strength to people who need it .
just the fact that we exist , and that we 're visible on the european level , " she said .
slovenia and the baltic states are the countries that jump to mind , she says .
at this point , she notes , they are all members of the eu . europe is reunited and free , birthler said , but europe would n't be europe without an understanding of its diverse and contradictory past . marcel fuerstenau -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 18.12.2008 nato , russia to resume high-level talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the informal meeting could lead to more formal talks down the line nato and russia will resume high-level talks in brussels friday .
it is a sign that the chill in relations between the alliance and the kremlin in the wake of the georgia conflict is starting to pass . the talks , labelled an " informal lunch , " will involve nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and russia 's ambassador to the alliance , dmitry rogozin , a nato official said on thursday , dec .
18 .
the meeting will be the first high-level gathering between russian and nato officials since august , when georgia and russia fought a short-lived but intense conflict over the breakaway georgian enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia .
as a result of that conflict , nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- talks were put on hold as tension was ratcheted up between the two parties over russia 's response to a georgian attempt to reassert its control over south ossetia .
although nrc technical and working-level talks were not interrupted , all meetings at the ambassadorial , ministerial and head-of-government levels have been frozen since the august war .
formal talks a possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : securing russian gas and oil is integral for security in europe , leaders say a handful of european governments - notable germany and france - have been eager to recommence high-level dialog with russia owing to its position as a major supplier of natural gas and oil to europe .
nato foreign ministers have tasked scheffer " to re-engage with russia at the political level " with a possible full return to formal talks once he reports back .
rogozin said he wanted all problematic issues between russia and nato to be " put on the table " so moscow could then decide whether it wanted to proceed with nrc meetings .
" i hope the secretary general will propose dates and themes for discussion and i will see with moscow if this is convenient , and then we will take a decision , " he told the afp news agency .
" everything has to be put on the table , " he said .
" it 's up to nato to correct its errors . "
mounting tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has vehemently opposed independence for kosovo tensions between russia and nato have been on the increase over several contentious matters , including kremlin anger at alliance pledges to absorb georgia and ukraine - both ex-soviet republics - into the 26-member bloc .
moscow views this as nato meddling in its traditional sphere of influence and as an attempt to box russia in .
russia has also strongly opposed independence from serbia for kosovo , which europe and nato have backed .
nato currently has a peacekeeping force in kosovo .
adding further fuel to the fire is a planned us anti-missile shield base which will see elements installed in poland and the czech republic .
moscow views this measure as a direct threat .
nato , meanwhile , has condemned russia 's recognition of the independence of the two breakaway georgian regions and views with distrust russian president dmitry medvedev 's proposal for a new european security pact , which the alliance believes is designed to negate the efficacy of nato . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their goal : to share experiences at conferences and improve access to files . a symbolic spot was chosen to sign the deal : the european house at the brandenburg gate .
until the end of 1989 , the berlin wall stood just a few meters away . for marianne birthler , the head of the federal commission for the records of the state security service of the former east germany , it was the fulfillment of a long-held dream : to deal with cold war secret police issues on an international basis . systematic cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film " the lives of others " helped explain the era to a new generation there has been contact between the countries in the past , but nothing systematic .
the european network - which will include the documentation agency of the east german stasi , as well as their counterparts in bulgaria , poland , romania , slovakia , the czech republic , and hungary - is expected to change all that . " one of our projects will be to provide information about our work in all seven countries , either via the internet or in printed form , " birthler said .
" of course , we will also host conferences .
there could even be a joint exhibition .
we 'll have to see . " different histories , different methods while birthler has plenty of plans , each country 's method of dealing with the issue is quite different . for example , in the czech republic , communist crimes have been under investigation since the mid-1990s , and access to files just became possible 10 months ago , according to miroslav lehky of the state security records agency in prague .
and compared with the germans , the czechs have many more files . " -lrb- we have files -rrb- not only from stasi , but all repressive state organizations from the communist state .
that includes military intelligence , civil intelligence , border guards .
now we have everything together , and can analyze it .
and of course we want to open everything , " said lehky . " i want to publish names " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives are accessible in berlin today bulgaria is also playing catch-up .
the records-historians there had to struggle for a long time before they got their own building .
now they have one .
it is slated to contain an archive of all the former secret agencies .
the goal of records-official evtim kostanidov , too , is to open up the archive to anyone who wants it . " another important job is to publish the names of those people who worked for the secret police , both officially and unofficially , " he said . for her part , birthler hopes the european network will help spark initiatives , particularly in post-communist countries that are n't part of the current group . an example for others " i could imagine that our cooperation would give strength to people who need it .
just the fact that we exist , and that we 're visible on the european level , " she said .
slovenia and the baltic states are the countries that jump to mind , she says .
at this point , she notes , they are all members of the eu . europe is reunited and free , birthler said , but europe would n't be europe without an understanding of its diverse and contradictory past . marcel fuerstenau -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.12.2008 steinmeier grilled over germany 's role in iraq war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier insists germany did not aid the us war effort german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier faced hard questions thursday about germany 's role in the us-led " war on terror . "
the stakes are high for steinmeier , who would like to become germany 's next chancellor . in parliamentary hearings on thursday , dec .
18 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuffed accusations in connection to the mission of two agents of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
steinmeier once again justified the mission of the two bnd agents who , at the time , were based at the french embassy with diplomatic passports .
he said that the bnd and the german government wanted to be able to gather their own information and not be forced to rely on outside sources .
steinmeier told the committee that at the time it was completely clear to all parties involved in the mission that the political guidelines stood and that germany was not taking part in the war .
" there is no reason for me to believe that the wishes of the government were either knowingly or unknowingly violated , " he added .
germany criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency during the launch of war in iraq germany , traditionally a strong us ally , came out strongly against the invasion of iraq .
yet in the five years since the war in iraq started , berlin has been criticized for becoming covertly involved in the us fight against islamist extremists .
there have been accusations that germany 's intelligence services were aware of cia kidnappings and prisoner renditions .
most recently , a top retired us military officer said that the united states relied on german intelligence during its invasion of iraq in 2003 .
due to his role as chief of staff for then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency , placing him at the center of the current accusations of aiding the us .
high stakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans have vocally opposed the war this is the fifth time steinmeier has been called before a parliamentary committee to testify about issues relating to germany 's participation in the us-led " war on terror . "
and the stakes for steinmeier have never been higher .
the social democratic party has chosen steinmeier to run against current chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the cdu and spd currently share power in an awkward coalition government .
both sides would like a decisive electoral victory next fall , which would allow them to ditch their current partners and form coalitions with other parties .
steinmeier 's party has made a campaign issue out of its opposition to the war in iraq .
it could be disastrous for social democrats if it now turns out that german spies were secretly funneling information to us counterparts to aid in the us invasion of iraq .
long list of questionable involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has denied knowing about secret cia flights steinmeier was first called to testify two years ago as part of a closed-door parliamentary enquiry into the kidnapping of khaled el-masri .
the german-lebanese man says he was imprisoned by us agents in december 2003 in macedonia and tortured in afghanistan before being released five months later .
in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german .
steinmeier denied knowing anything about el-masri 's case until after he had been freed .
at the time , steinmeier admitted that " sometimes , difficult decisions were necessary . "
but he denied that anything was done illegally .
" that was true in the past , " steinmeier said at the time .
" and i can promise you that it will also be true in the future . "
since then , there have been several other high-profile cases in which german citizens have claimed they have been kidnapped or tortured as part of us anti-terrorism efforts .
steinmeier has also been questioned about germany 's involvement in so-called rendition flights , in which the cia secretly transported people to countries for interrogation where they were possibly tortured .
steinmeier will face tough questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri claims claims he was tortured the committee was never able to determine whether or not germany knew about the el-masri kidnapping or any of the other cases .
until now , the german foreign minister has not experienced any political backlash from the various cases .
but that current round of questioning could prove to be the most challenging for steinmeier as he has to clarify the role of two german spies during the iraq war .
earlier this week , retired us general james marks said in an interview with der spiegel magazine that information provided by german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- spies stationed in baghdad was extremely important , detailed and useful to the united states .
" reports on the defensive positions in and around baghdad and the location of troops and weapons were important , " marks told the magazine .
" we trusted information from germany more than from the cia . "
the agents sent approximately 130 reports to their commanders in germany and appeared to be aware their intelligence was being forwarded to the americans , according to the spiegel report .
that news has outraged other politicians .
" he did not take adequate measures ensure that important information from baghdad would not be forwarded to the us headquarters , " said hans-christian stroebele of the green party .
officials in berlin continue to maintain that germany was not involved in the fighting of the iraq war .
" what foreign minster steinmeier has been saying from the beginning stands : germany had good reason to be against the iraq war and for that reason was not involved in combat operations , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany able to completely avoid becoming involved ?
steinmeier has defended himself by saying that the bnd did not provide " active support of combat operations , " but that the bnd did work to " avoid an embassy or hospital from being bombed , which has nothing to do with double standards but with saving innocent people 's lives . "
the spd has signaled that it will stand behind steinmeier .
thomas oppermann , who is a member of the spd and chairs the parliamentary committee overseeing intelligence issues , said that the interview with general marks was " manipulated . "
marks has also been invited to testify before the committee . dw staff -lrb- th , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case has renewed calls in germany for banning a far-right political party . investigators arrested a man and a woman on wednesday , dec .
18 , in the near-fatal weekend stabbing of passau police chief alois mannichl .
a 33-year-old man and his wife , aged 22 , were taken in for questioning on tuesday after police traced the stabber 's getaway car to them . lead investigator alois walch told the associated press on thursday that the pair has been ordered by a court to be held on suspicion of accessory to attempted murder in the weekend stabbing of mannichl .
investigators , however , are continuing to look for the perpetrator . though investigators did not say what exact role the suspects had played in the attack , witnesses report having seen the couple from munich in the vicinity of the police official 's house before the incident . targeting law enforcement mannichl was believed to have been targeted by far-right extremists because of his outspoken opposition to skinhead groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the stabbing , the police chief 's house became a crime scene he was stabbed in the chest at his home with his own knife , which had been left outside the door of the mannichl home to allow neighborhood children to cut slices of cake for themselves .
he is in stable condition and recovering from the attack . the assailant , whose head was shaved clean , is reported to have said at the time of the stabbing : " greetings from the national resistance .
you will no longer trample on the graves of our comrades , you leftist pig . " german neo-nazis often refer to themselves as the " national resistance . " renewed calls for banning of npd the violence , along with its implication that rightists are willing to attack public officials , has led to calls this week to outlaw germany 's main far right group , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . an earlier attempt to ban the anti-foreigner party was quashed by germany 's top court in 2003 .
german justice minister brigitte zypries was quoted in a newspaper interview on wednesday as saying she did not believe there was sufficient evidence to mount a new legal challenge against the npd . there are around 31,000 members of extreme right-wing groups in germany , about 10,000 of whom are prepared to resort to violence , according to the domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution . dw staff -lrb- th / cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a sign that the chill in relations between the alliance and the kremlin in the wake of the georgia conflict is starting to pass . the talks , labelled an " informal lunch , " will involve nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and russia 's ambassador to the alliance , dmitry rogozin , a nato official said on thursday , dec .
18 .
the meeting will be the first high-level gathering between russian and nato officials since august , when georgia and russia fought a short-lived but intense conflict over the breakaway georgian enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia .
as a result of that conflict , nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- talks were put on hold as tension was ratcheted up between the two parties over russia 's response to a georgian attempt to reassert its control over south ossetia .
although nrc technical and working-level talks were not interrupted , all meetings at the ambassadorial , ministerial and head-of-government levels have been frozen since the august war .
formal talks a possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : securing russian gas and oil is integral for security in europe , leaders say a handful of european governments - notable germany and france - have been eager to recommence high-level dialog with russia owing to its position as a major supplier of natural gas and oil to europe .
nato foreign ministers have tasked scheffer " to re-engage with russia at the political level " with a possible full return to formal talks once he reports back .
rogozin said he wanted all problematic issues between russia and nato to be " put on the table " so moscow could then decide whether it wanted to proceed with nrc meetings .
" i hope the secretary general will propose dates and themes for discussion and i will see with moscow if this is convenient , and then we will take a decision , " he told the afp news agency .
" everything has to be put on the table , " he said .
" it 's up to nato to correct its errors . "
mounting tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has vehemently opposed independence for kosovo tensions between russia and nato have been on the increase over several contentious matters , including kremlin anger at alliance pledges to absorb georgia and ukraine - both ex-soviet republics - into the 26-member bloc .
moscow views this as nato meddling in its traditional sphere of influence and as an attempt to box russia in .
russia has also strongly opposed independence from serbia for kosovo , which europe and nato have backed .
nato currently has a peacekeeping force in kosovo .
adding further fuel to the fire is a planned us anti-missile shield base which will see elements installed in poland and the czech republic .
moscow views this measure as a direct threat .

it is a sign that the chill in relations between the alliance and the kremlin in the wake of the georgia conflict is starting to pass . the talks , labelled an " informal lunch , " will involve nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and russia 's ambassador to the alliance , dmitry rogozin , a nato official said on thursday , dec .
18 .
the meeting will be the first high-level gathering between russian and nato officials since august , when georgia and russia fought a short-lived but intense conflict over the breakaway georgian enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia .
as a result of that conflict , nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- talks were put on hold as tension was ratcheted up between the two parties over russia 's response to a georgian attempt to reassert its control over south ossetia .
although nrc technical and working-level talks were not interrupted , all meetings at the ambassadorial , ministerial and head-of-government levels have been frozen since the august war .
formal talks a possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : securing russian gas and oil is integral for security in europe , leaders say a handful of european governments - notable germany and france - have been eager to recommence high-level dialog with russia owing to its position as a major supplier of natural gas and oil to europe .
nato foreign ministers have tasked scheffer " to re-engage with russia at the political level " with a possible full return to formal talks once he reports back .
rogozin said he wanted all problematic issues between russia and nato to be " put on the table " so moscow could then decide whether it wanted to proceed with nrc meetings .
" i hope the secretary general will propose dates and themes for discussion and i will see with moscow if this is convenient , and then we will take a decision , " he told the afp news agency .
" everything has to be put on the table , " he said .
" it 's up to nato to correct its errors . "
mounting tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has vehemently opposed independence for kosovo tensions between russia and nato have been on the increase over several contentious matters , including kremlin anger at alliance pledges to absorb georgia and ukraine - both ex-soviet republics - into the 26-member bloc .
moscow views this as nato meddling in its traditional sphere of influence and as an attempt to box russia in .
russia has also strongly opposed independence from serbia for kosovo , which europe and nato have backed .
nato currently has a peacekeeping force in kosovo .
adding further fuel to the fire is a planned us anti-missile shield base which will see elements installed in poland and the czech republic .
moscow views this measure as a direct threat .
nato , meanwhile , has condemned russia 's recognition of the independence of the two breakaway georgian regions and views with distrust russian president dmitry medvedev 's proposal for a new european security pact , which the alliance believes is designed to negate the efficacy of nato . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 18.12.2008 germany must boost spending to fight recession : imf chief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says germany should act with other eu nations and boost spending germany must increase public spending in line with other european countries to ward off a deepening recession , international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- director-general dominique strauss-kahn said thursday , dec .
18 . the imf chief urged chancellor angela merkel 's government to parallel mitigating steps taken by other eu nations to curb the global economic downturn .
he said berlin should put still more money on the table in addition to the existing stimulus package it has announced .
" it would be helpful if the german government , whose reluctance i fully understand , were able to take another step " and introduce further measures to aid the economy , the head of the washington-based imf told germany 's " zdf " public television network .
he said merkel 's wait-and-see attitude while other european governments had set out plans to re-energize their economies was not the ideal approach for pulling europe 's largest economy out of recession .
such measures " make all the more sense when they are taken by all sides at the same time , " strauss-kahn said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel remains cautious over implementing further stimulus packages too soon he added that european economies would likely experience negative growth of 1 to 2 percent in 2009 , and that " the economic consequences will be truly hard for the little guy . "
merkel wary of budget deficit so far , merkel 's grand coalition government has announced a series of measures totaling up to 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion -rrb- to help spur economic growth .

" december 's fall in the german ifo business climate index brings further evidence that , far from weathering the storm , the german economy is in the midst of it , " capital economics economist jennifer mckeown told the afp news agency . analysts had expected the index , which is drawn up by the munich-based economic institute , would fall to 84 points after it plunged more than expected in november to 85.8 points .
the index stood at 90.2 points in october . a sub-index of the ifo survey was much lower at 88.8 points , compared with 94.9 in october , while expectations for the next six months also hit a record low of 76.8 points from 77.6 points , the institute said .

companies have likewise reported that they expect to shed workers , halting a steady fall in german unemployment rates . " on the whole the economic downturn has worsened and will now have an impact on the labor market , " the report said .

with business slumping , europe 's largest economy is bracing itself for a tough year . with the global economic downturn gaining momentum , the closely-watched ifo business confidence index marked the end of the year by chalking up its seventh consecutive monthly fall , declining to 82.6 points . " december 's fall in the german ifo business climate index brings further evidence that , far from weathering the storm , the german economy is in the midst of it , " capital economics economist jennifer mckeown told the afp news agency . analysts had expected the index , which is drawn up by the munich-based economic institute , would fall to 84 points after it plunged more than expected in november to 85.8 points .
the index stood at 90.2 points in october . a sub-index of the ifo survey was much lower at 88.8 points , compared with 94.9 in october , while expectations for the next six months also hit a record low of 76.8 points from 77.6 points , the institute said . " the dominant feature of the december decline is the worsening of the firms ' current business situation , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn in a statement . downturn expected to affect labor market considered the most accurate measure of german business confidence , the survey of 7,000 german executives comes in the wake of the publication of a slew of major indicators and data underscoring the bleak economic outlook taking shape across europe . on tuesday , a euro-zone purchasing managers ' index -lrb- pmi -rrb- for december compiled by data and research group markit fell to 38.3 points , its lowest level in the survey 's 10-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairs at unemployment offices across germany may soon be filling up again " the downturn is affecting above all the manufacturers of export and capital goods and less , up until now , retailing and construction , " sinn added .
" the pessimistic expectations of past months are becoming reality as more and more of the firms report an unsatisfactory business situation . " ifo said in its report that the auto and chemical sectors in the world 's leading exporter have been especially hard hit by the global economic slowdown .
companies have likewise reported that they expect to shed workers , halting a steady fall in german unemployment rates . " on the whole the economic downturn has worsened and will now have an impact on the labor market , " the report said . " little light at the end of the tunnel " germany might see economic activity contract by up to 3.0 percent next year , which would mark the worst recession in its post-war history , deputy economy minister walther otremba told afp on wednesday . " with the -lrb- ifo -rrb- expectations index still at a record low , there is little light at the end of the tunnel , " mckeown said .
" in all , it still looks likely that german gdp will fall by at least 1.0 percent next year and the latest forecast from the ifo institute itself of a fall of about 2.0 percent might not be too far off the mark .

with business slumping , europe 's largest economy is bracing itself for a tough year . with the global economic downturn gaining momentum , the closely-watched ifo business confidence index marked the end of the year by chalking up its seventh consecutive monthly fall , declining to 82.6 points . " december 's fall in the german ifo business climate index brings further evidence that , far from weathering the storm , the german economy is in the midst of it , " capital economics economist jennifer mckeown told the afp news agency . analysts had expected the index , which is drawn up by the munich-based economic institute , would fall to 84 points after it plunged more than expected in november to 85.8 points .
the index stood at 90.2 points in october . a sub-index of the ifo survey was much lower at 88.8 points , compared with 94.9 in october , while expectations for the next six months also hit a record low of 76.8 points from 77.6 points , the institute said . " the dominant feature of the december decline is the worsening of the firms ' current business situation , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn in a statement . downturn expected to affect labor market considered the most accurate measure of german business confidence , the survey of 7,000 german executives comes in the wake of the publication of a slew of major indicators and data underscoring the bleak economic outlook taking shape across europe . on tuesday , a euro-zone purchasing managers ' index -lrb- pmi -rrb- for december compiled by data and research group markit fell to 38.3 points , its lowest level in the survey 's 10-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairs at unemployment offices across germany may soon be filling up again " the downturn is affecting above all the manufacturers of export and capital goods and less , up until now , retailing and construction , " sinn added .
" the pessimistic expectations of past months are becoming reality as more and more of the firms report an unsatisfactory business situation . " ifo said in its report that the auto and chemical sectors in the world 's leading exporter have been especially hard hit by the global economic slowdown .
companies have likewise reported that they expect to shed workers , halting a steady fall in german unemployment rates . " on the whole the economic downturn has worsened and will now have an impact on the labor market , " the report said . " little light at the end of the tunnel " germany might see economic activity contract by up to 3.0 percent next year , which would mark the worst recession in its post-war history , deputy economy minister walther otremba told afp on wednesday . " with the -lrb- ifo -rrb- expectations index still at a record low , there is little light at the end of the tunnel , " mckeown said .
" in all , it still looks likely that german gdp will fall by at least 1.0 percent next year and the latest forecast from the ifo institute itself of a fall of about 2.0 percent might not be too far off the mark .

"
the stakes are high for steinmeier , who would like to become germany 's next chancellor . in parliamentary hearings on thursday , dec .
18 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuffed accusations in connection to the mission of two agents of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
steinmeier once again justified the mission of the two bnd agents who , at the time , were based at the french embassy with diplomatic passports .
he said that the bnd and the german government wanted to be able to gather their own information and not be forced to rely on outside sources .
steinmeier told the committee that at the time it was completely clear to all parties involved in the mission that the political guidelines stood and that germany was not taking part in the war .
" there is no reason for me to believe that the wishes of the government were either knowingly or unknowingly violated , " he added .
germany criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency during the launch of war in iraq germany , traditionally a strong us ally , came out strongly against the invasion of iraq .
yet in the five years since the war in iraq started , berlin has been criticized for becoming covertly involved in the us fight against islamist extremists .
there have been accusations that germany 's intelligence services were aware of cia kidnappings and prisoner renditions .
most recently , a top retired us military officer said that the united states relied on german intelligence during its invasion of iraq in 2003 .
due to his role as chief of staff for then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency , placing him at the center of the current accusations of aiding the us .
high stakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans have vocally opposed the war this is the fifth time steinmeier has been called before a parliamentary committee to testify about issues relating to germany 's participation in the us-led " war on terror . "
and the stakes for steinmeier have never been higher .
the social democratic party has chosen steinmeier to run against current chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the cdu and spd currently share power in an awkward coalition government .
both sides would like a decisive electoral victory next fall , which would allow them to ditch their current partners and form coalitions with other parties .
steinmeier 's party has made a campaign issue out of its opposition to the war in iraq .
it could be disastrous for social democrats if it now turns out that german spies were secretly funneling information to us counterparts to aid in the us invasion of iraq .
long list of questionable involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has denied knowing about secret cia flights steinmeier was first called to testify two years ago as part of a closed-door parliamentary enquiry into the kidnapping of khaled el-masri .
the german-lebanese man says he was imprisoned by us agents in december 2003 in macedonia and tortured in afghanistan before being released five months later .
in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german .
steinmeier denied knowing anything about el-masri 's case until after he had been freed .
at the time , steinmeier admitted that " sometimes , difficult decisions were necessary . "
but he denied that anything was done illegally .
" that was true in the past , " steinmeier said at the time .
" and i can promise you that it will also be true in the future . "
since then , there have been several other high-profile cases in which german citizens have claimed they have been kidnapped or tortured as part of us anti-terrorism efforts .
steinmeier has also been questioned about germany 's involvement in so-called rendition flights , in which the cia secretly transported people to countries for interrogation where they were possibly tortured .
steinmeier will face tough questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri claims claims he was tortured the committee was never able to determine whether or not germany knew about the el-masri kidnapping or any of the other cases .
until now , the german foreign minister has not experienced any political backlash from the various cases .
but that current round of questioning could prove to be the most challenging for steinmeier as he has to clarify the role of two german spies during the iraq war .
earlier this week , retired us general james marks said in an interview with der spiegel magazine that information provided by german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- spies stationed in baghdad was extremely important , detailed and useful to the united states .
" reports on the defensive positions in and around baghdad and the location of troops and weapons were important , " marks told the magazine .
" we trusted information from germany more than from the cia . "
the agents sent approximately 130 reports to their commanders in germany and appeared to be aware their intelligence was being forwarded to the americans , according to the spiegel report .
that news has outraged other politicians .
" he did not take adequate measures ensure that important information from baghdad would not be forwarded to the us headquarters , " said hans-christian stroebele of the green party .
officials in berlin continue to maintain that germany was not involved in the fighting of the iraq war .
" what foreign minster steinmeier has been saying from the beginning stands : germany had good reason to be against the iraq war and for that reason was not involved in combat operations , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany able to completely avoid becoming involved ?
steinmeier has defended himself by saying that the bnd did not provide " active support of combat operations , " but that the bnd did work to " avoid an embassy or hospital from being bombed , which has nothing to do with double standards but with saving innocent people 's lives . "
the spd has signaled that it will stand behind steinmeier .
thomas oppermann , who is a member of the spd and chairs the parliamentary committee overseeing intelligence issues , said that the interview with general marks was " manipulated . "
marks has also been invited to testify before the committee . dw staff -lrb- th , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german .
steinmeier denied knowing anything about el-masri 's case until after he had been freed .
at the time , steinmeier admitted that " sometimes , difficult decisions were necessary . "
but he denied that anything was done illegally .
" that was true in the past , " steinmeier said at the time .
" and i can promise you that it will also be true in the future . "
since then , there have been several other high-profile cases in which german citizens have claimed they have been kidnapped or tortured as part of us anti-terrorism efforts .
steinmeier has also been questioned about germany 's involvement in so-called rendition flights , in which the cia secretly transported people to countries for interrogation where they were possibly tortured .
steinmeier will face tough questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri claims claims he was tortured the committee was never able to determine whether or not germany knew about the el-masri kidnapping or any of the other cases .
until now , the german foreign minister has not experienced any political backlash from the various cases .
but that current round of questioning could prove to be the most challenging for steinmeier as he has to clarify the role of two german spies during the iraq war .
earlier this week , retired us general james marks said in an interview with der spiegel magazine that information provided by german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- spies stationed in baghdad was extremely important , detailed and useful to the united states .
" reports on the defensive positions in and around baghdad and the location of troops and weapons were important , " marks told the magazine .
" we trusted information from germany more than from the cia . "
the agents sent approximately 130 reports to their commanders in germany and appeared to be aware their intelligence was being forwarded to the americans , according to the spiegel report .
that news has outraged other politicians .
" he did not take adequate measures ensure that important information from baghdad would not be forwarded to the us headquarters , " said hans-christian stroebele of the green party .
officials in berlin continue to maintain that germany was not involved in the fighting of the iraq war .
" what foreign minster steinmeier has been saying from the beginning stands : germany had good reason to be against the iraq war and for that reason was not involved in combat operations , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany able to completely avoid becoming involved ?
steinmeier has defended himself by saying that the bnd did not provide " active support of combat operations , " but that the bnd did work to " avoid an embassy or hospital from being bombed , which has nothing to do with double standards but with saving innocent people 's lives . "
the spd has signaled that it will stand behind steinmeier .
thomas oppermann , who is a member of the spd and chairs the parliamentary committee overseeing intelligence issues , said that the interview with general marks was " manipulated . "

"
the stakes are high for steinmeier , who would like to become germany 's next chancellor . in parliamentary hearings on thursday , dec .
18 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuffed accusations in connection to the mission of two agents of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
steinmeier once again justified the mission of the two bnd agents who , at the time , were based at the french embassy with diplomatic passports .
he said that the bnd and the german government wanted to be able to gather their own information and not be forced to rely on outside sources .
steinmeier told the committee that at the time it was completely clear to all parties involved in the mission that the political guidelines stood and that germany was not taking part in the war .
" there is no reason for me to believe that the wishes of the government were either knowingly or unknowingly violated , " he added .
germany criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency during the launch of war in iraq germany , traditionally a strong us ally , came out strongly against the invasion of iraq .
yet in the five years since the war in iraq started , berlin has been criticized for becoming covertly involved in the us fight against islamist extremists .
there have been accusations that germany 's intelligence services were aware of cia kidnappings and prisoner renditions .
most recently , a top retired us military officer said that the united states relied on german intelligence during its invasion of iraq in 2003 .
due to his role as chief of staff for then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency , placing him at the center of the current accusations of aiding the us .
high stakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans have vocally opposed the war this is the fifth time steinmeier has been called before a parliamentary committee to testify about issues relating to germany 's participation in the us-led " war on terror . "
and the stakes for steinmeier have never been higher .
the social democratic party has chosen steinmeier to run against current chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the cdu and spd currently share power in an awkward coalition government .
both sides would like a decisive electoral victory next fall , which would allow them to ditch their current partners and form coalitions with other parties .
steinmeier 's party has made a campaign issue out of its opposition to the war in iraq .
it could be disastrous for social democrats if it now turns out that german spies were secretly funneling information to us counterparts to aid in the us invasion of iraq .
long list of questionable involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has denied knowing about secret cia flights steinmeier was first called to testify two years ago as part of a closed-door parliamentary enquiry into the kidnapping of khaled el-masri .

18 . the imf chief urged chancellor angela merkel 's government to parallel mitigating steps taken by other eu nations to curb the global economic downturn .
he said berlin should put still more money on the table in addition to the existing stimulus package it has announced .
" it would be helpful if the german government , whose reluctance i fully understand , were able to take another step " and introduce further measures to aid the economy , the head of the washington-based imf told germany 's " zdf " public television network .
he said merkel 's wait-and-see attitude while other european governments had set out plans to re-energize their economies was not the ideal approach for pulling europe 's largest economy out of recession .
such measures " make all the more sense when they are taken by all sides at the same time , " strauss-kahn said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel remains cautious over implementing further stimulus packages too soon he added that european economies would likely experience negative growth of 1 to 2 percent in 2009 , and that " the economic consequences will be truly hard for the little guy . "
merkel wary of budget deficit so far , merkel 's grand coalition government has announced a series of measures totaling up to 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion -rrb- to help spur economic growth .
but she has also faced calls from within the ranks of her own political bloc for the government to underpin the economy by cutting taxes .
instead , however , merkel and her government have refused to take action they consider rash to help germany limp through the current global crisis , especially measures that could lead to a deepening of the nation 's budget deficit .
new year 's resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will wait to see what the us does under barack obama , merkel hinted criticism of merkel 's so-far-modest attempts to shield germany from the global downturn has triggered a slump in her popularity , prompting the chancellor to tell business leaders tuesday , dec .
16 , they could expect a firmer response from the government early next year .
in the speech to the center for european economic research , a think-tank in mannheim , germany , she acknowledged the government 's stimulus package " might not suffice , " but hinted that she wanted to coordinate future efforts with the incoming us administration under barack obama , who takes office january 20 .
" we will take action again in january - another few billion could come together , " she told them amid press reports suggesting berlin would invest up to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- more to drag the economy out of its slump . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a sign that the chill in relations between the alliance and the kremlin in the wake of the georgia conflict is starting to pass . the talks , labelled an " informal lunch , " will involve nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and russia 's ambassador to the alliance , dmitry rogozin , a nato official said on thursday , dec .
18 .
the meeting will be the first high-level gathering between russian and nato officials since august , when georgia and russia fought a short-lived but intense conflict over the breakaway georgian enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia .
as a result of that conflict , nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- talks were put on hold as tension was ratcheted up between the two parties over russia 's response to a georgian attempt to reassert its control over south ossetia .
although nrc technical and working-level talks were not interrupted , all meetings at the ambassadorial , ministerial and head-of-government levels have been frozen since the august war .

nato foreign ministers have tasked scheffer " to re-engage with russia at the political level " with a possible full return to formal talks once he reports back .
rogozin said he wanted all problematic issues between russia and nato to be " put on the table " so moscow could then decide whether it wanted to proceed with nrc meetings .
" i hope the secretary general will propose dates and themes for discussion and i will see with moscow if this is convenient , and then we will take a decision , " he told the afp news agency .

it is a sign that the chill in relations between the alliance and the kremlin in the wake of the georgia conflict is starting to pass . the talks , labelled an " informal lunch , " will involve nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and russia 's ambassador to the alliance , dmitry rogozin , a nato official said on thursday , dec .
18 .
the meeting will be the first high-level gathering between russian and nato officials since august , when georgia and russia fought a short-lived but intense conflict over the breakaway georgian enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia .
as a result of that conflict , nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- talks were put on hold as tension was ratcheted up between the two parties over russia 's response to a georgian attempt to reassert its control over south ossetia .
although nrc technical and working-level talks were not interrupted , all meetings at the ambassadorial , ministerial and head-of-government levels have been frozen since the august war .
formal talks a possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : securing russian gas and oil is integral for security in europe , leaders say a handful of european governments - notable germany and france - have been eager to recommence high-level dialog with russia owing to its position as a major supplier of natural gas and oil to europe .
nato foreign ministers have tasked scheffer " to re-engage with russia at the political level " with a possible full return to formal talks once he reports back .
rogozin said he wanted all problematic issues between russia and nato to be " put on the table " so moscow could then decide whether it wanted to proceed with nrc meetings .
" i hope the secretary general will propose dates and themes for discussion and i will see with moscow if this is convenient , and then we will take a decision , " he told the afp news agency .
" everything has to be put on the table , " he said .
" it 's up to nato to correct its errors . "
mounting tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has vehemently opposed independence for kosovo tensions between russia and nato have been on the increase over several contentious matters , including kremlin anger at alliance pledges to absorb georgia and ukraine - both ex-soviet republics - into the 26-member bloc .
moscow views this as nato meddling in its traditional sphere of influence and as an attempt to box russia in .
russia has also strongly opposed independence from serbia for kosovo , which europe and nato have backed .
nato currently has a peacekeeping force in kosovo .
adding further fuel to the fire is a planned us anti-missile shield base which will see elements installed in poland and the czech republic .
moscow views this measure as a direct threat .

18 . the imf chief urged chancellor angela merkel 's government to parallel mitigating steps taken by other eu nations to curb the global economic downturn .
he said berlin should put still more money on the table in addition to the existing stimulus package it has announced .
" it would be helpful if the german government , whose reluctance i fully understand , were able to take another step " and introduce further measures to aid the economy , the head of the washington-based imf told germany 's " zdf " public television network .
he said merkel 's wait-and-see attitude while other european governments had set out plans to re-energize their economies was not the ideal approach for pulling europe 's largest economy out of recession .
such measures " make all the more sense when they are taken by all sides at the same time , " strauss-kahn said .

18 . the imf chief urged chancellor angela merkel 's government to parallel mitigating steps taken by other eu nations to curb the global economic downturn .
he said berlin should put still more money on the table in addition to the existing stimulus package it has announced .
" it would be helpful if the german government , whose reluctance i fully understand , were able to take another step " and introduce further measures to aid the economy , the head of the washington-based imf told germany 's " zdf " public television network .
he said merkel 's wait-and-see attitude while other european governments had set out plans to re-energize their economies was not the ideal approach for pulling europe 's largest economy out of recession .
such measures " make all the more sense when they are taken by all sides at the same time , " strauss-kahn said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel remains cautious over implementing further stimulus packages too soon he added that european economies would likely experience negative growth of 1 to 2 percent in 2009 , and that " the economic consequences will be truly hard for the little guy . "
merkel wary of budget deficit so far , merkel 's grand coalition government has announced a series of measures totaling up to 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion -rrb- to help spur economic growth .
but she has also faced calls from within the ranks of her own political bloc for the government to underpin the economy by cutting taxes .
instead , however , merkel and her government have refused to take action they consider rash to help germany limp through the current global crisis , especially measures that could lead to a deepening of the nation 's budget deficit .
new year 's resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will wait to see what the us does under barack obama , merkel hinted criticism of merkel 's so-far-modest attempts to shield germany from the global downturn has triggered a slump in her popularity , prompting the chancellor to tell business leaders tuesday , dec .
16 , they could expect a firmer response from the government early next year .
in the speech to the center for european economic research , a think-tank in mannheim , germany , she acknowledged the government 's stimulus package " might not suffice , " but hinted that she wanted to coordinate future efforts with the incoming us administration under barack obama , who takes office january 20 .
" we will take action again in january - another few billion could come together , " she told them amid press reports suggesting berlin would invest up to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- more to drag the economy out of its slump . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the stakes are high for steinmeier , who would like to become germany 's next chancellor . in parliamentary hearings on thursday , dec .
18 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuffed accusations in connection to the mission of two agents of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
steinmeier once again justified the mission of the two bnd agents who , at the time , were based at the french embassy with diplomatic passports .
he said that the bnd and the german government wanted to be able to gather their own information and not be forced to rely on outside sources .
steinmeier told the committee that at the time it was completely clear to all parties involved in the mission that the political guidelines stood and that germany was not taking part in the war .
" there is no reason for me to believe that the wishes of the government were either knowingly or unknowingly violated , " he added .
germany criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency during the launch of war in iraq germany , traditionally a strong us ally , came out strongly against the invasion of iraq .
yet in the five years since the war in iraq started , berlin has been criticized for becoming covertly involved in the us fight against islamist extremists .
there have been accusations that germany 's intelligence services were aware of cia kidnappings and prisoner renditions .
most recently , a top retired us military officer said that the united states relied on german intelligence during its invasion of iraq in 2003 .
due to his role as chief of staff for then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency , placing him at the center of the current accusations of aiding the us .
high stakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans have vocally opposed the war this is the fifth time steinmeier has been called before a parliamentary committee to testify about issues relating to germany 's participation in the us-led " war on terror . "
and the stakes for steinmeier have never been higher .
the social democratic party has chosen steinmeier to run against current chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the cdu and spd currently share power in an awkward coalition government .
both sides would like a decisive electoral victory next fall , which would allow them to ditch their current partners and form coalitions with other parties .
steinmeier 's party has made a campaign issue out of its opposition to the war in iraq .
it could be disastrous for social democrats if it now turns out that german spies were secretly funneling information to us counterparts to aid in the us invasion of iraq .
long list of questionable involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has denied knowing about secret cia flights steinmeier was first called to testify two years ago as part of a closed-door parliamentary enquiry into the kidnapping of khaled el-masri .
the german-lebanese man says he was imprisoned by us agents in december 2003 in macedonia and tortured in afghanistan before being released five months later .
in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german .
steinmeier denied knowing anything about el-masri 's case until after he had been freed .
at the time , steinmeier admitted that " sometimes , difficult decisions were necessary . "
but he denied that anything was done illegally .
" that was true in the past , " steinmeier said at the time .
" and i can promise you that it will also be true in the future . "
since then , there have been several other high-profile cases in which german citizens have claimed they have been kidnapped or tortured as part of us anti-terrorism efforts .
steinmeier has also been questioned about germany 's involvement in so-called rendition flights , in which the cia secretly transported people to countries for interrogation where they were possibly tortured .
steinmeier will face tough questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri claims claims he was tortured the committee was never able to determine whether or not germany knew about the el-masri kidnapping or any of the other cases .
until now , the german foreign minister has not experienced any political backlash from the various cases .
but that current round of questioning could prove to be the most challenging for steinmeier as he has to clarify the role of two german spies during the iraq war .
earlier this week , retired us general james marks said in an interview with der spiegel magazine that information provided by german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- spies stationed in baghdad was extremely important , detailed and useful to the united states .
" reports on the defensive positions in and around baghdad and the location of troops and weapons were important , " marks told the magazine .
" we trusted information from germany more than from the cia . "
the agents sent approximately 130 reports to their commanders in germany and appeared to be aware their intelligence was being forwarded to the americans , according to the spiegel report .
that news has outraged other politicians .
" he did not take adequate measures ensure that important information from baghdad would not be forwarded to the us headquarters , " said hans-christian stroebele of the green party .
officials in berlin continue to maintain that germany was not involved in the fighting of the iraq war .
" what foreign minster steinmeier has been saying from the beginning stands : germany had good reason to be against the iraq war and for that reason was not involved in combat operations , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany able to completely avoid becoming involved ?
steinmeier has defended himself by saying that the bnd did not provide " active support of combat operations , " but that the bnd did work to " avoid an embassy or hospital from being bombed , which has nothing to do with double standards but with saving innocent people 's lives . "
the spd has signaled that it will stand behind steinmeier .
thomas oppermann , who is a member of the spd and chairs the parliamentary committee overseeing intelligence issues , said that the interview with general marks was " manipulated . "
marks has also been invited to testify before the committee . dw staff -lrb- th , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with business slumping , europe 's largest economy is bracing itself for a tough year . with the global economic downturn gaining momentum , the closely-watched ifo business confidence index marked the end of the year by chalking up its seventh consecutive monthly fall , declining to 82.6 points . " december 's fall in the german ifo business climate index brings further evidence that , far from weathering the storm , the german economy is in the midst of it , " capital economics economist jennifer mckeown told the afp news agency . analysts had expected the index , which is drawn up by the munich-based economic institute , would fall to 84 points after it plunged more than expected in november to 85.8 points .
the index stood at 90.2 points in october . a sub-index of the ifo survey was much lower at 88.8 points , compared with 94.9 in october , while expectations for the next six months also hit a record low of 76.8 points from 77.6 points , the institute said . " the dominant feature of the december decline is the worsening of the firms ' current business situation , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn in a statement . downturn expected to affect labor market considered the most accurate measure of german business confidence , the survey of 7,000 german executives comes in the wake of the publication of a slew of major indicators and data underscoring the bleak economic outlook taking shape across europe . on tuesday , a euro-zone purchasing managers ' index -lrb- pmi -rrb- for december compiled by data and research group markit fell to 38.3 points , its lowest level in the survey 's 10-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairs at unemployment offices across germany may soon be filling up again " the downturn is affecting above all the manufacturers of export and capital goods and less , up until now , retailing and construction , " sinn added .
" the pessimistic expectations of past months are becoming reality as more and more of the firms report an unsatisfactory business situation . " ifo said in its report that the auto and chemical sectors in the world 's leading exporter have been especially hard hit by the global economic slowdown .
companies have likewise reported that they expect to shed workers , halting a steady fall in german unemployment rates . " on the whole the economic downturn has worsened and will now have an impact on the labor market , " the report said . " little light at the end of the tunnel " germany might see economic activity contract by up to 3.0 percent next year , which would mark the worst recession in its post-war history , deputy economy minister walther otremba told afp on wednesday . " with the -lrb- ifo -rrb- expectations index still at a record low , there is little light at the end of the tunnel , " mckeown said .
" in all , it still looks likely that german gdp will fall by at least 1.0 percent next year and the latest forecast from the ifo institute itself of a fall of about 2.0 percent might not be too far off the mark .

" it returns russian justice to the times of 1920-1950s , when independent evaluation of the situation in the country ... to say nothing of the criticism of the regime and unsanctioned communication with foreigners , was interpreted as treason to the motherland , " the statement said . opposition movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilya yashin is one of the founding members of solidarity the bill was submitted last friday , just a day before a new opposition movement , solidarity , was founded in moscow .
among those in charge of the rally in the russian capital was ilya yashin , a 28-year-old opposition politician and the head of the youth wing of the liberal yabloko party . founding solidarity was important because russians have to know what is occurring in their country , yashin told deutsche welle , adding that in russia there is an information vacuum and news broadcast on the putin-controlled television have nothing to do with reality . bringing down the regime yashin said it was important to form a large , connected opposition in order to change the current power structure . " we will never be able to bring down this mechanism of power from the inside , " he said .
" this power is so complete that it consumes everything .
it has wrecked parliament , it has robbed us of our elections , it has destroyed independent television and the justice system .
the former kgb people who rule this nation are deaf and blind to criticism from the inside . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say putin has too much power yashin called the new move putin 's cabinet is another in a long line of battles he will have to help fight .
he said he understands that success for solidarity means that his life will be in greater danger , but added that democracy is worth it . " freedom is n't going to be served up on a plate , " he said .
" we have to fight for our freedom and democracy .
and when we have clawed our way back we will honor and defend our freedom . " dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with business slumping , europe 's largest economy is bracing itself for a tough year . with the global economic downturn gaining momentum , the closely-watched ifo business confidence index marked the end of the year by chalking up its seventh consecutive monthly fall , declining to 82.6 points . " december 's fall in the german ifo business climate index brings further evidence that , far from weathering the storm , the german economy is in the midst of it , " capital economics economist jennifer mckeown told the afp news agency . analysts had expected the index , which is drawn up by the munich-based economic institute , would fall to 84 points after it plunged more than expected in november to 85.8 points .
the index stood at 90.2 points in october . a sub-index of the ifo survey was much lower at 88.8 points , compared with 94.9 in october , while expectations for the next six months also hit a record low of 76.8 points from 77.6 points , the institute said . " the dominant feature of the december decline is the worsening of the firms ' current business situation , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn in a statement . downturn expected to affect labor market considered the most accurate measure of german business confidence , the survey of 7,000 german executives comes in the wake of the publication of a slew of major indicators and data underscoring the bleak economic outlook taking shape across europe . on tuesday , a euro-zone purchasing managers ' index -lrb- pmi -rrb- for december compiled by data and research group markit fell to 38.3 points , its lowest level in the survey 's 10-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairs at unemployment offices across germany may soon be filling up again " the downturn is affecting above all the manufacturers of export and capital goods and less , up until now , retailing and construction , " sinn added .
" the pessimistic expectations of past months are becoming reality as more and more of the firms report an unsatisfactory business situation . " ifo said in its report that the auto and chemical sectors in the world 's leading exporter have been especially hard hit by the global economic slowdown .
companies have likewise reported that they expect to shed workers , halting a steady fall in german unemployment rates . " on the whole the economic downturn has worsened and will now have an impact on the labor market , " the report said . " little light at the end of the tunnel " germany might see economic activity contract by up to 3.0 percent next year , which would mark the worst recession in its post-war history , deputy economy minister walther otremba told afp on wednesday . " with the -lrb- ifo -rrb- expectations index still at a record low , there is little light at the end of the tunnel , " mckeown said .
" in all , it still looks likely that german gdp will fall by at least 1.0 percent next year and the latest forecast from the ifo institute itself of a fall of about 2.0 percent might not be too far off the mark .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.12.2008 steinmeier grilled over germany 's role in iraq war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier insists germany did not aid the us war effort german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier faced hard questions thursday about germany 's role in the us-led " war on terror . "
the stakes are high for steinmeier , who would like to become germany 's next chancellor . in parliamentary hearings on thursday , dec .
18 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuffed accusations in connection to the mission of two agents of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
steinmeier once again justified the mission of the two bnd agents who , at the time , were based at the french embassy with diplomatic passports .
he said that the bnd and the german government wanted to be able to gather their own information and not be forced to rely on outside sources .
steinmeier told the committee that at the time it was completely clear to all parties involved in the mission that the political guidelines stood and that germany was not taking part in the war .
" there is no reason for me to believe that the wishes of the government were either knowingly or unknowingly violated , " he added .
germany criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency during the launch of war in iraq germany , traditionally a strong us ally , came out strongly against the invasion of iraq .
yet in the five years since the war in iraq started , berlin has been criticized for becoming covertly involved in the us fight against islamist extremists .
there have been accusations that germany 's intelligence services were aware of cia kidnappings and prisoner renditions .
most recently , a top retired us military officer said that the united states relied on german intelligence during its invasion of iraq in 2003 .
due to his role as chief of staff for then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency , placing him at the center of the current accusations of aiding the us .
high stakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans have vocally opposed the war this is the fifth time steinmeier has been called before a parliamentary committee to testify about issues relating to germany 's participation in the us-led " war on terror . "
and the stakes for steinmeier have never been higher .
the social democratic party has chosen steinmeier to run against current chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the cdu and spd currently share power in an awkward coalition government .
both sides would like a decisive electoral victory next fall , which would allow them to ditch their current partners and form coalitions with other parties .
steinmeier 's party has made a campaign issue out of its opposition to the war in iraq .
it could be disastrous for social democrats if it now turns out that german spies were secretly funneling information to us counterparts to aid in the us invasion of iraq .
long list of questionable involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has denied knowing about secret cia flights steinmeier was first called to testify two years ago as part of a closed-door parliamentary enquiry into the kidnapping of khaled el-masri .
the german-lebanese man says he was imprisoned by us agents in december 2003 in macedonia and tortured in afghanistan before being released five months later .
in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german .
steinmeier denied knowing anything about el-masri 's case until after he had been freed .
at the time , steinmeier admitted that " sometimes , difficult decisions were necessary . "
but he denied that anything was done illegally .
" that was true in the past , " steinmeier said at the time .
" and i can promise you that it will also be true in the future . "
since then , there have been several other high-profile cases in which german citizens have claimed they have been kidnapped or tortured as part of us anti-terrorism efforts .
steinmeier has also been questioned about germany 's involvement in so-called rendition flights , in which the cia secretly transported people to countries for interrogation where they were possibly tortured .
steinmeier will face tough questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri claims claims he was tortured the committee was never able to determine whether or not germany knew about the el-masri kidnapping or any of the other cases .
until now , the german foreign minister has not experienced any political backlash from the various cases .
but that current round of questioning could prove to be the most challenging for steinmeier as he has to clarify the role of two german spies during the iraq war .
earlier this week , retired us general james marks said in an interview with der spiegel magazine that information provided by german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- spies stationed in baghdad was extremely important , detailed and useful to the united states .
" reports on the defensive positions in and around baghdad and the location of troops and weapons were important , " marks told the magazine .
" we trusted information from germany more than from the cia . "
the agents sent approximately 130 reports to their commanders in germany and appeared to be aware their intelligence was being forwarded to the americans , according to the spiegel report .
that news has outraged other politicians .
" he did not take adequate measures ensure that important information from baghdad would not be forwarded to the us headquarters , " said hans-christian stroebele of the green party .
officials in berlin continue to maintain that germany was not involved in the fighting of the iraq war .
" what foreign minster steinmeier has been saying from the beginning stands : germany had good reason to be against the iraq war and for that reason was not involved in combat operations , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany able to completely avoid becoming involved ?
steinmeier has defended himself by saying that the bnd did not provide " active support of combat operations , " but that the bnd did work to " avoid an embassy or hospital from being bombed , which has nothing to do with double standards but with saving innocent people 's lives . "
the spd has signaled that it will stand behind steinmeier .
thomas oppermann , who is a member of the spd and chairs the parliamentary committee overseeing intelligence issues , said that the interview with general marks was " manipulated . "
marks has also been invited to testify before the committee . dw staff -lrb- th , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the stakes are high for steinmeier , who would like to become germany 's next chancellor . in parliamentary hearings on thursday , dec .
18 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuffed accusations in connection to the mission of two agents of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
steinmeier once again justified the mission of the two bnd agents who , at the time , were based at the french embassy with diplomatic passports .
he said that the bnd and the german government wanted to be able to gather their own information and not be forced to rely on outside sources .
steinmeier told the committee that at the time it was completely clear to all parties involved in the mission that the political guidelines stood and that germany was not taking part in the war .
" there is no reason for me to believe that the wishes of the government were either knowingly or unknowingly violated , " he added .
germany criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency during the launch of war in iraq germany , traditionally a strong us ally , came out strongly against the invasion of iraq .
yet in the five years since the war in iraq started , berlin has been criticized for becoming covertly involved in the us fight against islamist extremists .
there have been accusations that germany 's intelligence services were aware of cia kidnappings and prisoner renditions .
most recently , a top retired us military officer said that the united states relied on german intelligence during its invasion of iraq in 2003 .
due to his role as chief of staff for then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency , placing him at the center of the current accusations of aiding the us .
high stakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans have vocally opposed the war this is the fifth time steinmeier has been called before a parliamentary committee to testify about issues relating to germany 's participation in the us-led " war on terror . "
and the stakes for steinmeier have never been higher .
the social democratic party has chosen steinmeier to run against current chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the cdu and spd currently share power in an awkward coalition government .
both sides would like a decisive electoral victory next fall , which would allow them to ditch their current partners and form coalitions with other parties .
steinmeier 's party has made a campaign issue out of its opposition to the war in iraq .
it could be disastrous for social democrats if it now turns out that german spies were secretly funneling information to us counterparts to aid in the us invasion of iraq .
long list of questionable involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has denied knowing about secret cia flights steinmeier was first called to testify two years ago as part of a closed-door parliamentary enquiry into the kidnapping of khaled el-masri .
the german-lebanese man says he was imprisoned by us agents in december 2003 in macedonia and tortured in afghanistan before being released five months later .
in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german .
steinmeier denied knowing anything about el-masri 's case until after he had been freed .
at the time , steinmeier admitted that " sometimes , difficult decisions were necessary . "
but he denied that anything was done illegally .
" that was true in the past , " steinmeier said at the time .
" and i can promise you that it will also be true in the future . "
since then , there have been several other high-profile cases in which german citizens have claimed they have been kidnapped or tortured as part of us anti-terrorism efforts .
steinmeier has also been questioned about germany 's involvement in so-called rendition flights , in which the cia secretly transported people to countries for interrogation where they were possibly tortured .
steinmeier will face tough questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri claims claims he was tortured the committee was never able to determine whether or not germany knew about the el-masri kidnapping or any of the other cases .
until now , the german foreign minister has not experienced any political backlash from the various cases .
but that current round of questioning could prove to be the most challenging for steinmeier as he has to clarify the role of two german spies during the iraq war .
earlier this week , retired us general james marks said in an interview with der spiegel magazine that information provided by german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- spies stationed in baghdad was extremely important , detailed and useful to the united states .
" reports on the defensive positions in and around baghdad and the location of troops and weapons were important , " marks told the magazine .
" we trusted information from germany more than from the cia . "
the agents sent approximately 130 reports to their commanders in germany and appeared to be aware their intelligence was being forwarded to the americans , according to the spiegel report .
that news has outraged other politicians .
" he did not take adequate measures ensure that important information from baghdad would not be forwarded to the us headquarters , " said hans-christian stroebele of the green party .
officials in berlin continue to maintain that germany was not involved in the fighting of the iraq war .
" what foreign minster steinmeier has been saying from the beginning stands : germany had good reason to be against the iraq war and for that reason was not involved in combat operations , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany able to completely avoid becoming involved ?
steinmeier has defended himself by saying that the bnd did not provide " active support of combat operations , " but that the bnd did work to " avoid an embassy or hospital from being bombed , which has nothing to do with double standards but with saving innocent people 's lives . "
the spd has signaled that it will stand behind steinmeier .
thomas oppermann , who is a member of the spd and chairs the parliamentary committee overseeing intelligence issues , said that the interview with general marks was " manipulated . "
marks has also been invited to testify before the committee . dw staff -lrb- th , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 . the imf chief urged chancellor angela merkel 's government to parallel mitigating steps taken by other eu nations to curb the global economic downturn .
he said berlin should put still more money on the table in addition to the existing stimulus package it has announced .
" it would be helpful if the german government , whose reluctance i fully understand , were able to take another step " and introduce further measures to aid the economy , the head of the washington-based imf told germany 's " zdf " public television network .
he said merkel 's wait-and-see attitude while other european governments had set out plans to re-energize their economies was not the ideal approach for pulling europe 's largest economy out of recession .
such measures " make all the more sense when they are taken by all sides at the same time , " strauss-kahn said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel remains cautious over implementing further stimulus packages too soon he added that european economies would likely experience negative growth of 1 to 2 percent in 2009 , and that " the economic consequences will be truly hard for the little guy .

merkel wary of budget deficit so far , merkel 's grand coalition government has announced a series of measures totaling up to 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion -rrb- to help spur economic growth .
but she has also faced calls from within the ranks of her own political bloc for the government to underpin the economy by cutting taxes .
instead , however , merkel and her government have refused to take action they consider rash to help germany limp through the current global crisis , especially measures that could lead to a deepening of the nation 's budget deficit .

the case has renewed calls in germany for banning a far-right political party . investigators arrested a man and a woman on wednesday , dec .
18 , in the near-fatal weekend stabbing of passau police chief alois mannichl .
a 33-year-old man and his wife , aged 22 , were taken in for questioning on tuesday after police traced the stabber 's getaway car to them . lead investigator alois walch told the associated press on thursday that the pair has been ordered by a court to be held on suspicion of accessory to attempted murder in the weekend stabbing of mannichl .
investigators , however , are continuing to look for the perpetrator . though investigators did not say what exact role the suspects had played in the attack , witnesses report having seen the couple from munich in the vicinity of the police official 's house before the incident . targeting law enforcement mannichl was believed to have been targeted by far-right extremists because of his outspoken opposition to skinhead groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the stabbing , the police chief 's house became a crime scene he was stabbed in the chest at his home with his own knife , which had been left outside the door of the mannichl home to allow neighborhood children to cut slices of cake for themselves .
he is in stable condition and recovering from the attack . the assailant , whose head was shaved clean , is reported to have said at the time of the stabbing : " greetings from the national resistance .
you will no longer trample on the graves of our comrades , you leftist pig . " german neo-nazis often refer to themselves as the " national resistance . " renewed calls for banning of npd the violence , along with its implication that rightists are willing to attack public officials , has led to calls this week to outlaw germany 's main far right group , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . an earlier attempt to ban the anti-foreigner party was quashed by germany 's top court in 2003 .
german justice minister brigitte zypries was quoted in a newspaper interview on wednesday as saying she did not believe there was sufficient evidence to mount a new legal challenge against the npd . there are around 31,000 members of extreme right-wing groups in germany , about 10,000 of whom are prepared to resort to violence , according to the domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution . dw staff -lrb- th / cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the stakes are high for steinmeier , who would like to become germany 's next chancellor . in parliamentary hearings on thursday , dec .
18 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuffed accusations in connection to the mission of two agents of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
steinmeier once again justified the mission of the two bnd agents who , at the time , were based at the french embassy with diplomatic passports .
he said that the bnd and the german government wanted to be able to gather their own information and not be forced to rely on outside sources .
steinmeier told the committee that at the time it was completely clear to all parties involved in the mission that the political guidelines stood and that germany was not taking part in the war .
" there is no reason for me to believe that the wishes of the government were either knowingly or unknowingly violated , " he added .
germany criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency during the launch of war in iraq germany , traditionally a strong us ally , came out strongly against the invasion of iraq .
yet in the five years since the war in iraq started , berlin has been criticized for becoming covertly involved in the us fight against islamist extremists .
there have been accusations that germany 's intelligence services were aware of cia kidnappings and prisoner renditions .
most recently , a top retired us military officer said that the united states relied on german intelligence during its invasion of iraq in 2003 .
due to his role as chief of staff for then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency , placing him at the center of the current accusations of aiding the us .
high stakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans have vocally opposed the war this is the fifth time steinmeier has been called before a parliamentary committee to testify about issues relating to germany 's participation in the us-led " war on terror . "
and the stakes for steinmeier have never been higher .
the social democratic party has chosen steinmeier to run against current chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the cdu and spd currently share power in an awkward coalition government .
both sides would like a decisive electoral victory next fall , which would allow them to ditch their current partners and form coalitions with other parties .
steinmeier 's party has made a campaign issue out of its opposition to the war in iraq .
it could be disastrous for social democrats if it now turns out that german spies were secretly funneling information to us counterparts to aid in the us invasion of iraq .
long list of questionable involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has denied knowing about secret cia flights steinmeier was first called to testify two years ago as part of a closed-door parliamentary enquiry into the kidnapping of khaled el-masri .
the german-lebanese man says he was imprisoned by us agents in december 2003 in macedonia and tortured in afghanistan before being released five months later .
in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german .
steinmeier denied knowing anything about el-masri 's case until after he had been freed .
at the time , steinmeier admitted that " sometimes , difficult decisions were necessary . "
but he denied that anything was done illegally .
" that was true in the past , " steinmeier said at the time .
" and i can promise you that it will also be true in the future . "
since then , there have been several other high-profile cases in which german citizens have claimed they have been kidnapped or tortured as part of us anti-terrorism efforts .
steinmeier has also been questioned about germany 's involvement in so-called rendition flights , in which the cia secretly transported people to countries for interrogation where they were possibly tortured .
steinmeier will face tough questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri claims claims he was tortured the committee was never able to determine whether or not germany knew about the el-masri kidnapping or any of the other cases .
until now , the german foreign minister has not experienced any political backlash from the various cases .
but that current round of questioning could prove to be the most challenging for steinmeier as he has to clarify the role of two german spies during the iraq war .
earlier this week , retired us general james marks said in an interview with der spiegel magazine that information provided by german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- spies stationed in baghdad was extremely important , detailed and useful to the united states .
" reports on the defensive positions in and around baghdad and the location of troops and weapons were important , " marks told the magazine .
" we trusted information from germany more than from the cia . "
the agents sent approximately 130 reports to their commanders in germany and appeared to be aware their intelligence was being forwarded to the americans , according to the spiegel report .
that news has outraged other politicians .
" he did not take adequate measures ensure that important information from baghdad would not be forwarded to the us headquarters , " said hans-christian stroebele of the green party .
officials in berlin continue to maintain that germany was not involved in the fighting of the iraq war .
" what foreign minster steinmeier has been saying from the beginning stands : germany had good reason to be against the iraq war and for that reason was not involved in combat operations , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany able to completely avoid becoming involved ?
steinmeier has defended himself by saying that the bnd did not provide " active support of combat operations , " but that the bnd did work to " avoid an embassy or hospital from being bombed , which has nothing to do with double standards but with saving innocent people 's lives . "
the spd has signaled that it will stand behind steinmeier .
thomas oppermann , who is a member of the spd and chairs the parliamentary committee overseeing intelligence issues , said that the interview with general marks was " manipulated . "
marks has also been invited to testify before the committee . dw staff -lrb- th , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

long list of questionable involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has denied knowing about secret cia flights steinmeier was first called to testify two years ago as part of a closed-door parliamentary enquiry into the kidnapping of khaled el-masri .
the german-lebanese man says he was imprisoned by us agents in december 2003 in macedonia and tortured in afghanistan before being released five months later .
in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german .
steinmeier denied knowing anything about el-masri 's case until after he had been freed .
at the time , steinmeier admitted that " sometimes , difficult decisions were necessary . "
but he denied that anything was done illegally .
" that was true in the past , " steinmeier said at the time .
" and i can promise you that it will also be true in the future . "
since then , there have been several other high-profile cases in which german citizens have claimed they have been kidnapped or tortured as part of us anti-terrorism efforts .
steinmeier has also been questioned about germany 's involvement in so-called rendition flights , in which the cia secretly transported people to countries for interrogation where they were possibly tortured .
steinmeier will face tough questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri claims claims he was tortured the committee was never able to determine whether or not germany knew about the el-masri kidnapping or any of the other cases .
until now , the german foreign minister has not experienced any political backlash from the various cases .
but that current round of questioning could prove to be the most challenging for steinmeier as he has to clarify the role of two german spies during the iraq war .
earlier this week , retired us general james marks said in an interview with der spiegel magazine that information provided by german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- spies stationed in baghdad was extremely important , detailed and useful to the united states .
" reports on the defensive positions in and around baghdad and the location of troops and weapons were important , " marks told the magazine .
" we trusted information from germany more than from the cia . "
the agents sent approximately 130 reports to their commanders in germany and appeared to be aware their intelligence was being forwarded to the americans , according to the spiegel report .
that news has outraged other politicians .
" he did not take adequate measures ensure that important information from baghdad would not be forwarded to the us headquarters , " said hans-christian stroebele of the green party .
officials in berlin continue to maintain that germany was not involved in the fighting of the iraq war .
" what foreign minster steinmeier has been saying from the beginning stands : germany had good reason to be against the iraq war and for that reason was not involved in combat operations , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany able to completely avoid becoming involved ?
steinmeier has defended himself by saying that the bnd did not provide " active support of combat operations , " but that the bnd did work to " avoid an embassy or hospital from being bombed , which has nothing to do with double standards but with saving innocent people 's lives . "

18 . the imf chief urged chancellor angela merkel 's government to parallel mitigating steps taken by other eu nations to curb the global economic downturn .
he said berlin should put still more money on the table in addition to the existing stimulus package it has announced .
" it would be helpful if the german government , whose reluctance i fully understand , were able to take another step " and introduce further measures to aid the economy , the head of the washington-based imf told germany 's " zdf " public television network .
he said merkel 's wait-and-see attitude while other european governments had set out plans to re-energize their economies was not the ideal approach for pulling europe 's largest economy out of recession .
such measures " make all the more sense when they are taken by all sides at the same time , " strauss-kahn said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel remains cautious over implementing further stimulus packages too soon he added that european economies would likely experience negative growth of 1 to 2 percent in 2009 , and that " the economic consequences will be truly hard for the little guy . "
merkel wary of budget deficit so far , merkel 's grand coalition government has announced a series of measures totaling up to 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion -rrb- to help spur economic growth .
but she has also faced calls from within the ranks of her own political bloc for the government to underpin the economy by cutting taxes .
instead , however , merkel and her government have refused to take action they consider rash to help germany limp through the current global crisis , especially measures that could lead to a deepening of the nation 's budget deficit .
new year 's resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will wait to see what the us does under barack obama , merkel hinted criticism of merkel 's so-far-modest attempts to shield germany from the global downturn has triggered a slump in her popularity , prompting the chancellor to tell business leaders tuesday , dec .
16 , they could expect a firmer response from the government early next year .
in the speech to the center for european economic research , a think-tank in mannheim , germany , she acknowledged the government 's stimulus package " might not suffice , " but hinted that she wanted to coordinate future efforts with the incoming us administration under barack obama , who takes office january 20 .
" we will take action again in january - another few billion could come together , " she told them amid press reports suggesting berlin would invest up to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- more to drag the economy out of its slump . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the stakes are high for steinmeier , who would like to become germany 's next chancellor . in parliamentary hearings on thursday , dec .
18 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuffed accusations in connection to the mission of two agents of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
steinmeier once again justified the mission of the two bnd agents who , at the time , were based at the french embassy with diplomatic passports .
he said that the bnd and the german government wanted to be able to gather their own information and not be forced to rely on outside sources .
steinmeier told the committee that at the time it was completely clear to all parties involved in the mission that the political guidelines stood and that germany was not taking part in the war .
" there is no reason for me to believe that the wishes of the government were either knowingly or unknowingly violated , " he added .
germany criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency during the launch of war in iraq germany , traditionally a strong us ally , came out strongly against the invasion of iraq .
yet in the five years since the war in iraq started , berlin has been criticized for becoming covertly involved in the us fight against islamist extremists .
there have been accusations that germany 's intelligence services were aware of cia kidnappings and prisoner renditions .
most recently , a top retired us military officer said that the united states relied on german intelligence during its invasion of iraq in 2003 .
due to his role as chief of staff for then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency , placing him at the center of the current accusations of aiding the us .
high stakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans have vocally opposed the war this is the fifth time steinmeier has been called before a parliamentary committee to testify about issues relating to germany 's participation in the us-led " war on terror . "
and the stakes for steinmeier have never been higher .
the social democratic party has chosen steinmeier to run against current chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the cdu and spd currently share power in an awkward coalition government .
both sides would like a decisive electoral victory next fall , which would allow them to ditch their current partners and form coalitions with other parties .
steinmeier 's party has made a campaign issue out of its opposition to the war in iraq .
it could be disastrous for social democrats if it now turns out that german spies were secretly funneling information to us counterparts to aid in the us invasion of iraq .

steinmeier told the committee that at the time it was completely clear to all parties involved in the mission that the political guidelines stood and that germany was not taking part in the war .
" there is no reason for me to believe that the wishes of the government were either knowingly or unknowingly violated , " he added .
germany criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency during the launch of war in iraq germany , traditionally a strong us ally , came out strongly against the invasion of iraq .
yet in the five years since the war in iraq started , berlin has been criticized for becoming covertly involved in the us fight against islamist extremists .
there have been accusations that germany 's intelligence services were aware of cia kidnappings and prisoner renditions .
most recently , a top retired us military officer said that the united states relied on german intelligence during its invasion of iraq in 2003 .
due to his role as chief of staff for then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , steinmeier was politically responsible for the german foreign intelligence agency , placing him at the center of the current accusations of aiding the us .
high stakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans have vocally opposed the war this is the fifth time steinmeier has been called before a parliamentary committee to testify about issues relating to germany 's participation in the us-led " war on terror . "
and the stakes for steinmeier have never been higher .
the social democratic party has chosen steinmeier to run against current chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the cdu and spd currently share power in an awkward coalition government .
both sides would like a decisive electoral victory next fall , which would allow them to ditch their current partners and form coalitions with other parties .
steinmeier 's party has made a campaign issue out of its opposition to the war in iraq .
it could be disastrous for social democrats if it now turns out that german spies were secretly funneling information to us counterparts to aid in the us invasion of iraq .
long list of questionable involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has denied knowing about secret cia flights steinmeier was first called to testify two years ago as part of a closed-door parliamentary enquiry into the kidnapping of khaled el-masri .
the german-lebanese man says he was imprisoned by us agents in december 2003 in macedonia and tortured in afghanistan before being released five months later .
in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german .
steinmeier denied knowing anything about el-masri 's case until after he had been freed .
at the time , steinmeier admitted that " sometimes , difficult decisions were necessary . "
but he denied that anything was done illegally .
" that was true in the past , " steinmeier said at the time .
" and i can promise you that it will also be true in the future . "
since then , there have been several other high-profile cases in which german citizens have claimed they have been kidnapped or tortured as part of us anti-terrorism efforts .
steinmeier has also been questioned about germany 's involvement in so-called rendition flights , in which the cia secretly transported people to countries for interrogation where they were possibly tortured .
steinmeier will face tough questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri claims claims he was tortured the committee was never able to determine whether or not germany knew about the el-masri kidnapping or any of the other cases .
until now , the german foreign minister has not experienced any political backlash from the various cases .
but that current round of questioning could prove to be the most challenging for steinmeier as he has to clarify the role of two german spies during the iraq war .
earlier this week , retired us general james marks said in an interview with der spiegel magazine that information provided by german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- spies stationed in baghdad was extremely important , detailed and useful to the united states .
" reports on the defensive positions in and around baghdad and the location of troops and weapons were important , " marks told the magazine .
" we trusted information from germany more than from the cia . "
the agents sent approximately 130 reports to their commanders in germany and appeared to be aware their intelligence was being forwarded to the americans , according to the spiegel report .
that news has outraged other politicians .
" he did not take adequate measures ensure that important information from baghdad would not be forwarded to the us headquarters , " said hans-christian stroebele of the green party .
officials in berlin continue to maintain that germany was not involved in the fighting of the iraq war .
" what foreign minster steinmeier has been saying from the beginning stands : germany had good reason to be against the iraq war and for that reason was not involved in combat operations , " foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany able to completely avoid becoming involved ?
steinmeier has defended himself by saying that the bnd did not provide " active support of combat operations , " but that the bnd did work to " avoid an embassy or hospital from being bombed , which has nothing to do with double standards but with saving innocent people 's lives . "
the spd has signaled that it will stand behind steinmeier .
thomas oppermann , who is a member of the spd and chairs the parliamentary committee overseeing intelligence issues , said that the interview with general marks was " manipulated . "
marks has also been invited to testify before the committee . dw staff -lrb- th , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the stakes are high for steinmeier , who would like to become germany 's next chancellor . in parliamentary hearings on thursday , dec .

their goal : to share experiences at conferences and improve access to files . a symbolic spot was chosen to sign the deal : the european house at the brandenburg gate .
until the end of 1989 , the berlin wall stood just a few meters away . for marianne birthler , the head of the federal commission for the records of the state security service of the former east germany , it was the fulfillment of a long-held dream : to deal with cold war secret police issues on an international basis . systematic cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film " the lives of others " helped explain the era to a new generation there has been contact between the countries in the past , but nothing systematic .
the european network - which will include the documentation agency of the east german stasi , as well as their counterparts in bulgaria , poland , romania , slovakia , the czech republic , and hungary - is expected to change all that . " one of our projects will be to provide information about our work in all seven countries , either via the internet or in printed form , " birthler said .
" of course , we will also host conferences .
there could even be a joint exhibition .
we 'll have to see . " different histories , different methods while birthler has plenty of plans , each country 's method of dealing with the issue is quite different . for example , in the czech republic , communist crimes have been under investigation since the mid-1990s , and access to files just became possible 10 months ago , according to miroslav lehky of the state security records agency in prague .
and compared with the germans , the czechs have many more files . " -lrb- we have files -rrb- not only from stasi , but all repressive state organizations from the communist state .
that includes military intelligence , civil intelligence , border guards .
now we have everything together , and can analyze it .
and of course we want to open everything , " said lehky . " i want to publish names " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives are accessible in berlin today bulgaria is also playing catch-up .
the records-historians there had to struggle for a long time before they got their own building .
now they have one .
it is slated to contain an archive of all the former secret agencies .
the goal of records-official evtim kostanidov , too , is to open up the archive to anyone who wants it . " another important job is to publish the names of those people who worked for the secret police , both officially and unofficially , " he said . for her part , birthler hopes the european network will help spark initiatives , particularly in post-communist countries that are n't part of the current group . an example for others " i could imagine that our cooperation would give strength to people who need it .
just the fact that we exist , and that we 're visible on the european level , " she said .
slovenia and the baltic states are the countries that jump to mind , she says .
at this point , she notes , they are all members of the eu . europe is reunited and free , birthler said , but europe would n't be europe without an understanding of its diverse and contradictory past . marcel fuerstenau -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a sign that the chill in relations between the alliance and the kremlin in the wake of the georgia conflict is starting to pass . the talks , labelled an " informal lunch , " will involve nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and russia 's ambassador to the alliance , dmitry rogozin , a nato official said on thursday , dec .
18 .
the meeting will be the first high-level gathering between russian and nato officials since august , when georgia and russia fought a short-lived but intense conflict over the breakaway georgian enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia .
as a result of that conflict , nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- talks were put on hold as tension was ratcheted up between the two parties over russia 's response to a georgian attempt to reassert its control over south ossetia .
although nrc technical and working-level talks were not interrupted , all meetings at the ambassadorial , ministerial and head-of-government levels have been frozen since the august war .
formal talks a possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : securing russian gas and oil is integral for security in europe , leaders say a handful of european governments - notable germany and france - have been eager to recommence high-level dialog with russia owing to its position as a major supplier of natural gas and oil to europe .
nato foreign ministers have tasked scheffer " to re-engage with russia at the political level " with a possible full return to formal talks once he reports back .
rogozin said he wanted all problematic issues between russia and nato to be " put on the table " so moscow could then decide whether it wanted to proceed with nrc meetings .
" i hope the secretary general will propose dates and themes for discussion and i will see with moscow if this is convenient , and then we will take a decision , " he told the afp news agency .
" everything has to be put on the table , " he said .
" it 's up to nato to correct its errors . "
mounting tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has vehemently opposed independence for kosovo tensions between russia and nato have been on the increase over several contentious matters , including kremlin anger at alliance pledges to absorb georgia and ukraine - both ex-soviet republics - into the 26-member bloc .
moscow views this as nato meddling in its traditional sphere of influence and as an attempt to box russia in .
russia has also strongly opposed independence from serbia for kosovo , which europe and nato have backed .
nato currently has a peacekeeping force in kosovo .
adding further fuel to the fire is a planned us anti-missile shield base which will see elements installed in poland and the czech republic .
moscow views this measure as a direct threat .
nato , meanwhile , has condemned russia 's recognition of the independence of the two breakaway georgian regions and views with distrust russian president dmitry medvedev 's proposal for a new european security pact , which the alliance believes is designed to negate the efficacy of nato . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a sign that the chill in relations between the alliance and the kremlin in the wake of the georgia conflict is starting to pass . the talks , labelled an " informal lunch , " will involve nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and russia 's ambassador to the alliance , dmitry rogozin , a nato official said on thursday , dec .
18 .
the meeting will be the first high-level gathering between russian and nato officials since august , when georgia and russia fought a short-lived but intense conflict over the breakaway georgian enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia .
as a result of that conflict , nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- talks were put on hold as tension was ratcheted up between the two parties over russia 's response to a georgian attempt to reassert its control over south ossetia .
although nrc technical and working-level talks were not interrupted , all meetings at the ambassadorial , ministerial and head-of-government levels have been frozen since the august war .
formal talks a possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : securing russian gas and oil is integral for security in europe , leaders say a handful of european governments - notable germany and france - have been eager to recommence high-level dialog with russia owing to its position as a major supplier of natural gas and oil to europe .
nato foreign ministers have tasked scheffer " to re-engage with russia at the political level " with a possible full return to formal talks once he reports back .
rogozin said he wanted all problematic issues between russia and nato to be " put on the table " so moscow could then decide whether it wanted to proceed with nrc meetings .
" i hope the secretary general will propose dates and themes for discussion and i will see with moscow if this is convenient , and then we will take a decision , " he told the afp news agency .

" it 's up to nato to correct its errors . "

their goal : to share experiences at conferences and improve access to files . a symbolic spot was chosen to sign the deal : the european house at the brandenburg gate .
until the end of 1989 , the berlin wall stood just a few meters away . for marianne birthler , the head of the federal commission for the records of the state security service of the former east germany , it was the fulfillment of a long-held dream : to deal with cold war secret police issues on an international basis . systematic cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film " the lives of others " helped explain the era to a new generation there has been contact between the countries in the past , but nothing systematic .
the european network - which will include the documentation agency of the east german stasi , as well as their counterparts in bulgaria , poland , romania , slovakia , the czech republic , and hungary - is expected to change all that . " one of our projects will be to provide information about our work in all seven countries , either via the internet or in printed form , " birthler said .
" of course , we will also host conferences .
there could even be a joint exhibition .
we 'll have to see . " different histories , different methods while birthler has plenty of plans , each country 's method of dealing with the issue is quite different . for example , in the czech republic , communist crimes have been under investigation since the mid-1990s , and access to files just became possible 10 months ago , according to miroslav lehky of the state security records agency in prague .
and compared with the germans , the czechs have many more files . " -lrb- we have files -rrb- not only from stasi , but all repressive state organizations from the communist state .
that includes military intelligence , civil intelligence , border guards .
now we have everything together , and can analyze it .
and of course we want to open everything , " said lehky . " i want to publish names " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives are accessible in berlin today bulgaria is also playing catch-up .
the records-historians there had to struggle for a long time before they got their own building .
now they have one .
it is slated to contain an archive of all the former secret agencies .
the goal of records-official evtim kostanidov , too , is to open up the archive to anyone who wants it . " another important job is to publish the names of those people who worked for the secret police , both officially and unofficially , " he said . for her part , birthler hopes the european network will help spark initiatives , particularly in post-communist countries that are n't part of the current group . an example for others " i could imagine that our cooperation would give strength to people who need it .
just the fact that we exist , and that we 're visible on the european level , " she said .
slovenia and the baltic states are the countries that jump to mind , she says .
at this point , she notes , they are all members of the eu . europe is reunited and free , birthler said , but europe would n't be europe without an understanding of its diverse and contradictory past . marcel fuerstenau -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the town 's mayor martin weale said he was in talks with " two well-known organisations " about staging a jazz event next summer in brecon .
mr weale said any new organisers would be entirely separate from the company which put on last summer 's spectacle .
the festival company has ceased trading after suffering a " substantial loss " .
mr weale , a powys county councillor , also claimed some of the event 's current sponsors had expressed an interest in supporting a new festival .

people in brecon react to the news that the jazz festival has had to call in the receivers however , he was reluctant to reveal any more about the ongoing talks .
mr weale added : " i am in talks with two different but well-known organisations .
both are established in this arena .
" the organisers of an event next summer would be entirely new and separate from the company which is sadly being wound up at the moment .
" i am very hopeful that something will happen in 2009 .
in fact , i 'd be disappointed if we did n't have a jazz festival in brecon next year .
" the scope of it is something i 'm not in a position to comment about at the moment . "
the company behind brecon jazz is being wound up , two months after telling creditors it was suspending payments .
its board blamed bad weather for poor ticket sales and said it " suffered a substantial financial loss " .
a creditors ' meeting has been called for 9 january , 2009 , and the festival company has ceased trading .
poor sales a statement from the company said although pre-event ticket sales were good , bad weather resulted in poor sales over the festival weekend .
a local hotel also pulled out as a venue which meant extra marquee and site costs .
organisers estimate that the weekend is worth £ 4m to the local economy .

earlier this month the two airlines had said they were in talks about joining forces through a dual-listed company .
in a joint statement the airlines said that despite the " potential longer term benefits " they had " not been able to come to an agreement " .
the two said they would continue to co-operate on their joint business between australia and the uk .
qantas chief executive alan joyce had warned last week that the merger faced major hurdles and would only go ahead if qantas could secure major revenue and cost benefits .
he also said he regretted the fact that news of the talks had become public knowledge .
merger obstacles a tie-up between ba and qantas faced several challenges , particularly over how ownership of the combined business would be divided between the two carriers . "
it was always going to be a difficult marriage and clearly there are a lot of pressures from outside the relationship that are being applied " ian thomas , capa consulting the idea was for the two airlines to come together as a dual-listed company - in both the uk and australia .
ba said in a statement on thursday that it would not agree to qantas owning more than 50 % of the combined firm - even though qantas is currently the larger company by market value .
under australian law , qantas must remain majority-owned by australian investors and its head office and major facilities must stay in australia .
other complications included ba 's pension-fund liabilities and also ba 's separate merger talks with spain 's iberia , as qantas had ruled out a three-way merger .
" it was always going to be a difficult marriage and clearly there are a lot of pressures from outside the relationship that are being applied - not least from iberia and also within qantas 's institutional base , " said ian thomas , of aviation consulting firm capa consulting .
despite calling off their talks , the two airlines will still work together as part of the 10-airline oneworld global alliance .
the prospect of consolidation in the airline sector has been fuelled by high oil prices and the prospect of a deep global recession .
ba recently announced a sharp fall in its half-year profits and said it was cutting services from its summer 2009 schedule .

earlier this month the two airlines had said they were in talks about joining forces through a dual-listed company .
in a joint statement the airlines said that despite the " potential longer term benefits " they had " not been able to come to an agreement " .
the two said they would continue to co-operate on their joint business between australia and the uk .
qantas chief executive alan joyce had warned last week that the merger faced major hurdles and would only go ahead if qantas could secure major revenue and cost benefits .
he also said he regretted the fact that news of the talks had become public knowledge .
merger obstacles a tie-up between ba and qantas faced several challenges , particularly over how ownership of the combined business would be divided between the two carriers .
it was always going to be a difficult marriage and clearly there are a lot of pressures from outside the relationship that are being applied ian thomas , capa consulting the idea was for the two airlines to come together as a dual-listed company - in both the uk and australia .
ba said in a statement on thursday that it would not agree to qantas owning more than 50 % of the combined firm - even though qantas is currently the larger company by market value .
under australian law , qantas must remain majority-owned by australian investors and its head office and major facilities must stay in australia .
other complications included ba 's pension-fund liabilities and also ba 's separate merger talks with spain 's iberia , as qantas had ruled out a three-way merger .
" it was always going to be a difficult marriage and clearly there are a lot of pressures from outside the relationship that are being applied - not least from iberia and also within qantas 's institutional base , " said ian thomas , of aviation consulting firm capa consulting .
despite calling off their talks , the two airlines will still work together as part of the 10-airline oneworld global alliance .
the prospect of consolidation in the airline sector has been fuelled by high oil prices and the prospect of a deep global recession .
ba recently announced a sharp fall in its half-year profits and said it was cutting services from its summer 2009 schedule .

the state 's top court did not give a reason for its refusal of attorney general lisa madigan 's request .
ms madigan had argued mr blagojevich was unfit to serve , due to his arrest for allegedly trying to sell president-elect barack obama 's senate seat .
mr blagojevich denies the claims , but is under intense pressure to resign .
a panel of state lawmakers are currently considering whether to recommend his impeachment .
meanwhile , mr blagojevich 's lawyer has said the governor does not intend to appoint anyone to mr obama 's vacant illinois senate seat as senate democrats say they will reject anyone he chooses .
as governor , mr blagojevich has the sole authority to pick mr obama 's temporary successor as senator until an election is held .
' unsustainable situation ' lisa madigan had gone to the supreme court with what she called an " extraordinary request " to remove mr blagojevich from office , arguing that he " can no longer fulfil his official duties with any legitimacy " .
the court denied the request without comment .
charges against blagojevich federal agents say mr blagojevich tried to obtain campaign contributions in exchange for official actions ; tried to use state funds for the private purpose of inducing the tribune company to fire chicago tribune editorial board members critical of him ; tried to obtain personal financial benefits for himself in return for his appointment of a us senator profile : rod blagojevich justin webb : why no special election ?
following the ruling , ms madigan said : " because of governor blagojevich 's refusal to resign , the state of illinois is in an unsustainable situation . "
mr blagojevich 's lawyer , edward genson , has appeared before a bipartisan panel of state lawmakers who will decide whether the governor should be impeached .
mr genson argued that transcripts of his client 's telephone conversations intercepted by court-authorised wiretaps amounted to " two months of somebody who obviously likes to talk a lot , but two months of nothing getting done " .
" there 's no evidence that anyone ever asked anybody for anything with regard to that -lsb- us senate -rsb- seat , " he said .
mr blagojevich was charged last week with a number of offences including soliciting a bribe .
the charges relate to a variety of corruption schemes in which the governor was allegedly involved , including so-called " pay to play " deals - the doling out of jobs , contracts and appointments in return for campaign contributions .
in the conversations , the democratic governor allegedly discussed offering mr obama 's senate seat in return for a well-paid position at a non-profit organisation or a group affiliated with trades unions , according to the affidavit .

the kit is the offspring of tv stars twiggy and woody , who starred in the bbc 's autumnwatch programme in 2007 .

advertisement the beaver has been looked after by wardens a baby beaver thought to be the first hand-reared in the uk has been nursed back to health by experts at a lancashire wildlife centre .
the six-month-old unnamed beaver was found with serious injuries when he was only just weeks old .
wardens at the martin mere wildlife centre , in burscough , nursed the young beaver , known as a kit , back to health .
the kit is the offspring of tv stars twiggy and woody , who starred in the bbc 's autumnwatch programme in 2007 .
' quirky personality ' a martin mere spokeswoman said : " he was very poorly and without our intervention he would have died . "
she said it was unclear how he sustained his injuries .
wardens created a specially-designed enclosure for the kit and put him on a course of antibiotics .
he has since made a speedy recovery .
staff said the kit had a " quirky " personality and loved to play with a toy beaver and throw it in the water .
his favourite foods , they said , include sweetcorn and sweet potato .
from 20 december visitors to the west lancashire wildlife centre will be able to see the young kit via a live camera link in his enclosure .
andy wooldridge , martin mere manager , said : " we are delighted with his progress and it is a joy to see his character develop . "

media requires javascript to play .
advertisement ambulance workers : ' we 're in meltdown ' a growing number of ambulance services in england say the cold start to the month and outbreaks of illness have created unprecedented levels of calls .
some say staff are struggling to cope and are urging people to dial 999 only in a genuine emergency .
london ambulance service said last week was the busiest in its history .
the north west has also seen record calls .
the health secretary said circumstances were " very difficult , " but staff were working " very hard " to cope with them .
so far , this december has been the coldest for 30 years in many parts of britain .
' horrendous ' this has caused a sharp increase in falls and breathing problems and has combined with outbreaks of flu and the winter vomiting bug norovirus to create the high level of demand .
ambulance services say this has put pressure on hospital beds , often slowing down ambulances needing to offload patients and move on to attend new emergency calls .

" staff are tired and also sickness levels are increasing as they themselves become the victim of the norovirus and other stomach bugs that are around . "

nonetheless the system is coping . "
