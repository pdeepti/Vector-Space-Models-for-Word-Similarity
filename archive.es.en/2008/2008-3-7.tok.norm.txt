program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 07.03.2008 conservatives , greens edge toward state coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green light for a " black-green " alliance is a first in germany as a former german president called for constitutional changes to ensure stable coalition governments , traditional rivals in the green and conservative camps said they would work to reach a power-sharing deal in hamburg . german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- confirmed on thursday , march 6 , that it is ready to open negotiations with the green party with the aim of forming a first ever " black-green " coalition in the port city of hamburg . " we still have differences of opinion but they can be bridged , " michael freytag , the cdu 's regional head , said on thursday after the party 's board agreed to open talks with the greens .
the move highlights the conservatives ' preference to work with the greens instead of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unlikely marriage - the greens ' christa goetsch with the cdu 's von beust talk of the unusual alliance first erupted when a feb .
24 election in the city failed to provide a clear parliamentary majority for the cdu after their traditional partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , did not surpass the 5-percent hurdle to get into parliament . unusual bedfellows after seven hours of exploratory talks on wednesday , the two parties announced they had discovered " much common ground . " however , several green members have resisted the idea of teaming up with the cdu , a traditional political adversary , and the subject has prompted much soul-searching in the ecologically minded party .
although there is a degree of common ground between the two parties , for example , in certain economic policies and in their appeal to the well-heeled - they still differ substantially on many issues . in hamburg , the parties are split on several major issues , including a proposal to deepen the elbe river to prepare germany 's biggest port for a new generation of container ships and the planned construction of a new coal-fired power station that would be the largest of its kind in the country .
the greens oppose both projects on environmental grounds . the green party in the city-state of hamburg , where it goes by the name gal , signaled on thursday that they were prepared to enter negotiations for a " black-green " coalition with the conservatives in hamburg . gal party chief , anja hajduk said the cdu was willing to soften its position on the new coal-fired power station and was open for an alternative . former president calls for changes to constitution the mold-breaking tie-up between the greens and the conservatives is n't the only new political grouping on the german political landscape .
a steady decline in support for germany 's two biggest parties , the cdu and the spd , have led to the rise of parties like the far-left " die linke " which has made it tougher to form stable governments both at the federal and state level and led to new and risky political constellations . the development prompted former german president roman herzog on thursday to call for changes to germany 's constitution to counter the rise of fringe parties he said risked spawning unstable coalitions reminiscent of the weimar republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog is the first major german figure to call for a change to the constitution to deter fringe parties herzog , who served as german president from 1994 to 1999 , wrote in thursday 's sueddeutsche zeitung daily that germany was witnessing a fundamental shift in its system of government and suggested that its constitution , or " basic law , " which dates back to 1949 , should be adapted . " it will become increasingly difficult to form stable majorities and keep them together , " herzog wrote .
" it is clear that the danger of minority governments will rise . " the rise of the greens in the 1980s and more recently " die linke , " or left party - a grouping of ex-communists and western german spd deserters - means that five parties regularly clear the 5-percent hurdle , complicating the formation of political majorities . herzog said germans would not accept a british winner-takes-all approach , but added that french rules calling for candidates to win absolute majorities , which often leads to run-off elections , may be a good idea . the current german system requires the top party in any given election to form a majority in parliament , if necessary in coalition with another party or parties , to take power . rules put in place after world war two require parties to pass the five percent support threshold to enter parliament . herzog 's suggestion , the first proposal by an influential german politician to change the constitution because of fringe parties , was rejected by the cdu and spd , as well as opposition parties . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it wo n't be in the form of the traditional iron cross , said the government . president horst koehler has " approved in principle " a proposal by defense minister franz josef jung to introduce the new military honor , the presidential spokesman said thursday , march 6 . germany over the last half a century has awarded military decorations for special achievement , length of duty and for tours lasting over 30 days , but no medals for bravery have been given since world war ii . there was no word as to when the new medal would be introduced , what it would look like or what the criteria would be to receive it . no plans to resurrect iron cross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iron cross , seen here next to the german flag , is the bundeswehr 's official emblem the defense ministry , however , said on thursday that it would not resemble the iron cross - a wartime decoration introduced by prussian emperor friedrich wilhelm iii in 1813 .
the symbol was later adopted by the nazis , who combined it with a swastika . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , conservative parliamentarian ernst-reinhard beck had recommended modeling the new medal on the iron cross .
beck , a member of angela merkel 's christian democratic union , is also head of germany 's army reservists association . " we should reclaim the positive side of this symbol now that the war has been over for more than 60 years and that the bundeswehr has , over half a century , established a tradition which has nothing to do with the nazi era , " said beck . he conceded that the iron cross is associated with the world wars but said it could also serve as a " symbol of hope . " the design is still used today as the german military 's national emblem and appears on aircraft and tanks . defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe said there was no thought of bringing back the iron cross , " not only because of its third reich connotations , but because it was awarded for war service and we are not a nation at war .

he added that he did n't have anything against rewarding soldiers for special achievements where bravery was also displayed , but that these types of medals already existed . the proposal for the medal comes as germany 's participation in international peacekeeping mission has increased in recent years .

it 's now set to reopen friday , march 7 with a concert starring clarinetist giora feidman playing jewish klezmer music . the foundation stone was laid in 1935 , but the gigantic oval building on dutzendteich lake , modeled on the coliseum in rome , but 25 percent bigger , was never finished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl filmed " triumph of the will " in nuremberg the building was part of the nazi rally grounds where hitler held his massive military parades during the third reich .
it memorably featured as a backdrop in leni riefenstahl 's propaganda documentary " triumph of the will , " which was commissioned by hitler as a chronicle of the 1934 nazi party congress . today , its outer walls surround a field of weeds , which nuremberg kept as a warning against fascism for future generations . but two completed annex buildings have since been remodeled , both symbolically broken open with walls and ceilings of glass . one opened in 2000 as a museum documenting the atrocities of the third reich . a venue reborn the other has been revamped as a concert hall with over 500 seats in a redevelopment which took 14 months and cost some 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.9 million -rrb- . it is set to open friday with an inaugural performance by the clarinetist giora feidman , who specializes in jewish music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giora feidman in 2010 , the venue will become the new home of the nuremberg symphony orchestra .
until then it will serve as a temporary venue for the city 's state theater while its own premises are redeveloped . the orchestra has been using the southern wing of the building , which has not been renovated , since 1963 for its rehearsals . the burden of history the city has spent years debating whether to keep the vast neo-classicist park built by the nazis for displays of mass loyalty to dictator adolf hitler or to tear it down . ultimately , it was decided to use one annex for music as a deliberate counterpoint to the nazi cult of violence . in german history , the city is inextricably tied to the third reich .
nuremberg was chosen by the nazis as the center of their " aryan " world , with hitler conferring upon nuremberg the title " city of the party rallies . " up to a million party members would travel to nuremberg for the week-long rallies , and it was here that " der führer " gave many of his speeches on the supposed superiority of the aryan race . the city was also home to the nuremberg trials , which tried nazi leaders for crimes against humanity after world war ii . bildunterschrift : banishing the ghosts of the past dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will not stand for election on april 5 , as i can not guarantee a majority , " ypsilanti told reporters on friday , march 7 , ditching a controversial plan to build a minority alliance with the green party tolerated by germany 's far-left party in the western state of hesse .
the move amounted to ypsilanti going back on a pledge not to work with the grouping of ex-communists and leftist social democrat deserters from western germany . “ we can not take this path , since there are parliamentarians with us that will not go down this path , ” ypsilanti said in a statement . earlier , a renegade spd member in hesse 's state legislature , dagmar metzger , had made it clear that she would not back a deal with the left party which is considered by many in the spd as being unreliable and populist . after a deadlocked state election on jan .
27 , hesse was left scrambling to form a government .
both the spd and incumbent premier roland koch 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- won 42 seats each in the 110-seat legislature . cdu to seek other partners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch is looking for new friends spd head kurt beck had given ypsilanti the green light to pursue a cooperation with the left party , sparking a uproar in social democratic ranks .
the move also raised questions about beck 's credibility and his presumed bid to challenge chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal election . ypsilanti said earlier in the week that her decision to break with pre-election promises not to rely on the left party for votes had been " very , very difficult " for her . koch had urged the spd to consider a " grand coalition " together with the conservatives , similar to chancellor angela merkel 's model at the federal level .
he said friday that his conservative party would seek coalition talks with the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the greens , which have 11 and nine seats respectively in the state legislature . the greens have so far ruled out a coalition with the conservatives . neither of the two major parties can attain a majority of 56 seats with just one partner , but would need to get either the left party or the greens on board as well . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we still have differences of opinion but they can be bridged , " michael freytag , the cdu 's regional head , said on thursday after the party 's board agreed to open talks with the greens .
the move highlights the conservatives ' preference to work with the greens instead of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unlikely marriage - the greens ' christa goetsch with the cdu 's von beust talk of the unusual alliance first erupted when a feb .
24 election in the city failed to provide a clear parliamentary majority for the cdu after their traditional partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , did not surpass the 5-percent hurdle to get into parliament . unusual bedfellows after seven hours of exploratory talks on wednesday , the two parties announced they had discovered " much common ground . " however , several green members have resisted the idea of teaming up with the cdu , a traditional political adversary , and the subject has prompted much soul-searching in the ecologically minded party .
although there is a degree of common ground between the two parties , for example , in certain economic policies and in their appeal to the well-heeled - they still differ substantially on many issues . in hamburg , the parties are split on several major issues , including a proposal to deepen the elbe river to prepare germany 's biggest port for a new generation of container ships and the planned construction of a new coal-fired power station that would be the largest of its kind in the country .
the greens oppose both projects on environmental grounds . the green party in the city-state of hamburg , where it goes by the name gal , signaled on thursday that they were prepared to enter negotiations for a " black-green " coalition with the conservatives in hamburg . gal party chief , anja hajduk said the cdu was willing to soften its position on the new coal-fired power station and was open for an alternative . former president calls for changes to constitution the mold-breaking tie-up between the greens and the conservatives is n't the only new political grouping on the german political landscape .
a steady decline in support for germany 's two biggest parties , the cdu and the spd , have led to the rise of parties like the far-left " die linke " which has made it tougher to form stable governments both at the federal and state level and led to new and risky political constellations . the development prompted former german president roman herzog on thursday to call for changes to germany 's constitution to counter the rise of fringe parties he said risked spawning unstable coalitions reminiscent of the weimar republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog is the first major german figure to call for a change to the constitution to deter fringe parties herzog , who served as german president from 1994 to 1999 , wrote in thursday 's sueddeutsche zeitung daily that germany was witnessing a fundamental shift in its system of government and suggested that its constitution , or " basic law , " which dates back to 1949 , should be adapted .

" fitna " was produced by geert wilders , leader of the dutch freedom party and the netherlands ' most outspoken critic of islam . in the past , wilders has deemed the quran incompatible with dutch values .
he recently said his film will show how the muslim holy book is " an inspiration for intolerance , murder and terror . " " fitna " is an arabic term used in the quran usually translated as " strife " or " discord . " damaging dutch political and economic interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders said he had hoped for his film to be broadcast on dutch tv the dutch government has warned that the film might spark unrest and sanctions similar to those triggered when danish newspapers published a cartoon of the prophet mohammad in 2006 . on friday , prime minister jan peter balkenende warned wilders that the release of his film could have " far-reaching security consequences " and even " deaths , " calling on him to take responsibility for the possible consequences of the film . foreign minister maxime verhagen has met ambassadors from muslim countries to discuss the matter , emphasizing that the government does not share wilders ' views .
he asked them to make sure that dutch citizens and buildings abroad are protected . nato , meanwhile , is believed to be concerned about the safety of its troops in afghanistan after hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of mazar-i-sharif earlier in the week in protest .
the crowds set fire to dutch flags and called for the immediate withdrawal of the dutch army from afghanistan . " i fear that soldiers will come under fire because of this film , and i am not afraid to say so , " said nato general secretary jaap de hoop . various dutch employers ' associations and employees unions , as well as representatives of the protestant church have also urged wilders not to release the film . security measures the dutch counter-terrorism agency said in a report to parliament thursday that the new threat assessment was also influenced by arrests elsewhere in europe that had thwarted attacks by groups directed or influenced by al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan . the last time the threat level was this high was after an islamic militant killed director theo van gogh in 2004 over a film he made accusing islam of condoning violence against women . the netherlands has a four-stage risk classification system .
the lowest is " minimal , " the highest is " critical . " the counter-terrorism agency cut the threat level to the second-lowest " limited " last april , reported reuters , citing little fresh activity by militant networks in the country and growing resistance to radicalization among the one million muslims in the netherlands . in its new report , the agency noted that the country 's main muslim organizations had called for calm in response to the wilders film . stoking tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are dutch troops at risk wilders is expected to release the film on march 28 at the government press center in the hague , where security measures are already in place . in an interview dutch newspaper nrc handelsblad thursday , wilders said he was disappointed that no dutch broadcaster had been willing to show it . " i had hoped that a television broadcaster would say : ' you have the right to do this , we will give you a podium , " ' he said . " fitna " will also be made available online . a majority of dutch people want the film to be broadcast even though they fear it will stoke tension with muslims and harm relations with arab nations , a poll showed on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it wo n't be in the form of the traditional iron cross , said the government . president horst koehler has " approved in principle " a proposal by defense minister franz josef jung to introduce the new military honor , the presidential spokesman said thursday , march 6 . germany over the last half a century has awarded military decorations for special achievement , length of duty and for tours lasting over 30 days , but no medals for bravery have been given since world war ii . there was no word as to when the new medal would be introduced , what it would look like or what the criteria would be to receive it . no plans to resurrect iron cross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iron cross , seen here next to the german flag , is the bundeswehr 's official emblem the defense ministry , however , said on thursday that it would not resemble the iron cross - a wartime decoration introduced by prussian emperor friedrich wilhelm iii in 1813 .
the symbol was later adopted by the nazis , who combined it with a swastika . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , conservative parliamentarian ernst-reinhard beck had recommended modeling the new medal on the iron cross .
beck , a member of angela merkel 's christian democratic union , is also head of germany 's army reservists association . " we should reclaim the positive side of this symbol now that the war has been over for more than 60 years and that the bundeswehr has , over half a century , established a tradition which has nothing to do with the nazi era , " said beck . he conceded that the iron cross is associated with the world wars but said it could also serve as a " symbol of hope . " the design is still used today as the german military 's national emblem and appears on aircraft and tanks . defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe said there was no thought of bringing back the iron cross , " not only because of its third reich connotations , but because it was awarded for war service and we are not a nation at war . " medal plan meets opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 german troops are stationed abroad some left-wing politicians have spoken out against introducing any kind of bravery medal for soldiers . " german history has shown us that whenever soldiery was celebrated in society with monuments and honors , it was often a harbinger of germany 's involvement in wars , " said paul schaefer , a defense policy spokesman for the left party . a defense expert from the social democratic party , rainer arnold , told the friday edition of the märkische allgemeine zeitung that a military honor should n't be reduced to courage alone .
he added that he did n't have anything against rewarding soldiers for special achievements where bravery was also displayed , but that these types of medals already existed . the proposal for the medal comes as germany 's participation in international peacekeeping mission has increased in recent years .
it currently has 9,000 troops stations abroad in 10 separate missions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's now set to reopen friday , march 7 with a concert starring clarinetist giora feidman playing jewish klezmer music . the foundation stone was laid in 1935 , but the gigantic oval building on dutzendteich lake , modeled on the coliseum in rome , but 25 percent bigger , was never finished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl filmed " triumph of the will " in nuremberg the building was part of the nazi rally grounds where hitler held his massive military parades during the third reich .
it memorably featured as a backdrop in leni riefenstahl 's propaganda documentary " triumph of the will , " which was commissioned by hitler as a chronicle of the 1934 nazi party congress . today , its outer walls surround a field of weeds , which nuremberg kept as a warning against fascism for future generations . but two completed annex buildings have since been remodeled , both symbolically broken open with walls and ceilings of glass . one opened in 2000 as a museum documenting the atrocities of the third reich . a venue reborn the other has been revamped as a concert hall with over 500 seats in a redevelopment which took 14 months and cost some 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.9 million -rrb- . it is set to open friday with an inaugural performance by the clarinetist giora feidman , who specializes in jewish music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giora feidman in 2010 , the venue will become the new home of the nuremberg symphony orchestra .
until then it will serve as a temporary venue for the city 's state theater while its own premises are redeveloped . the orchestra has been using the southern wing of the building , which has not been renovated , since 1963 for its rehearsals . the burden of history the city has spent years debating whether to keep the vast neo-classicist park built by the nazis for displays of mass loyalty to dictator adolf hitler or to tear it down . ultimately , it was decided to use one annex for music as a deliberate counterpoint to the nazi cult of violence . in german history , the city is inextricably tied to the third reich .
nuremberg was chosen by the nazis as the center of their " aryan " world , with hitler conferring upon nuremberg the title " city of the party rallies . " up to a million party members would travel to nuremberg for the week-long rallies , and it was here that " der führer " gave many of his speeches on the supposed superiority of the aryan race . the city was also home to the nuremberg trials , which tried nazi leaders for crimes against humanity after world war ii . bildunterschrift : banishing the ghosts of the past dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will not stand for election on april 5 , as i can not guarantee a majority , " ypsilanti told reporters on friday , march 7 , ditching a controversial plan to build a minority alliance with the green party tolerated by germany 's far-left party in the western state of hesse .
the move amounted to ypsilanti going back on a pledge not to work with the grouping of ex-communists and leftist social democrat deserters from western germany . “ we can not take this path , since there are parliamentarians with us that will not go down this path , ” ypsilanti said in a statement . earlier , a renegade spd member in hesse 's state legislature , dagmar metzger , had made it clear that she would not back a deal with the left party which is considered by many in the spd as being unreliable and populist . after a deadlocked state election on jan .

the move also raised questions about beck 's credibility and his presumed bid to challenge chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal election . ypsilanti said earlier in the week that her decision to break with pre-election promises not to rely on the left party for votes had been " very , very difficult " for her . koch had urged the spd to consider a " grand coalition " together with the conservatives , similar to chancellor angela merkel 's model at the federal level .
he said friday that his conservative party would seek coalition talks with the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the greens , which have 11 and nine seats respectively in the state legislature . the greens have so far ruled out a coalition with the conservatives . neither of the two major parties can attain a majority of 56 seats with just one partner , but would need to get either the left party or the greens on board as well . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" fitna " was produced by geert wilders , leader of the dutch freedom party and the netherlands ' most outspoken critic of islam . in the past , wilders has deemed the quran incompatible with dutch values .
he recently said his film will show how the muslim holy book is " an inspiration for intolerance , murder and terror . " " fitna " is an arabic term used in the quran usually translated as " strife " or " discord . " damaging dutch political and economic interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders said he had hoped for his film to be broadcast on dutch tv the dutch government has warned that the film might spark unrest and sanctions similar to those triggered when danish newspapers published a cartoon of the prophet mohammad in 2006 . on friday , prime minister jan peter balkenende warned wilders that the release of his film could have " far-reaching security consequences " and even " deaths , " calling on him to take responsibility for the possible consequences of the film . foreign minister maxime verhagen has met ambassadors from muslim countries to discuss the matter , emphasizing that the government does not share wilders ' views .
he asked them to make sure that dutch citizens and buildings abroad are protected . nato , meanwhile , is believed to be concerned about the safety of its troops in afghanistan after hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of mazar-i-sharif earlier in the week in protest .
the crowds set fire to dutch flags and called for the immediate withdrawal of the dutch army from afghanistan . " i fear that soldiers will come under fire because of this film , and i am not afraid to say so , " said nato general secretary jaap de hoop . various dutch employers ' associations and employees unions , as well as representatives of the protestant church have also urged wilders not to release the film . security measures the dutch counter-terrorism agency said in a report to parliament thursday that the new threat assessment was also influenced by arrests elsewhere in europe that had thwarted attacks by groups directed or influenced by al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan . the last time the threat level was this high was after an islamic militant killed director theo van gogh in 2004 over a film he made accusing islam of condoning violence against women . the netherlands has a four-stage risk classification system .
the lowest is " minimal , " the highest is " critical . " the counter-terrorism agency cut the threat level to the second-lowest " limited " last april , reported reuters , citing little fresh activity by militant networks in the country and growing resistance to radicalization among the one million muslims in the netherlands . in its new report , the agency noted that the country 's main muslim organizations had called for calm in response to the wilders film . stoking tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are dutch troops at risk wilders is expected to release the film on march 28 at the government press center in the hague , where security measures are already in place . in an interview dutch newspaper nrc handelsblad thursday , wilders said he was disappointed that no dutch broadcaster had been willing to show it . " i had hoped that a television broadcaster would say : ' you have the right to do this , we will give you a podium , " ' he said . " fitna " will also be made available online . a majority of dutch people want the film to be broadcast even though they fear it will stoke tension with muslims and harm relations with arab nations , a poll showed on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seperately , pay talks collapsed between public sector employers and unions . deutsche bahn on friday said it had gone to court in a bid to block the threatened strike on national and suburban networks by train drivers ' union , gdl . a spokesman said deutsche bahn has lodged a complaint with the labor court in frankfurt and was expecting a ruling on monday morning .
this dispute is not about pay , but demarcation between the trade unions .
drivers organized in a small union , the gdl , are planning to shut down all passenger and freight operations , if deutsche bahn does not grant them a separate labor contract , with no right of veto held by larger unions.gdl has staged a series of warning strikes since summer , but is frustrated that agreements the union made with deutsche bahn afterwards have yet to be finalized .
deutsche bahn said earlier friday it had devised a back-up plan to limit the fallout and promised that at least half of normal trains should run on monday even if gdl went ahead with the strike .
deutsche bahn has been backed by the big unions , which traditionally depend on the drivers ' strength to win pay rises for cleaners and clerks .

schaeuble said the stand-off came because unions refused to budge over public bodies ' demands for longer working hours .
employers had offered to gradually raise pay by 5 percent over two years , if weekly working hours rise from 38.5 to 40 .
" this is not acceptable , " verdi chief frank bsirske told a press conference .
" we did not see progress on an offer .
we were told to accept an extension of the working week as a pre-condition for an improved offer . "

it wo n't be in the form of the traditional iron cross , said the government . president horst koehler has " approved in principle " a proposal by defense minister franz josef jung to introduce the new military honor , the presidential spokesman said thursday , march 6 . germany over the last half a century has awarded military decorations for special achievement , length of duty and for tours lasting over 30 days , but no medals for bravery have been given since world war ii . there was no word as to when the new medal would be introduced , what it would look like or what the criteria would be to receive it . no plans to resurrect iron cross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iron cross , seen here next to the german flag , is the bundeswehr 's official emblem the defense ministry , however , said on thursday that it would not resemble the iron cross - a wartime decoration introduced by prussian emperor friedrich wilhelm iii in 1813 .
the symbol was later adopted by the nazis , who combined it with a swastika . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , conservative parliamentarian ernst-reinhard beck had recommended modeling the new medal on the iron cross .
beck , a member of angela merkel 's christian democratic union , is also head of germany 's army reservists association . " we should reclaim the positive side of this symbol now that the war has been over for more than 60 years and that the bundeswehr has , over half a century , established a tradition which has nothing to do with the nazi era , " said beck . he conceded that the iron cross is associated with the world wars but said it could also serve as a " symbol of hope . " the design is still used today as the german military 's national emblem and appears on aircraft and tanks . defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe said there was no thought of bringing back the iron cross , " not only because of its third reich connotations , but because it was awarded for war service and we are not a nation at war . " medal plan meets opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 german troops are stationed abroad some left-wing politicians have spoken out against introducing any kind of bravery medal for soldiers . " german history has shown us that whenever soldiery was celebrated in society with monuments and honors , it was often a harbinger of germany 's involvement in wars , " said paul schaefer , a defense policy spokesman for the left party . a defense expert from the social democratic party , rainer arnold , told the friday edition of the märkische allgemeine zeitung that a military honor should n't be reduced to courage alone .
he added that he did n't have anything against rewarding soldiers for special achievements where bravery was also displayed , but that these types of medals already existed . the proposal for the medal comes as germany 's participation in international peacekeeping mission has increased in recent years .
it currently has 9,000 troops stations abroad in 10 separate missions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it wo n't be in the form of the traditional iron cross , said the government . president horst koehler has " approved in principle " a proposal by defense minister franz josef jung to introduce the new military honor , the presidential spokesman said thursday , march 6 . germany over the last half a century has awarded military decorations for special achievement , length of duty and for tours lasting over 30 days , but no medals for bravery have been given since world war ii . there was no word as to when the new medal would be introduced , what it would look like or what the criteria would be to receive it . no plans to resurrect iron cross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iron cross , seen here next to the german flag , is the bundeswehr 's official emblem the defense ministry , however , said on thursday that it would not resemble the iron cross - a wartime decoration introduced by prussian emperor friedrich wilhelm iii in 1813 .
the symbol was later adopted by the nazis , who combined it with a swastika . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , conservative parliamentarian ernst-reinhard beck had recommended modeling the new medal on the iron cross .
beck , a member of angela merkel 's christian democratic union , is also head of germany 's army reservists association . " we should reclaim the positive side of this symbol now that the war has been over for more than 60 years and that the bundeswehr has , over half a century , established a tradition which has nothing to do with the nazi era , " said beck . he conceded that the iron cross is associated with the world wars but said it could also serve as a " symbol of hope . " the design is still used today as the german military 's national emblem and appears on aircraft and tanks . defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe said there was no thought of bringing back the iron cross , " not only because of its third reich connotations , but because it was awarded for war service and we are not a nation at war . " medal plan meets opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 german troops are stationed abroad some left-wing politicians have spoken out against introducing any kind of bravery medal for soldiers . " german history has shown us that whenever soldiery was celebrated in society with monuments and honors , it was often a harbinger of germany 's involvement in wars , " said paul schaefer , a defense policy spokesman for the left party . a defense expert from the social democratic party , rainer arnold , told the friday edition of the märkische allgemeine zeitung that a military honor should n't be reduced to courage alone .
he added that he did n't have anything against rewarding soldiers for special achievements where bravery was also displayed , but that these types of medals already existed . the proposal for the medal comes as germany 's participation in international peacekeeping mission has increased in recent years .
it currently has 9,000 troops stations abroad in 10 separate missions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will not stand for election on april 5 , as i can not guarantee a majority , " ypsilanti told reporters on friday , march 7 , ditching a controversial plan to build a minority alliance with the green party tolerated by germany 's far-left party in the western state of hesse .
the move amounted to ypsilanti going back on a pledge not to work with the grouping of ex-communists and leftist social democrat deserters from western germany . “ we can not take this path , since there are parliamentarians with us that will not go down this path , ” ypsilanti said in a statement . earlier , a renegade spd member in hesse 's state legislature , dagmar metzger , had made it clear that she would not back a deal with the left party which is considered by many in the spd as being unreliable and populist . after a deadlocked state election on jan .
27 , hesse was left scrambling to form a government .
both the spd and incumbent premier roland koch 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- won 42 seats each in the 110-seat legislature . cdu to seek other partners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch is looking for new friends spd head kurt beck had given ypsilanti the green light to pursue a cooperation with the left party , sparking a uproar in social democratic ranks .
the move also raised questions about beck 's credibility and his presumed bid to challenge chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal election . ypsilanti said earlier in the week that her decision to break with pre-election promises not to rely on the left party for votes had been " very , very difficult " for her . koch had urged the spd to consider a " grand coalition " together with the conservatives , similar to chancellor angela merkel 's model at the federal level .
he said friday that his conservative party would seek coalition talks with the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the greens , which have 11 and nine seats respectively in the state legislature . the greens have so far ruled out a coalition with the conservatives . neither of the two major parties can attain a majority of 56 seats with just one partner , but would need to get either the left party or the greens on board as well . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seperately , pay talks collapsed between public sector employers and unions . deutsche bahn on friday said it had gone to court in a bid to block the threatened strike on national and suburban networks by train drivers ' union , gdl . a spokesman said deutsche bahn has lodged a complaint with the labor court in frankfurt and was expecting a ruling on monday morning .
this dispute is not about pay , but demarcation between the trade unions .
drivers organized in a small union , the gdl , are planning to shut down all passenger and freight operations , if deutsche bahn does not grant them a separate labor contract , with no right of veto held by larger unions.gdl has staged a series of warning strikes since summer , but is frustrated that agreements the union made with deutsche bahn afterwards have yet to be finalized .
deutsche bahn said earlier friday it had devised a back-up plan to limit the fallout and promised that at least half of normal trains should run on monday even if gdl went ahead with the strike .
deutsche bahn has been backed by the big unions , which traditionally depend on the drivers ' strength to win pay rises for cleaners and clerks .
an earlier deal with deutsche bahn , which was struck after a dispute lasting almost a year , has come unstuck .
db has chartered engines and drivers from other railways companies to haul essential goods trains supplying factories next week .
offer " not acceptable " separately , top government negotiator , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , said public sector employers had called off pay talks with services union , verdi in potsdam near berlin .
the next step will be to take the dispute to arbitration , via a mediation procedure prescribed by german labor law .
schaeuble said the stand-off came because unions refused to budge over public bodies ' demands for longer working hours .
employers had offered to gradually raise pay by 5 percent over two years , if weekly working hours rise from 38.5 to 40 .
" this is not acceptable , " verdi chief frank bsirske told a press conference .
" we did not see progress on an offer .
we were told to accept an extension of the working week as a pre-condition for an improved offer . "
stepping up pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the train strikes are causing chaos against a backdrop of slackening economic growth , unions are pushing to secure wage gains for the low paid sectors before the next round of belt tightening .
verdi and other unions have been stepping up pressure in recent weeks , with nurses , refuse collectors , airport workers , administrative staff and childcare professionals participating in rolling strikes .
verdi is fighting to get an 8 percent increase in salary or an additional 200 euros -lrb- $ 300 -rrb- per month .
in a second conflict currently raging in the capital , verdi 's public transport workers continued an unlimited strike for a third day , and are gearing up for an all-out strike next week .
berlin 's underground transit train system came to a standstill , and only 100 out of 1200 city buses continued to operate .
the strikes caused chaos amongst commuters , who were forced to walk or use cars and taxis .
government appeals to unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union are demanding an 8 percent pay rise for employees in public services the german government appealed friday to the train drivers and deutsche bahn to think twice about an all-out confrontation and the rail strike next week .
" the renewed escalation is difficult to sympathize with , " said ulrich wilhelm , chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman .
he appealed to the company , which is owned by berlin but independently managed , and the gdl drivers ' union to end their dispute for the sake of other employees , rail customers and the germany economy .
" the minister appeals to both parties to leave no stone unturned to avoid a strike .

" fitna " was produced by geert wilders , leader of the dutch freedom party and the netherlands ' most outspoken critic of islam . in the past , wilders has deemed the quran incompatible with dutch values .
he recently said his film will show how the muslim holy book is " an inspiration for intolerance , murder and terror . " " fitna " is an arabic term used in the quran usually translated as " strife " or " discord . " damaging dutch political and economic interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders said he had hoped for his film to be broadcast on dutch tv the dutch government has warned that the film might spark unrest and sanctions similar to those triggered when danish newspapers published a cartoon of the prophet mohammad in 2006 . on friday , prime minister jan peter balkenende warned wilders that the release of his film could have " far-reaching security consequences " and even " deaths , " calling on him to take responsibility for the possible consequences of the film . foreign minister maxime verhagen has met ambassadors from muslim countries to discuss the matter , emphasizing that the government does not share wilders ' views .
he asked them to make sure that dutch citizens and buildings abroad are protected . nato , meanwhile , is believed to be concerned about the safety of its troops in afghanistan after hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of mazar-i-sharif earlier in the week in protest .
the crowds set fire to dutch flags and called for the immediate withdrawal of the dutch army from afghanistan . " i fear that soldiers will come under fire because of this film , and i am not afraid to say so , " said nato general secretary jaap de hoop . various dutch employers ' associations and employees unions , as well as representatives of the protestant church have also urged wilders not to release the film . security measures the dutch counter-terrorism agency said in a report to parliament thursday that the new threat assessment was also influenced by arrests elsewhere in europe that had thwarted attacks by groups directed or influenced by al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan . the last time the threat level was this high was after an islamic militant killed director theo van gogh in 2004 over a film he made accusing islam of condoning violence against women . the netherlands has a four-stage risk classification system .
the lowest is " minimal , " the highest is " critical . " the counter-terrorism agency cut the threat level to the second-lowest " limited " last april , reported reuters , citing little fresh activity by militant networks in the country and growing resistance to radicalization among the one million muslims in the netherlands . in its new report , the agency noted that the country 's main muslim organizations had called for calm in response to the wilders film . stoking tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are dutch troops at risk wilders is expected to release the film on march 28 at the government press center in the hague , where security measures are already in place . in an interview dutch newspaper nrc handelsblad thursday , wilders said he was disappointed that no dutch broadcaster had been willing to show it . " i had hoped that a television broadcaster would say : ' you have the right to do this , we will give you a podium , " ' he said . " fitna " will also be made available online . a majority of dutch people want the film to be broadcast even though they fear it will stoke tension with muslims and harm relations with arab nations , a poll showed on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this made me think of the first democratic campaign in spain that i participated in with such hope 31 years ago .
i reached voting age - 21 years old at the time - at the same time democracy arrived to my country . we had n't had free elections since february of 1936 , only a few months before the military rebellion against the spanish republic and the start of the spanish civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : antonio munoz molina in that first election of 1977 , street walls were plastered with posters , flags and handbills featuring the candidates ' faces .
the air was full of speeches emanating from car loudspeakers . voting for democracy 's sake this morning i went out to take a walk and realized that none of this exists today .
just as in the past , elections come up frequently and , as usual , the candidates make themselves hoarse repeating excessive promises and launching tasteless attacks against their adversaries .
but this time the city is quiet and the people appear to be focused on their personal affairs , removed from the melodrama of political confrontation . spaniards will not only vote , but will do so in very high numbers .
those of us with doubts will go as well , despite the fact that we do n't identify with any of the major candidates and despite wishing that the campaigns would have discussed more ideas and offered fewer empty slogans . in spain , the division between the left and the right , between the socialist party and the people 's party is very strong .
this is in contrast to the moderate tone of the immense majority of the country and the limited actual differences between the parties ' proposals . issues such as homosexual marriage , abortion rights and the catholic church 's involvement in education have provoked large confrontations among some people .
but the majority of the population , including catholics , is relatively tolerant in practice . ignoring the big issues more serious issues are not debated because neither of the two political parties can come up with a solution .
no matter how big their electoral victory , some problems would require a major , long-term national agreement . you need such an agreement to stem the decline of the educational system , which according to the most serious international evaluations continues to worsen , harming both the strength of our citizens and our economic competitiveness .
you need such an agreement for international politics as well , in order to regain a position of power in the european union and to establish more cordial relations with the united states . the two big national parties also need to decide definitively on the federal map of the country , which is in constant danger of being altered by extremism and nationalism .
without a shared agreement and without giving in to the temptations of xenophobia and demagoguery , it 's impossible to create solid immigration policies that accept the rights and obligations of those immigrants that our country is able to absorb . most experts , except the government , agree that the spanish economy is nearing the end of an era of growth .
there is also the problem of geographical inequalities in the distribution of water .
spain is the country in europe most threatened by desertification : one part of our territory receives abundant rain ; the other lives in permanent danger of drought . rhetoric trumps action with all of the divisions between parties and regional egoisms , solutions seem unlikely .
is any party proposing the improvement of public services , austerity and public sector professionalism ?
it does n't appear that the parties think of this , nor does it seem that they are in favor of toning down their belligerence to concentrate on the search for rational solutions . except for the staunchest supporters , the majority of spaniards are following the electoral campaign only reluctantly and we are glad that there are n't posters on the streets .
but many of us , despite our skepticism , will go and vote , if only because we still remember an era in which democracy did n't exist . antonio munoz molina is one of spain 's best-known writers and commentators . -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 07.03.2008 spanish politician assassinated ahead of election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police inspect the bullet-riddled car of slain politician isaias carrasco a former socialist politician was shot and killed in the basque region just two days before spaniards vote in national elections .
the government blamed eta seperatists for the killing and suspended campaigning . the basque separatist group eta is seen as the likely culprit behind the assassination of a former socialist local council member , isaias carrasco on friday , march 7 .
" this is a vile , cowardly act worthy of all our condemnation , carried out by a group of murderers who will never succeed in breaking the will of spanish democracy , " socialist interior minister alfredo rubalcaba told reporters .
the shooting came on the last day of official campaigning before spaniards go to the polls sunday to choose their next government .
both the governing socialist party and the opposition popular party cancelled their final rallies friday .
socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero currently leads the conservative popular party by about four percentage points in opinion polls .
uncertain election outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative supporters wave popular party flags yet the shooting could change the election outcome .
zapatero had controversially opened peace talks with eta before abandoning them in december 2006 after eta killed two people with a car bomb .
the killing in the basque country is not likely to alter this election outcome , said julian santamaria , a politics professor at madrid 's complutense university .
it could increase voter turnout , santamaria told reuters .
" it might mean more people get out and vote on sunday , " he said .
placing the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're in a tight race in the 2004 elections , zapatero 's socialists were trailing the popular party in the weeks leading up to the elections .
then , three days before the elections , train bombings during morning rush hour in madrid killed 191 people .
the popular party blamed eta although evidence from the beginning showed that radical islamists were responsible .
spaniards were outraged and voted the socialist party into office .
but this year , basque separatism had taken a back seat to issues such as the slowing economy and immigration .
eta has killed 800 people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta has killed 800 people isaias carrasco , a former socialist council member , was assassinated in front of his wife and young daughter outside his house in a small town in the basque region .
eta has killed more than 800 people in the past four decades in an attempt to gain independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an automous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
zapatero has been accused by the right of being soft on basque separatists .
but no criticism was heard friday .
" this is a day of mourning .
we should all stand by the family of isaias carrasco and remain united , united against eta , " said popular party candidate mariano rajoy . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government blamed eta seperatists for the killing and suspended campaigning . the basque separatist group eta is seen as the likely culprit behind the assassination of a former socialist local council member , isaias carrasco on friday , march 7 .
" this is a vile , cowardly act worthy of all our condemnation , carried out by a group of murderers who will never succeed in breaking the will of spanish democracy , " socialist interior minister alfredo rubalcaba told reporters .
the shooting came on the last day of official campaigning before spaniards go to the polls sunday to choose their next government .
both the governing socialist party and the opposition popular party cancelled their final rallies friday .
socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero currently leads the conservative popular party by about four percentage points in opinion polls .
uncertain election outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative supporters wave popular party flags yet the shooting could change the election outcome .
zapatero had controversially opened peace talks with eta before abandoning them in december 2006 after eta killed two people with a car bomb .
the killing in the basque country is not likely to alter this election outcome , said julian santamaria , a politics professor at madrid 's complutense university .
it could increase voter turnout , santamaria told reuters .
" it might mean more people get out and vote on sunday , " he said .

then , three days before the elections , train bombings during morning rush hour in madrid killed 191 people .

spaniards were outraged and voted the socialist party into office .
but this year , basque separatism had taken a back seat to issues such as the slowing economy and immigration .
eta has killed 800 people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta has killed 800 people isaias carrasco , a former socialist council member , was assassinated in front of his wife and young daughter outside his house in a small town in the basque region .
eta has killed more than 800 people in the past four decades in an attempt to gain independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an automous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
zapatero has been accused by the right of being soft on basque separatists .
but no criticism was heard friday .

it memorably featured as a backdrop in leni riefenstahl 's propaganda documentary " triumph of the will , " which was commissioned by hitler as a chronicle of the 1934 nazi party congress . today , its outer walls surround a field of weeds , which nuremberg kept as a warning against fascism for future generations . but two completed annex buildings have since been remodeled , both symbolically broken open with walls and ceilings of glass . one opened in 2000 as a museum documenting the atrocities of the third reich . a venue reborn the other has been revamped as a concert hall with over 500 seats in a redevelopment which took 14 months and cost some 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.9 million -rrb- . it is set to open friday with an inaugural performance by the clarinetist giora feidman , who specializes in jewish music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giora feidman in 2010 , the venue will become the new home of the nuremberg symphony orchestra .

nuremberg was chosen by the nazis as the center of their " aryan " world , with hitler conferring upon nuremberg the title " city of the party rallies . " up to a million party members would travel to nuremberg for the week-long rallies , and it was here that " der führer " gave many of his speeches on the supposed superiority of the aryan race . the city was also home to the nuremberg trials , which tried nazi leaders for crimes against humanity after world war ii . bildunterschrift : banishing the ghosts of the past dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" fitna " was produced by geert wilders , leader of the dutch freedom party and the netherlands ' most outspoken critic of islam . in the past , wilders has deemed the quran incompatible with dutch values .
he recently said his film will show how the muslim holy book is " an inspiration for intolerance , murder and terror . " " fitna " is an arabic term used in the quran usually translated as " strife " or " discord . " damaging dutch political and economic interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders said he had hoped for his film to be broadcast on dutch tv the dutch government has warned that the film might spark unrest and sanctions similar to those triggered when danish newspapers published a cartoon of the prophet mohammad in 2006 . on friday , prime minister jan peter balkenende warned wilders that the release of his film could have " far-reaching security consequences " and even " deaths , " calling on him to take responsibility for the possible consequences of the film . foreign minister maxime verhagen has met ambassadors from muslim countries to discuss the matter , emphasizing that the government does not share wilders ' views .
he asked them to make sure that dutch citizens and buildings abroad are protected . nato , meanwhile , is believed to be concerned about the safety of its troops in afghanistan after hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of mazar-i-sharif earlier in the week in protest .
the crowds set fire to dutch flags and called for the immediate withdrawal of the dutch army from afghanistan . " i fear that soldiers will come under fire because of this film , and i am not afraid to say so , " said nato general secretary jaap de hoop . various dutch employers ' associations and employees unions , as well as representatives of the protestant church have also urged wilders not to release the film . security measures the dutch counter-terrorism agency said in a report to parliament thursday that the new threat assessment was also influenced by arrests elsewhere in europe that had thwarted attacks by groups directed or influenced by al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan . the last time the threat level was this high was after an islamic militant killed director theo van gogh in 2004 over a film he made accusing islam of condoning violence against women . the netherlands has a four-stage risk classification system .
the lowest is " minimal , " the highest is " critical . " the counter-terrorism agency cut the threat level to the second-lowest " limited " last april , reported reuters , citing little fresh activity by militant networks in the country and growing resistance to radicalization among the one million muslims in the netherlands . in its new report , the agency noted that the country 's main muslim organizations had called for calm in response to the wilders film . stoking tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are dutch troops at risk wilders is expected to release the film on march 28 at the government press center in the hague , where security measures are already in place . in an interview dutch newspaper nrc handelsblad thursday , wilders said he was disappointed that no dutch broadcaster had been willing to show it . " i had hoped that a television broadcaster would say : ' you have the right to do this , we will give you a podium , " ' he said . " fitna " will also be made available online . a majority of dutch people want the film to be broadcast even though they fear it will stoke tension with muslims and harm relations with arab nations , a poll showed on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government blamed eta seperatists for the killing and suspended campaigning . the basque separatist group eta is seen as the likely culprit behind the assassination of a former socialist local council member , isaias carrasco on friday , march 7 .
" this is a vile , cowardly act worthy of all our condemnation , carried out by a group of murderers who will never succeed in breaking the will of spanish democracy , " socialist interior minister alfredo rubalcaba told reporters .
the shooting came on the last day of official campaigning before spaniards go to the polls sunday to choose their next government .
both the governing socialist party and the opposition popular party cancelled their final rallies friday .
socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero currently leads the conservative popular party by about four percentage points in opinion polls .
uncertain election outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative supporters wave popular party flags yet the shooting could change the election outcome .
zapatero had controversially opened peace talks with eta before abandoning them in december 2006 after eta killed two people with a car bomb .
the killing in the basque country is not likely to alter this election outcome , said julian santamaria , a politics professor at madrid 's complutense university .

this made me think of the first democratic campaign in spain that i participated in with such hope 31 years ago .
i reached voting age - 21 years old at the time - at the same time democracy arrived to my country . we had n't had free elections since february of 1936 , only a few months before the military rebellion against the spanish republic and the start of the spanish civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : antonio munoz molina in that first election of 1977 , street walls were plastered with posters , flags and handbills featuring the candidates ' faces .
the air was full of speeches emanating from car loudspeakers . voting for democracy 's sake this morning i went out to take a walk and realized that none of this exists today .
just as in the past , elections come up frequently and , as usual , the candidates make themselves hoarse repeating excessive promises and launching tasteless attacks against their adversaries .
but this time the city is quiet and the people appear to be focused on their personal affairs , removed from the melodrama of political confrontation . spaniards will not only vote , but will do so in very high numbers .
those of us with doubts will go as well , despite the fact that we do n't identify with any of the major candidates and despite wishing that the campaigns would have discussed more ideas and offered fewer empty slogans . in spain , the division between the left and the right , between the socialist party and the people 's party is very strong .
this is in contrast to the moderate tone of the immense majority of the country and the limited actual differences between the parties ' proposals . issues such as homosexual marriage , abortion rights and the catholic church 's involvement in education have provoked large confrontations among some people .
but the majority of the population , including catholics , is relatively tolerant in practice . ignoring the big issues more serious issues are not debated because neither of the two political parties can come up with a solution .
no matter how big their electoral victory , some problems would require a major , long-term national agreement . you need such an agreement to stem the decline of the educational system , which according to the most serious international evaluations continues to worsen , harming both the strength of our citizens and our economic competitiveness .
you need such an agreement for international politics as well , in order to regain a position of power in the european union and to establish more cordial relations with the united states . the two big national parties also need to decide definitively on the federal map of the country , which is in constant danger of being altered by extremism and nationalism .
without a shared agreement and without giving in to the temptations of xenophobia and demagoguery , it 's impossible to create solid immigration policies that accept the rights and obligations of those immigrants that our country is able to absorb . most experts , except the government , agree that the spanish economy is nearing the end of an era of growth .
there is also the problem of geographical inequalities in the distribution of water .
spain is the country in europe most threatened by desertification : one part of our territory receives abundant rain ; the other lives in permanent danger of drought . rhetoric trumps action with all of the divisions between parties and regional egoisms , solutions seem unlikely .
is any party proposing the improvement of public services , austerity and public sector professionalism ?
it does n't appear that the parties think of this , nor does it seem that they are in favor of toning down their belligerence to concentrate on the search for rational solutions . except for the staunchest supporters , the majority of spaniards are following the electoral campaign only reluctantly and we are glad that there are n't posters on the streets .

this made me think of the first democratic campaign in spain that i participated in with such hope 31 years ago .
i reached voting age - 21 years old at the time - at the same time democracy arrived to my country . we had n't had free elections since february of 1936 , only a few months before the military rebellion against the spanish republic and the start of the spanish civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : antonio munoz molina in that first election of 1977 , street walls were plastered with posters , flags and handbills featuring the candidates ' faces .
the air was full of speeches emanating from car loudspeakers . voting for democracy 's sake this morning i went out to take a walk and realized that none of this exists today .
just as in the past , elections come up frequently and , as usual , the candidates make themselves hoarse repeating excessive promises and launching tasteless attacks against their adversaries .
but this time the city is quiet and the people appear to be focused on their personal affairs , removed from the melodrama of political confrontation . spaniards will not only vote , but will do so in very high numbers .
those of us with doubts will go as well , despite the fact that we do n't identify with any of the major candidates and despite wishing that the campaigns would have discussed more ideas and offered fewer empty slogans . in spain , the division between the left and the right , between the socialist party and the people 's party is very strong .
this is in contrast to the moderate tone of the immense majority of the country and the limited actual differences between the parties ' proposals . issues such as homosexual marriage , abortion rights and the catholic church 's involvement in education have provoked large confrontations among some people .
but the majority of the population , including catholics , is relatively tolerant in practice . ignoring the big issues more serious issues are not debated because neither of the two political parties can come up with a solution .
no matter how big their electoral victory , some problems would require a major , long-term national agreement . you need such an agreement to stem the decline of the educational system , which according to the most serious international evaluations continues to worsen , harming both the strength of our citizens and our economic competitiveness .
you need such an agreement for international politics as well , in order to regain a position of power in the european union and to establish more cordial relations with the united states . the two big national parties also need to decide definitively on the federal map of the country , which is in constant danger of being altered by extremism and nationalism .
without a shared agreement and without giving in to the temptations of xenophobia and demagoguery , it 's impossible to create solid immigration policies that accept the rights and obligations of those immigrants that our country is able to absorb . most experts , except the government , agree that the spanish economy is nearing the end of an era of growth .
there is also the problem of geographical inequalities in the distribution of water .
spain is the country in europe most threatened by desertification : one part of our territory receives abundant rain ; the other lives in permanent danger of drought . rhetoric trumps action with all of the divisions between parties and regional egoisms , solutions seem unlikely .
is any party proposing the improvement of public services , austerity and public sector professionalism ?
it does n't appear that the parties think of this , nor does it seem that they are in favor of toning down their belligerence to concentrate on the search for rational solutions . except for the staunchest supporters , the majority of spaniards are following the electoral campaign only reluctantly and we are glad that there are n't posters on the streets .
but many of us , despite our skepticism , will go and vote , if only because we still remember an era in which democracy did n't exist . antonio munoz molina is one of spain 's best-known writers and commentators . -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 07.03.2008 spanish politician assassinated ahead of election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police inspect the bullet-riddled car of slain politician isaias carrasco a former socialist politician was shot and killed in the basque region just two days before spaniards vote in national elections .
the government blamed eta seperatists for the killing and suspended campaigning . the basque separatist group eta is seen as the likely culprit behind the assassination of a former socialist local council member , isaias carrasco on friday , march 7 .
" this is a vile , cowardly act worthy of all our condemnation , carried out by a group of murderers who will never succeed in breaking the will of spanish democracy , " socialist interior minister alfredo rubalcaba told reporters .
the shooting came on the last day of official campaigning before spaniards go to the polls sunday to choose their next government .
both the governing socialist party and the opposition popular party cancelled their final rallies friday .
socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero currently leads the conservative popular party by about four percentage points in opinion polls .
uncertain election outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative supporters wave popular party flags yet the shooting could change the election outcome .
zapatero had controversially opened peace talks with eta before abandoning them in december 2006 after eta killed two people with a car bomb .
the killing in the basque country is not likely to alter this election outcome , said julian santamaria , a politics professor at madrid 's complutense university .
it could increase voter turnout , santamaria told reuters .
" it might mean more people get out and vote on sunday , " he said .
placing the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're in a tight race in the 2004 elections , zapatero 's socialists were trailing the popular party in the weeks leading up to the elections .
then , three days before the elections , train bombings during morning rush hour in madrid killed 191 people .
the popular party blamed eta although evidence from the beginning showed that radical islamists were responsible .

it memorably featured as a backdrop in leni riefenstahl 's propaganda documentary " triumph of the will , " which was commissioned by hitler as a chronicle of the 1934 nazi party congress . today , its outer walls surround a field of weeds , which nuremberg kept as a warning against fascism for future generations . but two completed annex buildings have since been remodeled , both symbolically broken open with walls and ceilings of glass . one opened in 2000 as a museum documenting the atrocities of the third reich . a venue reborn the other has been revamped as a concert hall with over 500 seats in a redevelopment which took 14 months and cost some 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.9 million -rrb- . it is set to open friday with an inaugural performance by the clarinetist giora feidman , who specializes in jewish music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giora feidman in 2010 , the venue will become the new home of the nuremberg symphony orchestra .

nuremberg was chosen by the nazis as the center of their " aryan " world , with hitler conferring upon nuremberg the title " city of the party rallies . " up to a million party members would travel to nuremberg for the week-long rallies , and it was here that " der führer " gave many of his speeches on the supposed superiority of the aryan race . the city was also home to the nuremberg trials , which tried nazi leaders for crimes against humanity after world war ii . bildunterschrift : banishing the ghosts of the past dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche bahn said earlier friday it had devised a back-up plan to limit the fallout and promised that at least half of normal trains should run on monday even if gdl went ahead with the strike .
deutsche bahn has been backed by the big unions , which traditionally depend on the drivers ' strength to win pay rises for cleaners and clerks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 07.03.2008 conservatives , greens edge toward state coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green light for a " black-green " alliance is a first in germany as a former german president called for constitutional changes to ensure stable coalition governments , traditional rivals in the green and conservative camps said they would work to reach a power-sharing deal in hamburg . german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- confirmed on thursday , march 6 , that it is ready to open negotiations with the green party with the aim of forming a first ever " black-green " coalition in the port city of hamburg . " we still have differences of opinion but they can be bridged , " michael freytag , the cdu 's regional head , said on thursday after the party 's board agreed to open talks with the greens .
the move highlights the conservatives ' preference to work with the greens instead of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unlikely marriage - the greens ' christa goetsch with the cdu 's von beust talk of the unusual alliance first erupted when a feb .
24 election in the city failed to provide a clear parliamentary majority for the cdu after their traditional partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , did not surpass the 5-percent hurdle to get into parliament . unusual bedfellows after seven hours of exploratory talks on wednesday , the two parties announced they had discovered " much common ground . " however , several green members have resisted the idea of teaming up with the cdu , a traditional political adversary , and the subject has prompted much soul-searching in the ecologically minded party .
although there is a degree of common ground between the two parties , for example , in certain economic policies and in their appeal to the well-heeled - they still differ substantially on many issues . in hamburg , the parties are split on several major issues , including a proposal to deepen the elbe river to prepare germany 's biggest port for a new generation of container ships and the planned construction of a new coal-fired power station that would be the largest of its kind in the country .
the greens oppose both projects on environmental grounds . the green party in the city-state of hamburg , where it goes by the name gal , signaled on thursday that they were prepared to enter negotiations for a " black-green " coalition with the conservatives in hamburg . gal party chief , anja hajduk said the cdu was willing to soften its position on the new coal-fired power station and was open for an alternative . former president calls for changes to constitution the mold-breaking tie-up between the greens and the conservatives is n't the only new political grouping on the german political landscape .
a steady decline in support for germany 's two biggest parties , the cdu and the spd , have led to the rise of parties like the far-left " die linke " which has made it tougher to form stable governments both at the federal and state level and led to new and risky political constellations . the development prompted former german president roman herzog on thursday to call for changes to germany 's constitution to counter the rise of fringe parties he said risked spawning unstable coalitions reminiscent of the weimar republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog is the first major german figure to call for a change to the constitution to deter fringe parties herzog , who served as german president from 1994 to 1999 , wrote in thursday 's sueddeutsche zeitung daily that germany was witnessing a fundamental shift in its system of government and suggested that its constitution , or " basic law , " which dates back to 1949 , should be adapted .

" we still have differences of opinion but they can be bridged , " michael freytag , the cdu 's regional head , said on thursday after the party 's board agreed to open talks with the greens .
the move highlights the conservatives ' preference to work with the greens instead of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unlikely marriage - the greens ' christa goetsch with the cdu 's von beust talk of the unusual alliance first erupted when a feb .
24 election in the city failed to provide a clear parliamentary majority for the cdu after their traditional partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , did not surpass the 5-percent hurdle to get into parliament . unusual bedfellows after seven hours of exploratory talks on wednesday , the two parties announced they had discovered " much common ground . " however , several green members have resisted the idea of teaming up with the cdu , a traditional political adversary , and the subject has prompted much soul-searching in the ecologically minded party .
although there is a degree of common ground between the two parties , for example , in certain economic policies and in their appeal to the well-heeled - they still differ substantially on many issues . in hamburg , the parties are split on several major issues , including a proposal to deepen the elbe river to prepare germany 's biggest port for a new generation of container ships and the planned construction of a new coal-fired power station that would be the largest of its kind in the country .
the greens oppose both projects on environmental grounds . the green party in the city-state of hamburg , where it goes by the name gal , signaled on thursday that they were prepared to enter negotiations for a " black-green " coalition with the conservatives in hamburg . gal party chief , anja hajduk said the cdu was willing to soften its position on the new coal-fired power station and was open for an alternative . former president calls for changes to constitution the mold-breaking tie-up between the greens and the conservatives is n't the only new political grouping on the german political landscape .
a steady decline in support for germany 's two biggest parties , the cdu and the spd , have led to the rise of parties like the far-left " die linke " which has made it tougher to form stable governments both at the federal and state level and led to new and risky political constellations . the development prompted former german president roman herzog on thursday to call for changes to germany 's constitution to counter the rise of fringe parties he said risked spawning unstable coalitions reminiscent of the weimar republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog is the first major german figure to call for a change to the constitution to deter fringe parties herzog , who served as german president from 1994 to 1999 , wrote in thursday 's sueddeutsche zeitung daily that germany was witnessing a fundamental shift in its system of government and suggested that its constitution , or " basic law , " which dates back to 1949 , should be adapted .

it wo n't be in the form of the traditional iron cross , said the government . president horst koehler has " approved in principle " a proposal by defense minister franz josef jung to introduce the new military honor , the presidential spokesman said thursday , march 6 . germany over the last half a century has awarded military decorations for special achievement , length of duty and for tours lasting over 30 days , but no medals for bravery have been given since world war ii . there was no word as to when the new medal would be introduced , what it would look like or what the criteria would be to receive it . no plans to resurrect iron cross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iron cross , seen here next to the german flag , is the bundeswehr 's official emblem the defense ministry , however , said on thursday that it would not resemble the iron cross - a wartime decoration introduced by prussian emperor friedrich wilhelm iii in 1813 .
the symbol was later adopted by the nazis , who combined it with a swastika . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , conservative parliamentarian ernst-reinhard beck had recommended modeling the new medal on the iron cross .
beck , a member of angela merkel 's christian democratic union , is also head of germany 's army reservists association . " we should reclaim the positive side of this symbol now that the war has been over for more than 60 years and that the bundeswehr has , over half a century , established a tradition which has nothing to do with the nazi era , " said beck . he conceded that the iron cross is associated with the world wars but said it could also serve as a " symbol of hope . " the design is still used today as the german military 's national emblem and appears on aircraft and tanks . defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe said there was no thought of bringing back the iron cross , " not only because of its third reich connotations , but because it was awarded for war service and we are not a nation at war . " medal plan meets opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 german troops are stationed abroad some left-wing politicians have spoken out against introducing any kind of bravery medal for soldiers . " german history has shown us that whenever soldiery was celebrated in society with monuments and honors , it was often a harbinger of germany 's involvement in wars , " said paul schaefer , a defense policy spokesman for the left party . a defense expert from the social democratic party , rainer arnold , told the friday edition of the märkische allgemeine zeitung that a military honor should n't be reduced to courage alone .
he added that he did n't have anything against rewarding soldiers for special achievements where bravery was also displayed , but that these types of medals already existed . the proposal for the medal comes as germany 's participation in international peacekeeping mission has increased in recent years .
it currently has 9,000 troops stations abroad in 10 separate missions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it wo n't be in the form of the traditional iron cross , said the government . president horst koehler has " approved in principle " a proposal by defense minister franz josef jung to introduce the new military honor , the presidential spokesman said thursday , march 6 . germany over the last half a century has awarded military decorations for special achievement , length of duty and for tours lasting over 30 days , but no medals for bravery have been given since world war ii . there was no word as to when the new medal would be introduced , what it would look like or what the criteria would be to receive it . no plans to resurrect iron cross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iron cross , seen here next to the german flag , is the bundeswehr 's official emblem the defense ministry , however , said on thursday that it would not resemble the iron cross - a wartime decoration introduced by prussian emperor friedrich wilhelm iii in 1813 .
the symbol was later adopted by the nazis , who combined it with a swastika . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , conservative parliamentarian ernst-reinhard beck had recommended modeling the new medal on the iron cross .
beck , a member of angela merkel 's christian democratic union , is also head of germany 's army reservists association . " we should reclaim the positive side of this symbol now that the war has been over for more than 60 years and that the bundeswehr has , over half a century , established a tradition which has nothing to do with the nazi era , " said beck . he conceded that the iron cross is associated with the world wars but said it could also serve as a " symbol of hope . " the design is still used today as the german military 's national emblem and appears on aircraft and tanks . defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe said there was no thought of bringing back the iron cross , " not only because of its third reich connotations , but because it was awarded for war service and we are not a nation at war . " medal plan meets opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 german troops are stationed abroad some left-wing politicians have spoken out against introducing any kind of bravery medal for soldiers . " german history has shown us that whenever soldiery was celebrated in society with monuments and honors , it was often a harbinger of germany 's involvement in wars , " said paul schaefer , a defense policy spokesman for the left party . a defense expert from the social democratic party , rainer arnold , told the friday edition of the märkische allgemeine zeitung that a military honor should n't be reduced to courage alone .
he added that he did n't have anything against rewarding soldiers for special achievements where bravery was also displayed , but that these types of medals already existed . the proposal for the medal comes as germany 's participation in international peacekeeping mission has increased in recent years .
it currently has 9,000 troops stations abroad in 10 separate missions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it memorably featured as a backdrop in leni riefenstahl 's propaganda documentary " triumph of the will , " which was commissioned by hitler as a chronicle of the 1934 nazi party congress . today , its outer walls surround a field of weeds , which nuremberg kept as a warning against fascism for future generations . but two completed annex buildings have since been remodeled , both symbolically broken open with walls and ceilings of glass . one opened in 2000 as a museum documenting the atrocities of the third reich . a venue reborn the other has been revamped as a concert hall with over 500 seats in a redevelopment which took 14 months and cost some 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.9 million -rrb- . it is set to open friday with an inaugural performance by the clarinetist giora feidman , who specializes in jewish music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giora feidman in 2010 , the venue will become the new home of the nuremberg symphony orchestra .

nuremberg was chosen by the nazis as the center of their " aryan " world , with hitler conferring upon nuremberg the title " city of the party rallies .

the case of a bavarian who decided to trade in smoking for gambling certainly beats all those draconian health warnings on cigarette packets as convincing proof that stubbing out has its perks .
for the last three years , he 's been trading in the money he used to spend on cigarettes every week for a lottery ticket .
the odds were against this ever proving to be more than just another of those desperate tricks smokers use to persuade themselves to quit , but last saturday he hit the jackpot , winning 1.17 million euros -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- in the game 77 version of the state lottery and becoming an overnight millionaire .

the winner said he intended to use some of the money to pay off his house , but apart from that had no fixed plans on what to do with the windfall .
" going out for a really good meal , that 's a must , of course , " he told the lottery organizers .

" i will not stand for election on april 5 , as i can not guarantee a majority , " ypsilanti told reporters on friday , march 7 , ditching a controversial plan to build a minority alliance with the green party tolerated by germany 's far-left party in the western state of hesse .
the move amounted to ypsilanti going back on a pledge not to work with the grouping of ex-communists and leftist social democrat deserters from western germany . “ we can not take this path , since there are parliamentarians with us that will not go down this path , ” ypsilanti said in a statement . earlier , a renegade spd member in hesse 's state legislature , dagmar metzger , had made it clear that she would not back a deal with the left party which is considered by many in the spd as being unreliable and populist . after a deadlocked state election on jan .
27 , hesse was left scrambling to form a government .
both the spd and incumbent premier roland koch 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- won 42 seats each in the 110-seat legislature . cdu to seek other partners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch is looking for new friends spd head kurt beck had given ypsilanti the green light to pursue a cooperation with the left party , sparking a uproar in social democratic ranks .
the move also raised questions about beck 's credibility and his presumed bid to challenge chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal election . ypsilanti said earlier in the week that her decision to break with pre-election promises not to rely on the left party for votes had been " very , very difficult " for her . koch had urged the spd to consider a " grand coalition " together with the conservatives , similar to chancellor angela merkel 's model at the federal level .
he said friday that his conservative party would seek coalition talks with the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the greens , which have 11 and nine seats respectively in the state legislature . the greens have so far ruled out a coalition with the conservatives . neither of the two major parties can attain a majority of 56 seats with just one partner , but would need to get either the left party or the greens on board as well . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government blamed eta seperatists for the killing and suspended campaigning . the basque separatist group eta is seen as the likely culprit behind the assassination of a former socialist local council member , isaias carrasco on friday , march 7 .
" this is a vile , cowardly act worthy of all our condemnation , carried out by a group of murderers who will never succeed in breaking the will of spanish democracy , " socialist interior minister alfredo rubalcaba told reporters .
the shooting came on the last day of official campaigning before spaniards go to the polls sunday to choose their next government .
both the governing socialist party and the opposition popular party cancelled their final rallies friday .
socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero currently leads the conservative popular party by about four percentage points in opinion polls .

zapatero had controversially opened peace talks with eta before abandoning them in december 2006 after eta killed two people with a car bomb .
the killing in the basque country is not likely to alter this election outcome , said julian santamaria , a politics professor at madrid 's complutense university .
it could increase voter turnout , santamaria told reuters .

opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an automous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
zapatero has been accused by the right of being soft on basque separatists .
but no criticism was heard friday .

the government blamed eta seperatists for the killing and suspended campaigning . the basque separatist group eta is seen as the likely culprit behind the assassination of a former socialist local council member , isaias carrasco on friday , march 7 .
" this is a vile , cowardly act worthy of all our condemnation , carried out by a group of murderers who will never succeed in breaking the will of spanish democracy , " socialist interior minister alfredo rubalcaba told reporters .
the shooting came on the last day of official campaigning before spaniards go to the polls sunday to choose their next government .
both the governing socialist party and the opposition popular party cancelled their final rallies friday .
socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero currently leads the conservative popular party by about four percentage points in opinion polls .
uncertain election outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative supporters wave popular party flags yet the shooting could change the election outcome .
zapatero had controversially opened peace talks with eta before abandoning them in december 2006 after eta killed two people with a car bomb .
the killing in the basque country is not likely to alter this election outcome , said julian santamaria , a politics professor at madrid 's complutense university .
it could increase voter turnout , santamaria told reuters .
" it might mean more people get out and vote on sunday , " he said .
placing the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're in a tight race in the 2004 elections , zapatero 's socialists were trailing the popular party in the weeks leading up to the elections .
then , three days before the elections , train bombings during morning rush hour in madrid killed 191 people .
the popular party blamed eta although evidence from the beginning showed that radical islamists were responsible .
spaniards were outraged and voted the socialist party into office .
but this year , basque separatism had taken a back seat to issues such as the slowing economy and immigration .
eta has killed 800 people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta has killed 800 people isaias carrasco , a former socialist council member , was assassinated in front of his wife and young daughter outside his house in a small town in the basque region .
eta has killed more than 800 people in the past four decades in an attempt to gain independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an automous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .

" fitna " was produced by geert wilders , leader of the dutch freedom party and the netherlands ' most outspoken critic of islam . in the past , wilders has deemed the quran incompatible with dutch values .
he recently said his film will show how the muslim holy book is " an inspiration for intolerance , murder and terror . " " fitna " is an arabic term used in the quran usually translated as " strife " or " discord . " damaging dutch political and economic interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders said he had hoped for his film to be broadcast on dutch tv the dutch government has warned that the film might spark unrest and sanctions similar to those triggered when danish newspapers published a cartoon of the prophet mohammad in 2006 . on friday , prime minister jan peter balkenende warned wilders that the release of his film could have " far-reaching security consequences " and even " deaths , " calling on him to take responsibility for the possible consequences of the film . foreign minister maxime verhagen has met ambassadors from muslim countries to discuss the matter , emphasizing that the government does not share wilders ' views .
he asked them to make sure that dutch citizens and buildings abroad are protected . nato , meanwhile , is believed to be concerned about the safety of its troops in afghanistan after hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of mazar-i-sharif earlier in the week in protest .
the crowds set fire to dutch flags and called for the immediate withdrawal of the dutch army from afghanistan . " i fear that soldiers will come under fire because of this film , and i am not afraid to say so , " said nato general secretary jaap de hoop . various dutch employers ' associations and employees unions , as well as representatives of the protestant church have also urged wilders not to release the film . security measures the dutch counter-terrorism agency said in a report to parliament thursday that the new threat assessment was also influenced by arrests elsewhere in europe that had thwarted attacks by groups directed or influenced by al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan . the last time the threat level was this high was after an islamic militant killed director theo van gogh in 2004 over a film he made accusing islam of condoning violence against women . the netherlands has a four-stage risk classification system .
the lowest is " minimal , " the highest is " critical . " the counter-terrorism agency cut the threat level to the second-lowest " limited " last april , reported reuters , citing little fresh activity by militant networks in the country and growing resistance to radicalization among the one million muslims in the netherlands . in its new report , the agency noted that the country 's main muslim organizations had called for calm in response to the wilders film . stoking tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are dutch troops at risk wilders is expected to release the film on march 28 at the government press center in the hague , where security measures are already in place . in an interview dutch newspaper nrc handelsblad thursday , wilders said he was disappointed that no dutch broadcaster had been willing to show it . " i had hoped that a television broadcaster would say : ' you have the right to do this , we will give you a podium , " ' he said . " fitna " will also be made available online . a majority of dutch people want the film to be broadcast even though they fear it will stoke tension with muslims and harm relations with arab nations , a poll showed on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it wo n't be in the form of the traditional iron cross , said the government . president horst koehler has " approved in principle " a proposal by defense minister franz josef jung to introduce the new military honor , the presidential spokesman said thursday , march 6 . germany over the last half a century has awarded military decorations for special achievement , length of duty and for tours lasting over 30 days , but no medals for bravery have been given since world war ii . there was no word as to when the new medal would be introduced , what it would look like or what the criteria would be to receive it . no plans to resurrect iron cross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iron cross , seen here next to the german flag , is the bundeswehr 's official emblem the defense ministry , however , said on thursday that it would not resemble the iron cross - a wartime decoration introduced by prussian emperor friedrich wilhelm iii in 1813 .
the symbol was later adopted by the nazis , who combined it with a swastika . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , conservative parliamentarian ernst-reinhard beck had recommended modeling the new medal on the iron cross .
beck , a member of angela merkel 's christian democratic union , is also head of germany 's army reservists association . " we should reclaim the positive side of this symbol now that the war has been over for more than 60 years and that the bundeswehr has , over half a century , established a tradition which has nothing to do with the nazi era , " said beck . he conceded that the iron cross is associated with the world wars but said it could also serve as a " symbol of hope . " the design is still used today as the german military 's national emblem and appears on aircraft and tanks . defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe said there was no thought of bringing back the iron cross , " not only because of its third reich connotations , but because it was awarded for war service and we are not a nation at war . " medal plan meets opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 german troops are stationed abroad some left-wing politicians have spoken out against introducing any kind of bravery medal for soldiers . " german history has shown us that whenever soldiery was celebrated in society with monuments and honors , it was often a harbinger of germany 's involvement in wars , " said paul schaefer , a defense policy spokesman for the left party . a defense expert from the social democratic party , rainer arnold , told the friday edition of the märkische allgemeine zeitung that a military honor should n't be reduced to courage alone .
he added that he did n't have anything against rewarding soldiers for special achievements where bravery was also displayed , but that these types of medals already existed . the proposal for the medal comes as germany 's participation in international peacekeeping mission has increased in recent years .
it currently has 9,000 troops stations abroad in 10 separate missions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 07.03.2008 conservatives , greens edge toward state coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green light for a " black-green " alliance is a first in germany as a former german president called for constitutional changes to ensure stable coalition governments , traditional rivals in the green and conservative camps said they would work to reach a power-sharing deal in hamburg . german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- confirmed on thursday , march 6 , that it is ready to open negotiations with the green party with the aim of forming a first ever " black-green " coalition in the port city of hamburg . " we still have differences of opinion but they can be bridged , " michael freytag , the cdu 's regional head , said on thursday after the party 's board agreed to open talks with the greens .
the move highlights the conservatives ' preference to work with the greens instead of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unlikely marriage - the greens ' christa goetsch with the cdu 's von beust talk of the unusual alliance first erupted when a feb .
24 election in the city failed to provide a clear parliamentary majority for the cdu after their traditional partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , did not surpass the 5-percent hurdle to get into parliament . unusual bedfellows after seven hours of exploratory talks on wednesday , the two parties announced they had discovered " much common ground . " however , several green members have resisted the idea of teaming up with the cdu , a traditional political adversary , and the subject has prompted much soul-searching in the ecologically minded party .
although there is a degree of common ground between the two parties , for example , in certain economic policies and in their appeal to the well-heeled - they still differ substantially on many issues . in hamburg , the parties are split on several major issues , including a proposal to deepen the elbe river to prepare germany 's biggest port for a new generation of container ships and the planned construction of a new coal-fired power station that would be the largest of its kind in the country .
the greens oppose both projects on environmental grounds . the green party in the city-state of hamburg , where it goes by the name gal , signaled on thursday that they were prepared to enter negotiations for a " black-green " coalition with the conservatives in hamburg . gal party chief , anja hajduk said the cdu was willing to soften its position on the new coal-fired power station and was open for an alternative . former president calls for changes to constitution the mold-breaking tie-up between the greens and the conservatives is n't the only new political grouping on the german political landscape .
a steady decline in support for germany 's two biggest parties , the cdu and the spd , have led to the rise of parties like the far-left " die linke " which has made it tougher to form stable governments both at the federal and state level and led to new and risky political constellations . the development prompted former german president roman herzog on thursday to call for changes to germany 's constitution to counter the rise of fringe parties he said risked spawning unstable coalitions reminiscent of the weimar republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog is the first major german figure to call for a change to the constitution to deter fringe parties herzog , who served as german president from 1994 to 1999 , wrote in thursday 's sueddeutsche zeitung daily that germany was witnessing a fundamental shift in its system of government and suggested that its constitution , or " basic law , " which dates back to 1949 , should be adapted . " it will become increasingly difficult to form stable majorities and keep them together , " herzog wrote .
" it is clear that the danger of minority governments will rise . " the rise of the greens in the 1980s and more recently " die linke , " or left party - a grouping of ex-communists and western german spd deserters - means that five parties regularly clear the 5-percent hurdle , complicating the formation of political majorities . herzog said germans would not accept a british winner-takes-all approach , but added that french rules calling for candidates to win absolute majorities , which often leads to run-off elections , may be a good idea . the current german system requires the top party in any given election to form a majority in parliament , if necessary in coalition with another party or parties , to take power . rules put in place after world war two require parties to pass the five percent support threshold to enter parliament . herzog 's suggestion , the first proposal by an influential german politician to change the constitution because of fringe parties , was rejected by the cdu and spd , as well as opposition parties . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this made me think of the first democratic campaign in spain that i participated in with such hope 31 years ago .
i reached voting age - 21 years old at the time - at the same time democracy arrived to my country . we had n't had free elections since february of 1936 , only a few months before the military rebellion against the spanish republic and the start of the spanish civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : antonio munoz molina in that first election of 1977 , street walls were plastered with posters , flags and handbills featuring the candidates ' faces .
the air was full of speeches emanating from car loudspeakers . voting for democracy 's sake this morning i went out to take a walk and realized that none of this exists today .
just as in the past , elections come up frequently and , as usual , the candidates make themselves hoarse repeating excessive promises and launching tasteless attacks against their adversaries .
but this time the city is quiet and the people appear to be focused on their personal affairs , removed from the melodrama of political confrontation . spaniards will not only vote , but will do so in very high numbers .
those of us with doubts will go as well , despite the fact that we do n't identify with any of the major candidates and despite wishing that the campaigns would have discussed more ideas and offered fewer empty slogans . in spain , the division between the left and the right , between the socialist party and the people 's party is very strong .
this is in contrast to the moderate tone of the immense majority of the country and the limited actual differences between the parties ' proposals . issues such as homosexual marriage , abortion rights and the catholic church 's involvement in education have provoked large confrontations among some people .
but the majority of the population , including catholics , is relatively tolerant in practice . ignoring the big issues more serious issues are not debated because neither of the two political parties can come up with a solution .
no matter how big their electoral victory , some problems would require a major , long-term national agreement . you need such an agreement to stem the decline of the educational system , which according to the most serious international evaluations continues to worsen , harming both the strength of our citizens and our economic competitiveness .
you need such an agreement for international politics as well , in order to regain a position of power in the european union and to establish more cordial relations with the united states . the two big national parties also need to decide definitively on the federal map of the country , which is in constant danger of being altered by extremism and nationalism .
without a shared agreement and without giving in to the temptations of xenophobia and demagoguery , it 's impossible to create solid immigration policies that accept the rights and obligations of those immigrants that our country is able to absorb . most experts , except the government , agree that the spanish economy is nearing the end of an era of growth .
there is also the problem of geographical inequalities in the distribution of water .
spain is the country in europe most threatened by desertification : one part of our territory receives abundant rain ; the other lives in permanent danger of drought . rhetoric trumps action with all of the divisions between parties and regional egoisms , solutions seem unlikely .
is any party proposing the improvement of public services , austerity and public sector professionalism ?
it does n't appear that the parties think of this , nor does it seem that they are in favor of toning down their belligerence to concentrate on the search for rational solutions . except for the staunchest supporters , the majority of spaniards are following the electoral campaign only reluctantly and we are glad that there are n't posters on the streets .

" i will not stand for election on april 5 , as i can not guarantee a majority , " ypsilanti told reporters on friday , march 7 , ditching a controversial plan to build a minority alliance with the green party tolerated by germany 's far-left party in the western state of hesse .
the move amounted to ypsilanti going back on a pledge not to work with the grouping of ex-communists and leftist social democrat deserters from western germany . “ we can not take this path , since there are parliamentarians with us that will not go down this path , ” ypsilanti said in a statement . earlier , a renegade spd member in hesse 's state legislature , dagmar metzger , had made it clear that she would not back a deal with the left party which is considered by many in the spd as being unreliable and populist . after a deadlocked state election on jan .
27 , hesse was left scrambling to form a government .
both the spd and incumbent premier roland koch 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- won 42 seats each in the 110-seat legislature . cdu to seek other partners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch is looking for new friends spd head kurt beck had given ypsilanti the green light to pursue a cooperation with the left party , sparking a uproar in social democratic ranks .
the move also raised questions about beck 's credibility and his presumed bid to challenge chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal election . ypsilanti said earlier in the week that her decision to break with pre-election promises not to rely on the left party for votes had been " very , very difficult " for her . koch had urged the spd to consider a " grand coalition " together with the conservatives , similar to chancellor angela merkel 's model at the federal level .
he said friday that his conservative party would seek coalition talks with the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the greens , which have 11 and nine seats respectively in the state legislature . the greens have so far ruled out a coalition with the conservatives . neither of the two major parties can attain a majority of 56 seats with just one partner , but would need to get either the left party or the greens on board as well . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this made me think of the first democratic campaign in spain that i participated in with such hope 31 years ago .
i reached voting age - 21 years old at the time - at the same time democracy arrived to my country . we had n't had free elections since february of 1936 , only a few months before the military rebellion against the spanish republic and the start of the spanish civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : antonio munoz molina in that first election of 1977 , street walls were plastered with posters , flags and handbills featuring the candidates ' faces .
the air was full of speeches emanating from car loudspeakers . voting for democracy 's sake this morning i went out to take a walk and realized that none of this exists today .
just as in the past , elections come up frequently and , as usual , the candidates make themselves hoarse repeating excessive promises and launching tasteless attacks against their adversaries .
but this time the city is quiet and the people appear to be focused on their personal affairs , removed from the melodrama of political confrontation . spaniards will not only vote , but will do so in very high numbers .
those of us with doubts will go as well , despite the fact that we do n't identify with any of the major candidates and despite wishing that the campaigns would have discussed more ideas and offered fewer empty slogans . in spain , the division between the left and the right , between the socialist party and the people 's party is very strong .
this is in contrast to the moderate tone of the immense majority of the country and the limited actual differences between the parties ' proposals . issues such as homosexual marriage , abortion rights and the catholic church 's involvement in education have provoked large confrontations among some people .
but the majority of the population , including catholics , is relatively tolerant in practice . ignoring the big issues more serious issues are not debated because neither of the two political parties can come up with a solution .
no matter how big their electoral victory , some problems would require a major , long-term national agreement . you need such an agreement to stem the decline of the educational system , which according to the most serious international evaluations continues to worsen , harming both the strength of our citizens and our economic competitiveness .
you need such an agreement for international politics as well , in order to regain a position of power in the european union and to establish more cordial relations with the united states . the two big national parties also need to decide definitively on the federal map of the country , which is in constant danger of being altered by extremism and nationalism .
without a shared agreement and without giving in to the temptations of xenophobia and demagoguery , it 's impossible to create solid immigration policies that accept the rights and obligations of those immigrants that our country is able to absorb . most experts , except the government , agree that the spanish economy is nearing the end of an era of growth .
there is also the problem of geographical inequalities in the distribution of water .
spain is the country in europe most threatened by desertification : one part of our territory receives abundant rain ; the other lives in permanent danger of drought . rhetoric trumps action with all of the divisions between parties and regional egoisms , solutions seem unlikely .
is any party proposing the improvement of public services , austerity and public sector professionalism ?
it does n't appear that the parties think of this , nor does it seem that they are in favor of toning down their belligerence to concentrate on the search for rational solutions . except for the staunchest supporters , the majority of spaniards are following the electoral campaign only reluctantly and we are glad that there are n't posters on the streets .

the case of a bavarian who decided to trade in smoking for gambling certainly beats all those draconian health warnings on cigarette packets as convincing proof that stubbing out has its perks .
for the last three years , he 's been trading in the money he used to spend on cigarettes every week for a lottery ticket .
the odds were against this ever proving to be more than just another of those desperate tricks smokers use to persuade themselves to quit , but last saturday he hit the jackpot , winning 1.17 million euros -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- in the game 77 version of the state lottery and becoming an overnight millionaire .
self-improvement , a lucrative business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : improved health , and loads of money into the bargain : how hard can giving up be ?
the winner said he intended to use some of the money to pay off his house , but apart from that had no fixed plans on what to do with the windfall .

" i will not stand for election on april 5 , as i can not guarantee a majority , " ypsilanti told reporters on friday , march 7 , ditching a controversial plan to build a minority alliance with the green party tolerated by germany 's far-left party in the western state of hesse .
the move amounted to ypsilanti going back on a pledge not to work with the grouping of ex-communists and leftist social democrat deserters from western germany . “ we can not take this path , since there are parliamentarians with us that will not go down this path , ” ypsilanti said in a statement . earlier , a renegade spd member in hesse 's state legislature , dagmar metzger , had made it clear that she would not back a deal with the left party which is considered by many in the spd as being unreliable and populist . after a deadlocked state election on jan .
27 , hesse was left scrambling to form a government .
both the spd and incumbent premier roland koch 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- won 42 seats each in the 110-seat legislature . cdu to seek other partners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch is looking for new friends spd head kurt beck had given ypsilanti the green light to pursue a cooperation with the left party , sparking a uproar in social democratic ranks .
the move also raised questions about beck 's credibility and his presumed bid to challenge chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal election . ypsilanti said earlier in the week that her decision to break with pre-election promises not to rely on the left party for votes had been " very , very difficult " for her . koch had urged the spd to consider a " grand coalition " together with the conservatives , similar to chancellor angela merkel 's model at the federal level .
he said friday that his conservative party would seek coalition talks with the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the greens , which have 11 and nine seats respectively in the state legislature . the greens have so far ruled out a coalition with the conservatives . neither of the two major parties can attain a majority of 56 seats with just one partner , but would need to get either the left party or the greens on board as well . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seperately , pay talks collapsed between public sector employers and unions . deutsche bahn on friday said it had gone to court in a bid to block the threatened strike on national and suburban networks by train drivers ' union , gdl . a spokesman said deutsche bahn has lodged a complaint with the labor court in frankfurt and was expecting a ruling on monday morning .
this dispute is not about pay , but demarcation between the trade unions .
drivers organized in a small union , the gdl , are planning to shut down all passenger and freight operations , if deutsche bahn does not grant them a separate labor contract , with no right of veto held by larger unions.gdl has staged a series of warning strikes since summer , but is frustrated that agreements the union made with deutsche bahn afterwards have yet to be finalized .
deutsche bahn said earlier friday it had devised a back-up plan to limit the fallout and promised that at least half of normal trains should run on monday even if gdl went ahead with the strike .
deutsche bahn has been backed by the big unions , which traditionally depend on the drivers ' strength to win pay rises for cleaners and clerks .
an earlier deal with deutsche bahn , which was struck after a dispute lasting almost a year , has come unstuck .
db has chartered engines and drivers from other railways companies to haul essential goods trains supplying factories next week .
offer " not acceptable " separately , top government negotiator , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , said public sector employers had called off pay talks with services union , verdi in potsdam near berlin .
the next step will be to take the dispute to arbitration , via a mediation procedure prescribed by german labor law .
schaeuble said the stand-off came because unions refused to budge over public bodies ' demands for longer working hours .
employers had offered to gradually raise pay by 5 percent over two years , if weekly working hours rise from 38.5 to 40 .
" this is not acceptable , " verdi chief frank bsirske told a press conference .
" we did not see progress on an offer .
we were told to accept an extension of the working week as a pre-condition for an improved offer . "

it wo n't be in the form of the traditional iron cross , said the government . president horst koehler has " approved in principle " a proposal by defense minister franz josef jung to introduce the new military honor , the presidential spokesman said thursday , march 6 . germany over the last half a century has awarded military decorations for special achievement , length of duty and for tours lasting over 30 days , but no medals for bravery have been given since world war ii . there was no word as to when the new medal would be introduced , what it would look like or what the criteria would be to receive it . no plans to resurrect iron cross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iron cross , seen here next to the german flag , is the bundeswehr 's official emblem the defense ministry , however , said on thursday that it would not resemble the iron cross - a wartime decoration introduced by prussian emperor friedrich wilhelm iii in 1813 .
the symbol was later adopted by the nazis , who combined it with a swastika . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , conservative parliamentarian ernst-reinhard beck had recommended modeling the new medal on the iron cross .
beck , a member of angela merkel 's christian democratic union , is also head of germany 's army reservists association . " we should reclaim the positive side of this symbol now that the war has been over for more than 60 years and that the bundeswehr has , over half a century , established a tradition which has nothing to do with the nazi era , " said beck . he conceded that the iron cross is associated with the world wars but said it could also serve as a " symbol of hope . " the design is still used today as the german military 's national emblem and appears on aircraft and tanks . defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe said there was no thought of bringing back the iron cross , " not only because of its third reich connotations , but because it was awarded for war service and we are not a nation at war .

" fitna " was produced by geert wilders , leader of the dutch freedom party and the netherlands ' most outspoken critic of islam . in the past , wilders has deemed the quran incompatible with dutch values .
he recently said his film will show how the muslim holy book is " an inspiration for intolerance , murder and terror . " " fitna " is an arabic term used in the quran usually translated as " strife " or " discord . " damaging dutch political and economic interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders said he had hoped for his film to be broadcast on dutch tv the dutch government has warned that the film might spark unrest and sanctions similar to those triggered when danish newspapers published a cartoon of the prophet mohammad in 2006 . on friday , prime minister jan peter balkenende warned wilders that the release of his film could have " far-reaching security consequences " and even " deaths , " calling on him to take responsibility for the possible consequences of the film . foreign minister maxime verhagen has met ambassadors from muslim countries to discuss the matter , emphasizing that the government does not share wilders ' views .
he asked them to make sure that dutch citizens and buildings abroad are protected . nato , meanwhile , is believed to be concerned about the safety of its troops in afghanistan after hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of mazar-i-sharif earlier in the week in protest .
the crowds set fire to dutch flags and called for the immediate withdrawal of the dutch army from afghanistan . " i fear that soldiers will come under fire because of this film , and i am not afraid to say so , " said nato general secretary jaap de hoop . various dutch employers ' associations and employees unions , as well as representatives of the protestant church have also urged wilders not to release the film . security measures the dutch counter-terrorism agency said in a report to parliament thursday that the new threat assessment was also influenced by arrests elsewhere in europe that had thwarted attacks by groups directed or influenced by al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan . the last time the threat level was this high was after an islamic militant killed director theo van gogh in 2004 over a film he made accusing islam of condoning violence against women . the netherlands has a four-stage risk classification system .
the lowest is " minimal , " the highest is " critical . " the counter-terrorism agency cut the threat level to the second-lowest " limited " last april , reported reuters , citing little fresh activity by militant networks in the country and growing resistance to radicalization among the one million muslims in the netherlands . in its new report , the agency noted that the country 's main muslim organizations had called for calm in response to the wilders film . stoking tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are dutch troops at risk wilders is expected to release the film on march 28 at the government press center in the hague , where security measures are already in place . in an interview dutch newspaper nrc handelsblad thursday , wilders said he was disappointed that no dutch broadcaster had been willing to show it . " i had hoped that a television broadcaster would say : ' you have the right to do this , we will give you a podium , " ' he said . " fitna " will also be made available online . a majority of dutch people want the film to be broadcast even though they fear it will stoke tension with muslims and harm relations with arab nations , a poll showed on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government blamed eta seperatists for the killing and suspended campaigning . the basque separatist group eta is seen as the likely culprit behind the assassination of a former socialist local council member , isaias carrasco on friday , march 7 .
" this is a vile , cowardly act worthy of all our condemnation , carried out by a group of murderers who will never succeed in breaking the will of spanish democracy , " socialist interior minister alfredo rubalcaba told reporters .
the shooting came on the last day of official campaigning before spaniards go to the polls sunday to choose their next government .
both the governing socialist party and the opposition popular party cancelled their final rallies friday .
socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero currently leads the conservative popular party by about four percentage points in opinion polls .
uncertain election outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative supporters wave popular party flags yet the shooting could change the election outcome .
zapatero had controversially opened peace talks with eta before abandoning them in december 2006 after eta killed two people with a car bomb .
the killing in the basque country is not likely to alter this election outcome , said julian santamaria , a politics professor at madrid 's complutense university .
it could increase voter turnout , santamaria told reuters .
" it might mean more people get out and vote on sunday , " he said .
placing the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're in a tight race in the 2004 elections , zapatero 's socialists were trailing the popular party in the weeks leading up to the elections .
then , three days before the elections , train bombings during morning rush hour in madrid killed 191 people .
the popular party blamed eta although evidence from the beginning showed that radical islamists were responsible .
spaniards were outraged and voted the socialist party into office .
but this year , basque separatism had taken a back seat to issues such as the slowing economy and immigration .
eta has killed 800 people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta has killed 800 people isaias carrasco , a former socialist council member , was assassinated in front of his wife and young daughter outside his house in a small town in the basque region .
eta has killed more than 800 people in the past four decades in an attempt to gain independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an automous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
zapatero has been accused by the right of being soft on basque separatists .
but no criticism was heard friday .
" this is a day of mourning .
we should all stand by the family of isaias carrasco and remain united , united against eta , " said popular party candidate mariano rajoy . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seperately , pay talks collapsed between public sector employers and unions . deutsche bahn on friday said it had gone to court in a bid to block the threatened strike on national and suburban networks by train drivers ' union , gdl . a spokesman said deutsche bahn has lodged a complaint with the labor court in frankfurt and was expecting a ruling on monday morning .
this dispute is not about pay , but demarcation between the trade unions .
drivers organized in a small union , the gdl , are planning to shut down all passenger and freight operations , if deutsche bahn does not grant them a separate labor contract , with no right of veto held by larger unions.gdl has staged a series of warning strikes since summer , but is frustrated that agreements the union made with deutsche bahn afterwards have yet to be finalized .
deutsche bahn said earlier friday it had devised a back-up plan to limit the fallout and promised that at least half of normal trains should run on monday even if gdl went ahead with the strike .
deutsche bahn has been backed by the big unions , which traditionally depend on the drivers ' strength to win pay rises for cleaners and clerks .
an earlier deal with deutsche bahn , which was struck after a dispute lasting almost a year , has come unstuck .
db has chartered engines and drivers from other railways companies to haul essential goods trains supplying factories next week .
offer " not acceptable " separately , top government negotiator , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , said public sector employers had called off pay talks with services union , verdi in potsdam near berlin .
the next step will be to take the dispute to arbitration , via a mediation procedure prescribed by german labor law .
schaeuble said the stand-off came because unions refused to budge over public bodies ' demands for longer working hours .
employers had offered to gradually raise pay by 5 percent over two years , if weekly working hours rise from 38.5 to 40 .
" this is not acceptable , " verdi chief frank bsirske told a press conference .
" we did not see progress on an offer .
we were told to accept an extension of the working week as a pre-condition for an improved offer . "
stepping up pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the train strikes are causing chaos against a backdrop of slackening economic growth , unions are pushing to secure wage gains for the low paid sectors before the next round of belt tightening .
verdi and other unions have been stepping up pressure in recent weeks , with nurses , refuse collectors , airport workers , administrative staff and childcare professionals participating in rolling strikes .
verdi is fighting to get an 8 percent increase in salary or an additional 200 euros -lrb- $ 300 -rrb- per month .
in a second conflict currently raging in the capital , verdi 's public transport workers continued an unlimited strike for a third day , and are gearing up for an all-out strike next week .
berlin 's underground transit train system came to a standstill , and only 100 out of 1200 city buses continued to operate .
the strikes caused chaos amongst commuters , who were forced to walk or use cars and taxis .
government appeals to unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union are demanding an 8 percent pay rise for employees in public services the german government appealed friday to the train drivers and deutsche bahn to think twice about an all-out confrontation and the rail strike next week .
" the renewed escalation is difficult to sympathize with , " said ulrich wilhelm , chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman .
he appealed to the company , which is owned by berlin but independently managed , and the gdl drivers ' union to end their dispute for the sake of other employees , rail customers and the germany economy .
" the minister appeals to both parties to leave no stone unturned to avoid a strike .
a strike would be immensely bad for the economy , for millions of passengers .
we appeal to common sense of both parties to come to a settlement at the last minute , " said a spokesman for transport minister wolfgang tiefensee . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's now set to reopen friday , march 7 with a concert starring clarinetist giora feidman playing jewish klezmer music . the foundation stone was laid in 1935 , but the gigantic oval building on dutzendteich lake , modeled on the coliseum in rome , but 25 percent bigger , was never finished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl filmed " triumph of the will " in nuremberg the building was part of the nazi rally grounds where hitler held his massive military parades during the third reich .
it memorably featured as a backdrop in leni riefenstahl 's propaganda documentary " triumph of the will , " which was commissioned by hitler as a chronicle of the 1934 nazi party congress . today , its outer walls surround a field of weeds , which nuremberg kept as a warning against fascism for future generations . but two completed annex buildings have since been remodeled , both symbolically broken open with walls and ceilings of glass . one opened in 2000 as a museum documenting the atrocities of the third reich . a venue reborn the other has been revamped as a concert hall with over 500 seats in a redevelopment which took 14 months and cost some 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.9 million -rrb- . it is set to open friday with an inaugural performance by the clarinetist giora feidman , who specializes in jewish music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giora feidman in 2010 , the venue will become the new home of the nuremberg symphony orchestra .
until then it will serve as a temporary venue for the city 's state theater while its own premises are redeveloped . the orchestra has been using the southern wing of the building , which has not been renovated , since 1963 for its rehearsals . the burden of history the city has spent years debating whether to keep the vast neo-classicist park built by the nazis for displays of mass loyalty to dictator adolf hitler or to tear it down . ultimately , it was decided to use one annex for music as a deliberate counterpoint to the nazi cult of violence . in german history , the city is inextricably tied to the third reich .
nuremberg was chosen by the nazis as the center of their " aryan " world , with hitler conferring upon nuremberg the title " city of the party rallies . " up to a million party members would travel to nuremberg for the week-long rallies , and it was here that " der führer " gave many of his speeches on the supposed superiority of the aryan race . the city was also home to the nuremberg trials , which tried nazi leaders for crimes against humanity after world war ii . bildunterschrift : banishing the ghosts of the past dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will not stand for election on april 5 , as i can not guarantee a majority , " ypsilanti told reporters on friday , march 7 , ditching a controversial plan to build a minority alliance with the green party tolerated by germany 's far-left party in the western state of hesse .
the move amounted to ypsilanti going back on a pledge not to work with the grouping of ex-communists and leftist social democrat deserters from western germany . “ we can not take this path , since there are parliamentarians with us that will not go down this path , ” ypsilanti said in a statement . earlier , a renegade spd member in hesse 's state legislature , dagmar metzger , had made it clear that she would not back a deal with the left party which is considered by many in the spd as being unreliable and populist . after a deadlocked state election on jan .
27 , hesse was left scrambling to form a government .

the move also raised questions about beck 's credibility and his presumed bid to challenge chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal election . ypsilanti said earlier in the week that her decision to break with pre-election promises not to rely on the left party for votes had been " very , very difficult " for her . koch had urged the spd to consider a " grand coalition " together with the conservatives , similar to chancellor angela merkel 's model at the federal level .
he said friday that his conservative party would seek coalition talks with the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the greens , which have 11 and nine seats respectively in the state legislature . the greens have so far ruled out a coalition with the conservatives . neither of the two major parties can attain a majority of 56 seats with just one partner , but would need to get either the left party or the greens on board as well . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seperately , pay talks collapsed between public sector employers and unions . deutsche bahn on friday said it had gone to court in a bid to block the threatened strike on national and suburban networks by train drivers ' union , gdl . a spokesman said deutsche bahn has lodged a complaint with the labor court in frankfurt and was expecting a ruling on monday morning .
this dispute is not about pay , but demarcation between the trade unions .
drivers organized in a small union , the gdl , are planning to shut down all passenger and freight operations , if deutsche bahn does not grant them a separate labor contract , with no right of veto held by larger unions.gdl has staged a series of warning strikes since summer , but is frustrated that agreements the union made with deutsche bahn afterwards have yet to be finalized .
deutsche bahn said earlier friday it had devised a back-up plan to limit the fallout and promised that at least half of normal trains should run on monday even if gdl went ahead with the strike .
deutsche bahn has been backed by the big unions , which traditionally depend on the drivers ' strength to win pay rises for cleaners and clerks .
an earlier deal with deutsche bahn , which was struck after a dispute lasting almost a year , has come unstuck .
db has chartered engines and drivers from other railways companies to haul essential goods trains supplying factories next week .
offer " not acceptable " separately , top government negotiator , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , said public sector employers had called off pay talks with services union , verdi in potsdam near berlin .
the next step will be to take the dispute to arbitration , via a mediation procedure prescribed by german labor law .
schaeuble said the stand-off came because unions refused to budge over public bodies ' demands for longer working hours .
employers had offered to gradually raise pay by 5 percent over two years , if weekly working hours rise from 38.5 to 40 .
" this is not acceptable , " verdi chief frank bsirske told a press conference .
" we did not see progress on an offer .
we were told to accept an extension of the working week as a pre-condition for an improved offer . "

seperately , pay talks collapsed between public sector employers and unions . deutsche bahn on friday said it had gone to court in a bid to block the threatened strike on national and suburban networks by train drivers ' union , gdl . a spokesman said deutsche bahn has lodged a complaint with the labor court in frankfurt and was expecting a ruling on monday morning .
this dispute is not about pay , but demarcation between the trade unions .
drivers organized in a small union , the gdl , are planning to shut down all passenger and freight operations , if deutsche bahn does not grant them a separate labor contract , with no right of veto held by larger unions.gdl has staged a series of warning strikes since summer , but is frustrated that agreements the union made with deutsche bahn afterwards have yet to be finalized .
deutsche bahn said earlier friday it had devised a back-up plan to limit the fallout and promised that at least half of normal trains should run on monday even if gdl went ahead with the strike .
deutsche bahn has been backed by the big unions , which traditionally depend on the drivers ' strength to win pay rises for cleaners and clerks .
an earlier deal with deutsche bahn , which was struck after a dispute lasting almost a year , has come unstuck .
db has chartered engines and drivers from other railways companies to haul essential goods trains supplying factories next week .
offer " not acceptable " separately , top government negotiator , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , said public sector employers had called off pay talks with services union , verdi in potsdam near berlin .
the next step will be to take the dispute to arbitration , via a mediation procedure prescribed by german labor law .
schaeuble said the stand-off came because unions refused to budge over public bodies ' demands for longer working hours .
employers had offered to gradually raise pay by 5 percent over two years , if weekly working hours rise from 38.5 to 40 .
" this is not acceptable , " verdi chief frank bsirske told a press conference .
" we did not see progress on an offer .
we were told to accept an extension of the working week as a pre-condition for an improved offer . "

it wo n't be in the form of the traditional iron cross , said the government . president horst koehler has " approved in principle " a proposal by defense minister franz josef jung to introduce the new military honor , the presidential spokesman said thursday , march 6 . germany over the last half a century has awarded military decorations for special achievement , length of duty and for tours lasting over 30 days , but no medals for bravery have been given since world war ii . there was no word as to when the new medal would be introduced , what it would look like or what the criteria would be to receive it . no plans to resurrect iron cross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iron cross , seen here next to the german flag , is the bundeswehr 's official emblem the defense ministry , however , said on thursday that it would not resemble the iron cross - a wartime decoration introduced by prussian emperor friedrich wilhelm iii in 1813 .
the symbol was later adopted by the nazis , who combined it with a swastika . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , conservative parliamentarian ernst-reinhard beck had recommended modeling the new medal on the iron cross .
beck , a member of angela merkel 's christian democratic union , is also head of germany 's army reservists association . " we should reclaim the positive side of this symbol now that the war has been over for more than 60 years and that the bundeswehr has , over half a century , established a tradition which has nothing to do with the nazi era , " said beck . he conceded that the iron cross is associated with the world wars but said it could also serve as a " symbol of hope . " the design is still used today as the german military 's national emblem and appears on aircraft and tanks . defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe said there was no thought of bringing back the iron cross , " not only because of its third reich connotations , but because it was awarded for war service and we are not a nation at war . " medal plan meets opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 german troops are stationed abroad some left-wing politicians have spoken out against introducing any kind of bravery medal for soldiers . " german history has shown us that whenever soldiery was celebrated in society with monuments and honors , it was often a harbinger of germany 's involvement in wars , " said paul schaefer , a defense policy spokesman for the left party . a defense expert from the social democratic party , rainer arnold , told the friday edition of the märkische allgemeine zeitung that a military honor should n't be reduced to courage alone .
he added that he did n't have anything against rewarding soldiers for special achievements where bravery was also displayed , but that these types of medals already existed . the proposal for the medal comes as germany 's participation in international peacekeeping mission has increased in recent years .
it currently has 9,000 troops stations abroad in 10 separate missions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it wo n't be in the form of the traditional iron cross , said the government . president horst koehler has " approved in principle " a proposal by defense minister franz josef jung to introduce the new military honor , the presidential spokesman said thursday , march 6 . germany over the last half a century has awarded military decorations for special achievement , length of duty and for tours lasting over 30 days , but no medals for bravery have been given since world war ii . there was no word as to when the new medal would be introduced , what it would look like or what the criteria would be to receive it . no plans to resurrect iron cross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iron cross , seen here next to the german flag , is the bundeswehr 's official emblem the defense ministry , however , said on thursday that it would not resemble the iron cross - a wartime decoration introduced by prussian emperor friedrich wilhelm iii in 1813 .
the symbol was later adopted by the nazis , who combined it with a swastika . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , conservative parliamentarian ernst-reinhard beck had recommended modeling the new medal on the iron cross .
beck , a member of angela merkel 's christian democratic union , is also head of germany 's army reservists association . " we should reclaim the positive side of this symbol now that the war has been over for more than 60 years and that the bundeswehr has , over half a century , established a tradition which has nothing to do with the nazi era , " said beck . he conceded that the iron cross is associated with the world wars but said it could also serve as a " symbol of hope . " the design is still used today as the german military 's national emblem and appears on aircraft and tanks . defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe said there was no thought of bringing back the iron cross , " not only because of its third reich connotations , but because it was awarded for war service and we are not a nation at war . " medal plan meets opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 german troops are stationed abroad some left-wing politicians have spoken out against introducing any kind of bravery medal for soldiers . " german history has shown us that whenever soldiery was celebrated in society with monuments and honors , it was often a harbinger of germany 's involvement in wars , " said paul schaefer , a defense policy spokesman for the left party . a defense expert from the social democratic party , rainer arnold , told the friday edition of the märkische allgemeine zeitung that a military honor should n't be reduced to courage alone .
he added that he did n't have anything against rewarding soldiers for special achievements where bravery was also displayed , but that these types of medals already existed . the proposal for the medal comes as germany 's participation in international peacekeeping mission has increased in recent years .
it currently has 9,000 troops stations abroad in 10 separate missions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we still have differences of opinion but they can be bridged , " michael freytag , the cdu 's regional head , said on thursday after the party 's board agreed to open talks with the greens .
the move highlights the conservatives ' preference to work with the greens instead of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unlikely marriage - the greens ' christa goetsch with the cdu 's von beust talk of the unusual alliance first erupted when a feb .
24 election in the city failed to provide a clear parliamentary majority for the cdu after their traditional partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , did not surpass the 5-percent hurdle to get into parliament . unusual bedfellows after seven hours of exploratory talks on wednesday , the two parties announced they had discovered " much common ground . " however , several green members have resisted the idea of teaming up with the cdu , a traditional political adversary , and the subject has prompted much soul-searching in the ecologically minded party .
although there is a degree of common ground between the two parties , for example , in certain economic policies and in their appeal to the well-heeled - they still differ substantially on many issues . in hamburg , the parties are split on several major issues , including a proposal to deepen the elbe river to prepare germany 's biggest port for a new generation of container ships and the planned construction of a new coal-fired power station that would be the largest of its kind in the country .
the greens oppose both projects on environmental grounds . the green party in the city-state of hamburg , where it goes by the name gal , signaled on thursday that they were prepared to enter negotiations for a " black-green " coalition with the conservatives in hamburg . gal party chief , anja hajduk said the cdu was willing to soften its position on the new coal-fired power station and was open for an alternative . former president calls for changes to constitution the mold-breaking tie-up between the greens and the conservatives is n't the only new political grouping on the german political landscape .
a steady decline in support for germany 's two biggest parties , the cdu and the spd , have led to the rise of parties like the far-left " die linke " which has made it tougher to form stable governments both at the federal and state level and led to new and risky political constellations . the development prompted former german president roman herzog on thursday to call for changes to germany 's constitution to counter the rise of fringe parties he said risked spawning unstable coalitions reminiscent of the weimar republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog is the first major german figure to call for a change to the constitution to deter fringe parties herzog , who served as german president from 1994 to 1999 , wrote in thursday 's sueddeutsche zeitung daily that germany was witnessing a fundamental shift in its system of government and suggested that its constitution , or " basic law , " which dates back to 1949 , should be adapted . " it will become increasingly difficult to form stable majorities and keep them together , " herzog wrote .
" it is clear that the danger of minority governments will rise . " the rise of the greens in the 1980s and more recently " die linke , " or left party - a grouping of ex-communists and western german spd deserters - means that five parties regularly clear the 5-percent hurdle , complicating the formation of political majorities . herzog said germans would not accept a british winner-takes-all approach , but added that french rules calling for candidates to win absolute majorities , which often leads to run-off elections , may be a good idea . the current german system requires the top party in any given election to form a majority in parliament , if necessary in coalition with another party or parties , to take power . rules put in place after world war two require parties to pass the five percent support threshold to enter parliament . herzog 's suggestion , the first proposal by an influential german politician to change the constitution because of fringe parties , was rejected by the cdu and spd , as well as opposition parties . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seperately , pay talks collapsed between public sector employers and unions . deutsche bahn on friday said it had gone to court in a bid to block the threatened strike on national and suburban networks by train drivers ' union , gdl . a spokesman said deutsche bahn has lodged a complaint with the labor court in frankfurt and was expecting a ruling on monday morning .
this dispute is not about pay , but demarcation between the trade unions .
drivers organized in a small union , the gdl , are planning to shut down all passenger and freight operations , if deutsche bahn does not grant them a separate labor contract , with no right of veto held by larger unions.gdl has staged a series of warning strikes since summer , but is frustrated that agreements the union made with deutsche bahn afterwards have yet to be finalized .
deutsche bahn said earlier friday it had devised a back-up plan to limit the fallout and promised that at least half of normal trains should run on monday even if gdl went ahead with the strike .
deutsche bahn has been backed by the big unions , which traditionally depend on the drivers ' strength to win pay rises for cleaners and clerks .
an earlier deal with deutsche bahn , which was struck after a dispute lasting almost a year , has come unstuck .

offer " not acceptable " separately , top government negotiator , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , said public sector employers had called off pay talks with services union , verdi in potsdam near berlin .
the next step will be to take the dispute to arbitration , via a mediation procedure prescribed by german labor law .
schaeuble said the stand-off came because unions refused to budge over public bodies ' demands for longer working hours .
employers had offered to gradually raise pay by 5 percent over two years , if weekly working hours rise from 38.5 to 40 .
" this is not acceptable , " verdi chief frank bsirske told a press conference .
" we did not see progress on an offer .
we were told to accept an extension of the working week as a pre-condition for an improved offer . "

verdi and other unions have been stepping up pressure in recent weeks , with nurses , refuse collectors , airport workers , administrative staff and childcare professionals participating in rolling strikes .
verdi is fighting to get an 8 percent increase in salary or an additional 200 euros -lrb- $ 300 -rrb- per month .
in a second conflict currently raging in the capital , verdi 's public transport workers continued an unlimited strike for a third day , and are gearing up for an all-out strike next week .
berlin 's underground transit train system came to a standstill , and only 100 out of 1200 city buses continued to operate .
the strikes caused chaos amongst commuters , who were forced to walk or use cars and taxis .
government appeals to unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union are demanding an 8 percent pay rise for employees in public services the german government appealed friday to the train drivers and deutsche bahn to think twice about an all-out confrontation and the rail strike next week .
" the renewed escalation is difficult to sympathize with , " said ulrich wilhelm , chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman .
he appealed to the company , which is owned by berlin but independently managed , and the gdl drivers ' union to end their dispute for the sake of other employees , rail customers and the germany economy .
" the minister appeals to both parties to leave no stone unturned to avoid a strike .
a strike would be immensely bad for the economy , for millions of passengers .
we appeal to common sense of both parties to come to a settlement at the last minute , " said a spokesman for transport minister wolfgang tiefensee . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seperately , pay talks collapsed between public sector employers and unions . deutsche bahn on friday said it had gone to court in a bid to block the threatened strike on national and suburban networks by train drivers ' union , gdl . a spokesman said deutsche bahn has lodged a complaint with the labor court in frankfurt and was expecting a ruling on monday morning .
this dispute is not about pay , but demarcation between the trade unions .
drivers organized in a small union , the gdl , are planning to shut down all passenger and freight operations , if deutsche bahn does not grant them a separate labor contract , with no right of veto held by larger unions.gdl has staged a series of warning strikes since summer , but is frustrated that agreements the union made with deutsche bahn afterwards have yet to be finalized .
deutsche bahn said earlier friday it had devised a back-up plan to limit the fallout and promised that at least half of normal trains should run on monday even if gdl went ahead with the strike .
deutsche bahn has been backed by the big unions , which traditionally depend on the drivers ' strength to win pay rises for cleaners and clerks .
an earlier deal with deutsche bahn , which was struck after a dispute lasting almost a year , has come unstuck .
db has chartered engines and drivers from other railways companies to haul essential goods trains supplying factories next week .
offer " not acceptable " separately , top government negotiator , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , said public sector employers had called off pay talks with services union , verdi in potsdam near berlin .
the next step will be to take the dispute to arbitration , via a mediation procedure prescribed by german labor law .
schaeuble said the stand-off came because unions refused to budge over public bodies ' demands for longer working hours .
employers had offered to gradually raise pay by 5 percent over two years , if weekly working hours rise from 38.5 to 40 .
" this is not acceptable , " verdi chief frank bsirske told a press conference .
" we did not see progress on an offer .
we were told to accept an extension of the working week as a pre-condition for an improved offer . "
stepping up pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the train strikes are causing chaos against a backdrop of slackening economic growth , unions are pushing to secure wage gains for the low paid sectors before the next round of belt tightening .
verdi and other unions have been stepping up pressure in recent weeks , with nurses , refuse collectors , airport workers , administrative staff and childcare professionals participating in rolling strikes .
verdi is fighting to get an 8 percent increase in salary or an additional 200 euros -lrb- $ 300 -rrb- per month .
in a second conflict currently raging in the capital , verdi 's public transport workers continued an unlimited strike for a third day , and are gearing up for an all-out strike next week .
berlin 's underground transit train system came to a standstill , and only 100 out of 1200 city buses continued to operate .
the strikes caused chaos amongst commuters , who were forced to walk or use cars and taxis .
government appeals to unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union are demanding an 8 percent pay rise for employees in public services the german government appealed friday to the train drivers and deutsche bahn to think twice about an all-out confrontation and the rail strike next week .
" the renewed escalation is difficult to sympathize with , " said ulrich wilhelm , chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman .
he appealed to the company , which is owned by berlin but independently managed , and the gdl drivers ' union to end their dispute for the sake of other employees , rail customers and the germany economy .
" the minister appeals to both parties to leave no stone unturned to avoid a strike .
a strike would be immensely bad for the economy , for millions of passengers .
we appeal to common sense of both parties to come to a settlement at the last minute , " said a spokesman for transport minister wolfgang tiefensee . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move amounted to ypsilanti going back on a pledge not to work with the grouping of ex-communists and leftist social democrat deserters from western germany . “ we can not take this path , since there are parliamentarians with us that will not go down this path , ” ypsilanti said in a statement . earlier , a renegade spd member in hesse 's state legislature , dagmar metzger , had made it clear that she would not back a deal with the left party which is considered by many in the spd as being unreliable and populist . after a deadlocked state election on jan .

it wo n't be in the form of the traditional iron cross , said the government . president horst koehler has " approved in principle " a proposal by defense minister franz josef jung to introduce the new military honor , the presidential spokesman said thursday , march 6 . germany over the last half a century has awarded military decorations for special achievement , length of duty and for tours lasting over 30 days , but no medals for bravery have been given since world war ii . there was no word as to when the new medal would be introduced , what it would look like or what the criteria would be to receive it . no plans to resurrect iron cross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iron cross , seen here next to the german flag , is the bundeswehr 's official emblem the defense ministry , however , said on thursday that it would not resemble the iron cross - a wartime decoration introduced by prussian emperor friedrich wilhelm iii in 1813 .
the symbol was later adopted by the nazis , who combined it with a swastika . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , conservative parliamentarian ernst-reinhard beck had recommended modeling the new medal on the iron cross .
beck , a member of angela merkel 's christian democratic union , is also head of germany 's army reservists association . " we should reclaim the positive side of this symbol now that the war has been over for more than 60 years and that the bundeswehr has , over half a century , established a tradition which has nothing to do with the nazi era , " said beck . he conceded that the iron cross is associated with the world wars but said it could also serve as a " symbol of hope . " the design is still used today as the german military 's national emblem and appears on aircraft and tanks . defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe said there was no thought of bringing back the iron cross , " not only because of its third reich connotations , but because it was awarded for war service and we are not a nation at war . " medal plan meets opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 german troops are stationed abroad some left-wing politicians have spoken out against introducing any kind of bravery medal for soldiers . " german history has shown us that whenever soldiery was celebrated in society with monuments and honors , it was often a harbinger of germany 's involvement in wars , " said paul schaefer , a defense policy spokesman for the left party . a defense expert from the social democratic party , rainer arnold , told the friday edition of the märkische allgemeine zeitung that a military honor should n't be reduced to courage alone .
he added that he did n't have anything against rewarding soldiers for special achievements where bravery was also displayed , but that these types of medals already existed . the proposal for the medal comes as germany 's participation in international peacekeeping mission has increased in recent years .
it currently has 9,000 troops stations abroad in 10 separate missions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this made me think of the first democratic campaign in spain that i participated in with such hope 31 years ago .
i reached voting age - 21 years old at the time - at the same time democracy arrived to my country . we had n't had free elections since february of 1936 , only a few months before the military rebellion against the spanish republic and the start of the spanish civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : antonio munoz molina in that first election of 1977 , street walls were plastered with posters , flags and handbills featuring the candidates ' faces .
the air was full of speeches emanating from car loudspeakers . voting for democracy 's sake this morning i went out to take a walk and realized that none of this exists today .
just as in the past , elections come up frequently and , as usual , the candidates make themselves hoarse repeating excessive promises and launching tasteless attacks against their adversaries .
but this time the city is quiet and the people appear to be focused on their personal affairs , removed from the melodrama of political confrontation . spaniards will not only vote , but will do so in very high numbers .
those of us with doubts will go as well , despite the fact that we do n't identify with any of the major candidates and despite wishing that the campaigns would have discussed more ideas and offered fewer empty slogans . in spain , the division between the left and the right , between the socialist party and the people 's party is very strong .
this is in contrast to the moderate tone of the immense majority of the country and the limited actual differences between the parties ' proposals . issues such as homosexual marriage , abortion rights and the catholic church 's involvement in education have provoked large confrontations among some people .
but the majority of the population , including catholics , is relatively tolerant in practice . ignoring the big issues more serious issues are not debated because neither of the two political parties can come up with a solution .
no matter how big their electoral victory , some problems would require a major , long-term national agreement . you need such an agreement to stem the decline of the educational system , which according to the most serious international evaluations continues to worsen , harming both the strength of our citizens and our economic competitiveness .
you need such an agreement for international politics as well , in order to regain a position of power in the european union and to establish more cordial relations with the united states . the two big national parties also need to decide definitively on the federal map of the country , which is in constant danger of being altered by extremism and nationalism .
without a shared agreement and without giving in to the temptations of xenophobia and demagoguery , it 's impossible to create solid immigration policies that accept the rights and obligations of those immigrants that our country is able to absorb . most experts , except the government , agree that the spanish economy is nearing the end of an era of growth .
there is also the problem of geographical inequalities in the distribution of water .
spain is the country in europe most threatened by desertification : one part of our territory receives abundant rain ; the other lives in permanent danger of drought . rhetoric trumps action with all of the divisions between parties and regional egoisms , solutions seem unlikely .
is any party proposing the improvement of public services , austerity and public sector professionalism ?
it does n't appear that the parties think of this , nor does it seem that they are in favor of toning down their belligerence to concentrate on the search for rational solutions . except for the staunchest supporters , the majority of spaniards are following the electoral campaign only reluctantly and we are glad that there are n't posters on the streets .

this made me think of the first democratic campaign in spain that i participated in with such hope 31 years ago .
i reached voting age - 21 years old at the time - at the same time democracy arrived to my country . we had n't had free elections since february of 1936 , only a few months before the military rebellion against the spanish republic and the start of the spanish civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : antonio munoz molina in that first election of 1977 , street walls were plastered with posters , flags and handbills featuring the candidates ' faces .
the air was full of speeches emanating from car loudspeakers . voting for democracy 's sake this morning i went out to take a walk and realized that none of this exists today .
just as in the past , elections come up frequently and , as usual , the candidates make themselves hoarse repeating excessive promises and launching tasteless attacks against their adversaries .
but this time the city is quiet and the people appear to be focused on their personal affairs , removed from the melodrama of political confrontation . spaniards will not only vote , but will do so in very high numbers .
those of us with doubts will go as well , despite the fact that we do n't identify with any of the major candidates and despite wishing that the campaigns would have discussed more ideas and offered fewer empty slogans . in spain , the division between the left and the right , between the socialist party and the people 's party is very strong .
this is in contrast to the moderate tone of the immense majority of the country and the limited actual differences between the parties ' proposals . issues such as homosexual marriage , abortion rights and the catholic church 's involvement in education have provoked large confrontations among some people .
but the majority of the population , including catholics , is relatively tolerant in practice . ignoring the big issues more serious issues are not debated because neither of the two political parties can come up with a solution .
no matter how big their electoral victory , some problems would require a major , long-term national agreement . you need such an agreement to stem the decline of the educational system , which according to the most serious international evaluations continues to worsen , harming both the strength of our citizens and our economic competitiveness .
you need such an agreement for international politics as well , in order to regain a position of power in the european union and to establish more cordial relations with the united states . the two big national parties also need to decide definitively on the federal map of the country , which is in constant danger of being altered by extremism and nationalism .
without a shared agreement and without giving in to the temptations of xenophobia and demagoguery , it 's impossible to create solid immigration policies that accept the rights and obligations of those immigrants that our country is able to absorb . most experts , except the government , agree that the spanish economy is nearing the end of an era of growth .
there is also the problem of geographical inequalities in the distribution of water .
spain is the country in europe most threatened by desertification : one part of our territory receives abundant rain ; the other lives in permanent danger of drought . rhetoric trumps action with all of the divisions between parties and regional egoisms , solutions seem unlikely .
is any party proposing the improvement of public services , austerity and public sector professionalism ?
it does n't appear that the parties think of this , nor does it seem that they are in favor of toning down their belligerence to concentrate on the search for rational solutions . except for the staunchest supporters , the majority of spaniards are following the electoral campaign only reluctantly and we are glad that there are n't posters on the streets .
but many of us , despite our skepticism , will go and vote , if only because we still remember an era in which democracy did n't exist . antonio munoz molina is one of spain 's best-known writers and commentators . -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it memorably featured as a backdrop in leni riefenstahl 's propaganda documentary " triumph of the will , " which was commissioned by hitler as a chronicle of the 1934 nazi party congress . today , its outer walls surround a field of weeds , which nuremberg kept as a warning against fascism for future generations . but two completed annex buildings have since been remodeled , both symbolically broken open with walls and ceilings of glass . one opened in 2000 as a museum documenting the atrocities of the third reich . a venue reborn the other has been revamped as a concert hall with over 500 seats in a redevelopment which took 14 months and cost some 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.9 million -rrb- . it is set to open friday with an inaugural performance by the clarinetist giora feidman , who specializes in jewish music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giora feidman in 2010 , the venue will become the new home of the nuremberg symphony orchestra .

nuremberg was chosen by the nazis as the center of their " aryan " world , with hitler conferring upon nuremberg the title " city of the party rallies . " up to a million party members would travel to nuremberg for the week-long rallies , and it was here that " der führer " gave many of his speeches on the supposed superiority of the aryan race . the city was also home to the nuremberg trials , which tried nazi leaders for crimes against humanity after world war ii . bildunterschrift : banishing the ghosts of the past dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it wo n't be in the form of the traditional iron cross , said the government . president horst koehler has " approved in principle " a proposal by defense minister franz josef jung to introduce the new military honor , the presidential spokesman said thursday , march 6 . germany over the last half a century has awarded military decorations for special achievement , length of duty and for tours lasting over 30 days , but no medals for bravery have been given since world war ii . there was no word as to when the new medal would be introduced , what it would look like or what the criteria would be to receive it . no plans to resurrect iron cross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iron cross , seen here next to the german flag , is the bundeswehr 's official emblem the defense ministry , however , said on thursday that it would not resemble the iron cross - a wartime decoration introduced by prussian emperor friedrich wilhelm iii in 1813 .
the symbol was later adopted by the nazis , who combined it with a swastika . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , conservative parliamentarian ernst-reinhard beck had recommended modeling the new medal on the iron cross .
beck , a member of angela merkel 's christian democratic union , is also head of germany 's army reservists association . " we should reclaim the positive side of this symbol now that the war has been over for more than 60 years and that the bundeswehr has , over half a century , established a tradition which has nothing to do with the nazi era , " said beck . he conceded that the iron cross is associated with the world wars but said it could also serve as a " symbol of hope . " the design is still used today as the german military 's national emblem and appears on aircraft and tanks . defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe said there was no thought of bringing back the iron cross , " not only because of its third reich connotations , but because it was awarded for war service and we are not a nation at war . " medal plan meets opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 german troops are stationed abroad some left-wing politicians have spoken out against introducing any kind of bravery medal for soldiers . " german history has shown us that whenever soldiery was celebrated in society with monuments and honors , it was often a harbinger of germany 's involvement in wars , " said paul schaefer , a defense policy spokesman for the left party . a defense expert from the social democratic party , rainer arnold , told the friday edition of the märkische allgemeine zeitung that a military honor should n't be reduced to courage alone .
he added that he did n't have anything against rewarding soldiers for special achievements where bravery was also displayed , but that these types of medals already existed . the proposal for the medal comes as germany 's participation in international peacekeeping mission has increased in recent years .
it currently has 9,000 troops stations abroad in 10 separate missions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's now set to reopen friday , march 7 with a concert starring clarinetist giora feidman playing jewish klezmer music . the foundation stone was laid in 1935 , but the gigantic oval building on dutzendteich lake , modeled on the coliseum in rome , but 25 percent bigger , was never finished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl filmed " triumph of the will " in nuremberg the building was part of the nazi rally grounds where hitler held his massive military parades during the third reich .
it memorably featured as a backdrop in leni riefenstahl 's propaganda documentary " triumph of the will , " which was commissioned by hitler as a chronicle of the 1934 nazi party congress . today , its outer walls surround a field of weeds , which nuremberg kept as a warning against fascism for future generations . but two completed annex buildings have since been remodeled , both symbolically broken open with walls and ceilings of glass . one opened in 2000 as a museum documenting the atrocities of the third reich . a venue reborn the other has been revamped as a concert hall with over 500 seats in a redevelopment which took 14 months and cost some 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.9 million -rrb- . it is set to open friday with an inaugural performance by the clarinetist giora feidman , who specializes in jewish music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giora feidman in 2010 , the venue will become the new home of the nuremberg symphony orchestra .
until then it will serve as a temporary venue for the city 's state theater while its own premises are redeveloped . the orchestra has been using the southern wing of the building , which has not been renovated , since 1963 for its rehearsals . the burden of history the city has spent years debating whether to keep the vast neo-classicist park built by the nazis for displays of mass loyalty to dictator adolf hitler or to tear it down . ultimately , it was decided to use one annex for music as a deliberate counterpoint to the nazi cult of violence . in german history , the city is inextricably tied to the third reich .
nuremberg was chosen by the nazis as the center of their " aryan " world , with hitler conferring upon nuremberg the title " city of the party rallies . " up to a million party members would travel to nuremberg for the week-long rallies , and it was here that " der führer " gave many of his speeches on the supposed superiority of the aryan race . the city was also home to the nuremberg trials , which tried nazi leaders for crimes against humanity after world war ii . bildunterschrift : banishing the ghosts of the past dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seperately , pay talks collapsed between public sector employers and unions . deutsche bahn on friday said it had gone to court in a bid to block the threatened strike on national and suburban networks by train drivers ' union , gdl . a spokesman said deutsche bahn has lodged a complaint with the labor court in frankfurt and was expecting a ruling on monday morning .
this dispute is not about pay , but demarcation between the trade unions .
drivers organized in a small union , the gdl , are planning to shut down all passenger and freight operations , if deutsche bahn does not grant them a separate labor contract , with no right of veto held by larger unions.gdl has staged a series of warning strikes since summer , but is frustrated that agreements the union made with deutsche bahn afterwards have yet to be finalized .
deutsche bahn said earlier friday it had devised a back-up plan to limit the fallout and promised that at least half of normal trains should run on monday even if gdl went ahead with the strike .
deutsche bahn has been backed by the big unions , which traditionally depend on the drivers ' strength to win pay rises for cleaners and clerks .
an earlier deal with deutsche bahn , which was struck after a dispute lasting almost a year , has come unstuck .
db has chartered engines and drivers from other railways companies to haul essential goods trains supplying factories next week .
offer " not acceptable " separately , top government negotiator , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , said public sector employers had called off pay talks with services union , verdi in potsdam near berlin .
the next step will be to take the dispute to arbitration , via a mediation procedure prescribed by german labor law .
schaeuble said the stand-off came because unions refused to budge over public bodies ' demands for longer working hours .
employers had offered to gradually raise pay by 5 percent over two years , if weekly working hours rise from 38.5 to 40 .
" this is not acceptable , " verdi chief frank bsirske told a press conference .

" we still have differences of opinion but they can be bridged , " michael freytag , the cdu 's regional head , said on thursday after the party 's board agreed to open talks with the greens .
the move highlights the conservatives ' preference to work with the greens instead of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unlikely marriage - the greens ' christa goetsch with the cdu 's von beust talk of the unusual alliance first erupted when a feb .
24 election in the city failed to provide a clear parliamentary majority for the cdu after their traditional partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , did not surpass the 5-percent hurdle to get into parliament . unusual bedfellows after seven hours of exploratory talks on wednesday , the two parties announced they had discovered " much common ground . " however , several green members have resisted the idea of teaming up with the cdu , a traditional political adversary , and the subject has prompted much soul-searching in the ecologically minded party .
although there is a degree of common ground between the two parties , for example , in certain economic policies and in their appeal to the well-heeled - they still differ substantially on many issues . in hamburg , the parties are split on several major issues , including a proposal to deepen the elbe river to prepare germany 's biggest port for a new generation of container ships and the planned construction of a new coal-fired power station that would be the largest of its kind in the country .
the greens oppose both projects on environmental grounds . the green party in the city-state of hamburg , where it goes by the name gal , signaled on thursday that they were prepared to enter negotiations for a " black-green " coalition with the conservatives in hamburg . gal party chief , anja hajduk said the cdu was willing to soften its position on the new coal-fired power station and was open for an alternative . former president calls for changes to constitution the mold-breaking tie-up between the greens and the conservatives is n't the only new political grouping on the german political landscape .
a steady decline in support for germany 's two biggest parties , the cdu and the spd , have led to the rise of parties like the far-left " die linke " which has made it tougher to form stable governments both at the federal and state level and led to new and risky political constellations . the development prompted former german president roman herzog on thursday to call for changes to germany 's constitution to counter the rise of fringe parties he said risked spawning unstable coalitions reminiscent of the weimar republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog is the first major german figure to call for a change to the constitution to deter fringe parties herzog , who served as german president from 1994 to 1999 , wrote in thursday 's sueddeutsche zeitung daily that germany was witnessing a fundamental shift in its system of government and suggested that its constitution , or " basic law , " which dates back to 1949 , should be adapted . " it will become increasingly difficult to form stable majorities and keep them together , " herzog wrote .
" it is clear that the danger of minority governments will rise . " the rise of the greens in the 1980s and more recently " die linke , " or left party - a grouping of ex-communists and western german spd deserters - means that five parties regularly clear the 5-percent hurdle , complicating the formation of political majorities . herzog said germans would not accept a british winner-takes-all approach , but added that french rules calling for candidates to win absolute majorities , which often leads to run-off elections , may be a good idea . the current german system requires the top party in any given election to form a majority in parliament , if necessary in coalition with another party or parties , to take power . rules put in place after world war two require parties to pass the five percent support threshold to enter parliament . herzog 's suggestion , the first proposal by an influential german politician to change the constitution because of fringe parties , was rejected by the cdu and spd , as well as opposition parties . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it wo n't be in the form of the traditional iron cross , said the government . president horst koehler has " approved in principle " a proposal by defense minister franz josef jung to introduce the new military honor , the presidential spokesman said thursday , march 6 . germany over the last half a century has awarded military decorations for special achievement , length of duty and for tours lasting over 30 days , but no medals for bravery have been given since world war ii . there was no word as to when the new medal would be introduced , what it would look like or what the criteria would be to receive it . no plans to resurrect iron cross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iron cross , seen here next to the german flag , is the bundeswehr 's official emblem the defense ministry , however , said on thursday that it would not resemble the iron cross - a wartime decoration introduced by prussian emperor friedrich wilhelm iii in 1813 .
the symbol was later adopted by the nazis , who combined it with a swastika . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , conservative parliamentarian ernst-reinhard beck had recommended modeling the new medal on the iron cross .
beck , a member of angela merkel 's christian democratic union , is also head of germany 's army reservists association . " we should reclaim the positive side of this symbol now that the war has been over for more than 60 years and that the bundeswehr has , over half a century , established a tradition which has nothing to do with the nazi era , " said beck . he conceded that the iron cross is associated with the world wars but said it could also serve as a " symbol of hope . " the design is still used today as the german military 's national emblem and appears on aircraft and tanks . defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe said there was no thought of bringing back the iron cross , " not only because of its third reich connotations , but because it was awarded for war service and we are not a nation at war . " medal plan meets opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 german troops are stationed abroad some left-wing politicians have spoken out against introducing any kind of bravery medal for soldiers . " german history has shown us that whenever soldiery was celebrated in society with monuments and honors , it was often a harbinger of germany 's involvement in wars , " said paul schaefer , a defense policy spokesman for the left party . a defense expert from the social democratic party , rainer arnold , told the friday edition of the märkische allgemeine zeitung that a military honor should n't be reduced to courage alone .
he added that he did n't have anything against rewarding soldiers for special achievements where bravery was also displayed , but that these types of medals already existed . the proposal for the medal comes as germany 's participation in international peacekeeping mission has increased in recent years .
it currently has 9,000 troops stations abroad in 10 separate missions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will not stand for election on april 5 , as i can not guarantee a majority , " ypsilanti told reporters on friday , march 7 , ditching a controversial plan to build a minority alliance with the green party tolerated by germany 's far-left party in the western state of hesse .
the move amounted to ypsilanti going back on a pledge not to work with the grouping of ex-communists and leftist social democrat deserters from western germany . “ we can not take this path , since there are parliamentarians with us that will not go down this path , ” ypsilanti said in a statement . earlier , a renegade spd member in hesse 's state legislature , dagmar metzger , had made it clear that she would not back a deal with the left party which is considered by many in the spd as being unreliable and populist . after a deadlocked state election on jan .
27 , hesse was left scrambling to form a government .
both the spd and incumbent premier roland koch 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- won 42 seats each in the 110-seat legislature . cdu to seek other partners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch is looking for new friends spd head kurt beck had given ypsilanti the green light to pursue a cooperation with the left party , sparking a uproar in social democratic ranks .
the move also raised questions about beck 's credibility and his presumed bid to challenge chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal election . ypsilanti said earlier in the week that her decision to break with pre-election promises not to rely on the left party for votes had been " very , very difficult " for her . koch had urged the spd to consider a " grand coalition " together with the conservatives , similar to chancellor angela merkel 's model at the federal level .
he said friday that his conservative party would seek coalition talks with the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the greens , which have 11 and nine seats respectively in the state legislature . the greens have so far ruled out a coalition with the conservatives . neither of the two major parties can attain a majority of 56 seats with just one partner , but would need to get either the left party or the greens on board as well . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this made me think of the first democratic campaign in spain that i participated in with such hope 31 years ago .
i reached voting age - 21 years old at the time - at the same time democracy arrived to my country . we had n't had free elections since february of 1936 , only a few months before the military rebellion against the spanish republic and the start of the spanish civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : antonio munoz molina in that first election of 1977 , street walls were plastered with posters , flags and handbills featuring the candidates ' faces .
the air was full of speeches emanating from car loudspeakers . voting for democracy 's sake this morning i went out to take a walk and realized that none of this exists today .
just as in the past , elections come up frequently and , as usual , the candidates make themselves hoarse repeating excessive promises and launching tasteless attacks against their adversaries .
but this time the city is quiet and the people appear to be focused on their personal affairs , removed from the melodrama of political confrontation . spaniards will not only vote , but will do so in very high numbers .
those of us with doubts will go as well , despite the fact that we do n't identify with any of the major candidates and despite wishing that the campaigns would have discussed more ideas and offered fewer empty slogans . in spain , the division between the left and the right , between the socialist party and the people 's party is very strong .
this is in contrast to the moderate tone of the immense majority of the country and the limited actual differences between the parties ' proposals . issues such as homosexual marriage , abortion rights and the catholic church 's involvement in education have provoked large confrontations among some people .
but the majority of the population , including catholics , is relatively tolerant in practice . ignoring the big issues more serious issues are not debated because neither of the two political parties can come up with a solution .
no matter how big their electoral victory , some problems would require a major , long-term national agreement . you need such an agreement to stem the decline of the educational system , which according to the most serious international evaluations continues to worsen , harming both the strength of our citizens and our economic competitiveness .
you need such an agreement for international politics as well , in order to regain a position of power in the european union and to establish more cordial relations with the united states . the two big national parties also need to decide definitively on the federal map of the country , which is in constant danger of being altered by extremism and nationalism .
without a shared agreement and without giving in to the temptations of xenophobia and demagoguery , it 's impossible to create solid immigration policies that accept the rights and obligations of those immigrants that our country is able to absorb . most experts , except the government , agree that the spanish economy is nearing the end of an era of growth .
there is also the problem of geographical inequalities in the distribution of water .
spain is the country in europe most threatened by desertification : one part of our territory receives abundant rain ; the other lives in permanent danger of drought . rhetoric trumps action with all of the divisions between parties and regional egoisms , solutions seem unlikely .
is any party proposing the improvement of public services , austerity and public sector professionalism ?
it does n't appear that the parties think of this , nor does it seem that they are in favor of toning down their belligerence to concentrate on the search for rational solutions . except for the staunchest supporters , the majority of spaniards are following the electoral campaign only reluctantly and we are glad that there are n't posters on the streets .

the case of a bavarian who decided to trade in smoking for gambling certainly beats all those draconian health warnings on cigarette packets as convincing proof that stubbing out has its perks .
for the last three years , he 's been trading in the money he used to spend on cigarettes every week for a lottery ticket .
the odds were against this ever proving to be more than just another of those desperate tricks smokers use to persuade themselves to quit , but last saturday he hit the jackpot , winning 1.17 million euros -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- in the game 77 version of the state lottery and becoming an overnight millionaire .
self-improvement , a lucrative business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : improved health , and loads of money into the bargain : how hard can giving up be ?
the winner said he intended to use some of the money to pay off his house , but apart from that had no fixed plans on what to do with the windfall .
" going out for a really good meal , that 's a must , of course , " he told the lottery organizers .

it 's now set to reopen friday , march 7 with a concert starring clarinetist giora feidman playing jewish klezmer music . the foundation stone was laid in 1935 , but the gigantic oval building on dutzendteich lake , modeled on the coliseum in rome , but 25 percent bigger , was never finished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl filmed " triumph of the will " in nuremberg the building was part of the nazi rally grounds where hitler held his massive military parades during the third reich .
it memorably featured as a backdrop in leni riefenstahl 's propaganda documentary " triumph of the will , " which was commissioned by hitler as a chronicle of the 1934 nazi party congress . today , its outer walls surround a field of weeds , which nuremberg kept as a warning against fascism for future generations . but two completed annex buildings have since been remodeled , both symbolically broken open with walls and ceilings of glass . one opened in 2000 as a museum documenting the atrocities of the third reich . a venue reborn the other has been revamped as a concert hall with over 500 seats in a redevelopment which took 14 months and cost some 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.9 million -rrb- . it is set to open friday with an inaugural performance by the clarinetist giora feidman , who specializes in jewish music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giora feidman in 2010 , the venue will become the new home of the nuremberg symphony orchestra .
until then it will serve as a temporary venue for the city 's state theater while its own premises are redeveloped . the orchestra has been using the southern wing of the building , which has not been renovated , since 1963 for its rehearsals . the burden of history the city has spent years debating whether to keep the vast neo-classicist park built by the nazis for displays of mass loyalty to dictator adolf hitler or to tear it down . ultimately , it was decided to use one annex for music as a deliberate counterpoint to the nazi cult of violence . in german history , the city is inextricably tied to the third reich .
nuremberg was chosen by the nazis as the center of their " aryan " world , with hitler conferring upon nuremberg the title " city of the party rallies . " up to a million party members would travel to nuremberg for the week-long rallies , and it was here that " der führer " gave many of his speeches on the supposed superiority of the aryan race . the city was also home to the nuremberg trials , which tried nazi leaders for crimes against humanity after world war ii . bildunterschrift : banishing the ghosts of the past dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we still have differences of opinion but they can be bridged , " michael freytag , the cdu 's regional head , said on thursday after the party 's board agreed to open talks with the greens .
the move highlights the conservatives ' preference to work with the greens instead of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unlikely marriage - the greens ' christa goetsch with the cdu 's von beust talk of the unusual alliance first erupted when a feb .
24 election in the city failed to provide a clear parliamentary majority for the cdu after their traditional partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , did not surpass the 5-percent hurdle to get into parliament . unusual bedfellows after seven hours of exploratory talks on wednesday , the two parties announced they had discovered " much common ground . " however , several green members have resisted the idea of teaming up with the cdu , a traditional political adversary , and the subject has prompted much soul-searching in the ecologically minded party .
although there is a degree of common ground between the two parties , for example , in certain economic policies and in their appeal to the well-heeled - they still differ substantially on many issues . in hamburg , the parties are split on several major issues , including a proposal to deepen the elbe river to prepare germany 's biggest port for a new generation of container ships and the planned construction of a new coal-fired power station that would be the largest of its kind in the country .
the greens oppose both projects on environmental grounds . the green party in the city-state of hamburg , where it goes by the name gal , signaled on thursday that they were prepared to enter negotiations for a " black-green " coalition with the conservatives in hamburg . gal party chief , anja hajduk said the cdu was willing to soften its position on the new coal-fired power station and was open for an alternative . former president calls for changes to constitution the mold-breaking tie-up between the greens and the conservatives is n't the only new political grouping on the german political landscape .
a steady decline in support for germany 's two biggest parties , the cdu and the spd , have led to the rise of parties like the far-left " die linke " which has made it tougher to form stable governments both at the federal and state level and led to new and risky political constellations . the development prompted former german president roman herzog on thursday to call for changes to germany 's constitution to counter the rise of fringe parties he said risked spawning unstable coalitions reminiscent of the weimar republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog is the first major german figure to call for a change to the constitution to deter fringe parties herzog , who served as german president from 1994 to 1999 , wrote in thursday 's sueddeutsche zeitung daily that germany was witnessing a fundamental shift in its system of government and suggested that its constitution , or " basic law , " which dates back to 1949 , should be adapted . " it will become increasingly difficult to form stable majorities and keep them together , " herzog wrote .
" it is clear that the danger of minority governments will rise . " the rise of the greens in the 1980s and more recently " die linke , " or left party - a grouping of ex-communists and western german spd deserters - means that five parties regularly clear the 5-percent hurdle , complicating the formation of political majorities . herzog said germans would not accept a british winner-takes-all approach , but added that french rules calling for candidates to win absolute majorities , which often leads to run-off elections , may be a good idea . the current german system requires the top party in any given election to form a majority in parliament , if necessary in coalition with another party or parties , to take power . rules put in place after world war two require parties to pass the five percent support threshold to enter parliament . herzog 's suggestion , the first proposal by an influential german politician to change the constitution because of fringe parties , was rejected by the cdu and spd , as well as opposition parties . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government blamed eta seperatists for the killing and suspended campaigning . the basque separatist group eta is seen as the likely culprit behind the assassination of a former socialist local council member , isaias carrasco on friday , march 7 .
" this is a vile , cowardly act worthy of all our condemnation , carried out by a group of murderers who will never succeed in breaking the will of spanish democracy , " socialist interior minister alfredo rubalcaba told reporters .
the shooting came on the last day of official campaigning before spaniards go to the polls sunday to choose their next government .
both the governing socialist party and the opposition popular party cancelled their final rallies friday .
socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero currently leads the conservative popular party by about four percentage points in opinion polls .
uncertain election outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative supporters wave popular party flags yet the shooting could change the election outcome .
zapatero had controversially opened peace talks with eta before abandoning them in december 2006 after eta killed two people with a car bomb .
the killing in the basque country is not likely to alter this election outcome , said julian santamaria , a politics professor at madrid 's complutense university .
it could increase voter turnout , santamaria told reuters .
" it might mean more people get out and vote on sunday , " he said .
placing the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're in a tight race in the 2004 elections , zapatero 's socialists were trailing the popular party in the weeks leading up to the elections .
then , three days before the elections , train bombings during morning rush hour in madrid killed 191 people .
the popular party blamed eta although evidence from the beginning showed that radical islamists were responsible .
spaniards were outraged and voted the socialist party into office .
but this year , basque separatism had taken a back seat to issues such as the slowing economy and immigration .
eta has killed 800 people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta has killed 800 people isaias carrasco , a former socialist council member , was assassinated in front of his wife and young daughter outside his house in a small town in the basque region .
eta has killed more than 800 people in the past four decades in an attempt to gain independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an automous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
zapatero has been accused by the right of being soft on basque separatists .
but no criticism was heard friday .
" this is a day of mourning .
we should all stand by the family of isaias carrasco and remain united , united against eta , " said popular party candidate mariano rajoy . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's now set to reopen friday , march 7 with a concert starring clarinetist giora feidman playing jewish klezmer music . the foundation stone was laid in 1935 , but the gigantic oval building on dutzendteich lake , modeled on the coliseum in rome , but 25 percent bigger , was never finished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl filmed " triumph of the will " in nuremberg the building was part of the nazi rally grounds where hitler held his massive military parades during the third reich .
it memorably featured as a backdrop in leni riefenstahl 's propaganda documentary " triumph of the will , " which was commissioned by hitler as a chronicle of the 1934 nazi party congress . today , its outer walls surround a field of weeds , which nuremberg kept as a warning against fascism for future generations . but two completed annex buildings have since been remodeled , both symbolically broken open with walls and ceilings of glass . one opened in 2000 as a museum documenting the atrocities of the third reich . a venue reborn the other has been revamped as a concert hall with over 500 seats in a redevelopment which took 14 months and cost some 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.9 million -rrb- . it is set to open friday with an inaugural performance by the clarinetist giora feidman , who specializes in jewish music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giora feidman in 2010 , the venue will become the new home of the nuremberg symphony orchestra .
until then it will serve as a temporary venue for the city 's state theater while its own premises are redeveloped . the orchestra has been using the southern wing of the building , which has not been renovated , since 1963 for its rehearsals . the burden of history the city has spent years debating whether to keep the vast neo-classicist park built by the nazis for displays of mass loyalty to dictator adolf hitler or to tear it down . ultimately , it was decided to use one annex for music as a deliberate counterpoint to the nazi cult of violence . in german history , the city is inextricably tied to the third reich .
nuremberg was chosen by the nazis as the center of their " aryan " world , with hitler conferring upon nuremberg the title " city of the party rallies . " up to a million party members would travel to nuremberg for the week-long rallies , and it was here that " der führer " gave many of his speeches on the supposed superiority of the aryan race . the city was also home to the nuremberg trials , which tried nazi leaders for crimes against humanity after world war ii . bildunterschrift : banishing the ghosts of the past dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" fitna " was produced by geert wilders , leader of the dutch freedom party and the netherlands ' most outspoken critic of islam . in the past , wilders has deemed the quran incompatible with dutch values .
he recently said his film will show how the muslim holy book is " an inspiration for intolerance , murder and terror . " " fitna " is an arabic term used in the quran usually translated as " strife " or " discord . " damaging dutch political and economic interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders said he had hoped for his film to be broadcast on dutch tv the dutch government has warned that the film might spark unrest and sanctions similar to those triggered when danish newspapers published a cartoon of the prophet mohammad in 2006 . on friday , prime minister jan peter balkenende warned wilders that the release of his film could have " far-reaching security consequences " and even " deaths , " calling on him to take responsibility for the possible consequences of the film . foreign minister maxime verhagen has met ambassadors from muslim countries to discuss the matter , emphasizing that the government does not share wilders ' views .
he asked them to make sure that dutch citizens and buildings abroad are protected . nato , meanwhile , is believed to be concerned about the safety of its troops in afghanistan after hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of mazar-i-sharif earlier in the week in protest .
the crowds set fire to dutch flags and called for the immediate withdrawal of the dutch army from afghanistan . " i fear that soldiers will come under fire because of this film , and i am not afraid to say so , " said nato general secretary jaap de hoop . various dutch employers ' associations and employees unions , as well as representatives of the protestant church have also urged wilders not to release the film . security measures the dutch counter-terrorism agency said in a report to parliament thursday that the new threat assessment was also influenced by arrests elsewhere in europe that had thwarted attacks by groups directed or influenced by al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan . the last time the threat level was this high was after an islamic militant killed director theo van gogh in 2004 over a film he made accusing islam of condoning violence against women . the netherlands has a four-stage risk classification system .
the lowest is " minimal , " the highest is " critical . " the counter-terrorism agency cut the threat level to the second-lowest " limited " last april , reported reuters , citing little fresh activity by militant networks in the country and growing resistance to radicalization among the one million muslims in the netherlands . in its new report , the agency noted that the country 's main muslim organizations had called for calm in response to the wilders film . stoking tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are dutch troops at risk wilders is expected to release the film on march 28 at the government press center in the hague , where security measures are already in place . in an interview dutch newspaper nrc handelsblad thursday , wilders said he was disappointed that no dutch broadcaster had been willing to show it . " i had hoped that a television broadcaster would say : ' you have the right to do this , we will give you a podium , " ' he said . " fitna " will also be made available online . a majority of dutch people want the film to be broadcast even though they fear it will stoke tension with muslims and harm relations with arab nations , a poll showed on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will not stand for election on april 5 , as i can not guarantee a majority , " ypsilanti told reporters on friday , march 7 , ditching a controversial plan to build a minority alliance with the green party tolerated by germany 's far-left party in the western state of hesse .
the move amounted to ypsilanti going back on a pledge not to work with the grouping of ex-communists and leftist social democrat deserters from western germany . “ we can not take this path , since there are parliamentarians with us that will not go down this path , ” ypsilanti said in a statement . earlier , a renegade spd member in hesse 's state legislature , dagmar metzger , had made it clear that she would not back a deal with the left party which is considered by many in the spd as being unreliable and populist . after a deadlocked state election on jan .
27 , hesse was left scrambling to form a government .
both the spd and incumbent premier roland koch 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- won 42 seats each in the 110-seat legislature . cdu to seek other partners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch is looking for new friends spd head kurt beck had given ypsilanti the green light to pursue a cooperation with the left party , sparking a uproar in social democratic ranks .
the move also raised questions about beck 's credibility and his presumed bid to challenge chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal election . ypsilanti said earlier in the week that her decision to break with pre-election promises not to rely on the left party for votes had been " very , very difficult " for her . koch had urged the spd to consider a " grand coalition " together with the conservatives , similar to chancellor angela merkel 's model at the federal level .
he said friday that his conservative party would seek coalition talks with the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the greens , which have 11 and nine seats respectively in the state legislature . the greens have so far ruled out a coalition with the conservatives . neither of the two major parties can attain a majority of 56 seats with just one partner , but would need to get either the left party or the greens on board as well . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case of a bavarian who decided to trade in smoking for gambling certainly beats all those draconian health warnings on cigarette packets as convincing proof that stubbing out has its perks .
for the last three years , he 's been trading in the money he used to spend on cigarettes every week for a lottery ticket .
the odds were against this ever proving to be more than just another of those desperate tricks smokers use to persuade themselves to quit , but last saturday he hit the jackpot , winning 1.17 million euros -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- in the game 77 version of the state lottery and becoming an overnight millionaire .
self-improvement , a lucrative business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : improved health , and loads of money into the bargain : how hard can giving up be ?
the winner said he intended to use some of the money to pay off his house , but apart from that had no fixed plans on what to do with the windfall .
" going out for a really good meal , that 's a must , of course , " he told the lottery organizers .
as germany adjusts to a ban on smoking in public places , his inspirational story might be all the country needs to convince recalcitrant puffers that giving up pays . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this made me think of the first democratic campaign in spain that i participated in with such hope 31 years ago .
i reached voting age - 21 years old at the time - at the same time democracy arrived to my country . we had n't had free elections since february of 1936 , only a few months before the military rebellion against the spanish republic and the start of the spanish civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : antonio munoz molina in that first election of 1977 , street walls were plastered with posters , flags and handbills featuring the candidates ' faces .
the air was full of speeches emanating from car loudspeakers . voting for democracy 's sake this morning i went out to take a walk and realized that none of this exists today .
just as in the past , elections come up frequently and , as usual , the candidates make themselves hoarse repeating excessive promises and launching tasteless attacks against their adversaries .
but this time the city is quiet and the people appear to be focused on their personal affairs , removed from the melodrama of political confrontation . spaniards will not only vote , but will do so in very high numbers .
those of us with doubts will go as well , despite the fact that we do n't identify with any of the major candidates and despite wishing that the campaigns would have discussed more ideas and offered fewer empty slogans . in spain , the division between the left and the right , between the socialist party and the people 's party is very strong .
this is in contrast to the moderate tone of the immense majority of the country and the limited actual differences between the parties ' proposals . issues such as homosexual marriage , abortion rights and the catholic church 's involvement in education have provoked large confrontations among some people .
but the majority of the population , including catholics , is relatively tolerant in practice . ignoring the big issues more serious issues are not debated because neither of the two political parties can come up with a solution .
no matter how big their electoral victory , some problems would require a major , long-term national agreement . you need such an agreement to stem the decline of the educational system , which according to the most serious international evaluations continues to worsen , harming both the strength of our citizens and our economic competitiveness .
you need such an agreement for international politics as well , in order to regain a position of power in the european union and to establish more cordial relations with the united states . the two big national parties also need to decide definitively on the federal map of the country , which is in constant danger of being altered by extremism and nationalism .
without a shared agreement and without giving in to the temptations of xenophobia and demagoguery , it 's impossible to create solid immigration policies that accept the rights and obligations of those immigrants that our country is able to absorb . most experts , except the government , agree that the spanish economy is nearing the end of an era of growth .
there is also the problem of geographical inequalities in the distribution of water .
spain is the country in europe most threatened by desertification : one part of our territory receives abundant rain ; the other lives in permanent danger of drought . rhetoric trumps action with all of the divisions between parties and regional egoisms , solutions seem unlikely .
is any party proposing the improvement of public services , austerity and public sector professionalism ?
it does n't appear that the parties think of this , nor does it seem that they are in favor of toning down their belligerence to concentrate on the search for rational solutions . except for the staunchest supporters , the majority of spaniards are following the electoral campaign only reluctantly and we are glad that there are n't posters on the streets .

this made me think of the first democratic campaign in spain that i participated in with such hope 31 years ago .
i reached voting age - 21 years old at the time - at the same time democracy arrived to my country . we had n't had free elections since february of 1936 , only a few months before the military rebellion against the spanish republic and the start of the spanish civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : antonio munoz molina in that first election of 1977 , street walls were plastered with posters , flags and handbills featuring the candidates ' faces .
the air was full of speeches emanating from car loudspeakers . voting for democracy 's sake this morning i went out to take a walk and realized that none of this exists today .
just as in the past , elections come up frequently and , as usual , the candidates make themselves hoarse repeating excessive promises and launching tasteless attacks against their adversaries .
but this time the city is quiet and the people appear to be focused on their personal affairs , removed from the melodrama of political confrontation . spaniards will not only vote , but will do so in very high numbers .
those of us with doubts will go as well , despite the fact that we do n't identify with any of the major candidates and despite wishing that the campaigns would have discussed more ideas and offered fewer empty slogans . in spain , the division between the left and the right , between the socialist party and the people 's party is very strong .
this is in contrast to the moderate tone of the immense majority of the country and the limited actual differences between the parties ' proposals . issues such as homosexual marriage , abortion rights and the catholic church 's involvement in education have provoked large confrontations among some people .
but the majority of the population , including catholics , is relatively tolerant in practice . ignoring the big issues more serious issues are not debated because neither of the two political parties can come up with a solution .
no matter how big their electoral victory , some problems would require a major , long-term national agreement . you need such an agreement to stem the decline of the educational system , which according to the most serious international evaluations continues to worsen , harming both the strength of our citizens and our economic competitiveness .
you need such an agreement for international politics as well , in order to regain a position of power in the european union and to establish more cordial relations with the united states . the two big national parties also need to decide definitively on the federal map of the country , which is in constant danger of being altered by extremism and nationalism .
without a shared agreement and without giving in to the temptations of xenophobia and demagoguery , it 's impossible to create solid immigration policies that accept the rights and obligations of those immigrants that our country is able to absorb . most experts , except the government , agree that the spanish economy is nearing the end of an era of growth .
there is also the problem of geographical inequalities in the distribution of water .
spain is the country in europe most threatened by desertification : one part of our territory receives abundant rain ; the other lives in permanent danger of drought . rhetoric trumps action with all of the divisions between parties and regional egoisms , solutions seem unlikely .
is any party proposing the improvement of public services , austerity and public sector professionalism ?
it does n't appear that the parties think of this , nor does it seem that they are in favor of toning down their belligerence to concentrate on the search for rational solutions . except for the staunchest supporters , the majority of spaniards are following the electoral campaign only reluctantly and we are glad that there are n't posters on the streets .
but many of us , despite our skepticism , will go and vote , if only because we still remember an era in which democracy did n't exist . antonio munoz molina is one of spain 's best-known writers and commentators . -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it wo n't be in the form of the traditional iron cross , said the government . president horst koehler has " approved in principle " a proposal by defense minister franz josef jung to introduce the new military honor , the presidential spokesman said thursday , march 6 . germany over the last half a century has awarded military decorations for special achievement , length of duty and for tours lasting over 30 days , but no medals for bravery have been given since world war ii . there was no word as to when the new medal would be introduced , what it would look like or what the criteria would be to receive it . no plans to resurrect iron cross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iron cross , seen here next to the german flag , is the bundeswehr 's official emblem the defense ministry , however , said on thursday that it would not resemble the iron cross - a wartime decoration introduced by prussian emperor friedrich wilhelm iii in 1813 .
the symbol was later adopted by the nazis , who combined it with a swastika . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , conservative parliamentarian ernst-reinhard beck had recommended modeling the new medal on the iron cross .
beck , a member of angela merkel 's christian democratic union , is also head of germany 's army reservists association . " we should reclaim the positive side of this symbol now that the war has been over for more than 60 years and that the bundeswehr has , over half a century , established a tradition which has nothing to do with the nazi era , " said beck . he conceded that the iron cross is associated with the world wars but said it could also serve as a " symbol of hope . " the design is still used today as the german military 's national emblem and appears on aircraft and tanks . defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe said there was no thought of bringing back the iron cross , " not only because of its third reich connotations , but because it was awarded for war service and we are not a nation at war . " medal plan meets opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 german troops are stationed abroad some left-wing politicians have spoken out against introducing any kind of bravery medal for soldiers . " german history has shown us that whenever soldiery was celebrated in society with monuments and honors , it was often a harbinger of germany 's involvement in wars , " said paul schaefer , a defense policy spokesman for the left party . a defense expert from the social democratic party , rainer arnold , told the friday edition of the märkische allgemeine zeitung that a military honor should n't be reduced to courage alone .
he added that he did n't have anything against rewarding soldiers for special achievements where bravery was also displayed , but that these types of medals already existed . the proposal for the medal comes as germany 's participation in international peacekeeping mission has increased in recent years .
it currently has 9,000 troops stations abroad in 10 separate missions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's now set to reopen friday , march 7 with a concert starring clarinetist giora feidman playing jewish klezmer music . the foundation stone was laid in 1935 , but the gigantic oval building on dutzendteich lake , modeled on the coliseum in rome , but 25 percent bigger , was never finished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl filmed " triumph of the will " in nuremberg the building was part of the nazi rally grounds where hitler held his massive military parades during the third reich .
it memorably featured as a backdrop in leni riefenstahl 's propaganda documentary " triumph of the will , " which was commissioned by hitler as a chronicle of the 1934 nazi party congress . today , its outer walls surround a field of weeds , which nuremberg kept as a warning against fascism for future generations . but two completed annex buildings have since been remodeled , both symbolically broken open with walls and ceilings of glass . one opened in 2000 as a museum documenting the atrocities of the third reich . a venue reborn the other has been revamped as a concert hall with over 500 seats in a redevelopment which took 14 months and cost some 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.9 million -rrb- . it is set to open friday with an inaugural performance by the clarinetist giora feidman , who specializes in jewish music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giora feidman in 2010 , the venue will become the new home of the nuremberg symphony orchestra .

the case of a bavarian who decided to trade in smoking for gambling certainly beats all those draconian health warnings on cigarette packets as convincing proof that stubbing out has its perks .
for the last three years , he 's been trading in the money he used to spend on cigarettes every week for a lottery ticket .
the odds were against this ever proving to be more than just another of those desperate tricks smokers use to persuade themselves to quit , but last saturday he hit the jackpot , winning 1.17 million euros -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- in the game 77 version of the state lottery and becoming an overnight millionaire .

mr blackwell added : " the bodleian is unique .

andrew motion composed the work under a commission from the bbc 's inside out west programme .
the prince of wales introduces the piece , saying mr patch , " epitomizes the courage , long-sufferingness and tenacity of his generation " .
the poem has five acts , each exploring different stages in mr patch 's life .
it begins at his childhood home in combe down , near bath , before moving on to the battlefields of the western front where mr patch saw action as a lewis gunner for the duke of cornwall 's light infantry .
it 's a great honour to have a poem written for me harry patch in the final act , mr patch is depicted in a care home in the city of wells , where he now lives .
mr motion said : " it is by some distance the most interesting of these sorts of commissions that i 've done .
" i feel really quite a heavy burden on to me to pay mr patch due respect , to celebrate him and honour him , but at the same time not to let those feelings of something approaching awe get in the way of having a normal conversation . "
mr patch was a plumber by trade before being called up and fighting in the battle of passchendaele .
his war was brought to an end when he was wounded by shrapnel from a german shell as he returned from the front line .
he is the second oldest uk survivor from world war i. the oldest is 111-year-old henry allingham , who fought in the battle of jutland rather than in the trenches like mr patch .
in february , he attended a special event at the bishop 's palace in wells to hear the poem performed for the first time .
afterwards he told the poet laureate : " it 's a great honour to have a poem written for me by you .
that 's all i can say . "
watch the piece on bbc one in the west at 7.30pm on friday 7 march .

andrew motion composed the work under a commission from the bbc 's inside out west programme .
the prince of wales introduces the piece , saying mr patch , " epitomizes the courage , long-sufferingness and tenacity of his generation " .
the poem has five acts , each exploring different stages in mr patch 's life .
it begins at his childhood home in combe down , near bath , before moving on to the battlefields of the western front where mr patch saw action as a lewis gunner for the duke of cornwall 's light infantry .
it 's a great honour to have a poem written for me harry patch in the final act , mr patch is depicted in a care home in the city of wells , where he now lives .
mr motion said : " it is by some distance the most interesting of these sorts of commissions that i 've done .
" i feel really quite a heavy burden on to me to pay mr patch due respect , to celebrate him and honour him , but at the same time not to let those feelings of something approaching awe get in the way of having a normal conversation . "
mr patch was a plumber by trade before being called up and fighting in the battle of passchendaele .
his war was brought to an end when he was wounded by shrapnel from a german shell as he returned from the front line .
he is the second oldest uk survivor from world war i. the oldest is 111-year-old henry allingham , who fought in the battle of jutland rather than in the trenches like mr patch .
in february , he attended a special event at the bishop 's palace in wells to hear the poem performed for the first time .
afterwards he told the poet laureate : " it 's a great honour to have a poem written for me by you .
that 's all i can say . "

andrew motion composed the work under a commission from the bbc 's inside out west programme .
the prince of wales introduces the piece , saying mr patch , " epitomizes the courage , long-sufferingness and tenacity of his generation " .
the poem has five acts , each exploring different stages in mr patch 's life .
it begins at his childhood home in combe down , near bath , before moving on to the battlefields of the western front where mr patch saw action as a lewis gunner for the duke of cornwall 's light infantry .
it 's a great honour to have a poem written for me harry patch in the final act , mr patch is depicted in a care home in the city of wells , where he now lives .
mr motion said : " it is by some distance the most interesting of these sorts of commissions that i 've done .
" i feel really quite a heavy burden on to me to pay mr patch due respect , to celebrate him and honour him , but at the same time not to let those feelings of something approaching awe get in the way of having a normal conversation . "
mr patch was a plumber by trade before being called up and fighting in the battle of passchendaele .
his war was brought to an end when he was wounded by shrapnel from a german shell as he returned from the front line .
he is the second oldest uk survivor from world war i. the oldest is 111-year-old henry allingham , who fought in the battle of jutland rather than in the trenches like mr patch .
in february , he attended a special event at the bishop 's palace in wells to hear the poem performed for the first time .
afterwards he told the poet laureate : " it 's a great honour to have a poem written for me by you .
that 's all i can say . "

there is no excuse for the " unacceptable " use of violence on children as young as 12 , the joint human rights committee said .
its report on privately run detention facilities said changes to guidance effectively gave staff free rein to use violence to enforce discipline .
the ministry of justice said it was reviewing the use of restraints .
' sanctioned violence ' the report on four detention facilities in england for children aged between 12 and 17 found restraint techniques were used about 3,000 times a year - equivalent to 10 times per child .
restraint should only be used to prevent injury to the trainee or others or to prevent escape john dismore , joint human rights committee chairman ' they took my boy away ' the committee 's chairman , andrew dismore , said that although he recognised the challenges faced by staff at secure training centres -lrb- stcs -rrb- , the state has a " duty " to protect children in its care from violence .
he said : " what is in effect state-sanctioned infliction of pain against children to ensure ' good order and discipline ' should not continue .
" restraint should only be used to prevent injury to the trainee or others or to prevent escape . "
but the ministry of justice said there was a clear distinction between the severity of the types of techniques used .
a spokeswoman said the 3,000 figure referred to " restraint techniques " which are not intended to cause pain .
she said the techniques could be as mild as putting an arm around someone to hold them back .
these are different from the more severe methods known as " distraction techniques " which are intended to inflict pain , she added .
blasts of pain the sanctioned distraction techniques involve bending an offender 's thumb back or jabbing them in the lower ribs .
the ministry spokeswoman said these had been used 169 times between february 2006 and march 2007 and only when an offender was being violent .
she said the independent review " will examine the whole question of the operation of restraint in secure training centres and indeed in children 's homes and youth offender institutions .
" force is only ever used as a last resort .
however , behaviour in secure training centres can be very violent and staff need appropriate and effective methods to contain and resolve dangerous situations . "
as far as we are concerned there are still methods of restraint that are painful and that can be psychological damaging deborah coles , inquest but the committee found that the sanctioned techniques in effect contravened governmental assurances that it " does not sanction violence against children " .
it suggested the techniques also flew in the face of the un committee on the rights of the child which has stated that restraint " should not involve the deliberate infliction of pain as a form of control " .
in december the government suspended two techniques following the inquests into the deaths in custody of two teenage boys .
one of the banned practices , classed as a distraction technique , involved a jab to the septum under the nose .
the other , a restraint technique , involves holding someone with their arms crossed behind their back .
adam rickwood , 14 , killed himself in 2004 shortly after the former was used on him .
in the same year , 15-year-old gareth myatt died after three officers held him in another type of restraint method known as a " seated double embrace " .
deborah coles , of inquest , a pressure group that campaigns on behalf of the families of those who die in custody , said there needed to be a sea-change in the culture surrounding use of restraint techniques in stcs .
she told the bbc news website : " all you need to do is look at the deaths .
as far as we are concerned there are still methods of restraint that are painful and that can be psychological damaging .
" what you need is to have a very , very different culture operating where you are working with the needs of the children . "
frances crook , from the howard league for penal reform , said young detainees were often unused to complying with instructions - and staff would respond by hitting them .
" these are children who have usually come from backgrounds where they have been physically abused , where they have experienced violence - sometimes sexual abuse , as well , " she said .

there is no excuse for the " unacceptable " use of violence on children as young as 12 , the joint human rights committee said .
its report on privately run detention facilities said changes to guidance effectively gave staff free rein to use violence to enforce discipline .
the ministry of justice said it was reviewing the use of restraints .
' sanctioned violence ' the report on four detention facilities in england for children aged between 12 and 17 found restraint techniques were used about 3,000 times a year - equivalent to 10 times per child .

these are different from the more severe methods known as " distraction techniques " which are intended to inflict pain , she added .

the ministry spokeswoman said these had been used 169 times between february 2006 and march 2007 and only when an offender was being violent .

officers at raf wittering reported that servicemen have been taunted by people in nearby peterborough who oppose uk involvement in afghanistan and iraq .
although military staff are encouraged to wear uniform in public , a local decision was made against doing so in the city , the ministry of defence said .
the government is investigating as " a matter of urgency " .
cambridgeshire police said they did not know of any abuse reported in the city .
but a spokesman for raf wittering said staff from the base had reported incidents of abuse " up the military chain of command " .
it is a great shame that some individuals in this community do n't respect our forces des browne , defence secretary he said acting on advice from raf police , the station commander had then taken the decision that staff should not wear uniforms off site .
the mayor of peterborough , marion todd , said the decision not to wear service uniforms was a " sad day for the city " .
john peach , leader of the peterborough city council , said : " i guess to a degree they are perhaps a sitting target but it 's terrible that people have to take theses sort of measures because we 're on friendly terms with raf wittering .
" in fact we gave them the freedom of the city award some time ago and we welcome the base being there and are on good co-operative terms with them . "
peterborough 's conservative mp stewart jackson said he thought the raf may have overreacted .
" i think it could have been the case that there was some abuse of military personel by a very very small number of people , " he said .
defence minister derek twigg told five live said he believed it was " a tiny minority of people " responsible for such abuse , adding that it was a " great shame on the day we 've got 184 members of the armed forces being honoured for their courage and bravery " .
a government review of the public 's perception of the military is being carried out .
raf wittering is best-known for housing harrier jets it has been suggested as part of the review that soldiers may be encouraged to wear their uniforms off-duty to boost their popularity .
defence secretary des browne said : " we must defend our forces ' right to wear their uniforms in public .
" it is a great shame that some individuals in this community do n't respect our forces , who are daily doing a great deal for this nation .
" this is not a situation we should tolerate .
we learned about this today and are investigating it as a matter of urgency .
" i hope that by working closely with peterborough city council and the local police , service personnel at raf wittering will soon be able to wear their uniforms freely about the town with the support of the local people . "
raf wittering was established in 1916 and more than 2,000 servicemen and women are based at the station , which is best-known for housing a fleet of harrier jump jets .
air chief marshall sir glenn torpy , said : " whatever people 's views are about specific military operations , everyone should be able to recognise the bravery and professionalism of our armed forces and respect the difficult job they do . "
former air vice marshall and a former station commander at wittering , gerry connelly , said he would be concerned about politicians " trying to overturn the decision of the local commander because at the end of the day they are the people on the ground " .
shadow defence secretary liam fox said : " i think that the majority of our public would be appalled to hear that there are no-go areas for our armed forces , even in their own country . "
your comments : this is appalling .
raf employees should not be asked to refrain from wearing their uniform if they wish to do so .
it should be a matter of pride to wear such a prestigious uniform .
every single person in the uk owes the raf a huge amount of gratitude for the job they do .
i would not hesitate to thank anyone wearing a forces uniform ; we owe our freedom to them .
julie butchard , york when i was at university , and a member of the british army 's uotc at that university , we were all advised to not wear uniforms in public unless completely unavoidable .

officers at raf wittering reported that servicemen have been taunted by people in nearby peterborough who oppose uk involvement in afghanistan and iraq .
although military staff are encouraged to wear uniform in public , a local decision was made against doing so in the city , the ministry of defence said .
the government is investigating as " a matter of urgency " .
cambridgeshire police said they did not know of any abuse reported in the city .
but a spokesman for raf wittering said staff from the base had reported incidents of abuse " up the military chain of command " .
it is a great shame that some individuals in this community do n't respect our forces des browne , defence secretary he said acting on advice from raf police , the station commander had then taken the decision that staff should not wear uniforms off site .
the mayor of peterborough , marion todd , said the decision not to wear service uniforms was a " sad day for the city " .
john peach , leader of the peterborough city council , said : " i guess to a degree they are perhaps a sitting target but it 's terrible that people have to take theses sort of measures because we 're on friendly terms with raf wittering .
" in fact we gave them the freedom of the city award some time ago and we welcome the base being there and are on good co-operative terms with them . "
peterborough 's conservative mp stewart jackson said he thought the raf may have overreacted .
" i think it could have been the case that there was some abuse of military personel by a very very small number of people , " he said .
defence minister derek twigg told five live said he believed it was " a tiny minority of people " responsible for such abuse , adding that it was a " great shame on the day we 've got 184 members of the armed forces being honoured for their courage and bravery " .
a government review of the public 's perception of the military is being carried out .
raf wittering is best-known for housing harrier jets it has been suggested as part of the review that soldiers may be encouraged to wear their uniforms off-duty to boost their popularity .
defence secretary des browne said : " we must defend our forces ' right to wear their uniforms in public .
" it is a great shame that some individuals in this community do n't respect our forces , who are daily doing a great deal for this nation .
" this is not a situation we should tolerate .
we learned about this today and are investigating it as a matter of urgency .
" i hope that by working closely with peterborough city council and the local police , service personnel at raf wittering will soon be able to wear their uniforms freely about the town with the support of the local people . "
raf wittering was established in 1916 and more than 2,000 servicemen and women are based at the station , which is best-known for housing a fleet of harrier jump jets .
air chief marshall sir glenn torpy , said : " whatever people 's views are about specific military operations , everyone should be able to recognise the bravery and professionalism of our armed forces and respect the difficult job they do . "
former air vice marshall and a former station commander at wittering , gerry connelly , said he would be concerned about politicians " trying to overturn the decision of the local commander because at the end of the day they are the people on the ground " .
shadow defence secretary liam fox said : " i think that the majority of our public would be appalled to hear that there are no-go areas for our armed forces , even in their own country . "
your comments : this is appalling .
raf employees should not be asked to refrain from wearing their uniform if they wish to do so .
it should be a matter of pride to wear such a prestigious uniform .
every single person in the uk owes the raf a huge amount of gratitude for the job they do .
i would not hesitate to thank anyone wearing a forces uniform ; we owe our freedom to them .

there is no excuse for the " unacceptable " use of violence on children as young as 12 , the joint human rights committee said .
its report on privately run detention facilities said changes to guidance effectively gave staff free rein to use violence to enforce discipline .
the ministry of justice said it was reviewing the use of restraints .
' sanctioned violence ' the report on four detention facilities in england for children aged between 12 and 17 found restraint techniques were used about 3,000 times a year - equivalent to 10 times per child . "
restraint should only be used to prevent injury to the trainee or others or to prevent escape " john dismore , joint human rights committee chairman ' they took my boy away ' the committee 's chairman , andrew dismore , said that although he recognised the challenges faced by staff at secure training centres -lrb- stcs -rrb- , the state has a " duty " to protect children in its care from violence .
he said : " what is in effect state-sanctioned infliction of pain against children to ensure ' good order and discipline ' should not continue .
" restraint should only be used to prevent injury to the trainee or others or to prevent escape . "
but the ministry of justice said there was a clear distinction between the severity of the types of techniques used .
a spokeswoman said the 3,000 figure referred to " restraint techniques " which are not intended to cause pain .
she said the techniques could be as mild as putting an arm around someone to hold them back .
these are different from the more severe methods known as " distraction techniques " which are intended to inflict pain , she added .
blasts of pain the sanctioned distraction techniques involve bending an offender 's thumb back or jabbing them in the lower ribs .
the ministry spokeswoman said these had been used 169 times between february 2006 and march 2007 and only when an offender was being violent .
she said the independent review " will examine the whole question of the operation of restraint in secure training centres and indeed in children 's homes and youth offender institutions .
" force is only ever used as a last resort .
however , behaviour in secure training centres can be very violent and staff need appropriate and effective methods to contain and resolve dangerous situations . "
" as far as we are concerned there are still methods of restraint that are painful and that can be psychological damaging " deborah coles , inquest but the committee found that the sanctioned techniques in effect contravened governmental assurances that it " does not sanction violence against children " .
it suggested the techniques also flew in the face of the un committee on the rights of the child which has stated that restraint " should not involve the deliberate infliction of pain as a form of control " .
in december the government suspended two techniques following the inquests into the deaths in custody of two teenage boys .
one of the banned practices , classed as a distraction technique , involved a jab to the septum under the nose .
the other , a restraint technique , involves holding someone with their arms crossed behind their back .
adam rickwood , 14 , killed himself in 2004 shortly after the former was used on him .
in the same year , 15-year-old gareth myatt died after three officers held him in another type of restraint method known as a " seated double embrace " .
deborah coles , of inquest , a pressure group that campaigns on behalf of the families of those who die in custody , said there needed to be a sea-change in the culture surrounding use of restraint techniques in stcs .
she told the bbc news website : " all you need to do is look at the deaths .
as far as we are concerned there are still methods of restraint that are painful and that can be psychological damaging .
" what you need is to have a very , very different culture operating where you are working with the needs of the children . "
frances crook , from the howard league for penal reform , said young detainees were often unused to complying with instructions - and staff would respond by hitting them .
" these are children who have usually come from backgrounds where they have been physically abused , where they have experienced violence - sometimes sexual abuse , as well , " she said .

tax on alcopops would be trebled , but money raised would be used to reduce tax on low-strength beer and cider .
the tories ' want to hit the drinks they believe fuel yobbish behaviour , without penalising " sensible " drinkers .
a spokeswoman for the chancellor said there was no provision in european law for a separate tax on alcopops . "
you can tackle the binge drinks without having an overall increase in the tax on alcohol " george osborne conservatives she added that their sales were going down .
duty on spirits has been frozen since 1998 and chancellor alistair darling is expected to raise alcohol taxes in next week 's budget .
' problem drinks ' bbc political correspondent reeta chakrabarti said the conservatives wanted to put pressure on ahead of the budget by showing how they would tackle under-age and binge-drinking through the tax system .
how taxes on alcohol and tobacco have evolved the conservatives say they would look to treble duty on alcopops - a mixture of spirits and fruit juice or fizzy drinks - and significantly raise it on strong beer and cider .
in a package of proposals to be published later , the conservatives will say labour 's approach to alcohol taxation has failed and " problem drinks " have become more affordable .
shadow chancellor george osborne told the bbc : " these drinks are targeted primarily at young women .
they disguise the taste of alcohol by putting very sweet mixtures in so they taste like lemonade .
" let 's make the price of that very difficult for people and then use all the money to cut the taxes on the low alcohol products .
" they 've done this kind of thing in germany and australia and it has had dramatic effects . "
under the party 's proposals , a £ 2 can of super-strength beer would rise in price to £ 2.38 , while a £ 1.25 litre of strong cider would rise to £ 1.66 .
alcopops costing around £ 1.25 a bottle would cost £ 1.79 under the conservatives ' plans .
the conservatives say wines , spirits and 90 % of beer and cider - including popular brands like carling , john smiths , guinness , stella artois , strongbow and magners - would not be affected .
meanwhile cider of less than 3 % alcohol by volume -lrb- abv -rrb- would see duty halved and beer below 2.5 % would see " significant " reductions , cutting the price of a pint by up to 8p .
' be brave ' but figures obtained by the liberal democrats earlier show that every year since 2000 around 100 children aged under eight have been admitted to hospital for alcohol-related problems .
the lib dems say the 10-year freeze on duty on spirits should end and it should go up with in line with inflation since 1997 - adding about an extra £ 1.50 per bottle .
dan shenker , of alcohol concern , told the bbc the government had to persuade people not to drink excessively and " be brave " in taking steps to ensure alcohol did not become too cheap .
in february the british medical association said pricing and promotion of drinks was fuelling an " alcohol epidemic " .
and last year , the health alcohol alliance campaign group called for tax on alcohol to be increased .
initial findings from a government review of " evidence on the relationship between alcohol , price , promotion and harm " are expected in the summer .
on tuesday the government announced its measures for dealing with binge drinking - including a " two-strikes-and-you 're-out " policy for off-licences caught selling drink to under-18s .
your comments : i am a student in sheffield currently and drinks are already getting too expensive , especially with pubs and clubs charging a large amount for entrance fees .
i do n't believe it makes sense raising taxes on alcopops , as people will always drink irresponsibly , and they will drink something else instead .
make buying drinks much more difficult , such as id is mandatory , and keep it cheap for students , we cant afford the tuition fees so we need cheap booze to relax !
charlie colman , sheffield , uk seems like the quickest way to encourage pre-drinking to me .
michael knight , manchester all this is doing is raising the prices of drinks .
this disadvantages those of us who simply wish to enjoy a night out drinking beer which has taste -lrb- mainly foreign beer as well as ales and bitters -rrb- .
really , all it means for binge drinking is that those who have the money to drink 10-12 cans of strong lager a day have to reduce that amount to say 8-10 .
that 's really not a big difference when you think about it .
it 's not going to reduce binge drinking .
phil , uk what ? ? ? ? ? ?
i thought this country could n't get any worse with all these taxes !
if were supposed to be in europe let 's have some european priced taxes on alcohol !
if there 's a problem with kids binge drinking just raise the drinking age to 21 !
it ai n't rocket science !

a spokeswoman for the chancellor said there was no provision in european law for a separate tax on alcopops .
you can tackle the binge drinks without having an overall increase in the tax on alcohol george osborne conservatives she added that their sales were going down .
duty on spirits has been frozen since 1998 and chancellor alistair darling is expected to raise alcohol taxes in next week 's budget .
' problem drinks ' bbc political correspondent reeta chakrabarti said the conservatives wanted to put pressure on ahead of the budget by showing how they would tackle under-age and binge-drinking through the tax system .
how taxes on alcohol and tobacco have evolved the conservatives say they would look to treble duty on alcopops - a mixture of spirits and fruit juice or fizzy drinks - and significantly raise it on strong beer and cider .
in a package of proposals to be published later , the conservatives will say labour 's approach to alcohol taxation has failed and " problem drinks " have become more affordable .
shadow chancellor george osborne told the bbc : " these drinks are targeted primarily at young women .
they disguise the taste of alcohol by putting very sweet mixtures in so they taste like lemonade .
" let 's make the price of that very difficult for people and then use all the money to cut the taxes on the low alcohol products .
" they 've done this kind of thing in germany and australia and it has had dramatic effects . "
under the party 's proposals , a £ 2 can of super-strength beer would rise in price to £ 2.38 , while a £ 1.25 litre of strong cider would rise to £ 1.66 .
alcopops costing around £ 1.25 a bottle would cost £ 1.79 under the conservatives ' plans .
the conservatives say wines , spirits and 90 % of beer and cider - including popular brands like carling , john smiths , guinness , stella artois , strongbow and magners - would not be affected .
meanwhile cider of less than 3 % alcohol by volume -lrb- abv -rrb- would see duty halved and beer below 2.5 % would see " significant " reductions , cutting the price of a pint by up to 8p .
' be brave ' but figures obtained by the liberal democrats earlier show that every year since 2000 around 100 children aged under eight have been admitted to hospital for alcohol-related problems .
the lib dems say the 10-year freeze on duty on spirits should end and it should go up with in line with inflation since 1997 - adding about an extra £ 1.50 per bottle .
dan shenker , of alcohol concern , told the bbc the government had to persuade people not to drink excessively and " be brave " in taking steps to ensure alcohol did not become too cheap .
in february the british medical association said pricing and promotion of drinks was fuelling an " alcohol epidemic " .
and last year , the health alcohol alliance campaign group called for tax on alcohol to be increased .
initial findings from a government review of " evidence on the relationship between alcohol , price , promotion and harm " are expected in the summer .
on tuesday the government announced its measures for dealing with binge drinking - including a " two-strikes-and-you 're-out " policy for off-licences caught selling drink to under-18s .
your comments : i am a student in sheffield currently and drinks are already getting too expensive , especially with pubs and clubs charging a large amount for entrance fees .
i do n't believe it makes sense raising taxes on alcopops , as people will always drink irresponsibly , and they will drink something else instead .
make buying drinks much more difficult , such as id is mandatory , and keep it cheap for students , we cant afford the tuition fees so we need cheap booze to relax !
charlie colman , sheffield , uk seems like the quickest way to encourage pre-drinking to me .
michael knight , manchester all this is doing is raising the prices of drinks .
this disadvantages those of us who simply wish to enjoy a night out drinking beer which has taste -lrb- mainly foreign beer as well as ales and bitters -rrb- .
really , all it means for binge drinking is that those who have the money to drink 10-12 cans of strong lager a day have to reduce that amount to say 8-10 .
that 's really not a big difference when you think about it .
it 's not going to reduce binge drinking .
phil , uk what ? ? ? ? ? ?
i thought this country could n't get any worse with all these taxes !
if were supposed to be in europe let 's have some european priced taxes on alcohol !

the conservatives say they will raise tax on super-strength beer , cider and alcopops to tackle binge drinking if they win the next general election .
tax on alcopops would be trebled , but money raised would be used to reduce tax on low-strength beer and cider .
the tories ' want to hit the drinks they believe fuel yobbish behaviour , without penalising " sensible " drinkers .
a spokeswoman for the chancellor said there was no provision in european law for a separate tax on alcopops .
you can tackle the binge drinks without having an overall increase in the tax on alcohol george osborne conservatives she added that their sales were going down .
duty on spirits has been frozen since 1998 and chancellor alistair darling is expected to raise alcohol taxes in next week 's budget .
' problem drinks ' bbc political correspondent reeta chakrabarti said the conservatives wanted to put pressure on ahead of the budget by showing how they would tackle under-age and binge-drinking through the tax system .
how taxes on alcohol and tobacco have evolved the conservatives say they would look to treble duty on alcopops - a mixture of spirits and fruit juice or fizzy drinks - and significantly raise it on strong beer and cider .
in a package of proposals to be published later , the conservatives will say labour 's approach to alcohol taxation has failed and " problem drinks " have become more affordable .
shadow chancellor george osborne told the bbc : " these drinks are targeted primarily at young women .
they disguise the taste of alcohol by putting very sweet mixtures in so they taste like lemonade .
" let 's make the price of that very difficult for people and then use all the money to cut the taxes on the low alcohol products .
" they 've done this kind of thing in germany and australia and it has had dramatic effects . "
under the party 's proposals , a £ 2 can of super-strength beer would rise in price to £ 2.38 , while a £ 1.25 litre of strong cider would rise to £ 1.66 .
alcopops costing around £ 1.25 a bottle would cost £ 1.79 under the conservatives ' plans .
the conservatives say wines , spirits and 90 % of beer and cider - including popular brands like carling , john smiths , guinness , stella artois , strongbow and magners - would not be affected .
meanwhile cider of less than 3 % alcohol by volume -lrb- abv -rrb- would see duty halved and beer below 2.5 % would see " significant " reductions , cutting the price of a pint by up to 8p .
' be brave ' but figures obtained by the liberal democrats earlier show that every year since 2000 around 100 children aged under eight have been admitted to hospital for alcohol-related problems .
the lib dems say the 10-year freeze on duty on spirits should end and it should go up with in line with inflation since 1997 - adding about an extra £ 1.50 per bottle .
dan shenker , of alcohol concern , told the bbc the government had to persuade people not to drink excessively and " be brave " in taking steps to ensure alcohol did not become too cheap .
in february the british medical association said pricing and promotion of drinks was fuelling an " alcohol epidemic " .
and last year , the health alcohol alliance campaign group called for tax on alcohol to be increased .
initial findings from a government review of " evidence on the relationship between alcohol , price , promotion and harm " are expected in the summer .
on tuesday the government announced its measures for dealing with binge drinking - including a " two-strikes-and-you 're-out " policy for off-licences caught selling drink to under-18s .
your comments : i am a student in sheffield currently and drinks are already getting too expensive , especially with pubs and clubs charging a large amount for entrance fees .
