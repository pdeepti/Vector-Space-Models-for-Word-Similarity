" given the precarious state of today 's financial markets and their vital importance to the daily lives of the american people , government intervention is not only warranted , it is essential , " he said at the white house .

18 , follows the court 's dissolution of basque nationalist action -lrb- anv -rrb- on tuesday , the region 's third-strongest party at municipal level , because of eta links .
the parties had emerged as the successors of eta 's political wing batasuna after it was outlawed in 2003 .
national court judge baltasar garzon had earlier slapped a temporary ban on the two parties to prevent them from contesting the national parliamentary elections held on march 9 .
prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's government and prosecutors had sought a ban on the parties , which garzon described as having close financial and other links with batasuna and eta .
the pctv is represented at municipal level , and has nine mps in the basque regional parliament .
half of the anv 's electoral lists had previously been prohibited in the may 2007 municipal elections , but the party nevertheless rose to the region 's third-largest force , gaining control of about 30 localities .
eta , which has killed more than 820 people in its four-decade campaign for a sovereign basque state , has been listed as a terrorist organization by the european union and the united states .
the bans followed the constitutional court 's decision to prohibit a regional referendum on the self-determination of the basque region , planned by the regional government , last week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 19.09.2008 eu aims to fight drug use with new action plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine is back in style , making the rounds among europe 's youth with a brand new drug-free campaign , the european union hopes to keep young people substance free - and improve cooperation between the bloc 's member states . two million people in the european union are dependent on drugs and roughly 7,500 die every year as a consequence of their addiction – statistics which are reason enough for the eu to fight drug consumption and the spread of drugs .
the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm , announced its new plan on thursday , sept .
18 , from brussels .
at the center of the new action plan is the development of care and counseling options for drug users , as well as an increase in police and customs controls to combat drug smuggling .
poster girl for substance abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amy winehouse 's drug difficulties are frequent tabloid fodder most people expect to celebrate their 25th birthday , but for others , reaching this age is almost a miracle .
that british soul singer amy winehouse just managed to celebrate a quarter of a century is impressive .
with her excessive drug and alcohol use , it seems winehouse has an appetite for self-destruction .
the main substance responsible for her downward spiral : cocaine .
winehouse is a particularly extreme poster girl for the danger that seems to be lurking just around the corner for european youths .
although the consumption of heroin as well as synthetic drugs has stagnated or even decreased slightly in some countries , according to the newest statistics from the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction , cocaine has n't become the number one most fashionable drug in just musician and manager circles .
" we have ascertained a worldwide increase in cocaine consumption that is very worrying , " said european commission vice-president jacques barrot .
allies in the war on drugs the uk , france and spain are seeing this increase particularly in youths between the ages of 15 and 16 .
and to counteract negative role models like whinehouse , the commission also wants to get celebrities to support its campaign against drugs .
" today i want to call for a european alliance in the struggle against drugs .
the goal is to sensitize the population , particularly the youth , but also to make businesses and local public authorities aware of the problem , " said barrot .
" those who join the alliance commit to taking concrete measures .
we also want to incorporate famous personalities to directly address youths . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot says cooperation among the eu nations is essential in the fight against drugs improved cooperation between the individual eu nations is also at the foreground of the new eu action plan .
" that is our strength - being able to launch large prevention campaigns on a europe-wide level .
and we are going to do everything we can to get a europe-wide campaign off the ground , " said barrot .
drugs + car = bad combo his other goal is uniform drug legislation across europe .
barrot also reportedly wants bloc-wide rules against drug use on the road because young people are n't sufficiently aware of the dangerous relationship between drugs and driving .
from the eu commission 's perspective , close cooperation between police and customs authorities against drug smuggling is also necessary .
according to data from barrot , illegal substances are increasingly making it to europe via the seaway from west africa . anke hagedorn -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with her excessive drug and alcohol use , it seems winehouse has an appetite for self-destruction .
the main substance responsible for her downward spiral : cocaine .
winehouse is a particularly extreme poster girl for the danger that seems to be lurking just around the corner for european youths .

the goal is to sensitize the population , particularly the youth , but also to make businesses and local public authorities aware of the problem , " said barrot .

counter-demonstrators carried signs with slogans including " stop the nazi congress - stop pro koeln " and a few scuffled with the right-wing organisers .
one leftist protester was briefly detained by police , a spokesman said .
some 3,000 police officers from north rhine-westphalia and neighboring states are being deployed in cologne this weekend in the hope that they 'll be able to maintain peace and security . the organizers from pro koeln - a self-described " civil movement " which has , however , been represented on the municipal council for four years now - are among the most vocal opponents to a project to build a new mosque in cologne . the group used the recent green-lighting of the construction plans to rally together other far-right groups in europe who share its view that german and europe are increasingly becoming " islamicized . " government , experts label pro-koeln extremist a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry criticised the event friday , calling pro-koeln an " extremist " group that aimed to undermine good relations between muslims and non-muslims . in chorus , a foreign affairs spokesperson for the federal government said : " in our country there is no place for radical right-wing groups who discriminate against minorities under the guise of a citizens ’ movement . " wolfgang kapust , an expert on the far-right definitively labeled pro-koeln an extremist grouping . " you can see it in the biographies of their leaders .
they 're members of the national democratic party , they 're in the republicans , and they established the very radical german league for people and homeland .
and all of these organizations and parties are characterized by far-right positions , racism , and a strong sense of nationalism . " no koelsch for nazis a wide majority of cologne residents are planning to clearly show that they want nothing to do with the congress .
they 've made hundreds of signs calling for passive resistance to the event .
the city 's barkeepers have declared that they will not be serving any of the local cologne beer , koelsch , to nazis .
and muslim groups in this city where every eighth resident is muslim have planned peaceful gatherings on the site of the planned mosque . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " prevent nazi congress " is scrawled on a cologne monument some onlookers are wondering why the city has n't banned the congress from taking place .
but politician ruprecht polenz , head of a christian-muslim peace initiative , said that 's not so easily done . " they 're clever , " he said .
" they 're not going to show up sporting swastikas .
rather , they 'll use slogans meant to pick up on any resentments .
there are problems with integration .
the question is , how do i handle it ?
do i contribute to the problem by reacting aggressively , or do i try , with dialogue , to get to the bottom of things and get closer to a solution ? " cologne residents to give the cold shoulder cologne 's city government has also had mixed feelings about hosting the congress , and not because of the bill of more than a million euros the city will have to foot once it 's all over .
officials are worried about the bad name that such an event could give a city that prides itself on being an exceptionally tolerant place to live . mayor fritz schramma has called on residents to show the far-right " the cold shoulder . " " shut your windows and doors , lower your shutters , " he said in a statement .
" make it clear to pro koeln and its camarilla : you are not welcome in cologne . " the right-wing extremists have been denied permission to gather in front of the city 's most famous landmark , the cologne cathedral .
instead , the event has been relegated to a city suburb . whether pro koeln 's attempt to unify europe 's nationalists will succeed in cologne remains to be seen .
in the run-up to the event , the organizers boasted that big names on the far-right scene would be in attendance - jean marie le pen , the head of france 's national front , for example , or the head of the austria 's freedom party . le pen , for his part , has already let it be known that pro-koeln was lying .
he said he had never had any plans to come to cologne . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

counter-demonstrators carried signs with slogans including " stop the nazi congress - stop pro koeln " and a few scuffled with the right-wing organisers .
one leftist protester was briefly detained by police , a spokesman said .
some 3,000 police officers from north rhine-westphalia and neighboring states are being deployed in cologne this weekend in the hope that they 'll be able to maintain peace and security . the organizers from pro koeln - a self-described " civil movement " which has , however , been represented on the municipal council for four years now - are among the most vocal opponents to a project to build a new mosque in cologne . the group used the recent green-lighting of the construction plans to rally together other far-right groups in europe who share its view that german and europe are increasingly becoming " islamicized .

18 , follows the court 's dissolution of basque nationalist action -lrb- anv -rrb- on tuesday , the region 's third-strongest party at municipal level , because of eta links .
the parties had emerged as the successors of eta 's political wing batasuna after it was outlawed in 2003 .
national court judge baltasar garzon had earlier slapped a temporary ban on the two parties to prevent them from contesting the national parliamentary elections held on march 9 .
prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's government and prosecutors had sought a ban on the parties , which garzon described as having close financial and other links with batasuna and eta .
the pctv is represented at municipal level , and has nine mps in the basque regional parliament .
half of the anv 's electoral lists had previously been prohibited in the may 2007 municipal elections , but the party nevertheless rose to the region 's third-largest force , gaining control of about 30 localities .
eta , which has killed more than 820 people in its four-decade campaign for a sovereign basque state , has been listed as a terrorist organization by the european union and the united states .
the bans followed the constitutional court 's decision to prohibit a regional referendum on the self-determination of the basque region , planned by the regional government , last week .
basque nationalist analysts accuse the spanish government and judiciary of using the fight against eta as a pretext to block any discussion on independence . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 , the exhibition consists of 15 artworks along with documents describing their seizure or forced sale , later changes in ownership and ultimate restitution .
valuable porcelain and book collections from dresden 's intellectual von klemperer family are included in the show .
the gestapo confiscated the family 's collection in 1938 , placing it in dresden 's municipal art collection and the saxony state library . before the second world war , nazi germany made it illegal for jews to own art treasures , forcing them to sell them .
later during the holocaust , jewish property throughout eastern europe was seized by nazi officials .
exhibition organizers said thursday that many of the confiscated paintings and other treasures had still not been recovered by the lawful heirs of the original owners .
taking responsibility for stolen art michael blumenthal , director of the museum , charged that german art collectors , dealers and museums had all profited by being able to purchase art at reduced prices .
he praised germany 's current efforts to give back the art , but said he was disappointed that heirs had no absolute legal right to reclaim the artworks .
at a ceremony on thursday evening , minister of culture bernd neumann called for " fair and just " solutions in returning the work stolen by nazi officials .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 19.09.2008 journalist stefan aust : baader-meinhof film reflects raf reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der baader-meinhof komplex opens across germany on sept .
25 journalist and author stefan aust 's book " der baader-meinhof komplex " has been used as the basis for a soon-to-be-released film of the same name .
he told deutsche welle about why the raf still interests people . both the book and the film chronicle the events of the late ' 60s and ' 70s surrounding the german terror group the red army faction .
aust spoke with dw-radio about the movement 's protagonists , the spirit of the time and the film .
deutsche welle : what do you think of the film , having written the book that the film 's based on ? stefan aust : actually , i think it 's a really great film .
it 's really close to the book , and the book was as close to reality as i could do it .
i think it 's the same spirit that 's in the book that inspired the filmmakers to do it .
it 's a fiction film , but has elements of a documentary as if you had been with this group , with the people , with the terrorists all the time during a whole decade . what are the fictional parts and what are the real parts ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan aust said raf leaders lost their sense of reality the whole thing is as close to reality as you could do in a feature film .
a lot of dialogue is more or less authentic , as i did the research .
some parts are exactly as they were in reality , so for instance we had parts in the courtroom in stammheim , when they were on trial there .
it was word for word .
everything that was said in the courtroom was recorded and written down and we used that for the script .
if you had dialogue , for instance , in prison - the fights between the two women , gudrun ensslin and ulrike meinhof - it was reconstructed out of letters that they sent to one another .
so it 's very close to reality . concerning the book and maybe your own personal research , what was it that got you interested in this topic ? well , i got to know some of the people who went underground , who were members of the red army faction , because i was working for a school magazine in a little town in northern germany together with the younger brother of the editor of the leftist , radical magazine konkret , klaus rainer roehl , who was the husband of ulrike meinhof .
so i knew them when i was still going to school . when i left school , i worked for three years for that magazine and that was the high-time of the students ' movement and radical developments , so i knew ulrike meinhof pretty well , i also knew the lawyer horst mahler pretty well ; he became a member of the red army faction .
when the whole thing started in 1970 i was working for public television in germany , and i had to do a lot of documentaries , short and long and magazine-type stories , about what happened .
so i knew everything quite well . in the beginning of the ' 80s i decided that i wanted to know everything .
so i quit my job , more or less , and spent about three years researching and writing the book . bildunterschrift : stefan aust said he knew the leadership of the raf , but was not friends with them you said you knew these people .
would you have considered yourselves as friends ? that would be a little too much .
i was a very young journalist at that time .
i started when i was just 20 or 21 and they were all a little bit older .
so i knew them , i was rather close to them , we were not friends , and i was always a little bit younger than they were and i was not as radical as they had been . what do you think drove them ?
what was the overarching goal that they were going for ? i think some of them really wanted to change the world .
they felt solidarity with the poor , and unemployed and exploited people of the world , so they fought imperialism .
that 's what they thought .
they fought against the police , they fought against the state and they forgot that they were n't putting bombs in " dead places " ... but on living human beings .
they became very cruel in their attempt to fight the cruelty of the world . do you think they lost sight at some point of the goal that they 'd started with ? they mainly lost their realistic view of reality .
suddenly , when they went underground , they thought and felt that they lived in a police state , a fascist police state .
and when you are living in a fascist police state you are allowed to do anything .
they had to change reality and their view on reality first in order to be able to do all these terrible things . even 30 years later there 's still a fascination with the raf and still this swirl of controversy because they began with such idealistic views .
what do you think makes the raf so intriguing for people even today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der baader-meinhof komplex film is as close to reality as possible , aust said i think it was the biggest crisis that post-war germany had had .
it was an attack on the state , on the government , on the authorities of the government and on the representatives of the government .
they killed important people .
it was really a threat to the stability of this country , and actually it was the only threat after the war that this country ever had from the inside . when you think about the german autumn in ' 77 , which was 31 years ago , it was really a state of crisis we were in .
in the collective memory of the germans it 's a little bit like september 11 for the united states . what do you think the majority opinion about the raf is right now ?
that they were terrorists or some kind of revolutionary heroes ? i think it 's both .
we tried in this film to show what they really were .
they were a group of people from a certain age , from a certain society , for a certain decade - the decade of revolution all over the world - and they felt themselves being revolutionary .
in the end it was a group of people killing other people and in the end killing themselves .
so i think most people see them more as terrorists than as revolutionary heroes , which sometimes happened in the ' 70s . is that the message that you want people watching the film to come away with ? yes , to take the group down to earth .
to make them human and to show what they really did .
because terrorism is terror , and people sometimes forget that . interview : eric heath -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 journalist and author stefan aust 's book " der baader-meinhof komplex " has been used as the basis for a soon-to-be-released film of the same name .
he told deutsche welle about why the raf still interests people . both the book and the film chronicle the events of the late ' 60s and ' 70s surrounding the german terror group the red army faction .
aust spoke with dw-radio about the movement 's protagonists , the spirit of the time and the film .
deutsche welle : what do you think of the film , having written the book that the film 's based on ? stefan aust : actually , i think it 's a really great film .
it 's really close to the book , and the book was as close to reality as i could do it .
i think it 's the same spirit that 's in the book that inspired the filmmakers to do it .
it 's a fiction film , but has elements of a documentary as if you had been with this group , with the people , with the terrorists all the time during a whole decade . what are the fictional parts and what are the real parts ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan aust said raf leaders lost their sense of reality the whole thing is as close to reality as you could do in a feature film .
a lot of dialogue is more or less authentic , as i did the research .
some parts are exactly as they were in reality , so for instance we had parts in the courtroom in stammheim , when they were on trial there .
it was word for word .
everything that was said in the courtroom was recorded and written down and we used that for the script .
if you had dialogue , for instance , in prison - the fights between the two women , gudrun ensslin and ulrike meinhof - it was reconstructed out of letters that they sent to one another .
so it 's very close to reality . concerning the book and maybe your own personal research , what was it that got you interested in this topic ? well , i got to know some of the people who went underground , who were members of the red army faction , because i was working for a school magazine in a little town in northern germany together with the younger brother of the editor of the leftist , radical magazine konkret , klaus rainer roehl , who was the husband of ulrike meinhof .
so i knew them when i was still going to school . when i left school , i worked for three years for that magazine and that was the high-time of the students ' movement and radical developments , so i knew ulrike meinhof pretty well , i also knew the lawyer horst mahler pretty well ; he became a member of the red army faction .
when the whole thing started in 1970 i was working for public television in germany , and i had to do a lot of documentaries , short and long and magazine-type stories , about what happened .
so i knew everything quite well . in the beginning of the ' 80s i decided that i wanted to know everything .
so i quit my job , more or less , and spent about three years researching and writing the book . bildunterschrift : stefan aust said he knew the leadership of the raf , but was not friends with them you said you knew these people .
would you have considered yourselves as friends ? that would be a little too much .
i was a very young journalist at that time .
i started when i was just 20 or 21 and they were all a little bit older .
so i knew them , i was rather close to them , we were not friends , and i was always a little bit younger than they were and i was not as radical as they had been . what do you think drove them ?
what was the overarching goal that they were going for ? i think some of them really wanted to change the world .
they felt solidarity with the poor , and unemployed and exploited people of the world , so they fought imperialism .
that 's what they thought .
they fought against the police , they fought against the state and they forgot that they were n't putting bombs in " dead places " ... but on living human beings .
they became very cruel in their attempt to fight the cruelty of the world . do you think they lost sight at some point of the goal that they 'd started with ? they mainly lost their realistic view of reality .
suddenly , when they went underground , they thought and felt that they lived in a police state , a fascist police state .
and when you are living in a fascist police state you are allowed to do anything .
they had to change reality and their view on reality first in order to be able to do all these terrible things . even 30 years later there 's still a fascination with the raf and still this swirl of controversy because they began with such idealistic views .
what do you think makes the raf so intriguing for people even today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der baader-meinhof komplex film is as close to reality as possible , aust said i think it was the biggest crisis that post-war germany had had .
it was an attack on the state , on the government , on the authorities of the government and on the representatives of the government .
they killed important people .
it was really a threat to the stability of this country , and actually it was the only threat after the war that this country ever had from the inside . when you think about the german autumn in ' 77 , which was 31 years ago , it was really a state of crisis we were in .
in the collective memory of the germans it 's a little bit like september 11 for the united states . what do you think the majority opinion about the raf is right now ?
that they were terrorists or some kind of revolutionary heroes ? i think it 's both .
we tried in this film to show what they really were .
they were a group of people from a certain age , from a certain society , for a certain decade - the decade of revolution all over the world - and they felt themselves being revolutionary .
in the end it was a group of people killing other people and in the end killing themselves .
so i think most people see them more as terrorists than as revolutionary heroes , which sometimes happened in the ' 70s . is that the message that you want people watching the film to come away with ? yes , to take the group down to earth .
to make them human and to show what they really did .
because terrorism is terror , and people sometimes forget that . interview : eric heath -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de sums up press reactions to her win . the luxemburger wort commented friday , sept .
19 , that livni was right to say that she would approach the job of prime minister with " great reverence . "
" further reconciliation with the palestinians , treatment of iran 's increasing nuclear power , and normalization of relations with syria are the three largest geo-strategic challenges facing israel , " the paper said .
" the long-term vitality of this high-tech nation sandwiched between the golan heights and the red sea depends on the clever handling of these dossiers . " the conservative swedish daily svenska dagbladet predicted that these issues will very soon be causing tzipi livni severe headaches should she be sworn in as prime minister .
" current prime minister ehud olmert 's plans for a one-sided withdrawal from the occupied territories were abandoned when hezbollah provoked the second war in lebanon , " the paper said .
" instead of a withdrawal , there was the hamas coup in gaza , which is now blocking progress in the west bank .
and it probably wo n't be long before the terrorists working for the hamas regime put livni 's skills to the hardest of tests . " london 's the independent commented friday on the first task awaiting livni - that of forming a government in just 42 days .
the task will be difficult , the paper said , because it will involve her winning some support from one of the small extremist parties which hold the balance of power in israeli politics .
" in the past , ms livni has hinted that she is not prepared to make random concessions to every interest group ; indeed , she wants to break with the wheeler-dealing tradition of israeli politics and restore public trust in the political process , " the paper wrote .
" she now has to strike a delicate balance between doing that and ensuring she can form an administration which will last long enough to present some serious progress on peace to the israeli electorate at the next election in 18 months time .
that is not long .
israel 's controversial security wall may have stopped the suicide bombs for the time being , but she must not be lulled into thinking she has the luxury of time . " israel 's english-language newspaper , haaretz , commented that all eyes will be on livni as she tries to form a government .
" being clean means more than not accepting envelopes filled with money , " the paper wrote .
" political cleanliness also requires making decisions that are statesmanlike and not opportunistic .
livni has to prove that , in contrast to her predecessor , she chooses the persons best suited to the job to be her cabinet ministers and not those who claim to represent the ' grassroots , ' those who threaten the unity of the ranks and those who threaten to call for new elections . " the berliner zeitung commented on the rise of " frauenpower " - the power of women - in israel , writing : " if livni were the lead singer of a band , it might be called ' tzipi and the expectations . '
western countries are among those who see huge promise in her .
in europe in particular , she 's being treated like a new beacon of light in the middle east peace process . "

25 , 2009 jewish-owned art seized by the nazis from 1933 onwards is featured at a new exhibition at the jewish museum in berlin .
meanwhile , germany 's culture minister has called for the " fair " return of jewish art . opening on friday , sept .
19 , the exhibition consists of 15 artworks along with documents describing their seizure or forced sale , later changes in ownership and ultimate restitution .
valuable porcelain and book collections from dresden 's intellectual von klemperer family are included in the show .
the gestapo confiscated the family 's collection in 1938 , placing it in dresden 's municipal art collection and the saxony state library . before the second world war , nazi germany made it illegal for jews to own art treasures , forcing them to sell them .
later during the holocaust , jewish property throughout eastern europe was seized by nazi officials .
exhibition organizers said thursday that many of the confiscated paintings and other treasures had still not been recovered by the lawful heirs of the original owners .
taking responsibility for stolen art michael blumenthal , director of the museum , charged that german art collectors , dealers and museums had all profited by being able to purchase art at reduced prices .
he praised germany 's current efforts to give back the art , but said he was disappointed that heirs had no absolute legal right to reclaim the artworks .
at a ceremony on thursday evening , minister of culture bernd neumann called for " fair and just " solutions in returning the work stolen by nazi officials .
" more than 60 years after the war 's end , germany is unrestrained in its moral responsibility for the restitution of art looted by the nazis , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 19.09.2008 journalist stefan aust : baader-meinhof film reflects raf reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der baader-meinhof komplex opens across germany on sept .
25 journalist and author stefan aust 's book " der baader-meinhof komplex " has been used as the basis for a soon-to-be-released film of the same name .
he told deutsche welle about why the raf still interests people . both the book and the film chronicle the events of the late ' 60s and ' 70s surrounding the german terror group the red army faction .
aust spoke with dw-radio about the movement 's protagonists , the spirit of the time and the film .
deutsche welle : what do you think of the film , having written the book that the film 's based on ? stefan aust : actually , i think it 's a really great film .
it 's really close to the book , and the book was as close to reality as i could do it .
i think it 's the same spirit that 's in the book that inspired the filmmakers to do it .
it 's a fiction film , but has elements of a documentary as if you had been with this group , with the people , with the terrorists all the time during a whole decade . what are the fictional parts and what are the real parts ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan aust said raf leaders lost their sense of reality the whole thing is as close to reality as you could do in a feature film .
a lot of dialogue is more or less authentic , as i did the research .
some parts are exactly as they were in reality , so for instance we had parts in the courtroom in stammheim , when they were on trial there .
it was word for word .
everything that was said in the courtroom was recorded and written down and we used that for the script .
if you had dialogue , for instance , in prison - the fights between the two women , gudrun ensslin and ulrike meinhof - it was reconstructed out of letters that they sent to one another .
so it 's very close to reality . concerning the book and maybe your own personal research , what was it that got you interested in this topic ? well , i got to know some of the people who went underground , who were members of the red army faction , because i was working for a school magazine in a little town in northern germany together with the younger brother of the editor of the leftist , radical magazine konkret , klaus rainer roehl , who was the husband of ulrike meinhof .
so i knew them when i was still going to school . when i left school , i worked for three years for that magazine and that was the high-time of the students ' movement and radical developments , so i knew ulrike meinhof pretty well , i also knew the lawyer horst mahler pretty well ; he became a member of the red army faction .
when the whole thing started in 1970 i was working for public television in germany , and i had to do a lot of documentaries , short and long and magazine-type stories , about what happened .
so i knew everything quite well . in the beginning of the ' 80s i decided that i wanted to know everything .
so i quit my job , more or less , and spent about three years researching and writing the book . bildunterschrift : stefan aust said he knew the leadership of the raf , but was not friends with them you said you knew these people .
would you have considered yourselves as friends ? that would be a little too much .
i was a very young journalist at that time .
i started when i was just 20 or 21 and they were all a little bit older .
so i knew them , i was rather close to them , we were not friends , and i was always a little bit younger than they were and i was not as radical as they had been . what do you think drove them ?
what was the overarching goal that they were going for ? i think some of them really wanted to change the world .
they felt solidarity with the poor , and unemployed and exploited people of the world , so they fought imperialism .
that 's what they thought .
they fought against the police , they fought against the state and they forgot that they were n't putting bombs in " dead places " ... but on living human beings .
they became very cruel in their attempt to fight the cruelty of the world . do you think they lost sight at some point of the goal that they 'd started with ? they mainly lost their realistic view of reality .
suddenly , when they went underground , they thought and felt that they lived in a police state , a fascist police state .
and when you are living in a fascist police state you are allowed to do anything .
they had to change reality and their view on reality first in order to be able to do all these terrible things . even 30 years later there 's still a fascination with the raf and still this swirl of controversy because they began with such idealistic views .
what do you think makes the raf so intriguing for people even today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der baader-meinhof komplex film is as close to reality as possible , aust said i think it was the biggest crisis that post-war germany had had .
it was an attack on the state , on the government , on the authorities of the government and on the representatives of the government .
they killed important people .
it was really a threat to the stability of this country , and actually it was the only threat after the war that this country ever had from the inside . when you think about the german autumn in ' 77 , which was 31 years ago , it was really a state of crisis we were in .
in the collective memory of the germans it 's a little bit like september 11 for the united states . what do you think the majority opinion about the raf is right now ?
that they were terrorists or some kind of revolutionary heroes ? i think it 's both .
we tried in this film to show what they really were .
they were a group of people from a certain age , from a certain society , for a certain decade - the decade of revolution all over the world - and they felt themselves being revolutionary .
in the end it was a group of people killing other people and in the end killing themselves .
so i think most people see them more as terrorists than as revolutionary heroes , which sometimes happened in the ' 70s . is that the message that you want people watching the film to come away with ? yes , to take the group down to earth .
to make them human and to show what they really did .
because terrorism is terror , and people sometimes forget that . interview : eric heath -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , follows the court 's dissolution of basque nationalist action -lrb- anv -rrb- on tuesday , the region 's third-strongest party at municipal level , because of eta links .
the parties had emerged as the successors of eta 's political wing batasuna after it was outlawed in 2003 .
national court judge baltasar garzon had earlier slapped a temporary ban on the two parties to prevent them from contesting the national parliamentary elections held on march 9 .
prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's government and prosecutors had sought a ban on the parties , which garzon described as having close financial and other links with batasuna and eta .
the pctv is represented at municipal level , and has nine mps in the basque regional parliament .
half of the anv 's electoral lists had previously been prohibited in the may 2007 municipal elections , but the party nevertheless rose to the region 's third-largest force , gaining control of about 30 localities .
eta , which has killed more than 820 people in its four-decade campaign for a sovereign basque state , has been listed as a terrorist organization by the european union and the united states .
the bans followed the constitutional court 's decision to prohibit a regional referendum on the self-determination of the basque region , planned by the regional government , last week .
basque nationalist analysts accuse the spanish government and judiciary of using the fight against eta as a pretext to block any discussion on independence . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a substantial offer from the eu is on the table .
we are still in talks with iran to receive a concrete and , we hope , positive response to this offer .
this has until now still been lacking , " he said when asked about the calls for sanctions . germany is one of six world powers attempting to convince iran to halt sensitive nuclear work with an incentives package in exchange for full suspension of uranium enrichment . " should there be no progress on the negotiations track , the german government believes the un security council will become more relevant again and discussions will have to be held whether there should be new resolutions . " this is not the track we are seeking - we want progress from negotiations .
but unfortunately what we have seen until now has not made us optimistic . " ploetner said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had stressed the importance of settling the issue quickly during talks monday with his iranian counterpart manouchehr mottaki . officials from the six nations , which also includes russia , china and the uk , are scheduled to meet friday , sept .
19 , before the un general assembly convenes in new york .
foreign ministers are expected to convene over iran during the annual meeting . unity required to approve new sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains unlikely that the security council will unite behind the french sanctions resolution european union foreign policy chief javier solana said he believes russia and china are " quite worried " about iran 's nuclear program and that a report presented monday by the iaea nuclear watchdog " is n't good for iran . " but he added that he did n't think moscow and beijing would completely turn around and support the west 's call for more sanctions . washington and european capitals have accused tehran of enriching uranium in order to produce atomic weapons .
iran has insisted its nuclear program is intended solely to create electricity . " the main option here is a fourth un sanctions resolution , but that is a possibility that requires russian , chinese and european cooperation , " a senior us official , who asked not to be named as his comments were sensitive , told reuters news agency . state department spokesman sean mccormack said on thursday there was agreement to move forward with a new sanctions resolution , but it was unclear how far the six political directors would get in hammering out a detailed agreement . tough steps unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would not change course " this is probably a discussion which will be aimed at seeing where each of the individual states are in terms of the timeline of moving forward and the content of a new resolution , " mccormack told reporters . iran experts have said that even if the un security council members plus germany , who are responsible for negotiations with iran , agreed to a new resolution , it would be a weaker version than washington and others wanted . restrictions would likely be placed on iranian companies but not the oil industry or oil products . " my guess is that the sanctions will be watered down and there is every reason for the russians to drag this out , " gary samore of the council on foreign relations told reuters . ahead of friday 's meeting , iran 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , again said tehran would not stop its enrichment program regardless of whether the un decides to impose a new round of sanctions . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw-world 's karl zawdzky asks whether it 's enough . british mortgage bank hbos fled into the arms of lloyds tsb ; morgan stanley is casting about for a savior , as is the largest american savings and loan bank , washington mutual .
whereas banks such lehman brothers are being sacrificed to the turmoil on the markets , other institutions like the international insurer american international group -lrb- aig -rrb- are being rescued .
and that begs the question : who will be the next to go down ? the best advice is , save yourself if you can .
because without a doubt , this is the biggest crisis since the crash of 1929 , which plunged the world into a depression , saw countless firms file for bankruptcy , brought massive unemployment and put wind in the sails of those who sought political gain . the financial markets are out of control .
only the mistakes and excesses of the boom are being corrected .
for too long , people thought that the only way would ever be up , that wealth without work was possible . many speculators even managed to accrue wealth in this way .
the bubble has long since been recognized but the realization that every bubble - whether on the financial market , the property market or the raw commodities market - has to burst sometime .
that 's exactly what 's happening now .
the time in which greed superseded reason is over - for now .
security is what 's needed ; the price of gold is jumping like never before . governments keeping their cool in contrast to the players on the financial markets , governments and central banks are keeping a level head .
banks and insurers , whose demise would not just shake up global financial systems but could bring them down like dominos , are being saved . aig , one of the world 's largest insurers with more than 100 million customers in 130 countries is being rescued by state intervention .
the reason : too many americans would have lost their retirement savings had the company collapsed .
aside from this , aig is a big credit insurer for banks around the world .
its demise could have triggered a core meltdown in the global financial system .
in comparison , the collapse of lehman brothers , the third-largest american investment bank , was painful , but survivable . what this means , though , is that while the financial markets are shaky and the stock exchanges are up and down , governments and central banks have n't let themselves become infected with the general sense of insecurity , rather , they 've acted decisively . the financial markets are literally being flooded with dollars , euros , yen , pounds and rubles to keep the systems running .
us treasury secretary henry paulson and federal reserve chairman ben bernanke are working on a solution which would involve creating a government-sponsored vehicle to relieve american financial companies of their toxic investments . greater regulation needed so the state emerges as the savior .
initial news of the bailout led to a swift recovery .
first , profits were privatized and now , losses are being socialized .
with the banks saved , the whole game can start over again .

meanwhile , germany 's culture minister has called for the " fair " return of jewish art . opening on friday , sept .
19 , the exhibition consists of 15 artworks along with documents describing their seizure or forced sale , later changes in ownership and ultimate restitution .
valuable porcelain and book collections from dresden 's intellectual von klemperer family are included in the show .
the gestapo confiscated the family 's collection in 1938 , placing it in dresden 's municipal art collection and the saxony state library . before the second world war , nazi germany made it illegal for jews to own art treasures , forcing them to sell them .
later during the holocaust , jewish property throughout eastern europe was seized by nazi officials .
exhibition organizers said thursday that many of the confiscated paintings and other treasures had still not been recovered by the lawful heirs of the original owners .
taking responsibility for stolen art michael blumenthal , director of the museum , charged that german art collectors , dealers and museums had all profited by being able to purchase art at reduced prices .
he praised germany 's current efforts to give back the art , but said he was disappointed that heirs had no absolute legal right to reclaim the artworks .
at a ceremony on thursday evening , minister of culture bernd neumann called for " fair and just " solutions in returning the work stolen by nazi officials .
" more than 60 years after the war 's end , germany is unrestrained in its moral responsibility for the restitution of art looted by the nazis , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw-world 's karl zawdzky asks whether it 's enough . british mortgage bank hbos fled into the arms of lloyds tsb ; morgan stanley is casting about for a savior , as is the largest american savings and loan bank , washington mutual .
whereas banks such lehman brothers are being sacrificed to the turmoil on the markets , other institutions like the international insurer american international group -lrb- aig -rrb- are being rescued .
and that begs the question : who will be the next to go down ? the best advice is , save yourself if you can .
because without a doubt , this is the biggest crisis since the crash of 1929 , which plunged the world into a depression , saw countless firms file for bankruptcy , brought massive unemployment and put wind in the sails of those who sought political gain . the financial markets are out of control .
only the mistakes and excesses of the boom are being corrected .
for too long , people thought that the only way would ever be up , that wealth without work was possible . many speculators even managed to accrue wealth in this way .
the bubble has long since been recognized but the realization that every bubble - whether on the financial market , the property market or the raw commodities market - has to burst sometime .
that 's exactly what 's happening now .
the time in which greed superseded reason is over - for now .
security is what 's needed ; the price of gold is jumping like never before . governments keeping their cool in contrast to the players on the financial markets , governments and central banks are keeping a level head .
banks and insurers , whose demise would not just shake up global financial systems but could bring them down like dominos , are being saved . aig , one of the world 's largest insurers with more than 100 million customers in 130 countries is being rescued by state intervention .
the reason : too many americans would have lost their retirement savings had the company collapsed .
aside from this , aig is a big credit insurer for banks around the world .
its demise could have triggered a core meltdown in the global financial system .
in comparison , the collapse of lehman brothers , the third-largest american investment bank , was painful , but survivable . what this means , though , is that while the financial markets are shaky and the stock exchanges are up and down , governments and central banks have n't let themselves become infected with the general sense of insecurity , rather , they 've acted decisively . the financial markets are literally being flooded with dollars , euros , yen , pounds and rubles to keep the systems running .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 19.09.2008 european press review : livni up against great expectations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni hopes to become israel 's first female prime minister in more than three decades israel 's foreign minister tzipi livni is beginning the task of putting together a new government after she was elected leader of the ruling kadima party this week .
dw-world.de sums up press reactions to her win . the luxemburger wort commented friday , sept .
19 , that livni was right to say that she would approach the job of prime minister with " great reverence . "
" further reconciliation with the palestinians , treatment of iran 's increasing nuclear power , and normalization of relations with syria are the three largest geo-strategic challenges facing israel , " the paper said .
" the long-term vitality of this high-tech nation sandwiched between the golan heights and the red sea depends on the clever handling of these dossiers . " the conservative swedish daily svenska dagbladet predicted that these issues will very soon be causing tzipi livni severe headaches should she be sworn in as prime minister .
" current prime minister ehud olmert 's plans for a one-sided withdrawal from the occupied territories were abandoned when hezbollah provoked the second war in lebanon , " the paper said .
" instead of a withdrawal , there was the hamas coup in gaza , which is now blocking progress in the west bank .
and it probably wo n't be long before the terrorists working for the hamas regime put livni 's skills to the hardest of tests . " london 's the independent commented friday on the first task awaiting livni - that of forming a government in just 42 days .
the task will be difficult , the paper said , because it will involve her winning some support from one of the small extremist parties which hold the balance of power in israeli politics .
" in the past , ms livni has hinted that she is not prepared to make random concessions to every interest group ; indeed , she wants to break with the wheeler-dealing tradition of israeli politics and restore public trust in the political process , " the paper wrote .
" she now has to strike a delicate balance between doing that and ensuring she can form an administration which will last long enough to present some serious progress on peace to the israeli electorate at the next election in 18 months time .
that is not long .
israel 's controversial security wall may have stopped the suicide bombs for the time being , but she must not be lulled into thinking she has the luxury of time . " israel 's english-language newspaper , haaretz , commented that all eyes will be on livni as she tries to form a government .
" being clean means more than not accepting envelopes filled with money , " the paper wrote .
" political cleanliness also requires making decisions that are statesmanlike and not opportunistic .
livni has to prove that , in contrast to her predecessor , she chooses the persons best suited to the job to be her cabinet ministers and not those who claim to represent the ' grassroots , ' those who threaten the unity of the ranks and those who threaten to call for new elections . " the berliner zeitung commented on the rise of " frauenpower " - the power of women - in israel , writing : " if livni were the lead singer of a band , it might be called ' tzipi and the expectations . '
western countries are among those who see huge promise in her .
in europe in particular , she 's being treated like a new beacon of light in the middle east peace process . "
despite the difficulties facing livni , the paper said that with her victory , the chance is now greater that those who want a fair peace deal will have greater say . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a letter to staff , munich-based bayern lb , which is controlled by bavaria state , put its risk at up to 300 million euros .
all three banks had placed funds with lehman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal bank kfw is under fire for mistakenly wiring millions to lehman before its collapse " like many other banks active worldwide , our company had a business relationship over many years with lehman brothers , " said the letter signed by bayern chief executive michael kemmer .
he said accountants were still comparing which sums were credits and which were debts to establish the net exposure , but the figure so far was " up to 300 million . "
nrw bank , controlled by the state of north-rhine westphalia , said it had lent money to lehman brothers , but declined to say how much .
" they were n't problem investments , " said a spokesman .
although no german banks have so far failed or been forced to merge , the known exposure of german taxpayers to the crisis was approaching $ 1.2 billion friday .
europe seeks tighter banking regulations global markets have been shaken by the financial earthquake on wall street though indexes in many countries rallied friday after a host of major central banks in america , europe and elsewehere made almost a quarter of a trillion dollars available to struggling banks .
the us federal reserve said it had authorized another $ 180 million lending program to help banks in need of emergency cash . the eu is now seeking to use the us economic meltdown , which it asserts was the result of a negligent attitude towards finance , as motivation to beef up its supervision of the financial sector in two key areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis on wall street has sparked some intense soul-searching " we need more coordinated action by supervisors than currently exists , " said eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia on thursday , sept 18 , in madrid .
" we must move forward faster .
we can not wait until a financial institution operating in seven or 10 countries of the european union has problems such as those of lehman brothers or bear sterns , " he continued the eu ’ s first goal is to tighten regulation of credit ratings agencies , which have come under fire for failing to alert investors about risks threatening borrowers ’ solvency .
the eu commission is also assembling plans to coordinate regulation of insurers and is set to announce a similar plan for the banking sector next month ..
while continental european countries took the initiative to hold talks about tougher oversight of financial speculation , especially hedge funds , before the us financial crisis , european regulators have failed to keep tabs on the frequent cross-border consolidation in the banking industry sector in recent years .
banks are thus largely supervised along national lines .

dw-world.de sums up press reactions to her win . the luxemburger wort commented friday , sept .
19 , that livni was right to say that she would approach the job of prime minister with " great reverence . "
" further reconciliation with the palestinians , treatment of iran 's increasing nuclear power , and normalization of relations with syria are the three largest geo-strategic challenges facing israel , " the paper said .
" the long-term vitality of this high-tech nation sandwiched between the golan heights and the red sea depends on the clever handling of these dossiers . " the conservative swedish daily svenska dagbladet predicted that these issues will very soon be causing tzipi livni severe headaches should she be sworn in as prime minister .
" current prime minister ehud olmert 's plans for a one-sided withdrawal from the occupied territories were abandoned when hezbollah provoked the second war in lebanon , " the paper said .
" instead of a withdrawal , there was the hamas coup in gaza , which is now blocking progress in the west bank .
and it probably wo n't be long before the terrorists working for the hamas regime put livni 's skills to the hardest of tests . " london 's the independent commented friday on the first task awaiting livni - that of forming a government in just 42 days .
the task will be difficult , the paper said , because it will involve her winning some support from one of the small extremist parties which hold the balance of power in israeli politics .
" in the past , ms livni has hinted that she is not prepared to make random concessions to every interest group ; indeed , she wants to break with the wheeler-dealing tradition of israeli politics and restore public trust in the political process , " the paper wrote .
" she now has to strike a delicate balance between doing that and ensuring she can form an administration which will last long enough to present some serious progress on peace to the israeli electorate at the next election in 18 months time .
that is not long .
israel 's controversial security wall may have stopped the suicide bombs for the time being , but she must not be lulled into thinking she has the luxury of time . " israel 's english-language newspaper , haaretz , commented that all eyes will be on livni as she tries to form a government .
" being clean means more than not accepting envelopes filled with money , " the paper wrote .
" political cleanliness also requires making decisions that are statesmanlike and not opportunistic .
livni has to prove that , in contrast to her predecessor , she chooses the persons best suited to the job to be her cabinet ministers and not those who claim to represent the ' grassroots , ' those who threaten the unity of the ranks and those who threaten to call for new elections . " the berliner zeitung commented on the rise of " frauenpower " - the power of women - in israel , writing : " if livni were the lead singer of a band , it might be called ' tzipi and the expectations . '
western countries are among those who see huge promise in her .
in europe in particular , she 's being treated like a new beacon of light in the middle east peace process . "

" the berliner zeitung commented on the rise of " frauenpower " - the power of women - in israel , writing : " if livni were the lead singer of a band , it might be called ' tzipi and the expectations . '
western countries are among those who see huge promise in her .
in europe in particular , she 's being treated like a new beacon of light in the middle east peace process . "

at the latest count , 6,244 children have become ill , four have died and 158 are suffering " acute kidney failure . "
with foreign consumers warily eyeing china 's manufacturing reputation amid claims of delays and cover-ups , robert madelin , director-general for health and consumer protection at the european commission , told reporters in beijing he expected an account of what went wrong .
" we are trying to establish the facts .
we are discussing all aspects of this crisis bilaterally with our colleagues in china , " he said .
" i know from experience that these sorts of cases , where apparently illegal or fraudulent acts lead to problems in safety , are the most difficult for any of us to deal with , " added madelin .
madelin said the eu did not import chinese infant milk powder , and there had been no reports of infant sickness in the bloc from other chinese dairy products .
the scandal 's protagonists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : products of china 's mengniu dairy company have been pulled from starbucks shelves almost one-tenth of liquid milk batches from mengniu dairy and inner mongolia yili industrial group , a beijing olympic games sponsor , contained melamine , a chemical which is banned in food .
several samples of milk from the bright dairy group also had the substance , used in making plastics , china 's general administration of quality supervision , inspection and quarantine found .
chinese media have largely kept quiet about claims that the sanlu group , china 's biggest maker of infant milk powder , concealed the poisonings from the public and senior authorities during the beijing olympics in august .
starbucks pulls questionable milk coffee chain starbucks said its 300-plus cafes in mainland china had pulled milk supplies by mengniu as a precautionary step , but that no employees or customers had fallen ill from the milk .
in singapore , the government food watchdog advised retailers to pull yili yoghurt ice bars from their shelves .
china is vowing to punish errant businesses and officials and there have already been dismissals , detentions and arrests linked to sanlu , 43-percent of which is owned by new zealand diary giant fonterra .
new zealand prime minister helen clark said monday that chinese officials acted last week only after her government pressed beijing .
eu , us target product safety bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and us want to increase awareness of their safety regulations events surrounding the dairy scandal come as eu and us consumer protection officials pledged friday to step up efforts to ensure product safety in china .

" further reconciliation with the palestinians , treatment of iran 's increasing nuclear power , and normalization of relations with syria are the three largest geo-strategic challenges facing israel , " the paper said .
" the long-term vitality of this high-tech nation sandwiched between the golan heights and the red sea depends on the clever handling of these dossiers .

the task will be difficult , the paper said , because it will involve her winning some support from one of the small extremist parties which hold the balance of power in israeli politics .
" in the past , ms livni has hinted that she is not prepared to make random concessions to every interest group ; indeed , she wants to break with the wheeler-dealing tradition of israeli politics and restore public trust in the political process , " the paper wrote .

israel 's controversial security wall may have stopped the suicide bombs for the time being , but she must not be lulled into thinking she has the luxury of time . " israel 's english-language newspaper , haaretz , commented that all eyes will be on livni as she tries to form a government .

israel 's controversial security wall may have stopped the suicide bombs for the time being , but she must not be lulled into thinking she has the luxury of time . " israel 's english-language newspaper , haaretz , commented that all eyes will be on livni as she tries to form a government .
" being clean means more than not accepting envelopes filled with money , " the paper wrote .
" political cleanliness also requires making decisions that are statesmanlike and not opportunistic .
livni has to prove that , in contrast to her predecessor , she chooses the persons best suited to the job to be her cabinet ministers and not those who claim to represent the ' grassroots , ' those who threaten the unity of the ranks and those who threaten to call for new elections . " the berliner zeitung commented on the rise of " frauenpower " - the power of women - in israel , writing : " if livni were the lead singer of a band , it might be called ' tzipi and the expectations . '
western countries are among those who see huge promise in her .
in europe in particular , she 's being treated like a new beacon of light in the middle east peace process . "
despite the difficulties facing livni , the paper said that with her victory , the chance is now greater that those who want a fair peace deal will have greater say . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

counter-demonstrators carried signs with slogans including " stop the nazi congress - stop pro koeln " and a few scuffled with the right-wing organisers .
one leftist protester was briefly detained by police , a spokesman said .
some 3,000 police officers from north rhine-westphalia and neighboring states are being deployed in cologne this weekend in the hope that they 'll be able to maintain peace and security . the organizers from pro koeln - a self-described " civil movement " which has , however , been represented on the municipal council for four years now - are among the most vocal opponents to a project to build a new mosque in cologne . the group used the recent green-lighting of the construction plans to rally together other far-right groups in europe who share its view that german and europe are increasingly becoming " islamicized . " government , experts label pro-koeln extremist a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry criticised the event friday , calling pro-koeln an " extremist " group that aimed to undermine good relations between muslims and non-muslims . in chorus , a foreign affairs spokesperson for the federal government said : " in our country there is no place for radical right-wing groups who discriminate against minorities under the guise of a citizens ’ movement . " wolfgang kapust , an expert on the far-right definitively labeled pro-koeln an extremist grouping . " you can see it in the biographies of their leaders .

they 've made hundreds of signs calling for passive resistance to the event .
the city 's barkeepers have declared that they will not be serving any of the local cologne beer , koelsch , to nazis .
and muslim groups in this city where every eighth resident is muslim have planned peaceful gatherings on the site of the planned mosque . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " prevent nazi congress " is scrawled on a cologne monument some onlookers are wondering why the city has n't banned the congress from taking place .
but politician ruprecht polenz , head of a christian-muslim peace initiative , said that 's not so easily done . " they 're clever , " he said .
" they 're not going to show up sporting swastikas .
rather , they 'll use slogans meant to pick up on any resentments .
there are problems with integration .
the question is , how do i handle it ?
do i contribute to the problem by reacting aggressively , or do i try , with dialogue , to get to the bottom of things and get closer to a solution ? " cologne residents to give the cold shoulder cologne 's city government has also had mixed feelings about hosting the congress , and not because of the bill of more than a million euros the city will have to foot once it 's all over .
officials are worried about the bad name that such an event could give a city that prides itself on being an exceptionally tolerant place to live . mayor fritz schramma has called on residents to show the far-right " the cold shoulder . " " shut your windows and doors , lower your shutters , " he said in a statement .
" make it clear to pro koeln and its camarilla : you are not welcome in cologne . " the right-wing extremists have been denied permission to gather in front of the city 's most famous landmark , the cologne cathedral .
instead , the event has been relegated to a city suburb . whether pro koeln 's attempt to unify europe 's nationalists will succeed in cologne remains to be seen .
in the run-up to the event , the organizers boasted that big names on the far-right scene would be in attendance - jean marie le pen , the head of france 's national front , for example , or the head of the austria 's freedom party . le pen , for his part , has already let it be known that pro-koeln was lying .

25 , 2009 jewish-owned art seized by the nazis from 1933 onwards is featured at a new exhibition at the jewish museum in berlin .
meanwhile , germany 's culture minister has called for the " fair " return of jewish art . opening on friday , sept .
19 , the exhibition consists of 15 artworks along with documents describing their seizure or forced sale , later changes in ownership and ultimate restitution .
valuable porcelain and book collections from dresden 's intellectual von klemperer family are included in the show .
the gestapo confiscated the family 's collection in 1938 , placing it in dresden 's municipal art collection and the saxony state library . before the second world war , nazi germany made it illegal for jews to own art treasures , forcing them to sell them .
later during the holocaust , jewish property throughout eastern europe was seized by nazi officials .
exhibition organizers said thursday that many of the confiscated paintings and other treasures had still not been recovered by the lawful heirs of the original owners .
taking responsibility for stolen art michael blumenthal , director of the museum , charged that german art collectors , dealers and museums had all profited by being able to purchase art at reduced prices .
he praised germany 's current efforts to give back the art , but said he was disappointed that heirs had no absolute legal right to reclaim the artworks .
at a ceremony on thursday evening , minister of culture bernd neumann called for " fair and just " solutions in returning the work stolen by nazi officials .
" more than 60 years after the war 's end , germany is unrestrained in its moral responsibility for the restitution of art looted by the nazis , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that british soul singer amy winehouse just managed to celebrate a quarter of a century is impressive .
with her excessive drug and alcohol use , it seems winehouse has an appetite for self-destruction .
the main substance responsible for her downward spiral : cocaine .
winehouse is a particularly extreme poster girl for the danger that seems to be lurking just around the corner for european youths .
although the consumption of heroin as well as synthetic drugs has stagnated or even decreased slightly in some countries , according to the newest statistics from the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction , cocaine has n't become the number one most fashionable drug in just musician and manager circles .

" that is our strength - being able to launch large prevention campaigns on a europe-wide level .
and we are going to do everything we can to get a europe-wide campaign off the ground , " said barrot .
drugs + car = bad combo his other goal is uniform drug legislation across europe .
barrot also reportedly wants bloc-wide rules against drug use on the road because young people are n't sufficiently aware of the dangerous relationship between drugs and driving .

the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm , announced its new plan on thursday , sept .
18 , from brussels .
at the center of the new action plan is the development of care and counseling options for drug users , as well as an increase in police and customs controls to combat drug smuggling .
poster girl for substance abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amy winehouse 's drug difficulties are frequent tabloid fodder most people expect to celebrate their 25th birthday , but for others , reaching this age is almost a miracle .
that british soul singer amy winehouse just managed to celebrate a quarter of a century is impressive .
with her excessive drug and alcohol use , it seems winehouse has an appetite for self-destruction .
the main substance responsible for her downward spiral : cocaine .
winehouse is a particularly extreme poster girl for the danger that seems to be lurking just around the corner for european youths .
although the consumption of heroin as well as synthetic drugs has stagnated or even decreased slightly in some countries , according to the newest statistics from the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction , cocaine has n't become the number one most fashionable drug in just musician and manager circles .
" we have ascertained a worldwide increase in cocaine consumption that is very worrying , " said european commission vice-president jacques barrot .
allies in the war on drugs the uk , france and spain are seeing this increase particularly in youths between the ages of 15 and 16 .
and to counteract negative role models like whinehouse , the commission also wants to get celebrities to support its campaign against drugs .
" today i want to call for a european alliance in the struggle against drugs .
the goal is to sensitize the population , particularly the youth , but also to make businesses and local public authorities aware of the problem , " said barrot .
" those who join the alliance commit to taking concrete measures .
we also want to incorporate famous personalities to directly address youths . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot says cooperation among the eu nations is essential in the fight against drugs improved cooperation between the individual eu nations is also at the foreground of the new eu action plan .
" that is our strength - being able to launch large prevention campaigns on a europe-wide level .
and we are going to do everything we can to get a europe-wide campaign off the ground , " said barrot .
drugs + car = bad combo his other goal is uniform drug legislation across europe .
barrot also reportedly wants bloc-wide rules against drug use on the road because young people are n't sufficiently aware of the dangerous relationship between drugs and driving .
from the eu commission 's perspective , close cooperation between police and customs authorities against drug smuggling is also necessary .
according to data from barrot , illegal substances are increasingly making it to europe via the seaway from west africa . anke hagedorn -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 19.09.2008 eu seeks explanation on widening china dairy scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of parents have crowded hospitals and demanded answers from government the european union and the us are seeking an explanation from china over the unfolding toxic milk powder scandal that has led to the deaths of four infants and illness in some 6,000 more . fears over the scandal were heightened last week when a chinese government quality watchdog revealed that 10 percent of samples from three major chinese dairies were contaminated with the potentially fatal chemical melamine .
at the latest count , 6,244 children have become ill , four have died and 158 are suffering " acute kidney failure . "
with foreign consumers warily eyeing china 's manufacturing reputation amid claims of delays and cover-ups , robert madelin , director-general for health and consumer protection at the european commission , told reporters in beijing he expected an account of what went wrong .
" we are trying to establish the facts .
we are discussing all aspects of this crisis bilaterally with our colleagues in china , " he said .
" i know from experience that these sorts of cases , where apparently illegal or fraudulent acts lead to problems in safety , are the most difficult for any of us to deal with , " added madelin .
madelin said the eu did not import chinese infant milk powder , and there had been no reports of infant sickness in the bloc from other chinese dairy products .
the scandal 's protagonists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : products of china 's mengniu dairy company have been pulled from starbucks shelves almost one-tenth of liquid milk batches from mengniu dairy and inner mongolia yili industrial group , a beijing olympic games sponsor , contained melamine , a chemical which is banned in food .
several samples of milk from the bright dairy group also had the substance , used in making plastics , china 's general administration of quality supervision , inspection and quarantine found .
chinese media have largely kept quiet about claims that the sanlu group , china 's biggest maker of infant milk powder , concealed the poisonings from the public and senior authorities during the beijing olympics in august .
starbucks pulls questionable milk coffee chain starbucks said its 300-plus cafes in mainland china had pulled milk supplies by mengniu as a precautionary step , but that no employees or customers had fallen ill from the milk .
in singapore , the government food watchdog advised retailers to pull yili yoghurt ice bars from their shelves .
china is vowing to punish errant businesses and officials and there have already been dismissals , detentions and arrests linked to sanlu , 43-percent of which is owned by new zealand diary giant fonterra .
new zealand prime minister helen clark said monday that chinese officials acted last week only after her government pressed beijing .
eu , us target product safety bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and us want to increase awareness of their safety regulations events surrounding the dairy scandal come as eu and us consumer protection officials pledged friday to step up efforts to ensure product safety in china .
the new product safety initiative aims to increase awareness among chinese manufacturers of consumer safety regulations in the us and europe .
the initiative , however , was directed at toys , clothes and electrical products and did not address the milk powder scandal in particular . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 journalist and author stefan aust 's book " der baader-meinhof komplex " has been used as the basis for a soon-to-be-released film of the same name .
he told deutsche welle about why the raf still interests people . both the book and the film chronicle the events of the late ' 60s and ' 70s surrounding the german terror group the red army faction .
aust spoke with dw-radio about the movement 's protagonists , the spirit of the time and the film .
deutsche welle : what do you think of the film , having written the book that the film 's based on ? stefan aust : actually , i think it 's a really great film .
it 's really close to the book , and the book was as close to reality as i could do it .
i think it 's the same spirit that 's in the book that inspired the filmmakers to do it .
it 's a fiction film , but has elements of a documentary as if you had been with this group , with the people , with the terrorists all the time during a whole decade . what are the fictional parts and what are the real parts ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan aust said raf leaders lost their sense of reality the whole thing is as close to reality as you could do in a feature film .
a lot of dialogue is more or less authentic , as i did the research .
some parts are exactly as they were in reality , so for instance we had parts in the courtroom in stammheim , when they were on trial there .
it was word for word .
everything that was said in the courtroom was recorded and written down and we used that for the script .
if you had dialogue , for instance , in prison - the fights between the two women , gudrun ensslin and ulrike meinhof - it was reconstructed out of letters that they sent to one another .
so it 's very close to reality . concerning the book and maybe your own personal research , what was it that got you interested in this topic ? well , i got to know some of the people who went underground , who were members of the red army faction , because i was working for a school magazine in a little town in northern germany together with the younger brother of the editor of the leftist , radical magazine konkret , klaus rainer roehl , who was the husband of ulrike meinhof .
so i knew them when i was still going to school . when i left school , i worked for three years for that magazine and that was the high-time of the students ' movement and radical developments , so i knew ulrike meinhof pretty well , i also knew the lawyer horst mahler pretty well ; he became a member of the red army faction .
when the whole thing started in 1970 i was working for public television in germany , and i had to do a lot of documentaries , short and long and magazine-type stories , about what happened .
so i knew everything quite well . in the beginning of the ' 80s i decided that i wanted to know everything .
so i quit my job , more or less , and spent about three years researching and writing the book . bildunterschrift : stefan aust said he knew the leadership of the raf , but was not friends with them you said you knew these people .
would you have considered yourselves as friends ? that would be a little too much .
i was a very young journalist at that time .
i started when i was just 20 or 21 and they were all a little bit older .
so i knew them , i was rather close to them , we were not friends , and i was always a little bit younger than they were and i was not as radical as they had been . what do you think drove them ?
what was the overarching goal that they were going for ? i think some of them really wanted to change the world .
they felt solidarity with the poor , and unemployed and exploited people of the world , so they fought imperialism .
that 's what they thought .
they fought against the police , they fought against the state and they forgot that they were n't putting bombs in " dead places " ... but on living human beings .
they became very cruel in their attempt to fight the cruelty of the world . do you think they lost sight at some point of the goal that they 'd started with ? they mainly lost their realistic view of reality .
suddenly , when they went underground , they thought and felt that they lived in a police state , a fascist police state .
and when you are living in a fascist police state you are allowed to do anything .
they had to change reality and their view on reality first in order to be able to do all these terrible things . even 30 years later there 's still a fascination with the raf and still this swirl of controversy because they began with such idealistic views .
what do you think makes the raf so intriguing for people even today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der baader-meinhof komplex film is as close to reality as possible , aust said i think it was the biggest crisis that post-war germany had had .
it was an attack on the state , on the government , on the authorities of the government and on the representatives of the government .
they killed important people .
it was really a threat to the stability of this country , and actually it was the only threat after the war that this country ever had from the inside . when you think about the german autumn in ' 77 , which was 31 years ago , it was really a state of crisis we were in .
in the collective memory of the germans it 's a little bit like september 11 for the united states . what do you think the majority opinion about the raf is right now ?
that they were terrorists or some kind of revolutionary heroes ? i think it 's both .
we tried in this film to show what they really were .
they were a group of people from a certain age , from a certain society , for a certain decade - the decade of revolution all over the world - and they felt themselves being revolutionary .
in the end it was a group of people killing other people and in the end killing themselves .
so i think most people see them more as terrorists than as revolutionary heroes , which sometimes happened in the ' 70s . is that the message that you want people watching the film to come away with ? yes , to take the group down to earth .
to make them human and to show what they really did .
because terrorism is terror , and people sometimes forget that . interview : eric heath -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 .
it comes at a time when the eu is eager to bolster ties with neighbours that share a border with a newly resurgent russia . last month 's georgia conflict saw russia invade the small caucasus nation and support the independence claims of two of its restive regions .
" belarus does not want dialogue with the west through the ' iron curtain ' it has built on its border , " lukashenko said in an interview with western journalists ahead of the parliamentary polls .
" we want dialogue in all areas . "
" we want you to accept us and to recognize our elections , " lukashenko said , according to excerpts of the interview provided by his office .
lukashenko , in power for 14 years , is accused by the united states and the european union of rigging elections , jailing opponents and closing down free media .
no election held in the former soviet republic since the mid-1990s has been deemed free or fair .
prisoner releases herald prospect of thaw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander kozulin was released from detention , along with other notable political prisoners last month , lukashenko released belarus ' highest-profile political prisoner , former presidential candidate alexander kozulin , and the remaining political prisoners being held there .
european foreign ministers on monday responded by holding out the prospect of aid and lifted sanctions in a bid to persuade lukashenko to hold democratic elections .
following the prisoner release , washington also said the move set the stage for a " significant " improvement in ties .
lukashenko said western monitoring of the upcoming elections would prove that belarus was a genuine democracy .
" we have opened the country for you .
come , look , observe , whether the pre-election campaign , the voting and the election itself are undertaken in line with our laws , " he said .
forty belarussian figures , including the president , have been banned from entering the eu since the 2006 presidential election which was judged not to comply with international norms .

in a letter to staff , munich-based bayern lb , which is controlled by bavaria state , put its risk at up to 300 million euros .
all three banks had placed funds with lehman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal bank kfw is under fire for mistakenly wiring millions to lehman before its collapse " like many other banks active worldwide , our company had a business relationship over many years with lehman brothers , " said the letter signed by bayern chief executive michael kemmer .
he said accountants were still comparing which sums were credits and which were debts to establish the net exposure , but the figure so far was " up to 300 million . "
nrw bank , controlled by the state of north-rhine westphalia , said it had lent money to lehman brothers , but declined to say how much .
" they were n't problem investments , " said a spokesman .
although no german banks have so far failed or been forced to merge , the known exposure of german taxpayers to the crisis was approaching $ 1.2 billion friday .
europe seeks tighter banking regulations global markets have been shaken by the financial earthquake on wall street though indexes in many countries rallied friday after a host of major central banks in america , europe and elsewehere made almost a quarter of a trillion dollars available to struggling banks .
the us federal reserve said it had authorized another $ 180 million lending program to help banks in need of emergency cash . the eu is now seeking to use the us economic meltdown , which it asserts was the result of a negligent attitude towards finance , as motivation to beef up its supervision of the financial sector in two key areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis on wall street has sparked some intense soul-searching " we need more coordinated action by supervisors than currently exists , " said eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia on thursday , sept 18 , in madrid .
" we must move forward faster .
we can not wait until a financial institution operating in seven or 10 countries of the european union has problems such as those of lehman brothers or bear sterns , " he continued the eu ’ s first goal is to tighten regulation of credit ratings agencies , which have come under fire for failing to alert investors about risks threatening borrowers ’ solvency .
the eu commission is also assembling plans to coordinate regulation of insurers and is set to announce a similar plan for the banking sector next month ..
while continental european countries took the initiative to hold talks about tougher oversight of financial speculation , especially hedge funds , before the us financial crisis , european regulators have failed to keep tabs on the frequent cross-border consolidation in the banking industry sector in recent years .
banks are thus largely supervised along national lines .
that would mean that major european banks such as deutsche bank , unicredit and bnparibas could potentially face various sets of regulations across europe in times of trouble - a burden feared by many officials . dpa news agency -lrb- ls / dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a substantial offer from the eu is on the table .
we are still in talks with iran to receive a concrete and , we hope , positive response to this offer .
this has until now still been lacking , " he said when asked about the calls for sanctions . germany is one of six world powers attempting to convince iran to halt sensitive nuclear work with an incentives package in exchange for full suspension of uranium enrichment . " should there be no progress on the negotiations track , the german government believes the un security council will become more relevant again and discussions will have to be held whether there should be new resolutions . " this is not the track we are seeking - we want progress from negotiations .
but unfortunately what we have seen until now has not made us optimistic . " ploetner said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had stressed the importance of settling the issue quickly during talks monday with his iranian counterpart manouchehr mottaki . officials from the six nations , which also includes russia , china and the uk , are scheduled to meet friday , sept .
19 , before the un general assembly convenes in new york .
foreign ministers are expected to convene over iran during the annual meeting . unity required to approve new sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains unlikely that the security council will unite behind the french sanctions resolution european union foreign policy chief javier solana said he believes russia and china are " quite worried " about iran 's nuclear program and that a report presented monday by the iaea nuclear watchdog " is n't good for iran . " but he added that he did n't think moscow and beijing would completely turn around and support the west 's call for more sanctions . washington and european capitals have accused tehran of enriching uranium in order to produce atomic weapons .
iran has insisted its nuclear program is intended solely to create electricity . " the main option here is a fourth un sanctions resolution , but that is a possibility that requires russian , chinese and european cooperation , " a senior us official , who asked not to be named as his comments were sensitive , told reuters news agency . state department spokesman sean mccormack said on thursday there was agreement to move forward with a new sanctions resolution , but it was unclear how far the six political directors would get in hammering out a detailed agreement . tough steps unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would not change course " this is probably a discussion which will be aimed at seeing where each of the individual states are in terms of the timeline of moving forward and the content of a new resolution , " mccormack told reporters . iran experts have said that even if the un security council members plus germany , who are responsible for negotiations with iran , agreed to a new resolution , it would be a weaker version than washington and others wanted . restrictions would likely be placed on iranian companies but not the oil industry or oil products . " my guess is that the sanctions will be watered down and there is every reason for the russians to drag this out , " gary samore of the council on foreign relations told reuters . ahead of friday 's meeting , iran 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , again said tehran would not stop its enrichment program regardless of whether the un decides to impose a new round of sanctions . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a substantial offer from the eu is on the table .
we are still in talks with iran to receive a concrete and , we hope , positive response to this offer .
this has until now still been lacking , " he said when asked about the calls for sanctions . germany is one of six world powers attempting to convince iran to halt sensitive nuclear work with an incentives package in exchange for full suspension of uranium enrichment .

iran has insisted its nuclear program is intended solely to create electricity .

25 , 2009 jewish-owned art seized by the nazis from 1933 onwards is featured at a new exhibition at the jewish museum in berlin .
meanwhile , germany 's culture minister has called for the " fair " return of jewish art . opening on friday , sept .
19 , the exhibition consists of 15 artworks along with documents describing their seizure or forced sale , later changes in ownership and ultimate restitution .
valuable porcelain and book collections from dresden 's intellectual von klemperer family are included in the show .
the gestapo confiscated the family 's collection in 1938 , placing it in dresden 's municipal art collection and the saxony state library . before the second world war , nazi germany made it illegal for jews to own art treasures , forcing them to sell them .
later during the holocaust , jewish property throughout eastern europe was seized by nazi officials .
exhibition organizers said thursday that many of the confiscated paintings and other treasures had still not been recovered by the lawful heirs of the original owners .
taking responsibility for stolen art michael blumenthal , director of the museum , charged that german art collectors , dealers and museums had all profited by being able to purchase art at reduced prices .
he praised germany 's current efforts to give back the art , but said he was disappointed that heirs had no absolute legal right to reclaim the artworks .
at a ceremony on thursday evening , minister of culture bernd neumann called for " fair and just " solutions in returning the work stolen by nazi officials .
" more than 60 years after the war 's end , germany is unrestrained in its moral responsibility for the restitution of art looted by the nazis , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 19.09.2008 journalist stefan aust : baader-meinhof film reflects raf reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der baader-meinhof komplex opens across germany on sept .
25 journalist and author stefan aust 's book " der baader-meinhof komplex " has been used as the basis for a soon-to-be-released film of the same name .
he told deutsche welle about why the raf still interests people . both the book and the film chronicle the events of the late ' 60s and ' 70s surrounding the german terror group the red army faction .
aust spoke with dw-radio about the movement 's protagonists , the spirit of the time and the film .
deutsche welle : what do you think of the film , having written the book that the film 's based on ? stefan aust : actually , i think it 's a really great film .
it 's really close to the book , and the book was as close to reality as i could do it .
i think it 's the same spirit that 's in the book that inspired the filmmakers to do it .
it 's a fiction film , but has elements of a documentary as if you had been with this group , with the people , with the terrorists all the time during a whole decade . what are the fictional parts and what are the real parts ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan aust said raf leaders lost their sense of reality the whole thing is as close to reality as you could do in a feature film .
a lot of dialogue is more or less authentic , as i did the research .
some parts are exactly as they were in reality , so for instance we had parts in the courtroom in stammheim , when they were on trial there .
it was word for word .
everything that was said in the courtroom was recorded and written down and we used that for the script .
if you had dialogue , for instance , in prison - the fights between the two women , gudrun ensslin and ulrike meinhof - it was reconstructed out of letters that they sent to one another .
so it 's very close to reality . concerning the book and maybe your own personal research , what was it that got you interested in this topic ? well , i got to know some of the people who went underground , who were members of the red army faction , because i was working for a school magazine in a little town in northern germany together with the younger brother of the editor of the leftist , radical magazine konkret , klaus rainer roehl , who was the husband of ulrike meinhof .
so i knew them when i was still going to school . when i left school , i worked for three years for that magazine and that was the high-time of the students ' movement and radical developments , so i knew ulrike meinhof pretty well , i also knew the lawyer horst mahler pretty well ; he became a member of the red army faction .
when the whole thing started in 1970 i was working for public television in germany , and i had to do a lot of documentaries , short and long and magazine-type stories , about what happened .
so i knew everything quite well . in the beginning of the ' 80s i decided that i wanted to know everything .
so i quit my job , more or less , and spent about three years researching and writing the book . bildunterschrift : stefan aust said he knew the leadership of the raf , but was not friends with them you said you knew these people .
would you have considered yourselves as friends ? that would be a little too much .
i was a very young journalist at that time .
i started when i was just 20 or 21 and they were all a little bit older .
so i knew them , i was rather close to them , we were not friends , and i was always a little bit younger than they were and i was not as radical as they had been . what do you think drove them ?
what was the overarching goal that they were going for ? i think some of them really wanted to change the world .
they felt solidarity with the poor , and unemployed and exploited people of the world , so they fought imperialism .
that 's what they thought .
they fought against the police , they fought against the state and they forgot that they were n't putting bombs in " dead places " ... but on living human beings .
they became very cruel in their attempt to fight the cruelty of the world . do you think they lost sight at some point of the goal that they 'd started with ? they mainly lost their realistic view of reality .
suddenly , when they went underground , they thought and felt that they lived in a police state , a fascist police state .
and when you are living in a fascist police state you are allowed to do anything .
they had to change reality and their view on reality first in order to be able to do all these terrible things . even 30 years later there 's still a fascination with the raf and still this swirl of controversy because they began with such idealistic views .
what do you think makes the raf so intriguing for people even today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der baader-meinhof komplex film is as close to reality as possible , aust said i think it was the biggest crisis that post-war germany had had .
it was an attack on the state , on the government , on the authorities of the government and on the representatives of the government .
they killed important people .
it was really a threat to the stability of this country , and actually it was the only threat after the war that this country ever had from the inside . when you think about the german autumn in ' 77 , which was 31 years ago , it was really a state of crisis we were in .
in the collective memory of the germans it 's a little bit like september 11 for the united states . what do you think the majority opinion about the raf is right now ?
that they were terrorists or some kind of revolutionary heroes ? i think it 's both .
we tried in this film to show what they really were .
they were a group of people from a certain age , from a certain society , for a certain decade - the decade of revolution all over the world - and they felt themselves being revolutionary .
in the end it was a group of people killing other people and in the end killing themselves .
so i think most people see them more as terrorists than as revolutionary heroes , which sometimes happened in the ' 70s . is that the message that you want people watching the film to come away with ? yes , to take the group down to earth .
to make them human and to show what they really did .
because terrorism is terror , and people sometimes forget that . interview : eric heath -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 journalist and author stefan aust 's book " der baader-meinhof komplex " has been used as the basis for a soon-to-be-released film of the same name .
he told deutsche welle about why the raf still interests people . both the book and the film chronicle the events of the late ' 60s and ' 70s surrounding the german terror group the red army faction .
aust spoke with dw-radio about the movement 's protagonists , the spirit of the time and the film .
deutsche welle : what do you think of the film , having written the book that the film 's based on ? stefan aust : actually , i think it 's a really great film .
it 's really close to the book , and the book was as close to reality as i could do it .
i think it 's the same spirit that 's in the book that inspired the filmmakers to do it .
it 's a fiction film , but has elements of a documentary as if you had been with this group , with the people , with the terrorists all the time during a whole decade . what are the fictional parts and what are the real parts ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan aust said raf leaders lost their sense of reality the whole thing is as close to reality as you could do in a feature film .
a lot of dialogue is more or less authentic , as i did the research .
some parts are exactly as they were in reality , so for instance we had parts in the courtroom in stammheim , when they were on trial there .
it was word for word .
everything that was said in the courtroom was recorded and written down and we used that for the script .
if you had dialogue , for instance , in prison - the fights between the two women , gudrun ensslin and ulrike meinhof - it was reconstructed out of letters that they sent to one another .
so it 's very close to reality . concerning the book and maybe your own personal research , what was it that got you interested in this topic ? well , i got to know some of the people who went underground , who were members of the red army faction , because i was working for a school magazine in a little town in northern germany together with the younger brother of the editor of the leftist , radical magazine konkret , klaus rainer roehl , who was the husband of ulrike meinhof .
so i knew them when i was still going to school . when i left school , i worked for three years for that magazine and that was the high-time of the students ' movement and radical developments , so i knew ulrike meinhof pretty well , i also knew the lawyer horst mahler pretty well ; he became a member of the red army faction .
when the whole thing started in 1970 i was working for public television in germany , and i had to do a lot of documentaries , short and long and magazine-type stories , about what happened .
so i knew everything quite well . in the beginning of the ' 80s i decided that i wanted to know everything .
so i quit my job , more or less , and spent about three years researching and writing the book . bildunterschrift : stefan aust said he knew the leadership of the raf , but was not friends with them you said you knew these people .
would you have considered yourselves as friends ? that would be a little too much .
i was a very young journalist at that time .
i started when i was just 20 or 21 and they were all a little bit older .
so i knew them , i was rather close to them , we were not friends , and i was always a little bit younger than they were and i was not as radical as they had been . what do you think drove them ?
what was the overarching goal that they were going for ? i think some of them really wanted to change the world .
they felt solidarity with the poor , and unemployed and exploited people of the world , so they fought imperialism .
that 's what they thought .
they fought against the police , they fought against the state and they forgot that they were n't putting bombs in " dead places " ... but on living human beings .
they became very cruel in their attempt to fight the cruelty of the world . do you think they lost sight at some point of the goal that they 'd started with ? they mainly lost their realistic view of reality .
suddenly , when they went underground , they thought and felt that they lived in a police state , a fascist police state .
and when you are living in a fascist police state you are allowed to do anything .
they had to change reality and their view on reality first in order to be able to do all these terrible things . even 30 years later there 's still a fascination with the raf and still this swirl of controversy because they began with such idealistic views .
what do you think makes the raf so intriguing for people even today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der baader-meinhof komplex film is as close to reality as possible , aust said i think it was the biggest crisis that post-war germany had had .
it was an attack on the state , on the government , on the authorities of the government and on the representatives of the government .
they killed important people .
it was really a threat to the stability of this country , and actually it was the only threat after the war that this country ever had from the inside . when you think about the german autumn in ' 77 , which was 31 years ago , it was really a state of crisis we were in .
in the collective memory of the germans it 's a little bit like september 11 for the united states . what do you think the majority opinion about the raf is right now ?
that they were terrorists or some kind of revolutionary heroes ? i think it 's both .
we tried in this film to show what they really were .
they were a group of people from a certain age , from a certain society , for a certain decade - the decade of revolution all over the world - and they felt themselves being revolutionary .
in the end it was a group of people killing other people and in the end killing themselves .
so i think most people see them more as terrorists than as revolutionary heroes , which sometimes happened in the ' 70s . is that the message that you want people watching the film to come away with ? yes , to take the group down to earth .

but dw-world 's karl zawdzky asks whether it 's enough . british mortgage bank hbos fled into the arms of lloyds tsb ; morgan stanley is casting about for a savior , as is the largest american savings and loan bank , washington mutual .
whereas banks such lehman brothers are being sacrificed to the turmoil on the markets , other institutions like the international insurer american international group -lrb- aig -rrb- are being rescued .
and that begs the question : who will be the next to go down ? the best advice is , save yourself if you can .
because without a doubt , this is the biggest crisis since the crash of 1929 , which plunged the world into a depression , saw countless firms file for bankruptcy , brought massive unemployment and put wind in the sails of those who sought political gain . the financial markets are out of control .
only the mistakes and excesses of the boom are being corrected .
for too long , people thought that the only way would ever be up , that wealth without work was possible . many speculators even managed to accrue wealth in this way .
the bubble has long since been recognized but the realization that every bubble - whether on the financial market , the property market or the raw commodities market - has to burst sometime .
that 's exactly what 's happening now .
the time in which greed superseded reason is over - for now .
security is what 's needed ; the price of gold is jumping like never before . governments keeping their cool in contrast to the players on the financial markets , governments and central banks are keeping a level head .
banks and insurers , whose demise would not just shake up global financial systems but could bring them down like dominos , are being saved . aig , one of the world 's largest insurers with more than 100 million customers in 130 countries is being rescued by state intervention .
the reason : too many americans would have lost their retirement savings had the company collapsed .
aside from this , aig is a big credit insurer for banks around the world .
its demise could have triggered a core meltdown in the global financial system .
in comparison , the collapse of lehman brothers , the third-largest american investment bank , was painful , but survivable . what this means , though , is that while the financial markets are shaky and the stock exchanges are up and down , governments and central banks have n't let themselves become infected with the general sense of insecurity , rather , they 've acted decisively . the financial markets are literally being flooded with dollars , euros , yen , pounds and rubles to keep the systems running .
us treasury secretary henry paulson and federal reserve chairman ben bernanke are working on a solution which would involve creating a government-sponsored vehicle to relieve american financial companies of their toxic investments . greater regulation needed so the state emerges as the savior .
initial news of the bailout led to a swift recovery .
first , profits were privatized and now , losses are being socialized .
with the banks saved , the whole game can start over again .
that is , unless the government makes stricter regulations for the financial sector part of its rescue program . the sector is always willing to be bailed out , but most unwilling to have regulations imposed on its business dealings .
but without stricter monitoring and regulation , such a bailout will only plant the seeds for the next bubble on the financial markets to grow . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 , 2009 jewish-owned art seized by the nazis from 1933 onwards is featured at a new exhibition at the jewish museum in berlin .
meanwhile , germany 's culture minister has called for the " fair " return of jewish art . opening on friday , sept .
19 , the exhibition consists of 15 artworks along with documents describing their seizure or forced sale , later changes in ownership and ultimate restitution .
valuable porcelain and book collections from dresden 's intellectual von klemperer family are included in the show .
the gestapo confiscated the family 's collection in 1938 , placing it in dresden 's municipal art collection and the saxony state library . before the second world war , nazi germany made it illegal for jews to own art treasures , forcing them to sell them .
later during the holocaust , jewish property throughout eastern europe was seized by nazi officials .
exhibition organizers said thursday that many of the confiscated paintings and other treasures had still not been recovered by the lawful heirs of the original owners .
taking responsibility for stolen art michael blumenthal , director of the museum , charged that german art collectors , dealers and museums had all profited by being able to purchase art at reduced prices .
he praised germany 's current efforts to give back the art , but said he was disappointed that heirs had no absolute legal right to reclaim the artworks .
at a ceremony on thursday evening , minister of culture bernd neumann called for " fair and just " solutions in returning the work stolen by nazi officials .
" more than 60 years after the war 's end , germany is unrestrained in its moral responsibility for the restitution of art looted by the nazis , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 , 2009 jewish-owned art seized by the nazis from 1933 onwards is featured at a new exhibition at the jewish museum in berlin .
meanwhile , germany 's culture minister has called for the " fair " return of jewish art . opening on friday , sept .
19 , the exhibition consists of 15 artworks along with documents describing their seizure or forced sale , later changes in ownership and ultimate restitution .
valuable porcelain and book collections from dresden 's intellectual von klemperer family are included in the show .
the gestapo confiscated the family 's collection in 1938 , placing it in dresden 's municipal art collection and the saxony state library . before the second world war , nazi germany made it illegal for jews to own art treasures , forcing them to sell them .
later during the holocaust , jewish property throughout eastern europe was seized by nazi officials .
exhibition organizers said thursday that many of the confiscated paintings and other treasures had still not been recovered by the lawful heirs of the original owners .
taking responsibility for stolen art michael blumenthal , director of the museum , charged that german art collectors , dealers and museums had all profited by being able to purchase art at reduced prices .
he praised germany 's current efforts to give back the art , but said he was disappointed that heirs had no absolute legal right to reclaim the artworks .
at a ceremony on thursday evening , minister of culture bernd neumann called for " fair and just " solutions in returning the work stolen by nazi officials .
" more than 60 years after the war 's end , germany is unrestrained in its moral responsibility for the restitution of art looted by the nazis , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw-world 's karl zawdzky asks whether it 's enough . british mortgage bank hbos fled into the arms of lloyds tsb ; morgan stanley is casting about for a savior , as is the largest american savings and loan bank , washington mutual .
whereas banks such lehman brothers are being sacrificed to the turmoil on the markets , other institutions like the international insurer american international group -lrb- aig -rrb- are being rescued .
and that begs the question : who will be the next to go down ? the best advice is , save yourself if you can .
because without a doubt , this is the biggest crisis since the crash of 1929 , which plunged the world into a depression , saw countless firms file for bankruptcy , brought massive unemployment and put wind in the sails of those who sought political gain . the financial markets are out of control .
only the mistakes and excesses of the boom are being corrected .
for too long , people thought that the only way would ever be up , that wealth without work was possible . many speculators even managed to accrue wealth in this way .
the bubble has long since been recognized but the realization that every bubble - whether on the financial market , the property market or the raw commodities market - has to burst sometime .
that 's exactly what 's happening now .
the time in which greed superseded reason is over - for now .
security is what 's needed ; the price of gold is jumping like never before . governments keeping their cool in contrast to the players on the financial markets , governments and central banks are keeping a level head .
banks and insurers , whose demise would not just shake up global financial systems but could bring them down like dominos , are being saved . aig , one of the world 's largest insurers with more than 100 million customers in 130 countries is being rescued by state intervention .
the reason : too many americans would have lost their retirement savings had the company collapsed .
aside from this , aig is a big credit insurer for banks around the world .
its demise could have triggered a core meltdown in the global financial system .
in comparison , the collapse of lehman brothers , the third-largest american investment bank , was painful , but survivable . what this means , though , is that while the financial markets are shaky and the stock exchanges are up and down , governments and central banks have n't let themselves become infected with the general sense of insecurity , rather , they 've acted decisively . the financial markets are literally being flooded with dollars , euros , yen , pounds and rubles to keep the systems running .
us treasury secretary henry paulson and federal reserve chairman ben bernanke are working on a solution which would involve creating a government-sponsored vehicle to relieve american financial companies of their toxic investments . greater regulation needed so the state emerges as the savior .
initial news of the bailout led to a swift recovery .
first , profits were privatized and now , losses are being socialized .
with the banks saved , the whole game can start over again .
that is , unless the government makes stricter regulations for the financial sector part of its rescue program . the sector is always willing to be bailed out , but most unwilling to have regulations imposed on its business dealings .
but without stricter monitoring and regulation , such a bailout will only plant the seeds for the next bubble on the financial markets to grow . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw-world 's karl zawdzky asks whether it 's enough . british mortgage bank hbos fled into the arms of lloyds tsb ; morgan stanley is casting about for a savior , as is the largest american savings and loan bank , washington mutual .
whereas banks such lehman brothers are being sacrificed to the turmoil on the markets , other institutions like the international insurer american international group -lrb- aig -rrb- are being rescued .
and that begs the question : who will be the next to go down ? the best advice is , save yourself if you can .
because without a doubt , this is the biggest crisis since the crash of 1929 , which plunged the world into a depression , saw countless firms file for bankruptcy , brought massive unemployment and put wind in the sails of those who sought political gain . the financial markets are out of control .
only the mistakes and excesses of the boom are being corrected .

banks and insurers , whose demise would not just shake up global financial systems but could bring them down like dominos , are being saved . aig , one of the world 's largest insurers with more than 100 million customers in 130 countries is being rescued by state intervention .
the reason : too many americans would have lost their retirement savings had the company collapsed .
aside from this , aig is a big credit insurer for banks around the world .
its demise could have triggered a core meltdown in the global financial system .
in comparison , the collapse of lehman brothers , the third-largest american investment bank , was painful , but survivable . what this means , though , is that while the financial markets are shaky and the stock exchanges are up and down , governments and central banks have n't let themselves become infected with the general sense of insecurity , rather , they 've acted decisively . the financial markets are literally being flooded with dollars , euros , yen , pounds and rubles to keep the systems running .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 19.09.2008 opinion : can a government lifeline alone end the crisis ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governments around the world are stepping up their efforts to rescue financial markets from collapse in the wake of recent market turmoil .
but dw-world 's karl zawdzky asks whether it 's enough . british mortgage bank hbos fled into the arms of lloyds tsb ; morgan stanley is casting about for a savior , as is the largest american savings and loan bank , washington mutual .
whereas banks such lehman brothers are being sacrificed to the turmoil on the markets , other institutions like the international insurer american international group -lrb- aig -rrb- are being rescued .
and that begs the question : who will be the next to go down ? the best advice is , save yourself if you can .
because without a doubt , this is the biggest crisis since the crash of 1929 , which plunged the world into a depression , saw countless firms file for bankruptcy , brought massive unemployment and put wind in the sails of those who sought political gain . the financial markets are out of control .
only the mistakes and excesses of the boom are being corrected .
for too long , people thought that the only way would ever be up , that wealth without work was possible . many speculators even managed to accrue wealth in this way .
the bubble has long since been recognized but the realization that every bubble - whether on the financial market , the property market or the raw commodities market - has to burst sometime .
that 's exactly what 's happening now .
the time in which greed superseded reason is over - for now .
security is what 's needed ; the price of gold is jumping like never before . governments keeping their cool in contrast to the players on the financial markets , governments and central banks are keeping a level head .
banks and insurers , whose demise would not just shake up global financial systems but could bring them down like dominos , are being saved . aig , one of the world 's largest insurers with more than 100 million customers in 130 countries is being rescued by state intervention .
the reason : too many americans would have lost their retirement savings had the company collapsed .
aside from this , aig is a big credit insurer for banks around the world .
its demise could have triggered a core meltdown in the global financial system .
in comparison , the collapse of lehman brothers , the third-largest american investment bank , was painful , but survivable . what this means , though , is that while the financial markets are shaky and the stock exchanges are up and down , governments and central banks have n't let themselves become infected with the general sense of insecurity , rather , they 've acted decisively . the financial markets are literally being flooded with dollars , euros , yen , pounds and rubles to keep the systems running .
us treasury secretary henry paulson and federal reserve chairman ben bernanke are working on a solution which would involve creating a government-sponsored vehicle to relieve american financial companies of their toxic investments . greater regulation needed so the state emerges as the savior .
initial news of the bailout led to a swift recovery .
first , profits were privatized and now , losses are being socialized .
with the banks saved , the whole game can start over again .
that is , unless the government makes stricter regulations for the financial sector part of its rescue program . the sector is always willing to be bailed out , but most unwilling to have regulations imposed on its business dealings .
but without stricter monitoring and regulation , such a bailout will only plant the seeds for the next bubble on the financial markets to grow . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german bank slammed for mistakenly wiring lehman millions berlin demanded an inquiry wednesday into why a german government bank transferred 300 million euros -lrb- $ 427 million -rrb- to lehman brothers just hours before the us bank collapsed amid continuing turmoil on wall street .
-lrb- 17.09.2008 -rrb- europe 's banks at risk as us bails out insurance giant aig the us central bank agreed to bail out the insurance giant american international group with $ 85 billion in an unprecedented move aimed at propping up the influential company .

no election held in the former soviet republic since the mid-1990s has been deemed free or fair .
prisoner releases herald prospect of thaw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander kozulin was released from detention , along with other notable political prisoners last month , lukashenko released belarus ' highest-profile political prisoner , former presidential candidate alexander kozulin , and the remaining political prisoners being held there .
european foreign ministers on monday responded by holding out the prospect of aid and lifted sanctions in a bid to persuade lukashenko to hold democratic elections .
following the prisoner release , washington also said the move set the stage for a " significant " improvement in ties .
lukashenko said western monitoring of the upcoming elections would prove that belarus was a genuine democracy .
" we have opened the country for you .
come , look , observe , whether the pre-election campaign , the voting and the election itself are undertaken in line with our laws , " he said .
forty belarussian figures , including the president , have been banned from entering the eu since the 2006 presidential election which was judged not to comply with international norms .
last week , a major belarus opposition party leader warned that western countries would turn a blind eye to fraud in next month 's legislative election and recognise a win for the outgoing authoritarian regime . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the latest count , 6,244 children have become ill , four have died and 158 are suffering " acute kidney failure . "
with foreign consumers warily eyeing china 's manufacturing reputation amid claims of delays and cover-ups , robert madelin , director-general for health and consumer protection at the european commission , told reporters in beijing he expected an account of what went wrong .
" we are trying to establish the facts .
we are discussing all aspects of this crisis bilaterally with our colleagues in china , " he said .
" i know from experience that these sorts of cases , where apparently illegal or fraudulent acts lead to problems in safety , are the most difficult for any of us to deal with , " added madelin .
madelin said the eu did not import chinese infant milk powder , and there had been no reports of infant sickness in the bloc from other chinese dairy products .
the scandal 's protagonists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : products of china 's mengniu dairy company have been pulled from starbucks shelves almost one-tenth of liquid milk batches from mengniu dairy and inner mongolia yili industrial group , a beijing olympic games sponsor , contained melamine , a chemical which is banned in food .
several samples of milk from the bright dairy group also had the substance , used in making plastics , china 's general administration of quality supervision , inspection and quarantine found .

the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm , announced its new plan on thursday , sept .

at the center of the new action plan is the development of care and counseling options for drug users , as well as an increase in police and customs controls to combat drug smuggling .

that british soul singer amy winehouse just managed to celebrate a quarter of a century is impressive .
with her excessive drug and alcohol use , it seems winehouse has an appetite for self-destruction .
the main substance responsible for her downward spiral : cocaine .
winehouse is a particularly extreme poster girl for the danger that seems to be lurking just around the corner for european youths .
although the consumption of heroin as well as synthetic drugs has stagnated or even decreased slightly in some countries , according to the newest statistics from the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction , cocaine has n't become the number one most fashionable drug in just musician and manager circles .
" we have ascertained a worldwide increase in cocaine consumption that is very worrying , " said european commission vice-president jacques barrot .
allies in the war on drugs the uk , france and spain are seeing this increase particularly in youths between the ages of 15 and 16 .
and to counteract negative role models like whinehouse , the commission also wants to get celebrities to support its campaign against drugs .
" today i want to call for a european alliance in the struggle against drugs .
the goal is to sensitize the population , particularly the youth , but also to make businesses and local public authorities aware of the problem , " said barrot .
" those who join the alliance commit to taking concrete measures .
we also want to incorporate famous personalities to directly address youths . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot says cooperation among the eu nations is essential in the fight against drugs improved cooperation between the individual eu nations is also at the foreground of the new eu action plan .
" that is our strength - being able to launch large prevention campaigns on a europe-wide level .
and we are going to do everything we can to get a europe-wide campaign off the ground , " said barrot .
drugs + car = bad combo his other goal is uniform drug legislation across europe .
barrot also reportedly wants bloc-wide rules against drug use on the road because young people are n't sufficiently aware of the dangerous relationship between drugs and driving .
from the eu commission 's perspective , close cooperation between police and customs authorities against drug smuggling is also necessary .

the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm , announced its new plan on thursday , sept .
18 , from brussels .
at the center of the new action plan is the development of care and counseling options for drug users , as well as an increase in police and customs controls to combat drug smuggling .
poster girl for substance abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amy winehouse 's drug difficulties are frequent tabloid fodder most people expect to celebrate their 25th birthday , but for others , reaching this age is almost a miracle .
that british soul singer amy winehouse just managed to celebrate a quarter of a century is impressive .
with her excessive drug and alcohol use , it seems winehouse has an appetite for self-destruction .
the main substance responsible for her downward spiral : cocaine .
winehouse is a particularly extreme poster girl for the danger that seems to be lurking just around the corner for european youths .
although the consumption of heroin as well as synthetic drugs has stagnated or even decreased slightly in some countries , according to the newest statistics from the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction , cocaine has n't become the number one most fashionable drug in just musician and manager circles .
" we have ascertained a worldwide increase in cocaine consumption that is very worrying , " said european commission vice-president jacques barrot .
allies in the war on drugs the uk , france and spain are seeing this increase particularly in youths between the ages of 15 and 16 .
and to counteract negative role models like whinehouse , the commission also wants to get celebrities to support its campaign against drugs .
" today i want to call for a european alliance in the struggle against drugs .
the goal is to sensitize the population , particularly the youth , but also to make businesses and local public authorities aware of the problem , " said barrot .
" those who join the alliance commit to taking concrete measures .
we also want to incorporate famous personalities to directly address youths . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot says cooperation among the eu nations is essential in the fight against drugs improved cooperation between the individual eu nations is also at the foreground of the new eu action plan .
" that is our strength - being able to launch large prevention campaigns on a europe-wide level .
and we are going to do everything we can to get a europe-wide campaign off the ground , " said barrot .
drugs + car = bad combo his other goal is uniform drug legislation across europe .
barrot also reportedly wants bloc-wide rules against drug use on the road because young people are n't sufficiently aware of the dangerous relationship between drugs and driving .

counter-demonstrators carried signs with slogans including " stop the nazi congress - stop pro koeln " and a few scuffled with the right-wing organisers .
one leftist protester was briefly detained by police , a spokesman said .
some 3,000 police officers from north rhine-westphalia and neighboring states are being deployed in cologne this weekend in the hope that they 'll be able to maintain peace and security . the organizers from pro koeln - a self-described " civil movement " which has , however , been represented on the municipal council for four years now - are among the most vocal opponents to a project to build a new mosque in cologne . the group used the recent green-lighting of the construction plans to rally together other far-right groups in europe who share its view that german and europe are increasingly becoming " islamicized .

dw-world.de sums up press reactions to her win . the luxemburger wort commented friday , sept .
19 , that livni was right to say that she would approach the job of prime minister with " great reverence . "
" further reconciliation with the palestinians , treatment of iran 's increasing nuclear power , and normalization of relations with syria are the three largest geo-strategic challenges facing israel , " the paper said .
" the long-term vitality of this high-tech nation sandwiched between the golan heights and the red sea depends on the clever handling of these dossiers . " the conservative swedish daily svenska dagbladet predicted that these issues will very soon be causing tzipi livni severe headaches should she be sworn in as prime minister .
" current prime minister ehud olmert 's plans for a one-sided withdrawal from the occupied territories were abandoned when hezbollah provoked the second war in lebanon , " the paper said .
" instead of a withdrawal , there was the hamas coup in gaza , which is now blocking progress in the west bank .
and it probably wo n't be long before the terrorists working for the hamas regime put livni 's skills to the hardest of tests . " london 's the independent commented friday on the first task awaiting livni - that of forming a government in just 42 days .
the task will be difficult , the paper said , because it will involve her winning some support from one of the small extremist parties which hold the balance of power in israeli politics .
" in the past , ms livni has hinted that she is not prepared to make random concessions to every interest group ; indeed , she wants to break with the wheeler-dealing tradition of israeli politics and restore public trust in the political process , " the paper wrote .
" she now has to strike a delicate balance between doing that and ensuring she can form an administration which will last long enough to present some serious progress on peace to the israeli electorate at the next election in 18 months time .
that is not long .
israel 's controversial security wall may have stopped the suicide bombs for the time being , but she must not be lulled into thinking she has the luxury of time . " israel 's english-language newspaper , haaretz , commented that all eyes will be on livni as she tries to form a government .
" being clean means more than not accepting envelopes filled with money , " the paper wrote .
" political cleanliness also requires making decisions that are statesmanlike and not opportunistic .
livni has to prove that , in contrast to her predecessor , she chooses the persons best suited to the job to be her cabinet ministers and not those who claim to represent the ' grassroots , ' those who threaten the unity of the ranks and those who threaten to call for new elections . " the berliner zeitung commented on the rise of " frauenpower " - the power of women - in israel , writing : " if livni were the lead singer of a band , it might be called ' tzipi and the expectations . '
western countries are among those who see huge promise in her .
in europe in particular , she 's being treated like a new beacon of light in the middle east peace process . "
despite the difficulties facing livni , the paper said that with her victory , the chance is now greater that those who want a fair peace deal will have greater say . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

'

25 , 2009 jewish-owned art seized by the nazis from 1933 onwards is featured at a new exhibition at the jewish museum in berlin .
meanwhile , germany 's culture minister has called for the " fair " return of jewish art . opening on friday , sept .
19 , the exhibition consists of 15 artworks along with documents describing their seizure or forced sale , later changes in ownership and ultimate restitution .
valuable porcelain and book collections from dresden 's intellectual von klemperer family are included in the show .
the gestapo confiscated the family 's collection in 1938 , placing it in dresden 's municipal art collection and the saxony state library . before the second world war , nazi germany made it illegal for jews to own art treasures , forcing them to sell them .
later during the holocaust , jewish property throughout eastern europe was seized by nazi officials .
exhibition organizers said thursday that many of the confiscated paintings and other treasures had still not been recovered by the lawful heirs of the original owners .
taking responsibility for stolen art michael blumenthal , director of the museum , charged that german art collectors , dealers and museums had all profited by being able to purchase art at reduced prices .
he praised germany 's current efforts to give back the art , but said he was disappointed that heirs had no absolute legal right to reclaim the artworks .
at a ceremony on thursday evening , minister of culture bernd neumann called for " fair and just " solutions in returning the work stolen by nazi officials .
" more than 60 years after the war 's end , germany is unrestrained in its moral responsibility for the restitution of art looted by the nazis , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 journalist and author stefan aust 's book " der baader-meinhof komplex " has been used as the basis for a soon-to-be-released film of the same name .
he told deutsche welle about why the raf still interests people . both the book and the film chronicle the events of the late ' 60s and ' 70s surrounding the german terror group the red army faction .
aust spoke with dw-radio about the movement 's protagonists , the spirit of the time and the film .
deutsche welle : what do you think of the film , having written the book that the film 's based on ? stefan aust : actually , i think it 's a really great film .
it 's really close to the book , and the book was as close to reality as i could do it .
i think it 's the same spirit that 's in the book that inspired the filmmakers to do it .
it 's a fiction film , but has elements of a documentary as if you had been with this group , with the people , with the terrorists all the time during a whole decade . what are the fictional parts and what are the real parts ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan aust said raf leaders lost their sense of reality the whole thing is as close to reality as you could do in a feature film .
a lot of dialogue is more or less authentic , as i did the research .
some parts are exactly as they were in reality , so for instance we had parts in the courtroom in stammheim , when they were on trial there .
it was word for word .
everything that was said in the courtroom was recorded and written down and we used that for the script .
if you had dialogue , for instance , in prison - the fights between the two women , gudrun ensslin and ulrike meinhof - it was reconstructed out of letters that they sent to one another .
so it 's very close to reality . concerning the book and maybe your own personal research , what was it that got you interested in this topic ? well , i got to know some of the people who went underground , who were members of the red army faction , because i was working for a school magazine in a little town in northern germany together with the younger brother of the editor of the leftist , radical magazine konkret , klaus rainer roehl , who was the husband of ulrike meinhof .
so i knew them when i was still going to school . when i left school , i worked for three years for that magazine and that was the high-time of the students ' movement and radical developments , so i knew ulrike meinhof pretty well , i also knew the lawyer horst mahler pretty well ; he became a member of the red army faction .
when the whole thing started in 1970 i was working for public television in germany , and i had to do a lot of documentaries , short and long and magazine-type stories , about what happened .
so i knew everything quite well . in the beginning of the ' 80s i decided that i wanted to know everything .
so i quit my job , more or less , and spent about three years researching and writing the book . bildunterschrift : stefan aust said he knew the leadership of the raf , but was not friends with them you said you knew these people .
would you have considered yourselves as friends ? that would be a little too much .
i was a very young journalist at that time .
i started when i was just 20 or 21 and they were all a little bit older .
so i knew them , i was rather close to them , we were not friends , and i was always a little bit younger than they were and i was not as radical as they had been . what do you think drove them ?
what was the overarching goal that they were going for ? i think some of them really wanted to change the world .
they felt solidarity with the poor , and unemployed and exploited people of the world , so they fought imperialism .
that 's what they thought .
they fought against the police , they fought against the state and they forgot that they were n't putting bombs in " dead places " ... but on living human beings .
they became very cruel in their attempt to fight the cruelty of the world . do you think they lost sight at some point of the goal that they 'd started with ? they mainly lost their realistic view of reality .
suddenly , when they went underground , they thought and felt that they lived in a police state , a fascist police state .
and when you are living in a fascist police state you are allowed to do anything .
they had to change reality and their view on reality first in order to be able to do all these terrible things . even 30 years later there 's still a fascination with the raf and still this swirl of controversy because they began with such idealistic views .
what do you think makes the raf so intriguing for people even today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der baader-meinhof komplex film is as close to reality as possible , aust said i think it was the biggest crisis that post-war germany had had .
it was an attack on the state , on the government , on the authorities of the government and on the representatives of the government .
they killed important people .
it was really a threat to the stability of this country , and actually it was the only threat after the war that this country ever had from the inside . when you think about the german autumn in ' 77 , which was 31 years ago , it was really a state of crisis we were in .
in the collective memory of the germans it 's a little bit like september 11 for the united states . what do you think the majority opinion about the raf is right now ?
that they were terrorists or some kind of revolutionary heroes ? i think it 's both .
we tried in this film to show what they really were .
they were a group of people from a certain age , from a certain society , for a certain decade - the decade of revolution all over the world - and they felt themselves being revolutionary .
in the end it was a group of people killing other people and in the end killing themselves .
so i think most people see them more as terrorists than as revolutionary heroes , which sometimes happened in the ' 70s . is that the message that you want people watching the film to come away with ? yes , to take the group down to earth .
to make them human and to show what they really did .
because terrorism is terror , and people sometimes forget that . interview : eric heath -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so it 's very close to reality . concerning the book and maybe your own personal research , what was it that got you interested in this topic ? well , i got to know some of the people who went underground , who were members of the red army faction , because i was working for a school magazine in a little town in northern germany together with the younger brother of the editor of the leftist , radical magazine konkret , klaus rainer roehl , who was the husband of ulrike meinhof .
so i knew them when i was still going to school . when i left school , i worked for three years for that magazine and that was the high-time of the students ' movement and radical developments , so i knew ulrike meinhof pretty well , i also knew the lawyer horst mahler pretty well ; he became a member of the red army faction .
when the whole thing started in 1970 i was working for public television in germany , and i had to do a lot of documentaries , short and long and magazine-type stories , about what happened .
so i knew everything quite well . in the beginning of the ' 80s i decided that i wanted to know everything .
so i quit my job , more or less , and spent about three years researching and writing the book . bildunterschrift : stefan aust said he knew the leadership of the raf , but was not friends with them you said you knew these people .
would you have considered yourselves as friends ? that would be a little too much .
i was a very young journalist at that time .
i started when i was just 20 or 21 and they were all a little bit older .
so i knew them , i was rather close to them , we were not friends , and i was always a little bit younger than they were and i was not as radical as they had been . what do you think drove them ?
what was the overarching goal that they were going for ? i think some of them really wanted to change the world .
they felt solidarity with the poor , and unemployed and exploited people of the world , so they fought imperialism .
that 's what they thought .
they fought against the police , they fought against the state and they forgot that they were n't putting bombs in " dead places " ... but on living human beings .
they became very cruel in their attempt to fight the cruelty of the world . do you think they lost sight at some point of the goal that they 'd started with ? they mainly lost their realistic view of reality .
suddenly , when they went underground , they thought and felt that they lived in a police state , a fascist police state .
and when you are living in a fascist police state you are allowed to do anything .
they had to change reality and their view on reality first in order to be able to do all these terrible things . even 30 years later there 's still a fascination with the raf and still this swirl of controversy because they began with such idealistic views .
what do you think makes the raf so intriguing for people even today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der baader-meinhof komplex film is as close to reality as possible , aust said i think it was the biggest crisis that post-war germany had had .
it was an attack on the state , on the government , on the authorities of the government and on the representatives of the government .
they killed important people .
it was really a threat to the stability of this country , and actually it was the only threat after the war that this country ever had from the inside . when you think about the german autumn in ' 77 , which was 31 years ago , it was really a state of crisis we were in .
in the collective memory of the germans it 's a little bit like september 11 for the united states . what do you think the majority opinion about the raf is right now ?
that they were terrorists or some kind of revolutionary heroes ? i think it 's both .
we tried in this film to show what they really were .
they were a group of people from a certain age , from a certain society , for a certain decade - the decade of revolution all over the world - and they felt themselves being revolutionary .
in the end it was a group of people killing other people and in the end killing themselves .
so i think most people see them more as terrorists than as revolutionary heroes , which sometimes happened in the ' 70s . is that the message that you want people watching the film to come away with ? yes , to take the group down to earth .
to make them human and to show what they really did .
because terrorism is terror , and people sometimes forget that . interview : eric heath -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 journalist and author stefan aust 's book " der baader-meinhof komplex " has been used as the basis for a soon-to-be-released film of the same name .
he told deutsche welle about why the raf still interests people . both the book and the film chronicle the events of the late ' 60s and ' 70s surrounding the german terror group the red army faction .
aust spoke with dw-radio about the movement 's protagonists , the spirit of the time and the film .
deutsche welle : what do you think of the film , having written the book that the film 's based on ? stefan aust : actually , i think it 's a really great film .
it 's really close to the book , and the book was as close to reality as i could do it .
i think it 's the same spirit that 's in the book that inspired the filmmakers to do it .
it 's a fiction film , but has elements of a documentary as if you had been with this group , with the people , with the terrorists all the time during a whole decade . what are the fictional parts and what are the real parts ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan aust said raf leaders lost their sense of reality the whole thing is as close to reality as you could do in a feature film .
a lot of dialogue is more or less authentic , as i did the research .
some parts are exactly as they were in reality , so for instance we had parts in the courtroom in stammheim , when they were on trial there .
it was word for word .
everything that was said in the courtroom was recorded and written down and we used that for the script .
if you had dialogue , for instance , in prison - the fights between the two women , gudrun ensslin and ulrike meinhof - it was reconstructed out of letters that they sent to one another .

25 journalist and author stefan aust 's book " der baader-meinhof komplex " has been used as the basis for a soon-to-be-released film of the same name .
he told deutsche welle about why the raf still interests people . both the book and the film chronicle the events of the late ' 60s and ' 70s surrounding the german terror group the red army faction .
aust spoke with dw-radio about the movement 's protagonists , the spirit of the time and the film .
deutsche welle : what do you think of the film , having written the book that the film 's based on ? stefan aust : actually , i think it 's a really great film .
it 's really close to the book , and the book was as close to reality as i could do it .
i think it 's the same spirit that 's in the book that inspired the filmmakers to do it .
it 's a fiction film , but has elements of a documentary as if you had been with this group , with the people , with the terrorists all the time during a whole decade . what are the fictional parts and what are the real parts ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan aust said raf leaders lost their sense of reality the whole thing is as close to reality as you could do in a feature film .
a lot of dialogue is more or less authentic , as i did the research .
some parts are exactly as they were in reality , so for instance we had parts in the courtroom in stammheim , when they were on trial there .
it was word for word .
everything that was said in the courtroom was recorded and written down and we used that for the script .
if you had dialogue , for instance , in prison - the fights between the two women , gudrun ensslin and ulrike meinhof - it was reconstructed out of letters that they sent to one another .
so it 's very close to reality . concerning the book and maybe your own personal research , what was it that got you interested in this topic ? well , i got to know some of the people who went underground , who were members of the red army faction , because i was working for a school magazine in a little town in northern germany together with the younger brother of the editor of the leftist , radical magazine konkret , klaus rainer roehl , who was the husband of ulrike meinhof .
so i knew them when i was still going to school . when i left school , i worked for three years for that magazine and that was the high-time of the students ' movement and radical developments , so i knew ulrike meinhof pretty well , i also knew the lawyer horst mahler pretty well ; he became a member of the red army faction .
when the whole thing started in 1970 i was working for public television in germany , and i had to do a lot of documentaries , short and long and magazine-type stories , about what happened .
so i knew everything quite well . in the beginning of the ' 80s i decided that i wanted to know everything .
so i quit my job , more or less , and spent about three years researching and writing the book . bildunterschrift : stefan aust said he knew the leadership of the raf , but was not friends with them you said you knew these people .
would you have considered yourselves as friends ? that would be a little too much .
i was a very young journalist at that time .
i started when i was just 20 or 21 and they were all a little bit older .
so i knew them , i was rather close to them , we were not friends , and i was always a little bit younger than they were and i was not as radical as they had been . what do you think drove them ?
what was the overarching goal that they were going for ? i think some of them really wanted to change the world .
they felt solidarity with the poor , and unemployed and exploited people of the world , so they fought imperialism .
that 's what they thought .
they fought against the police , they fought against the state and they forgot that they were n't putting bombs in " dead places " ... but on living human beings .
they became very cruel in their attempt to fight the cruelty of the world . do you think they lost sight at some point of the goal that they 'd started with ? they mainly lost their realistic view of reality .
suddenly , when they went underground , they thought and felt that they lived in a police state , a fascist police state .
and when you are living in a fascist police state you are allowed to do anything .
they had to change reality and their view on reality first in order to be able to do all these terrible things . even 30 years later there 's still a fascination with the raf and still this swirl of controversy because they began with such idealistic views .
what do you think makes the raf so intriguing for people even today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der baader-meinhof komplex film is as close to reality as possible , aust said i think it was the biggest crisis that post-war germany had had .
it was an attack on the state , on the government , on the authorities of the government and on the representatives of the government .
they killed important people .
it was really a threat to the stability of this country , and actually it was the only threat after the war that this country ever had from the inside . when you think about the german autumn in ' 77 , which was 31 years ago , it was really a state of crisis we were in .

we can not wait until a financial institution operating in seven or 10 countries of the european union has problems such as those of lehman brothers or bear sterns , " he said . the eu ’ s first goal is to tighten regulation of credit ratings agencies , which have come under fire for failing to alert investors about risks threatening borrowers ’ solvency . the eu commission is also plans to coordinate regulation of insurers and is set to announce a similar plan for the banking sector next month . while continental european countries took the initiative to hold talks about tougher oversight of financial speculation , especially hedge funds , before the us financial crisis , european regulators have failed to keep tabs on the frequent cross-border consolidation in the banking industry sector in recent years .
banks are thus largely supervised along national lines . that would mean that major european banks such as deutsche bank , unicredit and bnparibas could potentially face various sets of regulations across europe in times of trouble - a burden feared by many officials . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw-world 's karl zawdzky asks whether it 's enough . british mortgage bank hbos fled into the arms of lloyds tsb ; morgan stanley is casting about for a savior , as is the largest american savings and loan bank , washington mutual .
whereas banks such lehman brothers are being sacrificed to the turmoil on the markets , other institutions like the international insurer american international group -lrb- aig -rrb- are being rescued .
and that begs the question : who will be the next to go down ? the best advice is , save yourself if you can .
because without a doubt , this is the biggest crisis since the crash of 1929 , which plunged the world into a depression , saw countless firms file for bankruptcy , brought massive unemployment and put wind in the sails of those who sought political gain . the financial markets are out of control .
only the mistakes and excesses of the boom are being corrected .
for too long , people thought that the only way would ever be up , that wealth without work was possible . many speculators even managed to accrue wealth in this way .
the bubble has long since been recognized but the realization that every bubble - whether on the financial market , the property market or the raw commodities market - has to burst sometime .
that 's exactly what 's happening now .
the time in which greed superseded reason is over - for now .
security is what 's needed ; the price of gold is jumping like never before . governments keeping their cool in contrast to the players on the financial markets , governments and central banks are keeping a level head .
banks and insurers , whose demise would not just shake up global financial systems but could bring them down like dominos , are being saved . aig , one of the world 's largest insurers with more than 100 million customers in 130 countries is being rescued by state intervention .
the reason : too many americans would have lost their retirement savings had the company collapsed .
aside from this , aig is a big credit insurer for banks around the world .
its demise could have triggered a core meltdown in the global financial system .
in comparison , the collapse of lehman brothers , the third-largest american investment bank , was painful , but survivable . what this means , though , is that while the financial markets are shaky and the stock exchanges are up and down , governments and central banks have n't let themselves become infected with the general sense of insecurity , rather , they 've acted decisively . the financial markets are literally being flooded with dollars , euros , yen , pounds and rubles to keep the systems running .
us treasury secretary henry paulson and federal reserve chairman ben bernanke are working on a solution which would involve creating a government-sponsored vehicle to relieve american financial companies of their toxic investments . greater regulation needed so the state emerges as the savior .
initial news of the bailout led to a swift recovery .
first , profits were privatized and now , losses are being socialized .
with the banks saved , the whole game can start over again .
that is , unless the government makes stricter regulations for the financial sector part of its rescue program . the sector is always willing to be bailed out , but most unwilling to have regulations imposed on its business dealings .
but without stricter monitoring and regulation , such a bailout will only plant the seeds for the next bubble on the financial markets to grow . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 journalist and author stefan aust 's book " der baader-meinhof komplex " has been used as the basis for a soon-to-be-released film of the same name .
he told deutsche welle about why the raf still interests people . both the book and the film chronicle the events of the late ' 60s and ' 70s surrounding the german terror group the red army faction .
aust spoke with dw-radio about the movement 's protagonists , the spirit of the time and the film .
deutsche welle : what do you think of the film , having written the book that the film 's based on ? stefan aust : actually , i think it 's a really great film .
it 's really close to the book , and the book was as close to reality as i could do it .
i think it 's the same spirit that 's in the book that inspired the filmmakers to do it .
it 's a fiction film , but has elements of a documentary as if you had been with this group , with the people , with the terrorists all the time during a whole decade . what are the fictional parts and what are the real parts ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan aust said raf leaders lost their sense of reality the whole thing is as close to reality as you could do in a feature film .
a lot of dialogue is more or less authentic , as i did the research .
some parts are exactly as they were in reality , so for instance we had parts in the courtroom in stammheim , when they were on trial there .
it was word for word .
everything that was said in the courtroom was recorded and written down and we used that for the script .
if you had dialogue , for instance , in prison - the fights between the two women , gudrun ensslin and ulrike meinhof - it was reconstructed out of letters that they sent to one another .
so it 's very close to reality . concerning the book and maybe your own personal research , what was it that got you interested in this topic ? well , i got to know some of the people who went underground , who were members of the red army faction , because i was working for a school magazine in a little town in northern germany together with the younger brother of the editor of the leftist , radical magazine konkret , klaus rainer roehl , who was the husband of ulrike meinhof .
so i knew them when i was still going to school . when i left school , i worked for three years for that magazine and that was the high-time of the students ' movement and radical developments , so i knew ulrike meinhof pretty well , i also knew the lawyer horst mahler pretty well ; he became a member of the red army faction .
when the whole thing started in 1970 i was working for public television in germany , and i had to do a lot of documentaries , short and long and magazine-type stories , about what happened .
so i knew everything quite well . in the beginning of the ' 80s i decided that i wanted to know everything .
so i quit my job , more or less , and spent about three years researching and writing the book . bildunterschrift : stefan aust said he knew the leadership of the raf , but was not friends with them you said you knew these people .
would you have considered yourselves as friends ? that would be a little too much .
i was a very young journalist at that time .
i started when i was just 20 or 21 and they were all a little bit older .
so i knew them , i was rather close to them , we were not friends , and i was always a little bit younger than they were and i was not as radical as they had been . what do you think drove them ?
what was the overarching goal that they were going for ? i think some of them really wanted to change the world .
they felt solidarity with the poor , and unemployed and exploited people of the world , so they fought imperialism .
that 's what they thought .
they fought against the police , they fought against the state and they forgot that they were n't putting bombs in " dead places " ... but on living human beings .
they became very cruel in their attempt to fight the cruelty of the world . do you think they lost sight at some point of the goal that they 'd started with ? they mainly lost their realistic view of reality .
suddenly , when they went underground , they thought and felt that they lived in a police state , a fascist police state .
and when you are living in a fascist police state you are allowed to do anything .
they had to change reality and their view on reality first in order to be able to do all these terrible things . even 30 years later there 's still a fascination with the raf and still this swirl of controversy because they began with such idealistic views .
what do you think makes the raf so intriguing for people even today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der baader-meinhof komplex film is as close to reality as possible , aust said i think it was the biggest crisis that post-war germany had had .
it was an attack on the state , on the government , on the authorities of the government and on the representatives of the government .
they killed important people .
it was really a threat to the stability of this country , and actually it was the only threat after the war that this country ever had from the inside . when you think about the german autumn in ' 77 , which was 31 years ago , it was really a state of crisis we were in .
in the collective memory of the germans it 's a little bit like september 11 for the united states . what do you think the majority opinion about the raf is right now ?
that they were terrorists or some kind of revolutionary heroes ? i think it 's both .
we tried in this film to show what they really were .
they were a group of people from a certain age , from a certain society , for a certain decade - the decade of revolution all over the world - and they felt themselves being revolutionary .
in the end it was a group of people killing other people and in the end killing themselves .
so i think most people see them more as terrorists than as revolutionary heroes , which sometimes happened in the ' 70s . is that the message that you want people watching the film to come away with ? yes , to take the group down to earth .
to make them human and to show what they really did .
because terrorism is terror , and people sometimes forget that . interview : eric heath -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

aust spoke with dw-radio about the movement 's protagonists , the spirit of the time and the film .
deutsche welle : what do you think of the film , having written the book that the film 's based on ? stefan aust : actually , i think it 's a really great film .
it 's really close to the book , and the book was as close to reality as i could do it .
i think it 's the same spirit that 's in the book that inspired the filmmakers to do it .
it 's a fiction film , but has elements of a documentary as if you had been with this group , with the people , with the terrorists all the time during a whole decade . what are the fictional parts and what are the real parts ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan aust said raf leaders lost their sense of reality the whole thing is as close to reality as you could do in a feature film .
a lot of dialogue is more or less authentic , as i did the research .
some parts are exactly as they were in reality , so for instance we had parts in the courtroom in stammheim , when they were on trial there .
it was word for word .
everything that was said in the courtroom was recorded and written down and we used that for the script .
if you had dialogue , for instance , in prison - the fights between the two women , gudrun ensslin and ulrike meinhof - it was reconstructed out of letters that they sent to one another .
so it 's very close to reality . concerning the book and maybe your own personal research , what was it that got you interested in this topic ? well , i got to know some of the people who went underground , who were members of the red army faction , because i was working for a school magazine in a little town in northern germany together with the younger brother of the editor of the leftist , radical magazine konkret , klaus rainer roehl , who was the husband of ulrike meinhof .
so i knew them when i was still going to school . when i left school , i worked for three years for that magazine and that was the high-time of the students ' movement and radical developments , so i knew ulrike meinhof pretty well , i also knew the lawyer horst mahler pretty well ; he became a member of the red army faction .
when the whole thing started in 1970 i was working for public television in germany , and i had to do a lot of documentaries , short and long and magazine-type stories , about what happened .
so i knew everything quite well . in the beginning of the ' 80s i decided that i wanted to know everything .
so i quit my job , more or less , and spent about three years researching and writing the book . bildunterschrift : stefan aust said he knew the leadership of the raf , but was not friends with them you said you knew these people .
would you have considered yourselves as friends ? that would be a little too much .
i was a very young journalist at that time .
i started when i was just 20 or 21 and they were all a little bit older .
so i knew them , i was rather close to them , we were not friends , and i was always a little bit younger than they were and i was not as radical as they had been . what do you think drove them ?
what was the overarching goal that they were going for ? i think some of them really wanted to change the world .
they felt solidarity with the poor , and unemployed and exploited people of the world , so they fought imperialism .
that 's what they thought .
they fought against the police , they fought against the state and they forgot that they were n't putting bombs in " dead places " ... but on living human beings .
they became very cruel in their attempt to fight the cruelty of the world . do you think they lost sight at some point of the goal that they 'd started with ? they mainly lost their realistic view of reality .
suddenly , when they went underground , they thought and felt that they lived in a police state , a fascist police state .
and when you are living in a fascist police state you are allowed to do anything .
they had to change reality and their view on reality first in order to be able to do all these terrible things . even 30 years later there 's still a fascination with the raf and still this swirl of controversy because they began with such idealistic views .
what do you think makes the raf so intriguing for people even today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der baader-meinhof komplex film is as close to reality as possible , aust said i think it was the biggest crisis that post-war germany had had .
it was an attack on the state , on the government , on the authorities of the government and on the representatives of the government .
they killed important people .
it was really a threat to the stability of this country , and actually it was the only threat after the war that this country ever had from the inside . when you think about the german autumn in ' 77 , which was 31 years ago , it was really a state of crisis we were in .
in the collective memory of the germans it 's a little bit like september 11 for the united states . what do you think the majority opinion about the raf is right now ?
that they were terrorists or some kind of revolutionary heroes ? i think it 's both .
we tried in this film to show what they really were .
they were a group of people from a certain age , from a certain society , for a certain decade - the decade of revolution all over the world - and they felt themselves being revolutionary .
in the end it was a group of people killing other people and in the end killing themselves .
so i think most people see them more as terrorists than as revolutionary heroes , which sometimes happened in the ' 70s . is that the message that you want people watching the film to come away with ? yes , to take the group down to earth .
to make them human and to show what they really did .
because terrorism is terror , and people sometimes forget that . interview : eric heath -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a substantial offer from the eu is on the table .
we are still in talks with iran to receive a concrete and , we hope , positive response to this offer .
this has until now still been lacking , " he said when asked about the calls for sanctions . germany is one of six world powers attempting to convince iran to halt sensitive nuclear work with an incentives package in exchange for full suspension of uranium enrichment . " should there be no progress on the negotiations track , the german government believes the un security council will become more relevant again and discussions will have to be held whether there should be new resolutions . " this is not the track we are seeking - we want progress from negotiations .
but unfortunately what we have seen until now has not made us optimistic . " ploetner said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had stressed the importance of settling the issue quickly during talks monday with his iranian counterpart manouchehr mottaki . officials from the six nations , which also includes russia , china and the uk , are scheduled to meet friday , sept .
19 , before the un general assembly convenes in new york .
foreign ministers are expected to convene over iran during the annual meeting . unity required to approve new sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains unlikely that the security council will unite behind the french sanctions resolution european union foreign policy chief javier solana said he believes russia and china are " quite worried " about iran 's nuclear program and that a report presented monday by the iaea nuclear watchdog " is n't good for iran . " but he added that he did n't think moscow and beijing would completely turn around and support the west 's call for more sanctions . washington and european capitals have accused tehran of enriching uranium in order to produce atomic weapons .
iran has insisted its nuclear program is intended solely to create electricity . " the main option here is a fourth un sanctions resolution , but that is a possibility that requires russian , chinese and european cooperation , " a senior us official , who asked not to be named as his comments were sensitive , told reuters news agency . state department spokesman sean mccormack said on thursday there was agreement to move forward with a new sanctions resolution , but it was unclear how far the six political directors would get in hammering out a detailed agreement . tough steps unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would not change course " this is probably a discussion which will be aimed at seeing where each of the individual states are in terms of the timeline of moving forward and the content of a new resolution , " mccormack told reporters . iran experts have said that even if the un security council members plus germany , who are responsible for negotiations with iran , agreed to a new resolution , it would be a weaker version than washington and others wanted . restrictions would likely be placed on iranian companies but not the oil industry or oil products . " my guess is that the sanctions will be watered down and there is every reason for the russians to drag this out , " gary samore of the council on foreign relations told reuters . ahead of friday 's meeting , iran 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , again said tehran would not stop its enrichment program regardless of whether the un decides to impose a new round of sanctions . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , follows the court 's dissolution of basque nationalist action -lrb- anv -rrb- on tuesday , the region 's third-strongest party at municipal level , because of eta links .
the parties had emerged as the successors of eta 's political wing batasuna after it was outlawed in 2003 .
national court judge baltasar garzon had earlier slapped a temporary ban on the two parties to prevent them from contesting the national parliamentary elections held on march 9 .
prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's government and prosecutors had sought a ban on the parties , which garzon described as having close financial and other links with batasuna and eta .
the pctv is represented at municipal level , and has nine mps in the basque regional parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 19.09.2008 european press review : livni up against great expectations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni hopes to become israel 's first female prime minister in more than three decades israel 's foreign minister tzipi livni is beginning the task of putting together a new government after she was elected leader of the ruling kadima party this week .
dw-world.de sums up press reactions to her win . the luxemburger wort commented friday , sept .
19 , that livni was right to say that she would approach the job of prime minister with " great reverence . "
" further reconciliation with the palestinians , treatment of iran 's increasing nuclear power , and normalization of relations with syria are the three largest geo-strategic challenges facing israel , " the paper said .
" the long-term vitality of this high-tech nation sandwiched between the golan heights and the red sea depends on the clever handling of these dossiers . " the conservative swedish daily svenska dagbladet predicted that these issues will very soon be causing tzipi livni severe headaches should she be sworn in as prime minister .
" current prime minister ehud olmert 's plans for a one-sided withdrawal from the occupied territories were abandoned when hezbollah provoked the second war in lebanon , " the paper said .
" instead of a withdrawal , there was the hamas coup in gaza , which is now blocking progress in the west bank .
and it probably wo n't be long before the terrorists working for the hamas regime put livni 's skills to the hardest of tests . " london 's the independent commented friday on the first task awaiting livni - that of forming a government in just 42 days .
the task will be difficult , the paper said , because it will involve her winning some support from one of the small extremist parties which hold the balance of power in israeli politics .
" in the past , ms livni has hinted that she is not prepared to make random concessions to every interest group ; indeed , she wants to break with the wheeler-dealing tradition of israeli politics and restore public trust in the political process , " the paper wrote .
" she now has to strike a delicate balance between doing that and ensuring she can form an administration which will last long enough to present some serious progress on peace to the israeli electorate at the next election in 18 months time .
that is not long .
israel 's controversial security wall may have stopped the suicide bombs for the time being , but she must not be lulled into thinking she has the luxury of time . " israel 's english-language newspaper , haaretz , commented that all eyes will be on livni as she tries to form a government .
" being clean means more than not accepting envelopes filled with money , " the paper wrote .
" political cleanliness also requires making decisions that are statesmanlike and not opportunistic .
livni has to prove that , in contrast to her predecessor , she chooses the persons best suited to the job to be her cabinet ministers and not those who claim to represent the ' grassroots , ' those who threaten the unity of the ranks and those who threaten to call for new elections . " the berliner zeitung commented on the rise of " frauenpower " - the power of women - in israel , writing : " if livni were the lead singer of a band , it might be called ' tzipi and the expectations . '
western countries are among those who see huge promise in her .
in europe in particular , she 's being treated like a new beacon of light in the middle east peace process . "
despite the difficulties facing livni , the paper said that with her victory , the chance is now greater that those who want a fair peace deal will have greater say . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de sums up press reactions to her win . the luxemburger wort commented friday , sept .
19 , that livni was right to say that she would approach the job of prime minister with " great reverence . "
" further reconciliation with the palestinians , treatment of iran 's increasing nuclear power , and normalization of relations with syria are the three largest geo-strategic challenges facing israel , " the paper said .
" the long-term vitality of this high-tech nation sandwiched between the golan heights and the red sea depends on the clever handling of these dossiers . " the conservative swedish daily svenska dagbladet predicted that these issues will very soon be causing tzipi livni severe headaches should she be sworn in as prime minister .
" current prime minister ehud olmert 's plans for a one-sided withdrawal from the occupied territories were abandoned when hezbollah provoked the second war in lebanon , " the paper said .
" instead of a withdrawal , there was the hamas coup in gaza , which is now blocking progress in the west bank .
and it probably wo n't be long before the terrorists working for the hamas regime put livni 's skills to the hardest of tests . " london 's the independent commented friday on the first task awaiting livni - that of forming a government in just 42 days .
the task will be difficult , the paper said , because it will involve her winning some support from one of the small extremist parties which hold the balance of power in israeli politics .
" in the past , ms livni has hinted that she is not prepared to make random concessions to every interest group ; indeed , she wants to break with the wheeler-dealing tradition of israeli politics and restore public trust in the political process , " the paper wrote .
" she now has to strike a delicate balance between doing that and ensuring she can form an administration which will last long enough to present some serious progress on peace to the israeli electorate at the next election in 18 months time .
that is not long .
israel 's controversial security wall may have stopped the suicide bombs for the time being , but she must not be lulled into thinking she has the luxury of time . " israel 's english-language newspaper , haaretz , commented that all eyes will be on livni as she tries to form a government .
" being clean means more than not accepting envelopes filled with money , " the paper wrote .
" political cleanliness also requires making decisions that are statesmanlike and not opportunistic .
livni has to prove that , in contrast to her predecessor , she chooses the persons best suited to the job to be her cabinet ministers and not those who claim to represent the ' grassroots , ' those who threaten the unity of the ranks and those who threaten to call for new elections . " the berliner zeitung commented on the rise of " frauenpower " - the power of women - in israel , writing : " if livni were the lead singer of a band , it might be called ' tzipi and the expectations . '
western countries are among those who see huge promise in her .
in europe in particular , she 's being treated like a new beacon of light in the middle east peace process . "
despite the difficulties facing livni , the paper said that with her victory , the chance is now greater that those who want a fair peace deal will have greater say . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 19.09.2008 european press review : livni up against great expectations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni hopes to become israel 's first female prime minister in more than three decades israel 's foreign minister tzipi livni is beginning the task of putting together a new government after she was elected leader of the ruling kadima party this week .
dw-world.de sums up press reactions to her win . the luxemburger wort commented friday , sept .
19 , that livni was right to say that she would approach the job of prime minister with " great reverence . "
" further reconciliation with the palestinians , treatment of iran 's increasing nuclear power , and normalization of relations with syria are the three largest geo-strategic challenges facing israel , " the paper said .
" the long-term vitality of this high-tech nation sandwiched between the golan heights and the red sea depends on the clever handling of these dossiers . " the conservative swedish daily svenska dagbladet predicted that these issues will very soon be causing tzipi livni severe headaches should she be sworn in as prime minister .
" current prime minister ehud olmert 's plans for a one-sided withdrawal from the occupied territories were abandoned when hezbollah provoked the second war in lebanon , " the paper said .
" instead of a withdrawal , there was the hamas coup in gaza , which is now blocking progress in the west bank .
and it probably wo n't be long before the terrorists working for the hamas regime put livni 's skills to the hardest of tests . " london 's the independent commented friday on the first task awaiting livni - that of forming a government in just 42 days .
the task will be difficult , the paper said , because it will involve her winning some support from one of the small extremist parties which hold the balance of power in israeli politics .
" in the past , ms livni has hinted that she is not prepared to make random concessions to every interest group ; indeed , she wants to break with the wheeler-dealing tradition of israeli politics and restore public trust in the political process , " the paper wrote .
" she now has to strike a delicate balance between doing that and ensuring she can form an administration which will last long enough to present some serious progress on peace to the israeli electorate at the next election in 18 months time .
that is not long .
israel 's controversial security wall may have stopped the suicide bombs for the time being , but she must not be lulled into thinking she has the luxury of time . " israel 's english-language newspaper , haaretz , commented that all eyes will be on livni as she tries to form a government .
" being clean means more than not accepting envelopes filled with money , " the paper wrote .
" political cleanliness also requires making decisions that are statesmanlike and not opportunistic .
livni has to prove that , in contrast to her predecessor , she chooses the persons best suited to the job to be her cabinet ministers and not those who claim to represent the ' grassroots , ' those who threaten the unity of the ranks and those who threaten to call for new elections . " the berliner zeitung commented on the rise of " frauenpower " - the power of women - in israel , writing : " if livni were the lead singer of a band , it might be called ' tzipi and the expectations . '
western countries are among those who see huge promise in her .
in europe in particular , she 's being treated like a new beacon of light in the middle east peace process . "
despite the difficulties facing livni , the paper said that with her victory , the chance is now greater that those who want a fair peace deal will have greater say . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a substantial offer from the eu is on the table .
we are still in talks with iran to receive a concrete and , we hope , positive response to this offer .
this has until now still been lacking , " he said when asked about the calls for sanctions . germany is one of six world powers attempting to convince iran to halt sensitive nuclear work with an incentives package in exchange for full suspension of uranium enrichment . " should there be no progress on the negotiations track , the german government believes the un security council will become more relevant again and discussions will have to be held whether there should be new resolutions . " this is not the track we are seeking - we want progress from negotiations .
but unfortunately what we have seen until now has not made us optimistic . " ploetner said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had stressed the importance of settling the issue quickly during talks monday with his iranian counterpart manouchehr mottaki . officials from the six nations , which also includes russia , china and the uk , are scheduled to meet friday , sept .
19 , before the un general assembly convenes in new york .
foreign ministers are expected to convene over iran during the annual meeting . unity required to approve new sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains unlikely that the security council will unite behind the french sanctions resolution european union foreign policy chief javier solana said he believes russia and china are " quite worried " about iran 's nuclear program and that a report presented monday by the iaea nuclear watchdog " is n't good for iran . " but he added that he did n't think moscow and beijing would completely turn around and support the west 's call for more sanctions . washington and european capitals have accused tehran of enriching uranium in order to produce atomic weapons .
iran has insisted its nuclear program is intended solely to create electricity . " the main option here is a fourth un sanctions resolution , but that is a possibility that requires russian , chinese and european cooperation , " a senior us official , who asked not to be named as his comments were sensitive , told reuters news agency . state department spokesman sean mccormack said on thursday there was agreement to move forward with a new sanctions resolution , but it was unclear how far the six political directors would get in hammering out a detailed agreement . tough steps unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would not change course " this is probably a discussion which will be aimed at seeing where each of the individual states are in terms of the timeline of moving forward and the content of a new resolution , " mccormack told reporters . iran experts have said that even if the un security council members plus germany , who are responsible for negotiations with iran , agreed to a new resolution , it would be a weaker version than washington and others wanted . restrictions would likely be placed on iranian companies but not the oil industry or oil products . " my guess is that the sanctions will be watered down and there is every reason for the russians to drag this out , " gary samore of the council on foreign relations told reuters . ahead of friday 's meeting , iran 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , again said tehran would not stop its enrichment program regardless of whether the un decides to impose a new round of sanctions . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

counter-demonstrators carried signs with slogans including " stop the nazi congress - stop pro koeln " and a few scuffled with the right-wing organisers .
one leftist protester was briefly detained by police , a spokesman said .
some 3,000 police officers from north rhine-westphalia and neighboring states are being deployed in cologne this weekend in the hope that they 'll be able to maintain peace and security . the organizers from pro koeln - a self-described " civil movement " which has , however , been represented on the municipal council for four years now - are among the most vocal opponents to a project to build a new mosque in cologne . the group used the recent green-lighting of the construction plans to rally together other far-right groups in europe who share its view that german and europe are increasingly becoming " islamicized . " government , experts label pro-koeln extremist a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry criticised the event friday , calling pro-koeln an " extremist " group that aimed to undermine good relations between muslims and non-muslims . in chorus , a foreign affairs spokesperson for the federal government said : " in our country there is no place for radical right-wing groups who discriminate against minorities under the guise of a citizens ’ movement . " wolfgang kapust , an expert on the far-right definitively labeled pro-koeln an extremist grouping . " you can see it in the biographies of their leaders .
they 're members of the national democratic party , they 're in the republicans , and they established the very radical german league for people and homeland .
and all of these organizations and parties are characterized by far-right positions , racism , and a strong sense of nationalism . " no koelsch for nazis a wide majority of cologne residents are planning to clearly show that they want nothing to do with the congress .
they 've made hundreds of signs calling for passive resistance to the event .
the city 's barkeepers have declared that they will not be serving any of the local cologne beer , koelsch , to nazis .
and muslim groups in this city where every eighth resident is muslim have planned peaceful gatherings on the site of the planned mosque . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " prevent nazi congress " is scrawled on a cologne monument some onlookers are wondering why the city has n't banned the congress from taking place .
but politician ruprecht polenz , head of a christian-muslim peace initiative , said that 's not so easily done . " they 're clever , " he said .
" they 're not going to show up sporting swastikas .
rather , they 'll use slogans meant to pick up on any resentments .
there are problems with integration .
the question is , how do i handle it ?
do i contribute to the problem by reacting aggressively , or do i try , with dialogue , to get to the bottom of things and get closer to a solution ? " cologne residents to give the cold shoulder cologne 's city government has also had mixed feelings about hosting the congress , and not because of the bill of more than a million euros the city will have to foot once it 's all over .
officials are worried about the bad name that such an event could give a city that prides itself on being an exceptionally tolerant place to live . mayor fritz schramma has called on residents to show the far-right " the cold shoulder . " " shut your windows and doors , lower your shutters , " he said in a statement .
" make it clear to pro koeln and its camarilla : you are not welcome in cologne . " the right-wing extremists have been denied permission to gather in front of the city 's most famous landmark , the cologne cathedral .
instead , the event has been relegated to a city suburb . whether pro koeln 's attempt to unify europe 's nationalists will succeed in cologne remains to be seen .
in the run-up to the event , the organizers boasted that big names on the far-right scene would be in attendance - jean marie le pen , the head of france 's national front , for example , or the head of the austria 's freedom party . le pen , for his part , has already let it be known that pro-koeln was lying .

counter-demonstrators carried signs with slogans including " stop the nazi congress - stop pro koeln " and a few scuffled with the right-wing organisers .
one leftist protester was briefly detained by police , a spokesman said .
some 3,000 police officers from north rhine-westphalia and neighboring states are being deployed in cologne this weekend in the hope that they 'll be able to maintain peace and security . the organizers from pro koeln - a self-described " civil movement " which has , however , been represented on the municipal council for four years now - are among the most vocal opponents to a project to build a new mosque in cologne . the group used the recent green-lighting of the construction plans to rally together other far-right groups in europe who share its view that german and europe are increasingly becoming " islamicized . " government , experts label pro-koeln extremist a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry criticised the event friday , calling pro-koeln an " extremist " group that aimed to undermine good relations between muslims and non-muslims . in chorus , a foreign affairs spokesperson for the federal government said : " in our country there is no place for radical right-wing groups who discriminate against minorities under the guise of a citizens ’ movement . " wolfgang kapust , an expert on the far-right definitively labeled pro-koeln an extremist grouping . " you can see it in the biographies of their leaders .
they 're members of the national democratic party , they 're in the republicans , and they established the very radical german league for people and homeland .
and all of these organizations and parties are characterized by far-right positions , racism , and a strong sense of nationalism . " no koelsch for nazis a wide majority of cologne residents are planning to clearly show that they want nothing to do with the congress .
they 've made hundreds of signs calling for passive resistance to the event .
the city 's barkeepers have declared that they will not be serving any of the local cologne beer , koelsch , to nazis .
and muslim groups in this city where every eighth resident is muslim have planned peaceful gatherings on the site of the planned mosque . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " prevent nazi congress " is scrawled on a cologne monument some onlookers are wondering why the city has n't banned the congress from taking place .
but politician ruprecht polenz , head of a christian-muslim peace initiative , said that 's not so easily done . " they 're clever , " he said .
" they 're not going to show up sporting swastikas .
rather , they 'll use slogans meant to pick up on any resentments .

the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm , announced its new plan on thursday , sept .

with her excessive drug and alcohol use , it seems winehouse has an appetite for self-destruction .
the main substance responsible for her downward spiral : cocaine .
winehouse is a particularly extreme poster girl for the danger that seems to be lurking just around the corner for european youths .
although the consumption of heroin as well as synthetic drugs has stagnated or even decreased slightly in some countries , according to the newest statistics from the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction , cocaine has n't become the number one most fashionable drug in just musician and manager circles .
" we have ascertained a worldwide increase in cocaine consumption that is very worrying , " said european commission vice-president jacques barrot .
allies in the war on drugs the uk , france and spain are seeing this increase particularly in youths between the ages of 15 and 16 .
and to counteract negative role models like whinehouse , the commission also wants to get celebrities to support its campaign against drugs .
" today i want to call for a european alliance in the struggle against drugs .
the goal is to sensitize the population , particularly the youth , but also to make businesses and local public authorities aware of the problem , " said barrot .
" those who join the alliance commit to taking concrete measures .
we also want to incorporate famous personalities to directly address youths . "

barrot also reportedly wants bloc-wide rules against drug use on the road because young people are n't sufficiently aware of the dangerous relationship between drugs and driving .

at the latest count , 6,244 children have become ill , four have died and 158 are suffering " acute kidney failure . "
with foreign consumers warily eyeing china 's manufacturing reputation amid claims of delays and cover-ups , robert madelin , director-general for health and consumer protection at the european commission , told reporters in beijing he expected an account of what went wrong .
" we are trying to establish the facts .
we are discussing all aspects of this crisis bilaterally with our colleagues in china , " he said .
" i know from experience that these sorts of cases , where apparently illegal or fraudulent acts lead to problems in safety , are the most difficult for any of us to deal with , " added madelin .
madelin said the eu did not import chinese infant milk powder , and there had been no reports of infant sickness in the bloc from other chinese dairy products .
the scandal 's protagonists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : products of china 's mengniu dairy company have been pulled from starbucks shelves almost one-tenth of liquid milk batches from mengniu dairy and inner mongolia yili industrial group , a beijing olympic games sponsor , contained melamine , a chemical which is banned in food .
several samples of milk from the bright dairy group also had the substance , used in making plastics , china 's general administration of quality supervision , inspection and quarantine found .
chinese media have largely kept quiet about claims that the sanlu group , china 's biggest maker of infant milk powder , concealed the poisonings from the public and senior authorities during the beijing olympics in august .
starbucks pulls questionable milk coffee chain starbucks said its 300-plus cafes in mainland china had pulled milk supplies by mengniu as a precautionary step , but that no employees or customers had fallen ill from the milk .

both were accused of travelling to an iju camp in the afghan-pakistan border area last year and taking supplies including binoculars , torches , and mp3 players to the remote camps .
a statement said they were associates of adem y , who was recently indicted for plotting car bomb attacks in germany .
police arrested yilmaz and two alleged co-conspirators last year before any attack occurred .
all the men were described as associates of the islamist iju , a shadowy sunni muslim group that is said to mimic the organization of al qaeda a decade ago and which has been the main recent focus of german anti-terrorism inquiries .
a federal magistrate remanded the two arrested this week into custody on a charge of supporting a foreign terrorist organization and exporting arms of war .
prosecutors said pakistan security forces caught the turkish national last year on his way to the camp and prevented him reaching it .

" a substantial offer from the eu is on the table .
we are still in talks with iran to receive a concrete and , we hope , positive response to this offer .
this has until now still been lacking , " he said when asked about the calls for sanctions . germany is one of six world powers attempting to convince iran to halt sensitive nuclear work with an incentives package in exchange for full suspension of uranium enrichment . " should there be no progress on the negotiations track , the german government believes the un security council will become more relevant again and discussions will have to be held whether there should be new resolutions . " this is not the track we are seeking - we want progress from negotiations .
but unfortunately what we have seen until now has not made us optimistic . " ploetner said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had stressed the importance of settling the issue quickly during talks monday with his iranian counterpart manouchehr mottaki . officials from the six nations , which also includes russia , china and the uk , are scheduled to meet friday , sept .
19 , before the un general assembly convenes in new york .
foreign ministers are expected to convene over iran during the annual meeting . unity required to approve new sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains unlikely that the security council will unite behind the french sanctions resolution european union foreign policy chief javier solana said he believes russia and china are " quite worried " about iran 's nuclear program and that a report presented monday by the iaea nuclear watchdog " is n't good for iran . " but he added that he did n't think moscow and beijing would completely turn around and support the west 's call for more sanctions . washington and european capitals have accused tehran of enriching uranium in order to produce atomic weapons .
iran has insisted its nuclear program is intended solely to create electricity . " the main option here is a fourth un sanctions resolution , but that is a possibility that requires russian , chinese and european cooperation , " a senior us official , who asked not to be named as his comments were sensitive , told reuters news agency . state department spokesman sean mccormack said on thursday there was agreement to move forward with a new sanctions resolution , but it was unclear how far the six political directors would get in hammering out a detailed agreement . tough steps unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would not change course " this is probably a discussion which will be aimed at seeing where each of the individual states are in terms of the timeline of moving forward and the content of a new resolution , " mccormack told reporters . iran experts have said that even if the un security council members plus germany , who are responsible for negotiations with iran , agreed to a new resolution , it would be a weaker version than washington and others wanted . restrictions would likely be placed on iranian companies but not the oil industry or oil products . " my guess is that the sanctions will be watered down and there is every reason for the russians to drag this out , " gary samore of the council on foreign relations told reuters . ahead of friday 's meeting , iran 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , again said tehran would not stop its enrichment program regardless of whether the un decides to impose a new round of sanctions . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a letter to staff , munich-based bayern lb , which is controlled by bavaria state , put its risk at up to 300 million euros .
all three banks had placed funds with lehman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal bank kfw is under fire for mistakenly wiring millions to lehman before its collapse " like many other banks active worldwide , our company had a business relationship over many years with lehman brothers , " said the letter signed by bayern chief executive michael kemmer .
he said accountants were still comparing which sums were credits and which were debts to establish the net exposure , but the figure so far was " up to 300 million . "
nrw bank , controlled by the state of north-rhine westphalia , said it had lent money to lehman brothers , but declined to say how much .
" they were n't problem investments , " said a spokesman .
although no german banks have so far failed or been forced to merge , the known exposure of german taxpayers to the crisis was approaching $ 1.2 billion friday .
europe seeks tighter banking regulations global markets have been shaken by the financial earthquake on wall street though indexes in many countries rallied friday after a host of major central banks in america , europe and elsewehere made almost a quarter of a trillion dollars available to struggling banks .
the us federal reserve said it had authorized another $ 180 million lending program to help banks in need of emergency cash . the eu is now seeking to use the us economic meltdown , which it asserts was the result of a negligent attitude towards finance , as motivation to beef up its supervision of the financial sector in two key areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis on wall street has sparked some intense soul-searching " we need more coordinated action by supervisors than currently exists , " said eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia on thursday , sept 18 , in madrid .
" we must move forward faster .
we can not wait until a financial institution operating in seven or 10 countries of the european union has problems such as those of lehman brothers or bear sterns , " he continued the eu ’ s first goal is to tighten regulation of credit ratings agencies , which have come under fire for failing to alert investors about risks threatening borrowers ’ solvency .
the eu commission is also assembling plans to coordinate regulation of insurers and is set to announce a similar plan for the banking sector next month ..
while continental european countries took the initiative to hold talks about tougher oversight of financial speculation , especially hedge funds , before the us financial crisis , european regulators have failed to keep tabs on the frequent cross-border consolidation in the banking industry sector in recent years .
banks are thus largely supervised along national lines .
that would mean that major european banks such as deutsche bank , unicredit and bnparibas could potentially face various sets of regulations across europe in times of trouble - a burden feared by many officials . dpa news agency -lrb- ls / dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 .
it comes at a time when the eu is eager to bolster ties with neighbours that share a border with a newly resurgent russia . last month 's georgia conflict saw russia invade the small caucasus nation and support the independence claims of two of its restive regions .
" belarus does not want dialogue with the west through the ' iron curtain ' it has built on its border , " lukashenko said in an interview with western journalists ahead of the parliamentary polls .
" we want dialogue in all areas . "
" we want you to accept us and to recognize our elections , " lukashenko said , according to excerpts of the interview provided by his office .
lukashenko , in power for 14 years , is accused by the united states and the european union of rigging elections , jailing opponents and closing down free media .
no election held in the former soviet republic since the mid-1990s has been deemed free or fair .
prisoner releases herald prospect of thaw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander kozulin was released from detention , along with other notable political prisoners last month , lukashenko released belarus ' highest-profile political prisoner , former presidential candidate alexander kozulin , and the remaining political prisoners being held there .
european foreign ministers on monday responded by holding out the prospect of aid and lifted sanctions in a bid to persuade lukashenko to hold democratic elections .
following the prisoner release , washington also said the move set the stage for a " significant " improvement in ties .
lukashenko said western monitoring of the upcoming elections would prove that belarus was a genuine democracy .
" we have opened the country for you .
come , look , observe , whether the pre-election campaign , the voting and the election itself are undertaken in line with our laws , " he said .
forty belarussian figures , including the president , have been banned from entering the eu since the 2006 presidential election which was judged not to comply with international norms .
last week , a major belarus opposition party leader warned that western countries would turn a blind eye to fraud in next month 's legislative election and recognise a win for the outgoing authoritarian regime . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the latest count , 6,244 children have become ill , four have died and 158 are suffering " acute kidney failure . "
with foreign consumers warily eyeing china 's manufacturing reputation amid claims of delays and cover-ups , robert madelin , director-general for health and consumer protection at the european commission , told reporters in beijing he expected an account of what went wrong .
" we are trying to establish the facts .
we are discussing all aspects of this crisis bilaterally with our colleagues in china , " he said .
" i know from experience that these sorts of cases , where apparently illegal or fraudulent acts lead to problems in safety , are the most difficult for any of us to deal with , " added madelin .
madelin said the eu did not import chinese infant milk powder , and there had been no reports of infant sickness in the bloc from other chinese dairy products .
the scandal 's protagonists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : products of china 's mengniu dairy company have been pulled from starbucks shelves almost one-tenth of liquid milk batches from mengniu dairy and inner mongolia yili industrial group , a beijing olympic games sponsor , contained melamine , a chemical which is banned in food .
several samples of milk from the bright dairy group also had the substance , used in making plastics , china 's general administration of quality supervision , inspection and quarantine found .
chinese media have largely kept quiet about claims that the sanlu group , china 's biggest maker of infant milk powder , concealed the poisonings from the public and senior authorities during the beijing olympics in august .
starbucks pulls questionable milk coffee chain starbucks said its 300-plus cafes in mainland china had pulled milk supplies by mengniu as a precautionary step , but that no employees or customers had fallen ill from the milk .
in singapore , the government food watchdog advised retailers to pull yili yoghurt ice bars from their shelves .
china is vowing to punish errant businesses and officials and there have already been dismissals , detentions and arrests linked to sanlu , 43-percent of which is owned by new zealand diary giant fonterra .
new zealand prime minister helen clark said monday that chinese officials acted last week only after her government pressed beijing .
eu , us target product safety bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and us want to increase awareness of their safety regulations events surrounding the dairy scandal come as eu and us consumer protection officials pledged friday to step up efforts to ensure product safety in china .

the initiative , however , was directed at toys , clothes and electrical products and did not address the milk powder scandal in particular . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the latest count , 6,244 children have become ill , four have died and 158 are suffering " acute kidney failure . "
with foreign consumers warily eyeing china 's manufacturing reputation amid claims of delays and cover-ups , robert madelin , director-general for health and consumer protection at the european commission , told reporters in beijing he expected an account of what went wrong .
" we are trying to establish the facts .
we are discussing all aspects of this crisis bilaterally with our colleagues in china , " he said .
" i know from experience that these sorts of cases , where apparently illegal or fraudulent acts lead to problems in safety , are the most difficult for any of us to deal with , " added madelin .

in singapore , the government food watchdog advised retailers to pull yili yoghurt ice bars from their shelves .
china is vowing to punish errant businesses and officials and there have already been dismissals , detentions and arrests linked to sanlu , 43-percent of which is owned by new zealand diary giant fonterra .

the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm , announced its new plan on thursday , sept .

that british soul singer amy winehouse just managed to celebrate a quarter of a century is impressive .
with her excessive drug and alcohol use , it seems winehouse has an appetite for self-destruction .
the main substance responsible for her downward spiral : cocaine .
winehouse is a particularly extreme poster girl for the danger that seems to be lurking just around the corner for european youths .
although the consumption of heroin as well as synthetic drugs has stagnated or even decreased slightly in some countries , according to the newest statistics from the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction , cocaine has n't become the number one most fashionable drug in just musician and manager circles .

and to counteract negative role models like whinehouse , the commission also wants to get celebrities to support its campaign against drugs .
" today i want to call for a european alliance in the struggle against drugs .
the goal is to sensitize the population , particularly the youth , but also to make businesses and local public authorities aware of the problem , " said barrot .

counter-demonstrators carried signs with slogans including " stop the nazi congress - stop pro koeln " and a few scuffled with the right-wing organisers .
one leftist protester was briefly detained by police , a spokesman said .
some 3,000 police officers from north rhine-westphalia and neighboring states are being deployed in cologne this weekend in the hope that they 'll be able to maintain peace and security . the organizers from pro koeln - a self-described " civil movement " which has , however , been represented on the municipal council for four years now - are among the most vocal opponents to a project to build a new mosque in cologne . the group used the recent green-lighting of the construction plans to rally together other far-right groups in europe who share its view that german and europe are increasingly becoming " islamicized . " government , experts label pro-koeln extremist a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry criticised the event friday , calling pro-koeln an " extremist " group that aimed to undermine good relations between muslims and non-muslims . in chorus , a foreign affairs spokesperson for the federal government said : " in our country there is no place for radical right-wing groups who discriminate against minorities under the guise of a citizens ’ movement . " wolfgang kapust , an expert on the far-right definitively labeled pro-koeln an extremist grouping . " you can see it in the biographies of their leaders .
they 're members of the national democratic party , they 're in the republicans , and they established the very radical german league for people and homeland .
and all of these organizations and parties are characterized by far-right positions , racism , and a strong sense of nationalism . " no koelsch for nazis a wide majority of cologne residents are planning to clearly show that they want nothing to do with the congress .
they 've made hundreds of signs calling for passive resistance to the event .
the city 's barkeepers have declared that they will not be serving any of the local cologne beer , koelsch , to nazis .
and muslim groups in this city where every eighth resident is muslim have planned peaceful gatherings on the site of the planned mosque . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " prevent nazi congress " is scrawled on a cologne monument some onlookers are wondering why the city has n't banned the congress from taking place .
but politician ruprecht polenz , head of a christian-muslim peace initiative , said that 's not so easily done . " they 're clever , " he said .
" they 're not going to show up sporting swastikas .
rather , they 'll use slogans meant to pick up on any resentments .
there are problems with integration .
the question is , how do i handle it ?
do i contribute to the problem by reacting aggressively , or do i try , with dialogue , to get to the bottom of things and get closer to a solution ? " cologne residents to give the cold shoulder cologne 's city government has also had mixed feelings about hosting the congress , and not because of the bill of more than a million euros the city will have to foot once it 's all over .
officials are worried about the bad name that such an event could give a city that prides itself on being an exceptionally tolerant place to live . mayor fritz schramma has called on residents to show the far-right " the cold shoulder . " " shut your windows and doors , lower your shutters , " he said in a statement .
" make it clear to pro koeln and its camarilla : you are not welcome in cologne . " the right-wing extremists have been denied permission to gather in front of the city 's most famous landmark , the cologne cathedral .
instead , the event has been relegated to a city suburb . whether pro koeln 's attempt to unify europe 's nationalists will succeed in cologne remains to be seen .
in the run-up to the event , the organizers boasted that big names on the far-right scene would be in attendance - jean marie le pen , the head of france 's national front , for example , or the head of the austria 's freedom party . le pen , for his part , has already let it be known that pro-koeln was lying .
he said he had never had any plans to come to cologne . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

counter-demonstrators carried signs with slogans including " stop the nazi congress - stop pro koeln " and a few scuffled with the right-wing organisers .
one leftist protester was briefly detained by police , a spokesman said .
some 3,000 police officers from north rhine-westphalia and neighboring states are being deployed in cologne this weekend in the hope that they 'll be able to maintain peace and security . the organizers from pro koeln - a self-described " civil movement " which has , however , been represented on the municipal council for four years now - are among the most vocal opponents to a project to build a new mosque in cologne . the group used the recent green-lighting of the construction plans to rally together other far-right groups in europe who share its view that german and europe are increasingly becoming " islamicized . " government , experts label pro-koeln extremist a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry criticised the event friday , calling pro-koeln an " extremist " group that aimed to undermine good relations between muslims and non-muslims . in chorus , a foreign affairs spokesperson for the federal government said : " in our country there is no place for radical right-wing groups who discriminate against minorities under the guise of a citizens ’ movement . " wolfgang kapust , an expert on the far-right definitively labeled pro-koeln an extremist grouping . " you can see it in the biographies of their leaders .

" cologne residents to give the cold shoulder cologne 's city government has also had mixed feelings about hosting the congress , and not because of the bill of more than a million euros the city will have to foot once it 's all over .
officials are worried about the bad name that such an event could give a city that prides itself on being an exceptionally tolerant place to live . mayor fritz schramma has called on residents to show the far-right " the cold shoulder .

counter-demonstrators carried signs with slogans including " stop the nazi congress - stop pro koeln " and a few scuffled with the right-wing organisers .

but dw-world 's karl zawdzky asks whether it 's enough . british mortgage bank hbos fled into the arms of lloyds tsb ; morgan stanley is casting about for a savior , as is the largest american savings and loan bank , washington mutual .
whereas banks such lehman brothers are being sacrificed to the turmoil on the markets , other institutions like the international insurer american international group -lrb- aig -rrb- are being rescued .
and that begs the question : who will be the next to go down ? the best advice is , save yourself if you can .
because without a doubt , this is the biggest crisis since the crash of 1929 , which plunged the world into a depression , saw countless firms file for bankruptcy , brought massive unemployment and put wind in the sails of those who sought political gain . the financial markets are out of control .
only the mistakes and excesses of the boom are being corrected .
for too long , people thought that the only way would ever be up , that wealth without work was possible . many speculators even managed to accrue wealth in this way .

banks and insurers , whose demise would not just shake up global financial systems but could bring them down like dominos , are being saved . aig , one of the world 's largest insurers with more than 100 million customers in 130 countries is being rescued by state intervention .
the reason : too many americans would have lost their retirement savings had the company collapsed .
aside from this , aig is a big credit insurer for banks around the world .
its demise could have triggered a core meltdown in the global financial system .
in comparison , the collapse of lehman brothers , the third-largest american investment bank , was painful , but survivable . what this means , though , is that while the financial markets are shaky and the stock exchanges are up and down , governments and central banks have n't let themselves become infected with the general sense of insecurity , rather , they 've acted decisively . the financial markets are literally being flooded with dollars , euros , yen , pounds and rubles to keep the systems running .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 19.09.2008 opinion : can a government lifeline alone end the crisis ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governments around the world are stepping up their efforts to rescue financial markets from collapse in the wake of recent market turmoil .
but dw-world 's karl zawdzky asks whether it 's enough . british mortgage bank hbos fled into the arms of lloyds tsb ; morgan stanley is casting about for a savior , as is the largest american savings and loan bank , washington mutual .
whereas banks such lehman brothers are being sacrificed to the turmoil on the markets , other institutions like the international insurer american international group -lrb- aig -rrb- are being rescued .
and that begs the question : who will be the next to go down ? the best advice is , save yourself if you can .
because without a doubt , this is the biggest crisis since the crash of 1929 , which plunged the world into a depression , saw countless firms file for bankruptcy , brought massive unemployment and put wind in the sails of those who sought political gain . the financial markets are out of control .
only the mistakes and excesses of the boom are being corrected .
for too long , people thought that the only way would ever be up , that wealth without work was possible . many speculators even managed to accrue wealth in this way .
the bubble has long since been recognized but the realization that every bubble - whether on the financial market , the property market or the raw commodities market - has to burst sometime .
that 's exactly what 's happening now .
the time in which greed superseded reason is over - for now .
security is what 's needed ; the price of gold is jumping like never before . governments keeping their cool in contrast to the players on the financial markets , governments and central banks are keeping a level head .
banks and insurers , whose demise would not just shake up global financial systems but could bring them down like dominos , are being saved . aig , one of the world 's largest insurers with more than 100 million customers in 130 countries is being rescued by state intervention .
the reason : too many americans would have lost their retirement savings had the company collapsed .
aside from this , aig is a big credit insurer for banks around the world .
its demise could have triggered a core meltdown in the global financial system .
in comparison , the collapse of lehman brothers , the third-largest american investment bank , was painful , but survivable . what this means , though , is that while the financial markets are shaky and the stock exchanges are up and down , governments and central banks have n't let themselves become infected with the general sense of insecurity , rather , they 've acted decisively . the financial markets are literally being flooded with dollars , euros , yen , pounds and rubles to keep the systems running .
us treasury secretary henry paulson and federal reserve chairman ben bernanke are working on a solution which would involve creating a government-sponsored vehicle to relieve american financial companies of their toxic investments . greater regulation needed so the state emerges as the savior .
initial news of the bailout led to a swift recovery .
first , profits were privatized and now , losses are being socialized .
with the banks saved , the whole game can start over again .
that is , unless the government makes stricter regulations for the financial sector part of its rescue program . the sector is always willing to be bailed out , but most unwilling to have regulations imposed on its business dealings .
but without stricter monitoring and regulation , such a bailout will only plant the seeds for the next bubble on the financial markets to grow . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

counter-demonstrators carried signs with slogans including " stop the nazi congress - stop pro koeln " and a few scuffled with the right-wing organisers .
one leftist protester was briefly detained by police , a spokesman said .
some 3,000 police officers from north rhine-westphalia and neighboring states are being deployed in cologne this weekend in the hope that they 'll be able to maintain peace and security . the organizers from pro koeln - a self-described " civil movement " which has , however , been represented on the municipal council for four years now - are among the most vocal opponents to a project to build a new mosque in cologne . the group used the recent green-lighting of the construction plans to rally together other far-right groups in europe who share its view that german and europe are increasingly becoming " islamicized . " government , experts label pro-koeln extremist a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry criticised the event friday , calling pro-koeln an " extremist " group that aimed to undermine good relations between muslims and non-muslims . in chorus , a foreign affairs spokesperson for the federal government said : " in our country there is no place for radical right-wing groups who discriminate against minorities under the guise of a citizens ’ movement . " wolfgang kapust , an expert on the far-right definitively labeled pro-koeln an extremist grouping . " you can see it in the biographies of their leaders .
they 're members of the national democratic party , they 're in the republicans , and they established the very radical german league for people and homeland .
and all of these organizations and parties are characterized by far-right positions , racism , and a strong sense of nationalism . " no koelsch for nazis a wide majority of cologne residents are planning to clearly show that they want nothing to do with the congress .
they 've made hundreds of signs calling for passive resistance to the event .
the city 's barkeepers have declared that they will not be serving any of the local cologne beer , koelsch , to nazis .
and muslim groups in this city where every eighth resident is muslim have planned peaceful gatherings on the site of the planned mosque . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " prevent nazi congress " is scrawled on a cologne monument some onlookers are wondering why the city has n't banned the congress from taking place .
but politician ruprecht polenz , head of a christian-muslim peace initiative , said that 's not so easily done . " they 're clever , " he said .
" they 're not going to show up sporting swastikas .
rather , they 'll use slogans meant to pick up on any resentments .
there are problems with integration .
the question is , how do i handle it ?
do i contribute to the problem by reacting aggressively , or do i try , with dialogue , to get to the bottom of things and get closer to a solution ? " cologne residents to give the cold shoulder cologne 's city government has also had mixed feelings about hosting the congress , and not because of the bill of more than a million euros the city will have to foot once it 's all over .
officials are worried about the bad name that such an event could give a city that prides itself on being an exceptionally tolerant place to live . mayor fritz schramma has called on residents to show the far-right " the cold shoulder . " " shut your windows and doors , lower your shutters , " he said in a statement .
" make it clear to pro koeln and its camarilla : you are not welcome in cologne . " the right-wing extremists have been denied permission to gather in front of the city 's most famous landmark , the cologne cathedral .
instead , the event has been relegated to a city suburb . whether pro koeln 's attempt to unify europe 's nationalists will succeed in cologne remains to be seen .
in the run-up to the event , the organizers boasted that big names on the far-right scene would be in attendance - jean marie le pen , the head of france 's national front , for example , or the head of the austria 's freedom party . le pen , for his part , has already let it be known that pro-koeln was lying .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 19.09.2008 european press review : livni up against great expectations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni hopes to become israel 's first female prime minister in more than three decades israel 's foreign minister tzipi livni is beginning the task of putting together a new government after she was elected leader of the ruling kadima party this week .
dw-world.de sums up press reactions to her win . the luxemburger wort commented friday , sept .
19 , that livni was right to say that she would approach the job of prime minister with " great reverence . "
" further reconciliation with the palestinians , treatment of iran 's increasing nuclear power , and normalization of relations with syria are the three largest geo-strategic challenges facing israel , " the paper said .
" the long-term vitality of this high-tech nation sandwiched between the golan heights and the red sea depends on the clever handling of these dossiers . " the conservative swedish daily svenska dagbladet predicted that these issues will very soon be causing tzipi livni severe headaches should she be sworn in as prime minister .
" current prime minister ehud olmert 's plans for a one-sided withdrawal from the occupied territories were abandoned when hezbollah provoked the second war in lebanon , " the paper said .
" instead of a withdrawal , there was the hamas coup in gaza , which is now blocking progress in the west bank .
and it probably wo n't be long before the terrorists working for the hamas regime put livni 's skills to the hardest of tests . " london 's the independent commented friday on the first task awaiting livni - that of forming a government in just 42 days .
the task will be difficult , the paper said , because it will involve her winning some support from one of the small extremist parties which hold the balance of power in israeli politics .
" in the past , ms livni has hinted that she is not prepared to make random concessions to every interest group ; indeed , she wants to break with the wheeler-dealing tradition of israeli politics and restore public trust in the political process , " the paper wrote .
" she now has to strike a delicate balance between doing that and ensuring she can form an administration which will last long enough to present some serious progress on peace to the israeli electorate at the next election in 18 months time .
that is not long .
israel 's controversial security wall may have stopped the suicide bombs for the time being , but she must not be lulled into thinking she has the luxury of time . " israel 's english-language newspaper , haaretz , commented that all eyes will be on livni as she tries to form a government .
" being clean means more than not accepting envelopes filled with money , " the paper wrote .
" political cleanliness also requires making decisions that are statesmanlike and not opportunistic .
livni has to prove that , in contrast to her predecessor , she chooses the persons best suited to the job to be her cabinet ministers and not those who claim to represent the ' grassroots , ' those who threaten the unity of the ranks and those who threaten to call for new elections . " the berliner zeitung commented on the rise of " frauenpower " - the power of women - in israel , writing : " if livni were the lead singer of a band , it might be called ' tzipi and the expectations . '
western countries are among those who see huge promise in her .
in europe in particular , she 's being treated like a new beacon of light in the middle east peace process . "

dw-world.de sums up press reactions to her win . the luxemburger wort commented friday , sept .
19 , that livni was right to say that she would approach the job of prime minister with " great reverence . "
" further reconciliation with the palestinians , treatment of iran 's increasing nuclear power , and normalization of relations with syria are the three largest geo-strategic challenges facing israel , " the paper said .
" the long-term vitality of this high-tech nation sandwiched between the golan heights and the red sea depends on the clever handling of these dossiers . " the conservative swedish daily svenska dagbladet predicted that these issues will very soon be causing tzipi livni severe headaches should she be sworn in as prime minister .
" current prime minister ehud olmert 's plans for a one-sided withdrawal from the occupied territories were abandoned when hezbollah provoked the second war in lebanon , " the paper said .
" instead of a withdrawal , there was the hamas coup in gaza , which is now blocking progress in the west bank .
and it probably wo n't be long before the terrorists working for the hamas regime put livni 's skills to the hardest of tests . " london 's the independent commented friday on the first task awaiting livni - that of forming a government in just 42 days .
the task will be difficult , the paper said , because it will involve her winning some support from one of the small extremist parties which hold the balance of power in israeli politics .
" in the past , ms livni has hinted that she is not prepared to make random concessions to every interest group ; indeed , she wants to break with the wheeler-dealing tradition of israeli politics and restore public trust in the political process , " the paper wrote .
" she now has to strike a delicate balance between doing that and ensuring she can form an administration which will last long enough to present some serious progress on peace to the israeli electorate at the next election in 18 months time .
that is not long .
israel 's controversial security wall may have stopped the suicide bombs for the time being , but she must not be lulled into thinking she has the luxury of time . " israel 's english-language newspaper , haaretz , commented that all eyes will be on livni as she tries to form a government .
" being clean means more than not accepting envelopes filled with money , " the paper wrote .
" political cleanliness also requires making decisions that are statesmanlike and not opportunistic .
livni has to prove that , in contrast to her predecessor , she chooses the persons best suited to the job to be her cabinet ministers and not those who claim to represent the ' grassroots , ' those who threaten the unity of the ranks and those who threaten to call for new elections . " the berliner zeitung commented on the rise of " frauenpower " - the power of women - in israel , writing : " if livni were the lead singer of a band , it might be called ' tzipi and the expectations . '
western countries are among those who see huge promise in her .
in europe in particular , she 's being treated like a new beacon of light in the middle east peace process . "

dw-world.de sums up press reactions to her win . the luxemburger wort commented friday , sept .
19 , that livni was right to say that she would approach the job of prime minister with " great reverence . "
" further reconciliation with the palestinians , treatment of iran 's increasing nuclear power , and normalization of relations with syria are the three largest geo-strategic challenges facing israel , " the paper said .
" the long-term vitality of this high-tech nation sandwiched between the golan heights and the red sea depends on the clever handling of these dossiers . " the conservative swedish daily svenska dagbladet predicted that these issues will very soon be causing tzipi livni severe headaches should she be sworn in as prime minister .
" current prime minister ehud olmert 's plans for a one-sided withdrawal from the occupied territories were abandoned when hezbollah provoked the second war in lebanon , " the paper said .
" instead of a withdrawal , there was the hamas coup in gaza , which is now blocking progress in the west bank .
and it probably wo n't be long before the terrorists working for the hamas regime put livni 's skills to the hardest of tests . " london 's the independent commented friday on the first task awaiting livni - that of forming a government in just 42 days .
the task will be difficult , the paper said , because it will involve her winning some support from one of the small extremist parties which hold the balance of power in israeli politics .
" in the past , ms livni has hinted that she is not prepared to make random concessions to every interest group ; indeed , she wants to break with the wheeler-dealing tradition of israeli politics and restore public trust in the political process , " the paper wrote .
" she now has to strike a delicate balance between doing that and ensuring she can form an administration which will last long enough to present some serious progress on peace to the israeli electorate at the next election in 18 months time .
that is not long .
israel 's controversial security wall may have stopped the suicide bombs for the time being , but she must not be lulled into thinking she has the luxury of time . " israel 's english-language newspaper , haaretz , commented that all eyes will be on livni as she tries to form a government .

" a substantial offer from the eu is on the table .
we are still in talks with iran to receive a concrete and , we hope , positive response to this offer .
this has until now still been lacking , " he said when asked about the calls for sanctions . germany is one of six world powers attempting to convince iran to halt sensitive nuclear work with an incentives package in exchange for full suspension of uranium enrichment . " should there be no progress on the negotiations track , the german government believes the un security council will become more relevant again and discussions will have to be held whether there should be new resolutions . " this is not the track we are seeking - we want progress from negotiations .
but unfortunately what we have seen until now has not made us optimistic .

" a substantial offer from the eu is on the table .
we are still in talks with iran to receive a concrete and , we hope , positive response to this offer .
this has until now still been lacking , " he said when asked about the calls for sanctions . germany is one of six world powers attempting to convince iran to halt sensitive nuclear work with an incentives package in exchange for full suspension of uranium enrichment . " should there be no progress on the negotiations track , the german government believes the un security council will become more relevant again and discussions will have to be held whether there should be new resolutions . " this is not the track we are seeking - we want progress from negotiations .

iran has insisted its nuclear program is intended solely to create electricity . " the main option here is a fourth un sanctions resolution , but that is a possibility that requires russian , chinese and european cooperation , " a senior us official , who asked not to be named as his comments were sensitive , told reuters news agency . state department spokesman sean mccormack said on thursday there was agreement to move forward with a new sanctions resolution , but it was unclear how far the six political directors would get in hammering out a detailed agreement . tough steps unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would not change course " this is probably a discussion which will be aimed at seeing where each of the individual states are in terms of the timeline of moving forward and the content of a new resolution , " mccormack told reporters . iran experts have said that even if the un security council members plus germany , who are responsible for negotiations with iran , agreed to a new resolution , it would be a weaker version than washington and others wanted . restrictions would likely be placed on iranian companies but not the oil industry or oil products .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 19.09.2008 journalist stefan aust : baader-meinhof film reflects raf reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der baader-meinhof komplex opens across germany on sept .
25 journalist and author stefan aust 's book " der baader-meinhof komplex " has been used as the basis for a soon-to-be-released film of the same name .
he told deutsche welle about why the raf still interests people . both the book and the film chronicle the events of the late ' 60s and ' 70s surrounding the german terror group the red army faction .
aust spoke with dw-radio about the movement 's protagonists , the spirit of the time and the film .
deutsche welle : what do you think of the film , having written the book that the film 's based on ? stefan aust : actually , i think it 's a really great film .
it 's really close to the book , and the book was as close to reality as i could do it .
i think it 's the same spirit that 's in the book that inspired the filmmakers to do it .
it 's a fiction film , but has elements of a documentary as if you had been with this group , with the people , with the terrorists all the time during a whole decade . what are the fictional parts and what are the real parts ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan aust said raf leaders lost their sense of reality the whole thing is as close to reality as you could do in a feature film .
a lot of dialogue is more or less authentic , as i did the research .
some parts are exactly as they were in reality , so for instance we had parts in the courtroom in stammheim , when they were on trial there .
it was word for word .
everything that was said in the courtroom was recorded and written down and we used that for the script .
if you had dialogue , for instance , in prison - the fights between the two women , gudrun ensslin and ulrike meinhof - it was reconstructed out of letters that they sent to one another .
so it 's very close to reality . concerning the book and maybe your own personal research , what was it that got you interested in this topic ? well , i got to know some of the people who went underground , who were members of the red army faction , because i was working for a school magazine in a little town in northern germany together with the younger brother of the editor of the leftist , radical magazine konkret , klaus rainer roehl , who was the husband of ulrike meinhof .
so i knew them when i was still going to school . when i left school , i worked for three years for that magazine and that was the high-time of the students ' movement and radical developments , so i knew ulrike meinhof pretty well , i also knew the lawyer horst mahler pretty well ; he became a member of the red army faction .
when the whole thing started in 1970 i was working for public television in germany , and i had to do a lot of documentaries , short and long and magazine-type stories , about what happened .
so i knew everything quite well . in the beginning of the ' 80s i decided that i wanted to know everything .
so i quit my job , more or less , and spent about three years researching and writing the book . bildunterschrift : stefan aust said he knew the leadership of the raf , but was not friends with them you said you knew these people .
would you have considered yourselves as friends ? that would be a little too much .
i was a very young journalist at that time .
i started when i was just 20 or 21 and they were all a little bit older .
so i knew them , i was rather close to them , we were not friends , and i was always a little bit younger than they were and i was not as radical as they had been . what do you think drove them ?
what was the overarching goal that they were going for ? i think some of them really wanted to change the world .
they felt solidarity with the poor , and unemployed and exploited people of the world , so they fought imperialism .
that 's what they thought .
they fought against the police , they fought against the state and they forgot that they were n't putting bombs in " dead places " ... but on living human beings .
they became very cruel in their attempt to fight the cruelty of the world . do you think they lost sight at some point of the goal that they 'd started with ? they mainly lost their realistic view of reality .
suddenly , when they went underground , they thought and felt that they lived in a police state , a fascist police state .
and when you are living in a fascist police state you are allowed to do anything .
they had to change reality and their view on reality first in order to be able to do all these terrible things . even 30 years later there 's still a fascination with the raf and still this swirl of controversy because they began with such idealistic views .
what do you think makes the raf so intriguing for people even today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der baader-meinhof komplex film is as close to reality as possible , aust said i think it was the biggest crisis that post-war germany had had .
it was an attack on the state , on the government , on the authorities of the government and on the representatives of the government .
they killed important people .
it was really a threat to the stability of this country , and actually it was the only threat after the war that this country ever had from the inside . when you think about the german autumn in ' 77 , which was 31 years ago , it was really a state of crisis we were in .
in the collective memory of the germans it 's a little bit like september 11 for the united states . what do you think the majority opinion about the raf is right now ?
that they were terrorists or some kind of revolutionary heroes ? i think it 's both .
we tried in this film to show what they really were .
they were a group of people from a certain age , from a certain society , for a certain decade - the decade of revolution all over the world - and they felt themselves being revolutionary .
in the end it was a group of people killing other people and in the end killing themselves .
so i think most people see them more as terrorists than as revolutionary heroes , which sometimes happened in the ' 70s . is that the message that you want people watching the film to come away with ? yes , to take the group down to earth .
to make them human and to show what they really did .
because terrorism is terror , and people sometimes forget that . interview : eric heath -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 journalist and author stefan aust 's book " der baader-meinhof komplex " has been used as the basis for a soon-to-be-released film of the same name .
he told deutsche welle about why the raf still interests people . both the book and the film chronicle the events of the late ' 60s and ' 70s surrounding the german terror group the red army faction .
aust spoke with dw-radio about the movement 's protagonists , the spirit of the time and the film .
deutsche welle : what do you think of the film , having written the book that the film 's based on ? stefan aust : actually , i think it 's a really great film .
it 's really close to the book , and the book was as close to reality as i could do it .
i think it 's the same spirit that 's in the book that inspired the filmmakers to do it .
it 's a fiction film , but has elements of a documentary as if you had been with this group , with the people , with the terrorists all the time during a whole decade . what are the fictional parts and what are the real parts ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan aust said raf leaders lost their sense of reality the whole thing is as close to reality as you could do in a feature film .
a lot of dialogue is more or less authentic , as i did the research .
some parts are exactly as they were in reality , so for instance we had parts in the courtroom in stammheim , when they were on trial there .
it was word for word .
everything that was said in the courtroom was recorded and written down and we used that for the script .
if you had dialogue , for instance , in prison - the fights between the two women , gudrun ensslin and ulrike meinhof - it was reconstructed out of letters that they sent to one another .
so it 's very close to reality . concerning the book and maybe your own personal research , what was it that got you interested in this topic ? well , i got to know some of the people who went underground , who were members of the red army faction , because i was working for a school magazine in a little town in northern germany together with the younger brother of the editor of the leftist , radical magazine konkret , klaus rainer roehl , who was the husband of ulrike meinhof .
so i knew them when i was still going to school . when i left school , i worked for three years for that magazine and that was the high-time of the students ' movement and radical developments , so i knew ulrike meinhof pretty well , i also knew the lawyer horst mahler pretty well ; he became a member of the red army faction .
when the whole thing started in 1970 i was working for public television in germany , and i had to do a lot of documentaries , short and long and magazine-type stories , about what happened .
so i knew everything quite well . in the beginning of the ' 80s i decided that i wanted to know everything .
so i quit my job , more or less , and spent about three years researching and writing the book . bildunterschrift : stefan aust said he knew the leadership of the raf , but was not friends with them you said you knew these people .
would you have considered yourselves as friends ? that would be a little too much .
i was a very young journalist at that time .
i started when i was just 20 or 21 and they were all a little bit older .
so i knew them , i was rather close to them , we were not friends , and i was always a little bit younger than they were and i was not as radical as they had been . what do you think drove them ?
what was the overarching goal that they were going for ? i think some of them really wanted to change the world .
they felt solidarity with the poor , and unemployed and exploited people of the world , so they fought imperialism .
that 's what they thought .
they fought against the police , they fought against the state and they forgot that they were n't putting bombs in " dead places " ... but on living human beings .
they became very cruel in their attempt to fight the cruelty of the world . do you think they lost sight at some point of the goal that they 'd started with ? they mainly lost their realistic view of reality .
suddenly , when they went underground , they thought and felt that they lived in a police state , a fascist police state .
and when you are living in a fascist police state you are allowed to do anything .
they had to change reality and their view on reality first in order to be able to do all these terrible things . even 30 years later there 's still a fascination with the raf and still this swirl of controversy because they began with such idealistic views .
what do you think makes the raf so intriguing for people even today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der baader-meinhof komplex film is as close to reality as possible , aust said i think it was the biggest crisis that post-war germany had had .
it was an attack on the state , on the government , on the authorities of the government and on the representatives of the government .
they killed important people .
it was really a threat to the stability of this country , and actually it was the only threat after the war that this country ever had from the inside . when you think about the german autumn in ' 77 , which was 31 years ago , it was really a state of crisis we were in .
in the collective memory of the germans it 's a little bit like september 11 for the united states . what do you think the majority opinion about the raf is right now ?
that they were terrorists or some kind of revolutionary heroes ? i think it 's both .
we tried in this film to show what they really were .
they were a group of people from a certain age , from a certain society , for a certain decade - the decade of revolution all over the world - and they felt themselves being revolutionary .

25 journalist and author stefan aust 's book " der baader-meinhof komplex " has been used as the basis for a soon-to-be-released film of the same name .
he told deutsche welle about why the raf still interests people . both the book and the film chronicle the events of the late ' 60s and ' 70s surrounding the german terror group the red army faction .
aust spoke with dw-radio about the movement 's protagonists , the spirit of the time and the film .
deutsche welle : what do you think of the film , having written the book that the film 's based on ? stefan aust : actually , i think it 's a really great film .
it 's really close to the book , and the book was as close to reality as i could do it .
i think it 's the same spirit that 's in the book that inspired the filmmakers to do it .
it 's a fiction film , but has elements of a documentary as if you had been with this group , with the people , with the terrorists all the time during a whole decade . what are the fictional parts and what are the real parts ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan aust said raf leaders lost their sense of reality the whole thing is as close to reality as you could do in a feature film .
a lot of dialogue is more or less authentic , as i did the research .
some parts are exactly as they were in reality , so for instance we had parts in the courtroom in stammheim , when they were on trial there .
it was word for word .
everything that was said in the courtroom was recorded and written down and we used that for the script .
if you had dialogue , for instance , in prison - the fights between the two women , gudrun ensslin and ulrike meinhof - it was reconstructed out of letters that they sent to one another .
so it 's very close to reality . concerning the book and maybe your own personal research , what was it that got you interested in this topic ? well , i got to know some of the people who went underground , who were members of the red army faction , because i was working for a school magazine in a little town in northern germany together with the younger brother of the editor of the leftist , radical magazine konkret , klaus rainer roehl , who was the husband of ulrike meinhof .
so i knew them when i was still going to school . when i left school , i worked for three years for that magazine and that was the high-time of the students ' movement and radical developments , so i knew ulrike meinhof pretty well , i also knew the lawyer horst mahler pretty well ; he became a member of the red army faction .
when the whole thing started in 1970 i was working for public television in germany , and i had to do a lot of documentaries , short and long and magazine-type stories , about what happened .
so i knew everything quite well . in the beginning of the ' 80s i decided that i wanted to know everything .
so i quit my job , more or less , and spent about three years researching and writing the book . bildunterschrift : stefan aust said he knew the leadership of the raf , but was not friends with them you said you knew these people .
would you have considered yourselves as friends ? that would be a little too much .
i was a very young journalist at that time .
i started when i was just 20 or 21 and they were all a little bit older .
so i knew them , i was rather close to them , we were not friends , and i was always a little bit younger than they were and i was not as radical as they had been . what do you think drove them ?
what was the overarching goal that they were going for ? i think some of them really wanted to change the world .
they felt solidarity with the poor , and unemployed and exploited people of the world , so they fought imperialism .
that 's what they thought .
they fought against the police , they fought against the state and they forgot that they were n't putting bombs in " dead places " ... but on living human beings .
they became very cruel in their attempt to fight the cruelty of the world . do you think they lost sight at some point of the goal that they 'd started with ? they mainly lost their realistic view of reality .
suddenly , when they went underground , they thought and felt that they lived in a police state , a fascist police state .
and when you are living in a fascist police state you are allowed to do anything .
they had to change reality and their view on reality first in order to be able to do all these terrible things . even 30 years later there 's still a fascination with the raf and still this swirl of controversy because they began with such idealistic views .
what do you think makes the raf so intriguing for people even today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der baader-meinhof komplex film is as close to reality as possible , aust said i think it was the biggest crisis that post-war germany had had .
it was an attack on the state , on the government , on the authorities of the government and on the representatives of the government .
they killed important people .
it was really a threat to the stability of this country , and actually it was the only threat after the war that this country ever had from the inside . when you think about the german autumn in ' 77 , which was 31 years ago , it was really a state of crisis we were in .
in the collective memory of the germans it 's a little bit like september 11 for the united states . what do you think the majority opinion about the raf is right now ?
that they were terrorists or some kind of revolutionary heroes ? i think it 's both .
we tried in this film to show what they really were .
they were a group of people from a certain age , from a certain society , for a certain decade - the decade of revolution all over the world - and they felt themselves being revolutionary .
in the end it was a group of people killing other people and in the end killing themselves .
so i think most people see them more as terrorists than as revolutionary heroes , which sometimes happened in the ' 70s . is that the message that you want people watching the film to come away with ? yes , to take the group down to earth .
to make them human and to show what they really did .
because terrorism is terror , and people sometimes forget that . interview : eric heath -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 , russia said that " a new-generation bulava ballistic missile was successfully fired from the white sea to the kura testing site in kamchatka " in russia 's far eastern region .
with a range of 8,000 kilometers -lrb- 5,000 miles -rrb- , the bulava can be equipped with up to 10 individually targeted nuclear warheads .
the missile test-fire comes during a time when us-russia relations have hit a post cold war low after moscow 's recent military intervention in georgia .
washington harshly criticized the military move .
russia , too , has recently expressed anger over us plans to establish a powerful missile-tracking reader in the czech republic as well as interceptor missiles in poland .
russia doubts us intentions according to analysts , russia is now beefing up its missile systems to counter the planned us shield in the region which it views as a tactical move by the us to deter russia 's nuclear activity .
washington , however , maintains that the shield is too small to defend against russia and is instead meant to protect against " rogues states " such as iran .
the latest test launch also comes only three weeks after russia test-fired the intercontinental topol rs-12m missile . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 , 2009 jewish-owned art seized by the nazis from 1933 onwards is featured at a new exhibition at the jewish museum in berlin .
meanwhile , germany 's culture minister has called for the " fair " return of jewish art . opening on friday , sept .
19 , the exhibition consists of 15 artworks along with documents describing their seizure or forced sale , later changes in ownership and ultimate restitution .
valuable porcelain and book collections from dresden 's intellectual von klemperer family are included in the show .
the gestapo confiscated the family 's collection in 1938 , placing it in dresden 's municipal art collection and the saxony state library . before the second world war , nazi germany made it illegal for jews to own art treasures , forcing them to sell them .
later during the holocaust , jewish property throughout eastern europe was seized by nazi officials .
exhibition organizers said thursday that many of the confiscated paintings and other treasures had still not been recovered by the lawful heirs of the original owners .
taking responsibility for stolen art michael blumenthal , director of the museum , charged that german art collectors , dealers and museums had all profited by being able to purchase art at reduced prices .
he praised germany 's current efforts to give back the art , but said he was disappointed that heirs had no absolute legal right to reclaim the artworks .
at a ceremony on thursday evening , minister of culture bernd neumann called for " fair and just " solutions in returning the work stolen by nazi officials .
" more than 60 years after the war 's end , germany is unrestrained in its moral responsibility for the restitution of art looted by the nazis , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 , russia said that " a new-generation bulava ballistic missile was successfully fired from the white sea to the kura testing site in kamchatka " in russia 's far eastern region .
with a range of 8,000 kilometers -lrb- 5,000 miles -rrb- , the bulava can be equipped with up to 10 individually targeted nuclear warheads .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 19.09.2008 european press review : livni up against great expectations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni hopes to become israel 's first female prime minister in more than three decades israel 's foreign minister tzipi livni is beginning the task of putting together a new government after she was elected leader of the ruling kadima party this week .
dw-world.de sums up press reactions to her win . the luxemburger wort commented friday , sept .
19 , that livni was right to say that she would approach the job of prime minister with " great reverence . "
" further reconciliation with the palestinians , treatment of iran 's increasing nuclear power , and normalization of relations with syria are the three largest geo-strategic challenges facing israel , " the paper said .
" the long-term vitality of this high-tech nation sandwiched between the golan heights and the red sea depends on the clever handling of these dossiers . " the conservative swedish daily svenska dagbladet predicted that these issues will very soon be causing tzipi livni severe headaches should she be sworn in as prime minister .
" current prime minister ehud olmert 's plans for a one-sided withdrawal from the occupied territories were abandoned when hezbollah provoked the second war in lebanon , " the paper said .
" instead of a withdrawal , there was the hamas coup in gaza , which is now blocking progress in the west bank .
and it probably wo n't be long before the terrorists working for the hamas regime put livni 's skills to the hardest of tests . " london 's the independent commented friday on the first task awaiting livni - that of forming a government in just 42 days .
the task will be difficult , the paper said , because it will involve her winning some support from one of the small extremist parties which hold the balance of power in israeli politics .
" in the past , ms livni has hinted that she is not prepared to make random concessions to every interest group ; indeed , she wants to break with the wheeler-dealing tradition of israeli politics and restore public trust in the political process , " the paper wrote .
" she now has to strike a delicate balance between doing that and ensuring she can form an administration which will last long enough to present some serious progress on peace to the israeli electorate at the next election in 18 months time .
that is not long .
israel 's controversial security wall may have stopped the suicide bombs for the time being , but she must not be lulled into thinking she has the luxury of time . " israel 's english-language newspaper , haaretz , commented that all eyes will be on livni as she tries to form a government .
" being clean means more than not accepting envelopes filled with money , " the paper wrote .
" political cleanliness also requires making decisions that are statesmanlike and not opportunistic .
livni has to prove that , in contrast to her predecessor , she chooses the persons best suited to the job to be her cabinet ministers and not those who claim to represent the ' grassroots , ' those who threaten the unity of the ranks and those who threaten to call for new elections . " the berliner zeitung commented on the rise of " frauenpower " - the power of women - in israel , writing : " if livni were the lead singer of a band , it might be called ' tzipi and the expectations . '
western countries are among those who see huge promise in her .
in europe in particular , she 's being treated like a new beacon of light in the middle east peace process . "
despite the difficulties facing livni , the paper said that with her victory , the chance is now greater that those who want a fair peace deal will have greater say . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a substantial offer from the eu is on the table .
we are still in talks with iran to receive a concrete and , we hope , positive response to this offer .
this has until now still been lacking , " he said when asked about the calls for sanctions . germany is one of six world powers attempting to convince iran to halt sensitive nuclear work with an incentives package in exchange for full suspension of uranium enrichment . " should there be no progress on the negotiations track , the german government believes the un security council will become more relevant again and discussions will have to be held whether there should be new resolutions . " this is not the track we are seeking - we want progress from negotiations .
but unfortunately what we have seen until now has not made us optimistic . " ploetner said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had stressed the importance of settling the issue quickly during talks monday with his iranian counterpart manouchehr mottaki . officials from the six nations , which also includes russia , china and the uk , are scheduled to meet friday , sept .
19 , before the un general assembly convenes in new york .
foreign ministers are expected to convene over iran during the annual meeting . unity required to approve new sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains unlikely that the security council will unite behind the french sanctions resolution european union foreign policy chief javier solana said he believes russia and china are " quite worried " about iran 's nuclear program and that a report presented monday by the iaea nuclear watchdog " is n't good for iran . " but he added that he did n't think moscow and beijing would completely turn around and support the west 's call for more sanctions . washington and european capitals have accused tehran of enriching uranium in order to produce atomic weapons .
iran has insisted its nuclear program is intended solely to create electricity . " the main option here is a fourth un sanctions resolution , but that is a possibility that requires russian , chinese and european cooperation , " a senior us official , who asked not to be named as his comments were sensitive , told reuters news agency . state department spokesman sean mccormack said on thursday there was agreement to move forward with a new sanctions resolution , but it was unclear how far the six political directors would get in hammering out a detailed agreement . tough steps unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would not change course " this is probably a discussion which will be aimed at seeing where each of the individual states are in terms of the timeline of moving forward and the content of a new resolution , " mccormack told reporters . iran experts have said that even if the un security council members plus germany , who are responsible for negotiations with iran , agreed to a new resolution , it would be a weaker version than washington and others wanted . restrictions would likely be placed on iranian companies but not the oil industry or oil products . " my guess is that the sanctions will be watered down and there is every reason for the russians to drag this out , " gary samore of the council on foreign relations told reuters . ahead of friday 's meeting , iran 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , again said tehran would not stop its enrichment program regardless of whether the un decides to impose a new round of sanctions . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de sums up press reactions to her win . the luxemburger wort commented friday , sept .
19 , that livni was right to say that she would approach the job of prime minister with " great reverence . "
" further reconciliation with the palestinians , treatment of iran 's increasing nuclear power , and normalization of relations with syria are the three largest geo-strategic challenges facing israel , " the paper said .
" the long-term vitality of this high-tech nation sandwiched between the golan heights and the red sea depends on the clever handling of these dossiers . " the conservative swedish daily svenska dagbladet predicted that these issues will very soon be causing tzipi livni severe headaches should she be sworn in as prime minister .
" current prime minister ehud olmert 's plans for a one-sided withdrawal from the occupied territories were abandoned when hezbollah provoked the second war in lebanon , " the paper said .
" instead of a withdrawal , there was the hamas coup in gaza , which is now blocking progress in the west bank .
and it probably wo n't be long before the terrorists working for the hamas regime put livni 's skills to the hardest of tests . " london 's the independent commented friday on the first task awaiting livni - that of forming a government in just 42 days .
the task will be difficult , the paper said , because it will involve her winning some support from one of the small extremist parties which hold the balance of power in israeli politics .
" in the past , ms livni has hinted that she is not prepared to make random concessions to every interest group ; indeed , she wants to break with the wheeler-dealing tradition of israeli politics and restore public trust in the political process , " the paper wrote .
" she now has to strike a delicate balance between doing that and ensuring she can form an administration which will last long enough to present some serious progress on peace to the israeli electorate at the next election in 18 months time .
that is not long .
israel 's controversial security wall may have stopped the suicide bombs for the time being , but she must not be lulled into thinking she has the luxury of time . " israel 's english-language newspaper , haaretz , commented that all eyes will be on livni as she tries to form a government .
" being clean means more than not accepting envelopes filled with money , " the paper wrote .
" political cleanliness also requires making decisions that are statesmanlike and not opportunistic .
livni has to prove that , in contrast to her predecessor , she chooses the persons best suited to the job to be her cabinet ministers and not those who claim to represent the ' grassroots , ' those who threaten the unity of the ranks and those who threaten to call for new elections . " the berliner zeitung commented on the rise of " frauenpower " - the power of women - in israel , writing : " if livni were the lead singer of a band , it might be called ' tzipi and the expectations . '
western countries are among those who see huge promise in her .
in europe in particular , she 's being treated like a new beacon of light in the middle east peace process . "

israel 's controversial security wall may have stopped the suicide bombs for the time being , but she must not be lulled into thinking she has the luxury of time . " israel 's english-language newspaper , haaretz , commented that all eyes will be on livni as she tries to form a government .
" being clean means more than not accepting envelopes filled with money , " the paper wrote .
" political cleanliness also requires making decisions that are statesmanlike and not opportunistic .
livni has to prove that , in contrast to her predecessor , she chooses the persons best suited to the job to be her cabinet ministers and not those who claim to represent the ' grassroots , ' those who threaten the unity of the ranks and those who threaten to call for new elections . " the berliner zeitung commented on the rise of " frauenpower " - the power of women - in israel , writing : " if livni were the lead singer of a band , it might be called ' tzipi and the expectations . '
western countries are among those who see huge promise in her .
in europe in particular , she 's being treated like a new beacon of light in the middle east peace process . "
despite the difficulties facing livni , the paper said that with her victory , the chance is now greater that those who want a fair peace deal will have greater say . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 19.09.2008 journalist stefan aust : baader-meinhof film reflects raf reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der baader-meinhof komplex opens across germany on sept .
25 journalist and author stefan aust 's book " der baader-meinhof komplex " has been used as the basis for a soon-to-be-released film of the same name .
he told deutsche welle about why the raf still interests people . both the book and the film chronicle the events of the late ' 60s and ' 70s surrounding the german terror group the red army faction .
aust spoke with dw-radio about the movement 's protagonists , the spirit of the time and the film .
deutsche welle : what do you think of the film , having written the book that the film 's based on ? stefan aust : actually , i think it 's a really great film .
it 's really close to the book , and the book was as close to reality as i could do it .
i think it 's the same spirit that 's in the book that inspired the filmmakers to do it .
it 's a fiction film , but has elements of a documentary as if you had been with this group , with the people , with the terrorists all the time during a whole decade . what are the fictional parts and what are the real parts ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan aust said raf leaders lost their sense of reality the whole thing is as close to reality as you could do in a feature film .
a lot of dialogue is more or less authentic , as i did the research .
some parts are exactly as they were in reality , so for instance we had parts in the courtroom in stammheim , when they were on trial there .
it was word for word .
everything that was said in the courtroom was recorded and written down and we used that for the script .
if you had dialogue , for instance , in prison - the fights between the two women , gudrun ensslin and ulrike meinhof - it was reconstructed out of letters that they sent to one another .
so it 's very close to reality . concerning the book and maybe your own personal research , what was it that got you interested in this topic ? well , i got to know some of the people who went underground , who were members of the red army faction , because i was working for a school magazine in a little town in northern germany together with the younger brother of the editor of the leftist , radical magazine konkret , klaus rainer roehl , who was the husband of ulrike meinhof .
so i knew them when i was still going to school . when i left school , i worked for three years for that magazine and that was the high-time of the students ' movement and radical developments , so i knew ulrike meinhof pretty well , i also knew the lawyer horst mahler pretty well ; he became a member of the red army faction .
when the whole thing started in 1970 i was working for public television in germany , and i had to do a lot of documentaries , short and long and magazine-type stories , about what happened .
so i knew everything quite well . in the beginning of the ' 80s i decided that i wanted to know everything .
so i quit my job , more or less , and spent about three years researching and writing the book . bildunterschrift : stefan aust said he knew the leadership of the raf , but was not friends with them you said you knew these people .
would you have considered yourselves as friends ? that would be a little too much .
i was a very young journalist at that time .
i started when i was just 20 or 21 and they were all a little bit older .
so i knew them , i was rather close to them , we were not friends , and i was always a little bit younger than they were and i was not as radical as they had been . what do you think drove them ?
what was the overarching goal that they were going for ? i think some of them really wanted to change the world .
they felt solidarity with the poor , and unemployed and exploited people of the world , so they fought imperialism .
that 's what they thought .
they fought against the police , they fought against the state and they forgot that they were n't putting bombs in " dead places " ... but on living human beings .
they became very cruel in their attempt to fight the cruelty of the world . do you think they lost sight at some point of the goal that they 'd started with ? they mainly lost their realistic view of reality .
suddenly , when they went underground , they thought and felt that they lived in a police state , a fascist police state .
and when you are living in a fascist police state you are allowed to do anything .
they had to change reality and their view on reality first in order to be able to do all these terrible things . even 30 years later there 's still a fascination with the raf and still this swirl of controversy because they began with such idealistic views .
what do you think makes the raf so intriguing for people even today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der baader-meinhof komplex film is as close to reality as possible , aust said i think it was the biggest crisis that post-war germany had had .
it was an attack on the state , on the government , on the authorities of the government and on the representatives of the government .
they killed important people .
it was really a threat to the stability of this country , and actually it was the only threat after the war that this country ever had from the inside . when you think about the german autumn in ' 77 , which was 31 years ago , it was really a state of crisis we were in .
in the collective memory of the germans it 's a little bit like september 11 for the united states . what do you think the majority opinion about the raf is right now ?
that they were terrorists or some kind of revolutionary heroes ? i think it 's both .
we tried in this film to show what they really were .
they were a group of people from a certain age , from a certain society , for a certain decade - the decade of revolution all over the world - and they felt themselves being revolutionary .
in the end it was a group of people killing other people and in the end killing themselves .
so i think most people see them more as terrorists than as revolutionary heroes , which sometimes happened in the ' 70s . is that the message that you want people watching the film to come away with ? yes , to take the group down to earth .
to make them human and to show what they really did .
because terrorism is terror , and people sometimes forget that . interview : eric heath -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 journalist and author stefan aust 's book " der baader-meinhof komplex " has been used as the basis for a soon-to-be-released film of the same name .
he told deutsche welle about why the raf still interests people . both the book and the film chronicle the events of the late ' 60s and ' 70s surrounding the german terror group the red army faction .
aust spoke with dw-radio about the movement 's protagonists , the spirit of the time and the film .
deutsche welle : what do you think of the film , having written the book that the film 's based on ? stefan aust : actually , i think it 's a really great film .
it 's really close to the book , and the book was as close to reality as i could do it .
i think it 's the same spirit that 's in the book that inspired the filmmakers to do it .
it 's a fiction film , but has elements of a documentary as if you had been with this group , with the people , with the terrorists all the time during a whole decade . what are the fictional parts and what are the real parts ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan aust said raf leaders lost their sense of reality the whole thing is as close to reality as you could do in a feature film .
a lot of dialogue is more or less authentic , as i did the research .
some parts are exactly as they were in reality , so for instance we had parts in the courtroom in stammheim , when they were on trial there .
it was word for word .
everything that was said in the courtroom was recorded and written down and we used that for the script .
if you had dialogue , for instance , in prison - the fights between the two women , gudrun ensslin and ulrike meinhof - it was reconstructed out of letters that they sent to one another .
so it 's very close to reality . concerning the book and maybe your own personal research , what was it that got you interested in this topic ? well , i got to know some of the people who went underground , who were members of the red army faction , because i was working for a school magazine in a little town in northern germany together with the younger brother of the editor of the leftist , radical magazine konkret , klaus rainer roehl , who was the husband of ulrike meinhof .
so i knew them when i was still going to school . when i left school , i worked for three years for that magazine and that was the high-time of the students ' movement and radical developments , so i knew ulrike meinhof pretty well , i also knew the lawyer horst mahler pretty well ; he became a member of the red army faction .
when the whole thing started in 1970 i was working for public television in germany , and i had to do a lot of documentaries , short and long and magazine-type stories , about what happened .
so i knew everything quite well . in the beginning of the ' 80s i decided that i wanted to know everything .
so i quit my job , more or less , and spent about three years researching and writing the book . bildunterschrift : stefan aust said he knew the leadership of the raf , but was not friends with them you said you knew these people .
would you have considered yourselves as friends ? that would be a little too much .
i was a very young journalist at that time .
i started when i was just 20 or 21 and they were all a little bit older .
so i knew them , i was rather close to them , we were not friends , and i was always a little bit younger than they were and i was not as radical as they had been . what do you think drove them ?
what was the overarching goal that they were going for ? i think some of them really wanted to change the world .
they felt solidarity with the poor , and unemployed and exploited people of the world , so they fought imperialism .
that 's what they thought .
they fought against the police , they fought against the state and they forgot that they were n't putting bombs in " dead places " ... but on living human beings .
they became very cruel in their attempt to fight the cruelty of the world . do you think they lost sight at some point of the goal that they 'd started with ? they mainly lost their realistic view of reality .
suddenly , when they went underground , they thought and felt that they lived in a police state , a fascist police state .
and when you are living in a fascist police state you are allowed to do anything .
they had to change reality and their view on reality first in order to be able to do all these terrible things . even 30 years later there 's still a fascination with the raf and still this swirl of controversy because they began with such idealistic views .
what do you think makes the raf so intriguing for people even today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der baader-meinhof komplex film is as close to reality as possible , aust said i think it was the biggest crisis that post-war germany had had .
it was an attack on the state , on the government , on the authorities of the government and on the representatives of the government .
they killed important people .
it was really a threat to the stability of this country , and actually it was the only threat after the war that this country ever had from the inside . when you think about the german autumn in ' 77 , which was 31 years ago , it was really a state of crisis we were in .
in the collective memory of the germans it 's a little bit like september 11 for the united states . what do you think the majority opinion about the raf is right now ?
that they were terrorists or some kind of revolutionary heroes ? i think it 's both .
we tried in this film to show what they really were .
they were a group of people from a certain age , from a certain society , for a certain decade - the decade of revolution all over the world - and they felt themselves being revolutionary .
in the end it was a group of people killing other people and in the end killing themselves .
so i think most people see them more as terrorists than as revolutionary heroes , which sometimes happened in the ' 70s . is that the message that you want people watching the film to come away with ? yes , to take the group down to earth .
to make them human and to show what they really did .
because terrorism is terror , and people sometimes forget that . interview : eric heath -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

counter-demonstrators carried signs with slogans including " stop the nazi congress - stop pro koeln " and a few scuffled with the right-wing organisers .
one leftist protester was briefly detained by police , a spokesman said .
some 3,000 police officers from north rhine-westphalia and neighboring states are being deployed in cologne this weekend in the hope that they 'll be able to maintain peace and security . the organizers from pro koeln - a self-described " civil movement " which has , however , been represented on the municipal council for four years now - are among the most vocal opponents to a project to build a new mosque in cologne . the group used the recent green-lighting of the construction plans to rally together other far-right groups in europe who share its view that german and europe are increasingly becoming " islamicized . " government , experts label pro-koeln extremist a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry criticised the event friday , calling pro-koeln an " extremist " group that aimed to undermine good relations between muslims and non-muslims . in chorus , a foreign affairs spokesperson for the federal government said : " in our country there is no place for radical right-wing groups who discriminate against minorities under the guise of a citizens ’ movement . " wolfgang kapust , an expert on the far-right definitively labeled pro-koeln an extremist grouping . " you can see it in the biographies of their leaders .
they 're members of the national democratic party , they 're in the republicans , and they established the very radical german league for people and homeland .
and all of these organizations and parties are characterized by far-right positions , racism , and a strong sense of nationalism . " no koelsch for nazis a wide majority of cologne residents are planning to clearly show that they want nothing to do with the congress .
they 've made hundreds of signs calling for passive resistance to the event .
the city 's barkeepers have declared that they will not be serving any of the local cologne beer , koelsch , to nazis .
and muslim groups in this city where every eighth resident is muslim have planned peaceful gatherings on the site of the planned mosque . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " prevent nazi congress " is scrawled on a cologne monument some onlookers are wondering why the city has n't banned the congress from taking place .
but politician ruprecht polenz , head of a christian-muslim peace initiative , said that 's not so easily done . " they 're clever , " he said .
" they 're not going to show up sporting swastikas .
rather , they 'll use slogans meant to pick up on any resentments .
there are problems with integration .
the question is , how do i handle it ?
do i contribute to the problem by reacting aggressively , or do i try , with dialogue , to get to the bottom of things and get closer to a solution ? " cologne residents to give the cold shoulder cologne 's city government has also had mixed feelings about hosting the congress , and not because of the bill of more than a million euros the city will have to foot once it 's all over .
officials are worried about the bad name that such an event could give a city that prides itself on being an exceptionally tolerant place to live . mayor fritz schramma has called on residents to show the far-right " the cold shoulder . " " shut your windows and doors , lower your shutters , " he said in a statement .
" make it clear to pro koeln and its camarilla : you are not welcome in cologne . " the right-wing extremists have been denied permission to gather in front of the city 's most famous landmark , the cologne cathedral .
instead , the event has been relegated to a city suburb . whether pro koeln 's attempt to unify europe 's nationalists will succeed in cologne remains to be seen .
in the run-up to the event , the organizers boasted that big names on the far-right scene would be in attendance - jean marie le pen , the head of france 's national front , for example , or the head of the austria 's freedom party . le pen , for his part , has already let it be known that pro-koeln was lying .

" a substantial offer from the eu is on the table .
we are still in talks with iran to receive a concrete and , we hope , positive response to this offer .
this has until now still been lacking , " he said when asked about the calls for sanctions . germany is one of six world powers attempting to convince iran to halt sensitive nuclear work with an incentives package in exchange for full suspension of uranium enrichment . " should there be no progress on the negotiations track , the german government believes the un security council will become more relevant again and discussions will have to be held whether there should be new resolutions . " this is not the track we are seeking - we want progress from negotiations .
but unfortunately what we have seen until now has not made us optimistic . " ploetner said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had stressed the importance of settling the issue quickly during talks monday with his iranian counterpart manouchehr mottaki . officials from the six nations , which also includes russia , china and the uk , are scheduled to meet friday , sept .
19 , before the un general assembly convenes in new york .
foreign ministers are expected to convene over iran during the annual meeting . unity required to approve new sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains unlikely that the security council will unite behind the french sanctions resolution european union foreign policy chief javier solana said he believes russia and china are " quite worried " about iran 's nuclear program and that a report presented monday by the iaea nuclear watchdog " is n't good for iran . " but he added that he did n't think moscow and beijing would completely turn around and support the west 's call for more sanctions . washington and european capitals have accused tehran of enriching uranium in order to produce atomic weapons .
iran has insisted its nuclear program is intended solely to create electricity . " the main option here is a fourth un sanctions resolution , but that is a possibility that requires russian , chinese and european cooperation , " a senior us official , who asked not to be named as his comments were sensitive , told reuters news agency . state department spokesman sean mccormack said on thursday there was agreement to move forward with a new sanctions resolution , but it was unclear how far the six political directors would get in hammering out a detailed agreement . tough steps unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would not change course " this is probably a discussion which will be aimed at seeing where each of the individual states are in terms of the timeline of moving forward and the content of a new resolution , " mccormack told reporters . iran experts have said that even if the un security council members plus germany , who are responsible for negotiations with iran , agreed to a new resolution , it would be a weaker version than washington and others wanted . restrictions would likely be placed on iranian companies but not the oil industry or oil products . " my guess is that the sanctions will be watered down and there is every reason for the russians to drag this out , " gary samore of the council on foreign relations told reuters . ahead of friday 's meeting , iran 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , again said tehran would not stop its enrichment program regardless of whether the un decides to impose a new round of sanctions . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a substantial offer from the eu is on the table .
we are still in talks with iran to receive a concrete and , we hope , positive response to this offer .
this has until now still been lacking , " he said when asked about the calls for sanctions . germany is one of six world powers attempting to convince iran to halt sensitive nuclear work with an incentives package in exchange for full suspension of uranium enrichment .

counter-demonstrators carried signs with slogans including " stop the nazi congress - stop pro koeln " and a few scuffled with the right-wing organisers .
one leftist protester was briefly detained by police , a spokesman said .
some 3,000 police officers from north rhine-westphalia and neighboring states are being deployed in cologne this weekend in the hope that they 'll be able to maintain peace and security . the organizers from pro koeln - a self-described " civil movement " which has , however , been represented on the municipal council for four years now - are among the most vocal opponents to a project to build a new mosque in cologne . the group used the recent green-lighting of the construction plans to rally together other far-right groups in europe who share its view that german and europe are increasingly becoming " islamicized . " government , experts label pro-koeln extremist a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry criticised the event friday , calling pro-koeln an " extremist " group that aimed to undermine good relations between muslims and non-muslims . in chorus , a foreign affairs spokesperson for the federal government said : " in our country there is no place for radical right-wing groups who discriminate against minorities under the guise of a citizens ’ movement . " wolfgang kapust , an expert on the far-right definitively labeled pro-koeln an extremist grouping . " you can see it in the biographies of their leaders .
they 're members of the national democratic party , they 're in the republicans , and they established the very radical german league for people and homeland .
and all of these organizations and parties are characterized by far-right positions , racism , and a strong sense of nationalism . " no koelsch for nazis a wide majority of cologne residents are planning to clearly show that they want nothing to do with the congress .
they 've made hundreds of signs calling for passive resistance to the event .
the city 's barkeepers have declared that they will not be serving any of the local cologne beer , koelsch , to nazis .
and muslim groups in this city where every eighth resident is muslim have planned peaceful gatherings on the site of the planned mosque . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " prevent nazi congress " is scrawled on a cologne monument some onlookers are wondering why the city has n't banned the congress from taking place .

in a letter to staff , munich-based bayern lb , which is controlled by bavaria state , put its risk at up to 300 million euros .
all three banks had placed funds with lehman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal bank kfw is under fire for mistakenly wiring millions to lehman before its collapse " like many other banks active worldwide , our company had a business relationship over many years with lehman brothers , " said the letter signed by bayern chief executive michael kemmer .
he said accountants were still comparing which sums were credits and which were debts to establish the net exposure , but the figure so far was " up to 300 million . "
nrw bank , controlled by the state of north-rhine westphalia , said it had lent money to lehman brothers , but declined to say how much .
" they were n't problem investments , " said a spokesman .
although no german banks have so far failed or been forced to merge , the known exposure of german taxpayers to the crisis was approaching $ 1.2 billion friday .
europe seeks tighter banking regulations global markets have been shaken by the financial earthquake on wall street though indexes in many countries rallied friday after a host of major central banks in america , europe and elsewehere made almost a quarter of a trillion dollars available to struggling banks .
the us federal reserve said it had authorized another $ 180 million lending program to help banks in need of emergency cash . the eu is now seeking to use the us economic meltdown , which it asserts was the result of a negligent attitude towards finance , as motivation to beef up its supervision of the financial sector in two key areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis on wall street has sparked some intense soul-searching " we need more coordinated action by supervisors than currently exists , " said eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia on thursday , sept 18 , in madrid .
" we must move forward faster .

with a range of 8,000 kilometers -lrb- 5,000 miles -rrb- , the bulava can be equipped with up to 10 individually targeted nuclear warheads .
the missile test-fire comes during a time when us-russia relations have hit a post cold war low after moscow 's recent military intervention in georgia .
washington harshly criticized the military move .
russia , too , has recently expressed anger over us plans to establish a powerful missile-tracking reader in the czech republic as well as interceptor missiles in poland .
russia doubts us intentions according to analysts , russia is now beefing up its missile systems to counter the planned us shield in the region which it views as a tactical move by the us to deter russia 's nuclear activity .
washington , however , maintains that the shield is too small to defend against russia and is instead meant to protect against " rogues states " such as iran .
the latest test launch also comes only three weeks after russia test-fired the intercontinental topol rs-12m missile . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nordic bourses also surged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mood was euphoric in stock exchanges around europe on friday the stockholm bourse index opened up over 5 per cent with banking shares posting double-digit increases , and shortly before closing the index had gained almost 8 per cent . telecommunications equipment maker ericsson increased some 5 per cent while clothes retailer hennes and mauritz was up 7 per cent . the main oslo index surged 6 per cent in opening trading with strong performances from banking sector shares .
near closing time the index had climbed over 8 per cent .
in copenhagen , the index of 20 leading stocks was on 3.8 per cent . rescue plan galvanizes stock exchanges european central bank president jean-claude trichet welcomed friday the us bailout for tottering investment funds and other institutions , a spokeswoman said . what had been announced so far was definitely welcome , she said , confirming an account of trichet 's remarks by the market news wire service . the us treasury launched the rescue program with a 50-billion-dollar guarantee program for money-market funds . the previous day , the us federal reserve had lent $ 180 billion to five central banks abroad to flood the globe with cash .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush made the case for government intervention in a speech friday us president george w.bush said on friday that government intervention was necessary to solve the problems roiling the financial markets , calling it a " pivotal moment for america 's economy . "
" we must act now to protect our nation 's economic health , " bush said , after plans were unveiled to address financial institutions ' toxic mortgage debt .
" given the precarious state of today 's financial markets and their vital importance to the daily lives of the american people , government intervention is not only warranted , it is essential , " he said at the white house .
" the rescue plan is being welcomed on stock exchanges , " said oliver opgen-rhein , a stock trader at hsbc trinkaus & burkhardt in frankfurt . banks , which had not dared lend one another cash earlier this week , proved the fastest rising investments in europe . critics warn of blows to us economy however analysts warned friday that the rescue plan was not all good : it risked a bad strain on the us federal budget . commerzbank economist bernd weidensteiner said the cost to the us taxpayer would be huge , noting that a similar rescue of the japanese banking system in the 1990s had cost as much as 20 per cent of japan 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
he said a bailout costing $ 850 billion would cost 6 per cent of us gdp . folker hellmeyer , chief economist of bremer landesbank in germany , said washington , which already had a fiscal deficit this year of $ 640 billion or 4 per cent of gdp , was skidding into " dangers you ca n't see the end of . " although no german banks have failed or been forced to merge , the known exposure of german taxpayers to the crisis was approaching $ 1.2 billion friday , with three huge government owned banks , kfw , bayern lb and nrw bank , admitting they had lost money . all had placed funds with us investment bank lehman brothers , which declared insolvency on monday . europe 's biggest casualty of the week was british bank halifax bank of scotland , which was taken over thursday by lloyds in a massive merger engineered by the british government . europe seeks tighter banking regulations global markets have been shaken by the financial earthquake on wall street this week . the eu is now seeking to use the us economic meltdown , which it asserts was the result of a negligent attitude towards finance , as motivation to beef up its supervision of the financial sector in two key areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is using the us financial storm to push for firmer financial oversight " we need more coordinated action by supervisors than currently exists , " said eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia on thursday , sept 18 , in madrid .
" we must move forward faster .
we can not wait until a financial institution operating in seven or 10 countries of the european union has problems such as those of lehman brothers or bear sterns , " he said . the eu ’ s first goal is to tighten regulation of credit ratings agencies , which have come under fire for failing to alert investors about risks threatening borrowers ’ solvency . the eu commission is also plans to coordinate regulation of insurers and is set to announce a similar plan for the banking sector next month . while continental european countries took the initiative to hold talks about tougher oversight of financial speculation , especially hedge funds , before the us financial crisis , european regulators have failed to keep tabs on the frequent cross-border consolidation in the banking industry sector in recent years .
banks are thus largely supervised along national lines . that would mean that major european banks such as deutsche bank , unicredit and bnparibas could potentially face various sets of regulations across europe in times of trouble - a burden feared by many officials . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm , announced its new plan on thursday , sept .
18 , from brussels .
at the center of the new action plan is the development of care and counseling options for drug users , as well as an increase in police and customs controls to combat drug smuggling .
poster girl for substance abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amy winehouse 's drug difficulties are frequent tabloid fodder most people expect to celebrate their 25th birthday , but for others , reaching this age is almost a miracle .
that british soul singer amy winehouse just managed to celebrate a quarter of a century is impressive .
with her excessive drug and alcohol use , it seems winehouse has an appetite for self-destruction .
the main substance responsible for her downward spiral : cocaine .
winehouse is a particularly extreme poster girl for the danger that seems to be lurking just around the corner for european youths .
although the consumption of heroin as well as synthetic drugs has stagnated or even decreased slightly in some countries , according to the newest statistics from the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction , cocaine has n't become the number one most fashionable drug in just musician and manager circles .
" we have ascertained a worldwide increase in cocaine consumption that is very worrying , " said european commission vice-president jacques barrot .
allies in the war on drugs the uk , france and spain are seeing this increase particularly in youths between the ages of 15 and 16 .
and to counteract negative role models like whinehouse , the commission also wants to get celebrities to support its campaign against drugs .
" today i want to call for a european alliance in the struggle against drugs .
the goal is to sensitize the population , particularly the youth , but also to make businesses and local public authorities aware of the problem , " said barrot .
" those who join the alliance commit to taking concrete measures .
we also want to incorporate famous personalities to directly address youths . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot says cooperation among the eu nations is essential in the fight against drugs improved cooperation between the individual eu nations is also at the foreground of the new eu action plan .
" that is our strength - being able to launch large prevention campaigns on a europe-wide level .
and we are going to do everything we can to get a europe-wide campaign off the ground , " said barrot .
drugs + car = bad combo his other goal is uniform drug legislation across europe .
barrot also reportedly wants bloc-wide rules against drug use on the road because young people are n't sufficiently aware of the dangerous relationship between drugs and driving .
from the eu commission 's perspective , close cooperation between police and customs authorities against drug smuggling is also necessary .
according to data from barrot , illegal substances are increasingly making it to europe via the seaway from west africa . anke hagedorn -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 , russia said that " a new-generation bulava ballistic missile was successfully fired from the white sea to the kura testing site in kamchatka " in russia 's far eastern region .
with a range of 8,000 kilometers -lrb- 5,000 miles -rrb- , the bulava can be equipped with up to 10 individually targeted nuclear warheads .
the missile test-fire comes during a time when us-russia relations have hit a post cold war low after moscow 's recent military intervention in georgia .
washington harshly criticized the military move .
russia , too , has recently expressed anger over us plans to establish a powerful missile-tracking reader in the czech republic as well as interceptor missiles in poland .
russia doubts us intentions according to analysts , russia is now beefing up its missile systems to counter the planned us shield in the region which it views as a tactical move by the us to deter russia 's nuclear activity .
washington , however , maintains that the shield is too small to defend against russia and is instead meant to protect against " rogues states " such as iran .
the latest test launch also comes only three weeks after russia test-fired the intercontinental topol rs-12m missile . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the latest count , 6,244 children have become ill , four have died and 158 are suffering " acute kidney failure . "
with foreign consumers warily eyeing china 's manufacturing reputation amid claims of delays and cover-ups , robert madelin , director-general for health and consumer protection at the european commission , told reporters in beijing he expected an account of what went wrong .
" we are trying to establish the facts .
we are discussing all aspects of this crisis bilaterally with our colleagues in china , " he said .
" i know from experience that these sorts of cases , where apparently illegal or fraudulent acts lead to problems in safety , are the most difficult for any of us to deal with , " added madelin .
madelin said the eu did not import chinese infant milk powder , and there had been no reports of infant sickness in the bloc from other chinese dairy products .
the scandal 's protagonists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : products of china 's mengniu dairy company have been pulled from starbucks shelves almost one-tenth of liquid milk batches from mengniu dairy and inner mongolia yili industrial group , a beijing olympic games sponsor , contained melamine , a chemical which is banned in food .
several samples of milk from the bright dairy group also had the substance , used in making plastics , china 's general administration of quality supervision , inspection and quarantine found .
chinese media have largely kept quiet about claims that the sanlu group , china 's biggest maker of infant milk powder , concealed the poisonings from the public and senior authorities during the beijing olympics in august .
starbucks pulls questionable milk coffee chain starbucks said its 300-plus cafes in mainland china had pulled milk supplies by mengniu as a precautionary step , but that no employees or customers had fallen ill from the milk .
in singapore , the government food watchdog advised retailers to pull yili yoghurt ice bars from their shelves .
china is vowing to punish errant businesses and officials and there have already been dismissals , detentions and arrests linked to sanlu , 43-percent of which is owned by new zealand diary giant fonterra .
new zealand prime minister helen clark said monday that chinese officials acted last week only after her government pressed beijing .

28 .
it comes at a time when the eu is eager to bolster ties with neighbours that share a border with a newly resurgent russia . last month 's georgia conflict saw russia invade the small caucasus nation and support the independence claims of two of its restive regions .
" belarus does not want dialogue with the west through the ' iron curtain ' it has built on its border , " lukashenko said in an interview with western journalists ahead of the parliamentary polls .
" we want dialogue in all areas . "
" we want you to accept us and to recognize our elections , " lukashenko said , according to excerpts of the interview provided by his office .
lukashenko , in power for 14 years , is accused by the united states and the european union of rigging elections , jailing opponents and closing down free media .
no election held in the former soviet republic since the mid-1990s has been deemed free or fair .
prisoner releases herald prospect of thaw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander kozulin was released from detention , along with other notable political prisoners last month , lukashenko released belarus ' highest-profile political prisoner , former presidential candidate alexander kozulin , and the remaining political prisoners being held there .
european foreign ministers on monday responded by holding out the prospect of aid and lifted sanctions in a bid to persuade lukashenko to hold democratic elections .
following the prisoner release , washington also said the move set the stage for a " significant " improvement in ties .
lukashenko said western monitoring of the upcoming elections would prove that belarus was a genuine democracy .
" we have opened the country for you .
come , look , observe , whether the pre-election campaign , the voting and the election itself are undertaken in line with our laws , " he said .
forty belarussian figures , including the president , have been banned from entering the eu since the 2006 presidential election which was judged not to comply with international norms .
last week , a major belarus opposition party leader warned that western countries would turn a blind eye to fraud in next month 's legislative election and recognise a win for the outgoing authoritarian regime . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

counter-demonstrators carried signs with slogans including " stop the nazi congress - stop pro koeln " and a few scuffled with the right-wing organisers .
one leftist protester was briefly detained by police , a spokesman said .
some 3,000 police officers from north rhine-westphalia and neighboring states are being deployed in cologne this weekend in the hope that they 'll be able to maintain peace and security . the organizers from pro koeln - a self-described " civil movement " which has , however , been represented on the municipal council for four years now - are among the most vocal opponents to a project to build a new mosque in cologne . the group used the recent green-lighting of the construction plans to rally together other far-right groups in europe who share its view that german and europe are increasingly becoming " islamicized . " government , experts label pro-koeln extremist a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry criticised the event friday , calling pro-koeln an " extremist " group that aimed to undermine good relations between muslims and non-muslims . in chorus , a foreign affairs spokesperson for the federal government said : " in our country there is no place for radical right-wing groups who discriminate against minorities under the guise of a citizens ’ movement . " wolfgang kapust , an expert on the far-right definitively labeled pro-koeln an extremist grouping . " you can see it in the biographies of their leaders .
they 're members of the national democratic party , they 're in the republicans , and they established the very radical german league for people and homeland .
and all of these organizations and parties are characterized by far-right positions , racism , and a strong sense of nationalism . " no koelsch for nazis a wide majority of cologne residents are planning to clearly show that they want nothing to do with the congress .
they 've made hundreds of signs calling for passive resistance to the event .
the city 's barkeepers have declared that they will not be serving any of the local cologne beer , koelsch , to nazis .
and muslim groups in this city where every eighth resident is muslim have planned peaceful gatherings on the site of the planned mosque . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " prevent nazi congress " is scrawled on a cologne monument some onlookers are wondering why the city has n't banned the congress from taking place .
but politician ruprecht polenz , head of a christian-muslim peace initiative , said that 's not so easily done . " they 're clever , " he said .
" they 're not going to show up sporting swastikas .
rather , they 'll use slogans meant to pick up on any resentments .
there are problems with integration .
the question is , how do i handle it ?
do i contribute to the problem by reacting aggressively , or do i try , with dialogue , to get to the bottom of things and get closer to a solution ? " cologne residents to give the cold shoulder cologne 's city government has also had mixed feelings about hosting the congress , and not because of the bill of more than a million euros the city will have to foot once it 's all over .
officials are worried about the bad name that such an event could give a city that prides itself on being an exceptionally tolerant place to live . mayor fritz schramma has called on residents to show the far-right " the cold shoulder . " " shut your windows and doors , lower your shutters , " he said in a statement .
" make it clear to pro koeln and its camarilla : you are not welcome in cologne . " the right-wing extremists have been denied permission to gather in front of the city 's most famous landmark , the cologne cathedral .
instead , the event has been relegated to a city suburb . whether pro koeln 's attempt to unify europe 's nationalists will succeed in cologne remains to be seen .
in the run-up to the event , the organizers boasted that big names on the far-right scene would be in attendance - jean marie le pen , the head of france 's national front , for example , or the head of the austria 's freedom party . le pen , for his part , has already let it be known that pro-koeln was lying .

" a substantial offer from the eu is on the table .
we are still in talks with iran to receive a concrete and , we hope , positive response to this offer .
this has until now still been lacking , " he said when asked about the calls for sanctions . germany is one of six world powers attempting to convince iran to halt sensitive nuclear work with an incentives package in exchange for full suspension of uranium enrichment . " should there be no progress on the negotiations track , the german government believes the un security council will become more relevant again and discussions will have to be held whether there should be new resolutions . " this is not the track we are seeking - we want progress from negotiations .
but unfortunately what we have seen until now has not made us optimistic . " ploetner said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had stressed the importance of settling the issue quickly during talks monday with his iranian counterpart manouchehr mottaki . officials from the six nations , which also includes russia , china and the uk , are scheduled to meet friday , sept .
19 , before the un general assembly convenes in new york .
foreign ministers are expected to convene over iran during the annual meeting . unity required to approve new sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains unlikely that the security council will unite behind the french sanctions resolution european union foreign policy chief javier solana said he believes russia and china are " quite worried " about iran 's nuclear program and that a report presented monday by the iaea nuclear watchdog " is n't good for iran . " but he added that he did n't think moscow and beijing would completely turn around and support the west 's call for more sanctions . washington and european capitals have accused tehran of enriching uranium in order to produce atomic weapons .
iran has insisted its nuclear program is intended solely to create electricity . " the main option here is a fourth un sanctions resolution , but that is a possibility that requires russian , chinese and european cooperation , " a senior us official , who asked not to be named as his comments were sensitive , told reuters news agency . state department spokesman sean mccormack said on thursday there was agreement to move forward with a new sanctions resolution , but it was unclear how far the six political directors would get in hammering out a detailed agreement . tough steps unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would not change course " this is probably a discussion which will be aimed at seeing where each of the individual states are in terms of the timeline of moving forward and the content of a new resolution , " mccormack told reporters . iran experts have said that even if the un security council members plus germany , who are responsible for negotiations with iran , agreed to a new resolution , it would be a weaker version than washington and others wanted . restrictions would likely be placed on iranian companies but not the oil industry or oil products . " my guess is that the sanctions will be watered down and there is every reason for the russians to drag this out , " gary samore of the council on foreign relations told reuters . ahead of friday 's meeting , iran 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , again said tehran would not stop its enrichment program regardless of whether the un decides to impose a new round of sanctions . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the latest count , 6,244 children have become ill , four have died and 158 are suffering " acute kidney failure . "
with foreign consumers warily eyeing china 's manufacturing reputation amid claims of delays and cover-ups , robert madelin , director-general for health and consumer protection at the european commission , told reporters in beijing he expected an account of what went wrong .
" we are trying to establish the facts .
we are discussing all aspects of this crisis bilaterally with our colleagues in china , " he said .
" i know from experience that these sorts of cases , where apparently illegal or fraudulent acts lead to problems in safety , are the most difficult for any of us to deal with , " added madelin .
madelin said the eu did not import chinese infant milk powder , and there had been no reports of infant sickness in the bloc from other chinese dairy products .
the scandal 's protagonists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : products of china 's mengniu dairy company have been pulled from starbucks shelves almost one-tenth of liquid milk batches from mengniu dairy and inner mongolia yili industrial group , a beijing olympic games sponsor , contained melamine , a chemical which is banned in food .
several samples of milk from the bright dairy group also had the substance , used in making plastics , china 's general administration of quality supervision , inspection and quarantine found .
chinese media have largely kept quiet about claims that the sanlu group , china 's biggest maker of infant milk powder , concealed the poisonings from the public and senior authorities during the beijing olympics in august .
starbucks pulls questionable milk coffee chain starbucks said its 300-plus cafes in mainland china had pulled milk supplies by mengniu as a precautionary step , but that no employees or customers had fallen ill from the milk .
in singapore , the government food watchdog advised retailers to pull yili yoghurt ice bars from their shelves .
china is vowing to punish errant businesses and officials and there have already been dismissals , detentions and arrests linked to sanlu , 43-percent of which is owned by new zealand diary giant fonterra .
new zealand prime minister helen clark said monday that chinese officials acted last week only after her government pressed beijing .
eu , us target product safety bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and us want to increase awareness of their safety regulations events surrounding the dairy scandal come as eu and us consumer protection officials pledged friday to step up efforts to ensure product safety in china .
the new product safety initiative aims to increase awareness among chinese manufacturers of consumer safety regulations in the us and europe .
the initiative , however , was directed at toys , clothes and electrical products and did not address the milk powder scandal in particular . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 , 2009 jewish-owned art seized by the nazis from 1933 onwards is featured at a new exhibition at the jewish museum in berlin .
meanwhile , germany 's culture minister has called for the " fair " return of jewish art . opening on friday , sept .
19 , the exhibition consists of 15 artworks along with documents describing their seizure or forced sale , later changes in ownership and ultimate restitution .
valuable porcelain and book collections from dresden 's intellectual von klemperer family are included in the show .
the gestapo confiscated the family 's collection in 1938 , placing it in dresden 's municipal art collection and the saxony state library . before the second world war , nazi germany made it illegal for jews to own art treasures , forcing them to sell them .
later during the holocaust , jewish property throughout eastern europe was seized by nazi officials .
exhibition organizers said thursday that many of the confiscated paintings and other treasures had still not been recovered by the lawful heirs of the original owners .
taking responsibility for stolen art michael blumenthal , director of the museum , charged that german art collectors , dealers and museums had all profited by being able to purchase art at reduced prices .
he praised germany 's current efforts to give back the art , but said he was disappointed that heirs had no absolute legal right to reclaim the artworks .
at a ceremony on thursday evening , minister of culture bernd neumann called for " fair and just " solutions in returning the work stolen by nazi officials .
" more than 60 years after the war 's end , germany is unrestrained in its moral responsibility for the restitution of art looted by the nazis , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what is short-selling ?
the city regulator has announced a ban on short-selling - in which traders bet on share prices falling - in a bid to tackle market instability .
the financial services authority -lrb- fsa -rrb- is clamping down on what some think contributed to the sharp falls in hbos shares before lloyds tsb rescued it .
the rule came into force at midnight and is due to last until 16 january .
the fsa 's clampdown applies only to 29 leading financial stocks , and not to shares in all listed firms .
the restrictions will be reviewed after 30 days .
" while we still regard short-selling as a legitimate investment technique in normal market conditions , the current extreme circumstances have given rise to disorderly markets , " said fsa chief executive hector sants .
' financial stability ' short-selling is a technique that sees investors borrow an asset , such as shares , currencies or oil contracts , from another investor and then sell that asset in the relevant market hoping the price will fall .
there is a danger in a trading system which allows financial institutions to be targeted and subject to extreme short-selling pressures callum mccarthy financial services authority chairman the aim is to buy back the asset at a lower price and return it to its owner , pocketing the difference .
anyone can short a position in a company 's shares , but typically hedge funds are the main players .
chancellor alistair darling welcomed the move by the fsa .
" i believe it is the right thing to do in the current market conditions and in the interests of financial stability , " he said .
markets have fluctuated hugely in recent days , with fundamental changes occurring in the financial landscape .
there are fears that several firms , including lehman brothers , which filed for bankruptcy at the start of the week , and insurance giant aig , which was rescued by the federal reserve , were targeted by those short-selling .

chancellor alistair darling says short-selling was n't the sole cause of falling global stock markets speaking to the bbc , mr darling underlined that short-selling was not wrong in itself .
" it can help actually in providing funds , liquidity , for companies . "
but he added that it could become a problem where people " deliberately " manipulate a market , making " a difficult situation even worse " .
callum mccarthy , chairman of the financial services authority , expressed concerns over recent volatility .
" there is a danger in a trading system which allows financial institutions to be targeted and subject to extreme short-selling pressures , because movements in equity prices can be translated into uncertainty in the minds of those who place deposits with those institutions with consequent financial stability issues . "
broader moves it was not only in the uk that attempts were being made to address short-shelling .
the us financial regulator , the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- , also announced restrictions on short-selling on wednesday .
and on thursday , new york attorney general andrew cuomo said he would start a probe into short-selling .
at issue is whether certain traders exploited short-selling to push down stock prices , breaching market rules .
new york 's state pension funds said it would cease lending stocks in 19 firms to short-sellers on a temporary basis .

the british association of aesthetic plastic surgeons said they were " increasingly concerned " with some of the standards in advertising .
use of models with " anatomically impossible " breasts and offers of " lunchtime facelifts " create unrealistic expectations they warned .
advertising regulators said any move to promote good practice was welcome .
delegates at the baaps annual conference were shown a range of adverts with dubious marketing practices , such as offering financial incentives to undergo surgery . "
we are particularly worried about younger , vulnerable readers of magazines who are being targeted very heavily " douglas mcgeorge , baaps president one offered a £ 250 discount to customers as an incentive to have the surgery quickly .
another offered a " lunchtime facelift " , which baaps surgeons said can not be done and falsely raises expectations .
baaps represents around one third of cosmetic surgeons in the uk but is not a regulatory body and so has no powers to take action against clinics .
but the association is launching its own advertising campaign to promote better choices about where people should have surgery .
serious decision douglas mcgeorge , president of baaps and a consultant plastic surgeon , said : " surgery is a serious undertaking which requires realistic expectations and should only proceed after proper consultation with a reputable and properly qualified clinician in an appropriate clinical setting . "
he added : " it is very difficult to regulate these adverts .
" we are particularly worried about younger , vulnerable readers of magazines who are being targeted very heavily . "
many clinics have signed up to the independent healthcare authority 's code of practice , which states marketing materials should be designed to safeguard patients from unrealistic expectations and should use real life models .
however this is voluntary .
adam searle , a former president of the organisation , said : " plastic surgery , when used well , is the most powerful tool to improve patients ' well-being .
" what it should not be used for is to make money .
" it is the patient who should benefit not the surgeon . "
a spokesman for the advertising standards authority said they supported any attempts by organisations to promote codes of good advertising practice .

the british association of aesthetic plastic surgeons said they were " increasingly concerned " with some of the standards in advertising .
use of models with " anatomically impossible " breasts and offers of " lunchtime facelifts " create unrealistic expectations they warned .
advertising regulators said any move to promote good practice was welcome .
delegates at the baaps annual conference were shown a range of adverts with dubious marketing practices , such as offering financial incentives to undergo surgery .
we are particularly worried about younger , vulnerable readers of magazines who are being targeted very heavily douglas mcgeorge , baaps president one offered a £ 250 discount to customers as an incentive to have the surgery quickly .
another offered a " lunchtime facelift " , which baaps surgeons said can not be done and falsely raises expectations .
baaps represents around one third of cosmetic surgeons in the uk but is not a regulatory body and so has no powers to take action against clinics .
but the association is launching its own advertising campaign to promote better choices about where people should have surgery .
serious decision douglas mcgeorge , president of baaps and a consultant plastic surgeon , said : " surgery is a serious undertaking which requires realistic expectations and should only proceed after proper consultation with a reputable and properly qualified clinician in an appropriate clinical setting . "
he added : " it is very difficult to regulate these adverts .
" we are particularly worried about younger , vulnerable readers of magazines who are being targeted very heavily . "
many clinics have signed up to the independent healthcare authority 's code of practice , which states marketing materials should be designed to safeguard patients from unrealistic expectations and should use real life models .
however this is voluntary .
adam searle , a former president of the organisation , said : " plastic surgery , when used well , is the most powerful tool to improve patients ' well-being .
" what it should not be used for is to make money .
" it is the patient who should benefit not the surgeon . "
a spokesman for the advertising standards authority said they supported any attempts by organisations to promote codes of good advertising practice .

mrs price , from newport , south wales , talks openly about her condition , which is caused by multiple sclerosis .
she is one of 14m people in the uk - almost one in four - who have some kind of bladder control problem .
but mrs price recognises there is a stigma attached to a condition that is almost guaranteed to raise eyebrows at the dinner table .
mrs price said she was in so much pain she sought help quickly and was lucky to have a supportive husband and friends she could confide in .
" i 'm very , very fortunate that a lot of my friends are in the nursing profession and one friend is a urology nurse , " she said .
" i was having all this pain and i brought it up with her over a glass of wine on a friday night .
" she said i needed to see a doctor and be referred properly . "
mrs price , a petrol station cashier , was equally as open with her work colleagues which allowed her to continue in her job . "
the biggest frustration for us is that people do n't come forward and suffer in silence " karen logan , nurse consultant " because it 's a small team there , they all know about it and i was never on my own , " she said .
" i ca n't imagine ever being in some jobs when you have got bladder problems . "
but the stigma of the condition means many people suffer in silence , for years in many cases .
national continence awareness week , from 15 - 19 september , run by the bladder and bowel foundation , aims to raise awareness of bowel and bladder problems and tell people that help is available .
karen logan , a nurse consultant and head of continence services at gwent healthcare nhs trust , said some people refused to tell even their closest friends , let alone seek medical help .
" the biggest frustration for us is that people do n't come forward and suffer in silence , " she said .
incontinence facts 14m people in the uk are affected by some sort of bladder problem it 's estimated that 6.5m people in the uk have some kind of bowel control problem women are more likely to be affected by bladder control problems than men 4.8m people in the uk under the age of 24 are estimated to have had bladder control problems .
bladder problems are more likely as you get older , particularly after the age of 45 on average , the kidneys produce two to three pints of urine every 24 hours the ancient egyptians created catheters from reeds source : bladder and bowel foundation " it 's normal for people to suffer for five to ten years with an overactive bladder or stress incontinence , triggered by sneezing or coughing for example .
" i 've had people in the clinic who did nothing about it for over 20 years . "
problems can range in severity from a mildly overactive bladder , which may cause frequent trips to the toilet , to neurological conditions or impairments , such as ms and extreme diabetes , which can cause incontinence .
some women who have had children suffer a weakening of their pelvic floor muscles which can cause incontinence and men 's urine flow can weaken as they get older .
but help is available such as lifestyle advice about avoiding caffeine and fizzy drinks , bladder control training and medication .
in more extreme cases , such as mrs price , a disposable catheter can be inserted after urination to help empty the bladder .
mrs price said her life had been transformed and urged anybody with bladder or bowel problems to seek help .
" you will not be the first case anyone has heard about and you wo n't be the last .
it 's about getting your quality of life back , " she said . • anyone with bladder or bowel problems can seek help from the bladder and bowel foundation on 0845 345 0165 .

david orr , the chief executive of the national housing federation , is calling for urgent radical action .
the credit crunch has adversely affected the uk 's property market , with fewer homes being built .
a communities and local government department spokesman said ministers remained committed to the target as a long-term aim .
mr orr is due to speak at the federation 's annual conference .
fewer homes he told housing association representatives that the dual problems of the worsening credit crunch and the contracting building industry meant it was time to recognise the target was simply not going to be met .
instead , the federation estimated 1.6 million homes would be built by 2020 .
it would take a further nine years to meet the original target .
mr orr said : " the prime minister was both brave and right to put the dire need for new housing centre-stage , and make it a national priority , when he took office last summer .
" however , with the global credit crunch worsening , and conditions getting tougher for all house builders , it is time to recognise that the very commendable 2020 target is now almost impossible . "
last year 167,577 new homes were built in the private and public sector .
this year the figure could shrink to 100,000 .
urgent help needed mr orr warned that housing associations , which depend on private borrowing to top up government grants , will find it harder to raise money .
his organisation called on the government to increase grant support and bring forward social housing budgets to get more homes built sooner .
it also wants more measures to speed up the planning process so that properties can be built faster .
the communities and local government spokesman said a series of measures had already been announced to alleviate some of the current problems in the housing market .
he said £ 400 million had already been brought forward to boost the spending power of providers of social housing , including registered landlords and councils .
the money should pay for 5,500 homes to be built during the next 18 months .

david orr , the chief executive of the national housing federation , is calling for urgent radical action .
the credit crunch has adversely affected the uk 's property market , with fewer homes being built .
a communities and local government department spokesman said ministers remained committed to the target as a long-term aim .
mr orr is due to speak at the federation 's annual conference .
fewer homes he told housing association representatives that the dual problems of the worsening credit crunch and the contracting building industry meant it was time to recognise the target was simply not going to be met .
instead , the federation estimated 1.6 million homes would be built by 2020 .
it would take a further nine years to meet the original target .
mr orr said : " the prime minister was both brave and right to put the dire need for new housing centre-stage , and make it a national priority , when he took office last summer .
" however , with the global credit crunch worsening , and conditions getting tougher for all house builders , it is time to recognise that the very commendable 2020 target is now almost impossible . "
last year 167,577 new homes were built in the private and public sector .
this year the figure could shrink to 100,000 .
urgent help needed mr orr warned that housing associations , which depend on private borrowing to top up government grants , will find it harder to raise money .
his organisation called on the government to increase grant support and bring forward social housing budgets to get more homes built sooner .
it also wants more measures to speed up the planning process so that properties can be built faster .
the communities and local government spokesman said a series of measures had already been announced to alleviate some of the current problems in the housing market .
he said £ 400 million had already been brought forward to boost the spending power of providers of social housing , including registered landlords and councils .
the money should pay for 5,500 homes to be built during the next 18 months .

david orr , the chief executive of the national housing federation , is calling for urgent radical action .
the credit crunch has adversely affected the uk 's property market , with fewer homes being built .
a communities and local government department spokesman said ministers remained committed to the target as a long-term aim .
mr orr is due to speak at the federation 's annual conference .
fewer homes he told housing association representatives that the dual problems of the worsening credit crunch and the contracting building industry meant it was time to recognise the target was simply not going to be met .
instead , the federation estimated 1.6 million homes would be built by 2020 .
it would take a further nine years to meet the original target .
mr orr said : " the prime minister was both brave and right to put the dire need for new housing centre-stage , and make it a national priority , when he took office last summer .
" however , with the global credit crunch worsening , and conditions getting tougher for all house builders , it is time to recognise that the very commendable 2020 target is now almost impossible . "
last year 167,577 new homes were built in the private and public sector .
this year the figure could shrink to 100,000 .
urgent help needed mr orr warned that housing associations , which depend on private borrowing to top up government grants , will find it harder to raise money .
his organisation called on the government to increase grant support and bring forward social housing budgets to get more homes built sooner .
it also wants more measures to speed up the planning process so that properties can be built faster .
the communities and local government spokesman said a series of measures had already been announced to alleviate some of the current problems in the housing market .
he said £ 400 million had already been brought forward to boost the spending power of providers of social housing , including registered landlords and councils .
the money should pay for 5,500 homes to be built during the next 18 months .

kevin hehir , 48 , from ribbleton , preston , saw the fox while he was out walking near chorley .
in gaelic tradition , the fox is as black as night so it can live in a man 's shadow and never be seen .
graham jones , from lancashire wildlife trust , said the fox was once bred for its fur , but some were released and then bred with foxes in the wild .
" this colour is what 's known as the silver fox , and it was this fox that was bred a long time ago within fur farms .
" some of them escaped , some were deliberately released , and then they obviously then bred with foxes that were already wild . "
welfare concerns mr hehir said : " i 'd never seen a black fox .
i went to one of the forestry commission lads , and he 's been in forestry all his life , and i asked him , and he said he 's never heard of it .
" he was the one who said to me , you 've probably got something there . "
he added he was not concerned about the unlucky folklore , as he " has bad luck anyway " .
mr hehir is loathe to reveal exactly where he saw the fox , as he is concerned for its welfare .
he has already had a call from a taxidermist , offering him £ 1,000 to tell him where it is .

kevin hehir , 48 , from ribbleton , preston , saw the fox while he was out walking near chorley .
in gaelic tradition , the fox is as black as night so it can live in a man 's shadow and never be seen .
graham jones , from lancashire wildlife trust , said the fox was once bred for its fur , but some were released and then bred with foxes in the wild .
" this colour is what 's known as the silver fox , and it was this fox that was bred a long time ago within fur farms .
" some of them escaped , some were deliberately released , and then they obviously then bred with foxes that were already wild . "

i went to one of the forestry commission lads , and he 's been in forestry all his life , and i asked him , and he said he 's never heard of it .
" he was the one who said to me , you 've probably got something there . "
he added he was not concerned about the unlucky folklore , as he " has bad luck anyway " .
mr hehir is loathe to reveal exactly where he saw the fox , as he is concerned for its welfare .
he has already had a call from a taxidermist , offering him £ 1,000 to tell him where it is .

stock markets are plunging and investment banks collapsing .
what does this mean for the future of capitalism ?
do we need more regulation or , indeed , less ?
can bank mergers save the day ?
leading economists , thinkers and analysts give their views .
click on the links below to read what they have to say .
" the unprecedented intervention of the fed ... reveals , once again , the profoundly undemocratic character of state capitalist institutions " noam chomsky linguist and political theorist " this is a failure of a system where we relied on the markets and excluded government .
and the markets failed " tony benn labour politician " as the greatest names on wall street crash to the ground , destroyed by their own arrogance and folly , we must ask : why are we so amazed ? "

markets have inherent and well-known inefficiencies .
one factor is failure to calculate the costs to those who do not participate in transactions .
these " externalities " can be huge .
that is particularly true for financial institutions .
their task is to take risks , calculating potential costs for themselves .
but they do not take into account the consequences of their losses for the economy as a whole . "
state capitalist institutions -lsb- are -rsb- designed in large measure to socialise cost and risk and privatize profit , without a public voice " hence the financial market " underprices risk " and is " systematically inefficient , " as john eatwell and lance taylor wrote a decade ago , warning of the extreme dangers of financial liberalization and reviewing the substantial costs already incurred - and also proposing solutions , which have been ignored .
the threat became more severe when the clinton administration repealed the glass-steagall act of 1933 , thus freeing financial institutions " to innovate in the new economy , " in clinton 's words - and also " to self-destruct , taking down with them the general economy and international confidence in the us banking system , " financial analyst nomi prins adds .
the unprecedented intervention of the fed may be justified or not in narrow terms , but it reveals , once again , the profoundly undemocratic character of state capitalist institutions , designed in large measure to socialise cost and risk and privatize profit , without a public voice .
that is , of course , not limited to financial markets .
the advanced economy as a whole relies heavily on the dynamic state sector , with much the same consequences with regard to risk , cost , profit , and decisions , crucial features of the economy and political system .
click here to return tony benn is a former labour member of parliament and cabinet minister this economic crisis is a global crisis .
it is more serious than the crisis in 1929 .
in this climate , people get very frightened and , when they are frightened , their fear can be exploited just like hitler did in the 1930s to get to power .
it 's the end of an era when we were told to borrow and spend and keep government out .
have your say " this ' crisis ' is not a glitch or a mishap .
it is exactly what modern capitalism does and how it works " rob brownell , colchester , uk send us your comments many people will now lose their jobs , lose their houses , lose their livelihoods .
they will say there seems to be plenty of money for war .
we are bombing in iraq and we are bombing in afghanistan and , if we can do that , why do n't we have enough money to meet our own need ?
there will be a big demand for a major policy change .
this is a failure of a system where we relied on the markets and excluded government .
and the markets failed .
click here to return peter jay is an economist , bank of england non-executive director and former bbc economics editor outside new delhi , in india , stands a piece of wasteland , frequented by mangy dogs and feral urchins , in which are to be found the collected statuary of the british raj - derelict kings , queens and viceroys staring sightlessly into the surrounding scrub .
no better metaphor could quickly be found for the apparent fate of modern-day finance capitalism on the morrow of the great crash of 2008 .
like the poet shelley 's ozymandias , king of kings , it shrieks : " look on my works , ye mighty , and despair " . "
we must face the real possibility that the mood swings of financial markets can not , forever , be biased to optimism " as the greatest names on wall street crash to the ground , destroyed by their own arrogance and folly as well as by the most hostile financial environment in almost 80 years , we must ask : why are we so amazed ?
we who were supposed to be such experts ?
and why did we not predict it ?
at least not with urgency and conviction ?
the truth is uncomfortable .
we had grown cynical of marxist talk of the contradictions of capitalism because marxism itself had , by the 1970s , so conspicuously failed - while capitalism thrived - that its acolytes were discredited .
those of an older generation truly believed that some combination of walter bagehot and j m keynes had made it impossible for the financial system to fail and for the macro-economy to plunge into depression .
central banks would never again allow that to happen .
i remember in the 1950s arguing this vehemently with my friend , the late paul foot .
i want now to say to his ghost i am no longer so sure ; and i 'm sorry for my dogmatism half a century ago .
for the younger generation , the 1930s seem a long time ago and crises since have all ended non-catastrophically .
complacency is the price of success .
but now we must face the real possibility that the mood swings of financial markets can not , forever , be biased to optimism ; that the higher they climb , the harder they will eventually fall and that this flaw in capitalism can not be fixed - even by alan greenspan - because it is embedded in unchanging human psychology .
click here to return prof patrick minford is an economist at cardiff university , and was an informal adviser to margaret thatcher in all the current financial train-wreck , voices are already being raised to demand huge increases in regulation and the " curbing of capitalist excess " .
it needs to be remembered firstly that , already , massive regulation is in place across banking practices under the basle agreements .
the trouble has been that the banks avoided them by using " special investment vehicles " away from their balance sheets . "
these animals have had a blood-bath and are unlikely to behave similarly ever again " one necessary adjustment would be to simply ensure that , in future , this avoidance is prevented .
secondly , investment banks - such as lehman brothers - are virtually not regulated at all and are certainly outside basle .
however , these animals have had a blood-bath and are unlikely to behave similarly ever again .
we must not try to stop their successors finding a new business model within normal business rules .
capitalism has a good record of dramatically raising the world 's living standards over long periods of time .
regulation of banking , which enjoys the privilege of access to " lender of last resort " support from the taxpayer , is necessary to protect the taxpayer from abuse .
but we need a vigorous and competitive banking and financial system - this is vital for growth and the availability of financial flexibility across all parts of society .
any adjustments to the existing regulatory framework must keep this firmly in mind .
click here to return dr jon danielsson is a member of the london school of economics ' financial markets group we hear that the wave of mergers , nationalizations and bankruptcies in the financial world represents the failure of the old way of doing business , that the future of finance is a heavily regulated , 1950s type world .
nothing could be farther from the truth .
the costs of preventing crises mean an economy like cuba and north korea .
while some banks , with the acquiescence of banking regulators , and often with the full support of governments did get into serious trouble , it is the reaction to the crisis that really matters .
the financial system has so far passed that test . "
the real tragedy would be if the official reaction to this crisis were ill thought , politically motivated , overbearing regulations " while we can debate individual decisions , liquidity provisions and the rapid putting down of sick institutions is exactly the right way .
we will come out of this crisis , having learned that it is important for banks not to make assets so complicated that neither they nor anybody else understands them .
liquidity will have a central place in both banking and the regulations of banks .
we can fine-tune the existing regulatory structure and the nature of banking to deal with this .
the real tragedy would be if the official reaction to this crisis were ill thought , politically motivated , overbearing regulations .
a freewheeling financial system is essential for future prosperity .
please policymakers , do n't return us to 1929 or even to the 1950s .
click here to return richard lambert is the former editor of the financial times and head of the cbi it is sad to see hbos lose its independence in this way but we needed a good market-driven solution to deal with these speculative attacks on the bank .
this looks like the right outcome .
lloyds tsb is a strong well capitalised institution and the new entity will be well placed to withstand the current turbulence .
the government and the financial authorities also deserve credit for making it possible in a timely way .
it also good for the broader economy .
the last thing we want is a sharp contraction of bank balance sheets because of the impact it would have on the availability of credit .
we must not lose sight of the fact that the british banking system is well capitalised and regulated , perhaps it is time for us all to draw breath and calm down a little .
click here to return brendon barber is the secretary general of the trades union congress -lrb- tuc -rrb- this is not the final crisis of capitalism , but it ought to be the end of the road for a particular version of it .
the truth is that there is no single economic model of capitalism .
there has always been a considerable difference between europe 's social market and the anglo-saxon version in the us - not to mention the wild-west excesses of post-communist russia or the strange hybrid that now operates in china .
what we have seen in the last few days should rather be the last gasp of the belief that the way to secure prosperity is to let free markets rip and tear up any regulation that gets in the way of short-term profit .
already the view that the state has no role to play has gone with the nationalisation of freddie , fannie and aig in the us and northern rock in the uk .
the lessons that we need to draw are that we have given far too much importance to the city and neglected other sectors - not just traditional manufacturing , but new environmental jobs and the creative sector , to give just a few examples .
this should be neo-liberalism rip .
but the paradox that has yet to work its way through is what this means for politics .
voters are shifting to the right in their voting intention , but shifting to the left in many policy preferences as they expect government to tax the rich more , regulate the energy sector and restore sensible regulatory structures in the city .

click here to return tony benn is a former labour member of parliament and cabinet minister this economic crisis is a global crisis .
it is more serious than the crisis in 1929 .
in this climate , people get very frightened and , when they are frightened , their fear can be exploited just like hitler did in the 1930s to get to power .
it 's the end of an era when we were told to borrow and spend and keep government out .
have your say this ' crisis ' is not a glitch or a mishap .
it is exactly what modern capitalism does and how it works rob brownell , colchester , uk send us your comments many people will now lose their jobs , lose their houses , lose their livelihoods .
they will say there seems to be plenty of money for war .
we are bombing in iraq and we are bombing in afghanistan and , if we can do that , why do n't we have enough money to meet our own need ?
there will be a big demand for a major policy change .
this is a failure of a system where we relied on the markets and excluded government .
and the markets failed .
click here to return peter jay is an economist , bank of england non-executive director and former bbc economics editor outside new delhi , in india , stands a piece of wasteland , frequented by mangy dogs and feral urchins , in which are to be found the collected statuary of the british raj - derelict kings , queens and viceroys staring sightlessly into the surrounding scrub .
no better metaphor could quickly be found for the apparent fate of modern-day finance capitalism on the morrow of the great crash of 2008 .
like the poet shelley 's ozymandias , king of kings , it shrieks : " look on my works , ye mighty , and despair " .
we must face the real possibility that the mood swings of financial markets can not , forever , be biased to optimism as the greatest names on wall street crash to the ground , destroyed by their own arrogance and folly as well as by the most hostile financial environment in almost 80 years , we must ask : why are we so amazed ?
we who were supposed to be such experts ?
and why did we not predict it ?
at least not with urgency and conviction ?
the truth is uncomfortable .
we had grown cynical of marxist talk of the contradictions of capitalism because marxism itself had , by the 1970s , so conspicuously failed - while capitalism thrived - that its acolytes were discredited .
those of an older generation truly believed that some combination of walter bagehot and j m keynes had made it impossible for the financial system to fail and for the macro-economy to plunge into depression .
central banks would never again allow that to happen .
i remember in the 1950s arguing this vehemently with my friend , the late paul foot .
i want now to say to his ghost i am no longer so sure ; and i 'm sorry for my dogmatism half a century ago .
for the younger generation , the 1930s seem a long time ago and crises since have all ended non-catastrophically .
complacency is the price of success .
but now we must face the real possibility that the mood swings of financial markets can not , forever , be biased to optimism ; that the higher they climb , the harder they will eventually fall and that this flaw in capitalism can not be fixed - even by alan greenspan - because it is embedded in unchanging human psychology .
click here to return prof patrick minford is an economist at cardiff university , and was an informal adviser to margaret thatcher in all the current financial train-wreck , voices are already being raised to demand huge increases in regulation and the " curbing of capitalist excess " .
it needs to be remembered firstly that , already , massive regulation is in place across banking practices under the basle agreements .
the trouble has been that the banks avoided them by using " special investment vehicles " away from their balance sheets .
these animals have had a blood-bath and are unlikely to behave similarly ever again one necessary adjustment would be to simply ensure that , in future , this avoidance is prevented .
secondly , investment banks - such as lehman brothers - are virtually not regulated at all and are certainly outside basle .
however , these animals have had a blood-bath and are unlikely to behave similarly ever again .
we must not try to stop their successors finding a new business model within normal business rules .
capitalism has a good record of dramatically raising the world 's living standards over long periods of time .
regulation of banking , which enjoys the privilege of access to " lender of last resort " support from the taxpayer , is necessary to protect the taxpayer from abuse .
but we need a vigorous and competitive banking and financial system - this is vital for growth and the availability of financial flexibility across all parts of society .
any adjustments to the existing regulatory framework must keep this firmly in mind .
click here to return dr jon danielsson is a member of the london school of economics ' financial markets group we hear that the wave of mergers , nationalizations and bankruptcies in the financial world represents the failure of the old way of doing business , that the future of finance is a heavily regulated , 1950s type world .
nothing could be farther from the truth .
the costs of preventing crises mean an economy like cuba and north korea .
while some banks , with the acquiescence of banking regulators , and often with the full support of governments did get into serious trouble , it is the reaction to the crisis that really matters .
the financial system has so far passed that test .
the real tragedy would be if the official reaction to this crisis were ill thought , politically motivated , overbearing regulations while we can debate individual decisions , liquidity provisions and the rapid putting down of sick institutions is exactly the right way .
we will come out of this crisis , having learned that it is important for banks not to make assets so complicated that neither they nor anybody else understands them .
liquidity will have a central place in both banking and the regulations of banks .
we can fine-tune the existing regulatory structure and the nature of banking to deal with this .
the real tragedy would be if the official reaction to this crisis were ill thought , politically motivated , overbearing regulations .
a freewheeling financial system is essential for future prosperity .
please policymakers , do n't return us to 1929 or even to the 1950s .
click here to return richard lambert is the former editor of the financial times and head of the cbi it is sad to see hbos lose its independence in this way but we needed a good market-driven solution to deal with these speculative attacks on the bank .
this looks like the right outcome .
lloyds tsb is a strong well capitalised institution and the new entity will be well placed to withstand the current turbulence .
the government and the financial authorities also deserve credit for making it possible in a timely way .
it also good for the broader economy .
the last thing we want is a sharp contraction of bank balance sheets because of the impact it would have on the availability of credit .
we must not lose sight of the fact that the british banking system is well capitalised and regulated , perhaps it is time for us all to draw breath and calm down a little .
click here to return brendon barber is the secretary general of the trades union congress -lrb- tuc -rrb- this is not the final crisis of capitalism , but it ought to be the end of the road for a particular version of it .
the truth is that there is no single economic model of capitalism .
there has always been a considerable difference between europe 's social market and the anglo-saxon version in the us - not to mention the wild-west excesses of post-communist russia or the strange hybrid that now operates in china .
what we have seen in the last few days should rather be the last gasp of the belief that the way to secure prosperity is to let free markets rip and tear up any regulation that gets in the way of short-term profit .
already the view that the state has no role to play has gone with the nationalisation of freddie , fannie and aig in the us and northern rock in the uk .
the lessons that we need to draw are that we have given far too much importance to the city and neglected other sectors - not just traditional manufacturing , but new environmental jobs and the creative sector , to give just a few examples .
this should be neo-liberalism rip .
but the paradox that has yet to work its way through is what this means for politics .
voters are shifting to the right in their voting intention , but shifting to the left in many policy preferences as they expect government to tax the rich more , regulate the energy sector and restore sensible regulatory structures in the city .
