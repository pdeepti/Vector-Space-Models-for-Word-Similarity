speaking after meeting state premiers in berlin , the chancellor said the two sides had held " constructive talks " keeping in mind " the common responsiblity for our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has called the deal " tenable " and expects the rescue package to win parliamentary approval merkel said the two sides had agreed to share the burden of the rescue package , adding she was optimistic the legislative package would win approval in the german houses of parliament on friday .
german rescue package the biggest most of the eurozone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds .
germany 's rescue deal is the biggest , comprising 400 billion euros in guarantees , a 70-billion-euro fund and 10 billion euros of leeway .
berlin says it will need a credit of 100 billion euros to operate the bank-support scheme , but the trading fund will earn interest and dividend income from banks it takes over .
the ultimate net cost may be far less than the credit sum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has moved away from a case-to-case bailout for struggling banks finance minister peer steinbrueck explained that when the final accounts were calculated after the rescue , the states would pay 35 percent of the cost , or possibly receive 35 percent of the profits if there were any .
state premiers said this was because the states , as proprietors of state banks , would have to sustain other losses in the crisis .
" it 's a good outcome , " said juergen ruettgers , premier of north rhine westphalia .
merkel called the deal " tenable . "
berlin to create new agency for bank rescue germany has not identified which of its banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-quality derivatives .
the cost burden on the states from the wider bail-out is to be limited to 7.7 billion euros , with the federal government to pay all higher bills , steinbrueck said .
government politicians said germany would create a special agency for the bank rescue after the country 's central bank said its independence would be compromised if it became an arm of government policy .
instead of being a department of the bundesbank , it would be a legally separate unit at the bundesbank office in frankfurt .
the bundesbank , which is one of the principal central banks underpinning the european central bank in frankfurt , had earlier told berlin it did not want to be seen taking instructions from the german federal government .
to speed passage of the bill on friday , votes are set to be held in the bundestag lower chamber and the bundesrat upper chamber on the same day .
in an unusual move , the bill is to be emailed back to the german government a few hundred metres away for the final formalities .

speaking after meeting state premiers in berlin , the chancellor said the two sides had held " constructive talks " keeping in mind " the common responsiblity for our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has called the deal " tenable " and expects the rescue package to win parliamentary approval merkel said the two sides had agreed to share the burden of the rescue package , adding she was optimistic the legislative package would win approval in the german houses of parliament on friday .
german rescue package the biggest most of the eurozone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds .
germany 's rescue deal is the biggest , comprising 400 billion euros in guarantees , a 70-billion-euro fund and 10 billion euros of leeway .
berlin says it will need a credit of 100 billion euros to operate the bank-support scheme , but the trading fund will earn interest and dividend income from banks it takes over .
the ultimate net cost may be far less than the credit sum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has moved away from a case-to-case bailout for struggling banks finance minister peer steinbrueck explained that when the final accounts were calculated after the rescue , the states would pay 35 percent of the cost , or possibly receive 35 percent of the profits if there were any .
state premiers said this was because the states , as proprietors of state banks , would have to sustain other losses in the crisis .
" it 's a good outcome , " said juergen ruettgers , premier of north rhine westphalia .
merkel called the deal " tenable . "
berlin to create new agency for bank rescue germany has not identified which of its banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-quality derivatives .
the cost burden on the states from the wider bail-out is to be limited to 7.7 billion euros , with the federal government to pay all higher bills , steinbrueck said .
government politicians said germany would create a special agency for the bank rescue after the country 's central bank said its independence would be compromised if it became an arm of government policy .
instead of being a department of the bundesbank , it would be a legally separate unit at the bundesbank office in frankfurt .
the bundesbank , which is one of the principal central banks underpinning the european central bank in frankfurt , had earlier told berlin it did not want to be seen taking instructions from the german federal government .
to speed passage of the bill on friday , votes are set to be held in the bundestag lower chamber and the bundesrat upper chamber on the same day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 16.10.2008 brzezinski : west must avoid russia 's mistakes in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brzezinski warned against trying to create a democracy in afghanistan from the top down zbigniew brzezinski was instrumental in arming the afghan mujahedeen against the soviet union .
in an interview with dw , the former us security advisor talks about how the west can avoid the mistakes of the russians . zbigniew brzezinski , the son of a diplomat , was born in warsaw on march 28 , 1928 .
in the 1950s , he was considered one of the leading western experts on the soviet union .
in 1960 , brzezinski advised john f. kennedy on eastern europe during his successful candidacy for the us presidency .
known for his hawkish foreign policy , brzezinski served as national security adviser to us president jimmy carter from 1977 to 1981 .
today , brzezinski is a scholar at the center for strategic and international studies in washington and advises us democratic presidential candidate barack obama . dw-world.de : while almost all political parties in germany want the troops to remain in afghanistan , a majority of the population would prefer a withdrawal .
what should the west do - withdraw , stay the course or increase the number of troops ? zbigniew brzezinski : i do n't think any of these options can be the answer .
withdrawal means that afghanistan will plunge immediately into a major crisis with unpredictable consequences .
simply putting more troops is not the solution to the problem .
staying the course is obviously unsatisfactory because right now there is mounting evidence that the situation is deteriorating . as jimmy carter 's security advisor in 1979 , you orchestrated the arming of the mujahedeen against afghanistan 's left-wing government , eventually drawing the soviet army into what you later referred to as the " afghan trap . "
has the west now fallen into that trap ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf force in afghanistan is battling a resurgent taliban the west should not repeat the mistakes that the soviets made .
the soviets invaded afghanistan on the illusion that a bunch of marxist afghan intellectuals could help them create a communist satellite using a foreign army to impose its will .
when the us reacted to the outrageous terrorist attacks of september 11 , which originated from afghanistan , it required only 300 american soldiers to overthrow the taliban .
the reason for that was that the afghans were genuinely grateful for the american support and the support of other countries . we are now running the risk of unintentionally duplicating what the soviets were doing : instead of capitalizing on that goodwill and leaving fairly soon thereafter while giving a lot of economic assistance to the afghans , we are trying to create a modern state - and a democratic version thereof - through a large foreign military presence .
i do not think that is a wise strategy . what you are suggesting seems to be exactly what the soviet union did : before it withdrew its troops , it tried to transfer the burden of fighting to the afghan forces - and failed .
why should nato succeed , given that it has much less afghan soldiers to rely on than the soviets had ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan population is not yet completely against help from foreign governments the soviets did that after devastating the afghan society and creating massive ill will .
one should not underestimate the enormous damage and incredible suffering that the soviets imposed in the afghan society by a ruthless military campaign , which drove millions of afghans out of the country and killed hundreds of thousands of them .
we have not done that yet .
but i think the risk is that the longer we rely on a military solution , the more likely it is that the resistance to us will become stronger and stronger .
i do n't think that it is in any way comparable to the resistance against the soviet occupation yet . how can the west avoid getting there ? we can not try to create a modern , centralized , democratic state in afghanistan from the top down using essentially foreign troops to impose such a solution .
this collides with the sense of ethnic identity and religious sensitivity in a country that is very resistant to foreign intrusions .
we need an altogether different approach .
some additional troops in the short run may be necessary , but the main emphasis has to be on decentralized political accommodation with the different elements which are collectively described as the taliban but in fact representing a much more diversified group . in their nearly completed national intelligence estimate , us intelligence agencies report a " breakdown in central authority " and " rampant corruption within the karzai government . "
the british ambassador to afghanistan is said to have called for an " acceptable dictator ... " how do you create a dictator out of nothing ?
the problem in afghanistan is that it is not possible to rule it from kabul effectively , and i do not see how we create a dictator in a deus ex machina fashion .
a dictator has to have either extensive social appeal or ruthless instruments of power - or preferably both .
i do n't see that in afghanistan unless it emerges by itself at some point . how should the west deal with the drug trade that provides the taliban with funds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracking down on the drug trade will not undercut the taliban , brzezinski said simply trying to wipe out the poppies and deprive the farmers of income will not undercut the taliban , it will strengthen them .
the europeans should pay the afghan farmers as much as it takes to abandon drug crops .
the europeans should do that because most of these drugs go to europe .
the drug problem in afghanistan is simultaneously a source of income for the taliban and a serious threat to europe .
in this respect , the european responsibility for dealing with it is self-evident . there have been repeated us attacks on pakistani territory .
do you think this could further destabilize the nuclear power pakistan ? us attacks on pakistani territory should be done only under very exceptional circumstances : when there is truly reliable intelligence that very senior operatives of al qaeda are potential targets and there is no indication that the pakistani authorities are going to do anything about it .
in those circumstances , such a reaction is justifiable since al qaeda attacked the united states .
but i think sporadic attacks against some taliban activities emanating from pakistan are likely to have the effect of simply widening the hostilities , and , in effect , transforming the problems we face in afghanistan into a problem that spans both afghanistan and pakistan thereby vastly complicating the challenge that we face - while at the same time probably further destabilizing pakistan . you support barack obama .
much like john mccain , he has called for a significant increase in us troops in afghanistan ... the call for some additional troops may be justified here or there .
but additional troops are not the solution in the long run .
i think obama has a much better understanding of the problems of the 21st century than mccain and the problems we face in afghanistan are not the only problems the 21st century is putting before us .
the american definition of its role in this world has to creatively adapt to the new global complexities .

staying the course is obviously unsatisfactory because right now there is mounting evidence that the situation is deteriorating . as jimmy carter 's security advisor in 1979 , you orchestrated the arming of the mujahedeen against afghanistan 's left-wing government , eventually drawing the soviet army into what you later referred to as the " afghan trap . "
has the west now fallen into that trap ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf force in afghanistan is battling a resurgent taliban the west should not repeat the mistakes that the soviets made .
the soviets invaded afghanistan on the illusion that a bunch of marxist afghan intellectuals could help them create a communist satellite using a foreign army to impose its will .
when the us reacted to the outrageous terrorist attacks of september 11 , which originated from afghanistan , it required only 300 american soldiers to overthrow the taliban .
the reason for that was that the afghans were genuinely grateful for the american support and the support of other countries . we are now running the risk of unintentionally duplicating what the soviets were doing : instead of capitalizing on that goodwill and leaving fairly soon thereafter while giving a lot of economic assistance to the afghans , we are trying to create a modern state - and a democratic version thereof - through a large foreign military presence .
i do not think that is a wise strategy . what you are suggesting seems to be exactly what the soviet union did : before it withdrew its troops , it tried to transfer the burden of fighting to the afghan forces - and failed .
why should nato succeed , given that it has much less afghan soldiers to rely on than the soviets had ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan population is not yet completely against help from foreign governments the soviets did that after devastating the afghan society and creating massive ill will .
one should not underestimate the enormous damage and incredible suffering that the soviets imposed in the afghan society by a ruthless military campaign , which drove millions of afghans out of the country and killed hundreds of thousands of them .
we have not done that yet .
but i think the risk is that the longer we rely on a military solution , the more likely it is that the resistance to us will become stronger and stronger .
i do n't think that it is in any way comparable to the resistance against the soviet occupation yet . how can the west avoid getting there ? we can not try to create a modern , centralized , democratic state in afghanistan from the top down using essentially foreign troops to impose such a solution .
this collides with the sense of ethnic identity and religious sensitivity in a country that is very resistant to foreign intrusions .
we need an altogether different approach .
some additional troops in the short run may be necessary , but the main emphasis has to be on decentralized political accommodation with the different elements which are collectively described as the taliban but in fact representing a much more diversified group . in their nearly completed national intelligence estimate , us intelligence agencies report a " breakdown in central authority " and " rampant corruption within the karzai government . "
the british ambassador to afghanistan is said to have called for an " acceptable dictator ... " how do you create a dictator out of nothing ?
the problem in afghanistan is that it is not possible to rule it from kabul effectively , and i do not see how we create a dictator in a deus ex machina fashion .
a dictator has to have either extensive social appeal or ruthless instruments of power - or preferably both .
i do n't see that in afghanistan unless it emerges by itself at some point . how should the west deal with the drug trade that provides the taliban with funds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracking down on the drug trade will not undercut the taliban , brzezinski said simply trying to wipe out the poppies and deprive the farmers of income will not undercut the taliban , it will strengthen them .
the europeans should pay the afghan farmers as much as it takes to abandon drug crops .
the europeans should do that because most of these drugs go to europe .
the drug problem in afghanistan is simultaneously a source of income for the taliban and a serious threat to europe .
in this respect , the european responsibility for dealing with it is self-evident . there have been repeated us attacks on pakistani territory .
do you think this could further destabilize the nuclear power pakistan ? us attacks on pakistani territory should be done only under very exceptional circumstances : when there is truly reliable intelligence that very senior operatives of al qaeda are potential targets and there is no indication that the pakistani authorities are going to do anything about it .
in those circumstances , such a reaction is justifiable since al qaeda attacked the united states .
but i think sporadic attacks against some taliban activities emanating from pakistan are likely to have the effect of simply widening the hostilities , and , in effect , transforming the problems we face in afghanistan into a problem that spans both afghanistan and pakistan thereby vastly complicating the challenge that we face - while at the same time probably further destabilizing pakistan . you support barack obama .
much like john mccain , he has called for a significant increase in us troops in afghanistan ... the call for some additional troops may be justified here or there .
but additional troops are not the solution in the long run .
i think obama has a much better understanding of the problems of the 21st century than mccain and the problems we face in afghanistan are not the only problems the 21st century is putting before us .
the american definition of its role in this world has to creatively adapt to the new global complexities .

in an interview with dw , the former us security advisor talks about how the west can avoid the mistakes of the russians . zbigniew brzezinski , the son of a diplomat , was born in warsaw on march 28 , 1928 .
in the 1950s , he was considered one of the leading western experts on the soviet union .

i do n't think that it is in any way comparable to the resistance against the soviet occupation yet . how can the west avoid getting there ? we can not try to create a modern , centralized , democratic state in afghanistan from the top down using essentially foreign troops to impose such a solution .
this collides with the sense of ethnic identity and religious sensitivity in a country that is very resistant to foreign intrusions .
we need an altogether different approach .
some additional troops in the short run may be necessary , but the main emphasis has to be on decentralized political accommodation with the different elements which are collectively described as the taliban but in fact representing a much more diversified group . in their nearly completed national intelligence estimate , us intelligence agencies report a " breakdown in central authority " and " rampant corruption within the karzai government . "
the british ambassador to afghanistan is said to have called for an " acceptable dictator ... " how do you create a dictator out of nothing ?
the problem in afghanistan is that it is not possible to rule it from kabul effectively , and i do not see how we create a dictator in a deus ex machina fashion .
a dictator has to have either extensive social appeal or ruthless instruments of power - or preferably both .
i do n't see that in afghanistan unless it emerges by itself at some point . how should the west deal with the drug trade that provides the taliban with funds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracking down on the drug trade will not undercut the taliban , brzezinski said simply trying to wipe out the poppies and deprive the farmers of income will not undercut the taliban , it will strengthen them .
the europeans should pay the afghan farmers as much as it takes to abandon drug crops .
the europeans should do that because most of these drugs go to europe .
the drug problem in afghanistan is simultaneously a source of income for the taliban and a serious threat to europe .
in this respect , the european responsibility for dealing with it is self-evident . there have been repeated us attacks on pakistani territory .
do you think this could further destabilize the nuclear power pakistan ? us attacks on pakistani territory should be done only under very exceptional circumstances : when there is truly reliable intelligence that very senior operatives of al qaeda are potential targets and there is no indication that the pakistani authorities are going to do anything about it .
in those circumstances , such a reaction is justifiable since al qaeda attacked the united states .
but i think sporadic attacks against some taliban activities emanating from pakistan are likely to have the effect of simply widening the hostilities , and , in effect , transforming the problems we face in afghanistan into a problem that spans both afghanistan and pakistan thereby vastly complicating the challenge that we face - while at the same time probably further destabilizing pakistan . you support barack obama .
much like john mccain , he has called for a significant increase in us troops in afghanistan ... the call for some additional troops may be justified here or there .
but additional troops are not the solution in the long run .
i think obama has a much better understanding of the problems of the 21st century than mccain and the problems we face in afghanistan are not the only problems the 21st century is putting before us .
the american definition of its role in this world has to creatively adapt to the new global complexities .
i do n't see much evidence that mccain understands that need .
obama is much more qualified . interview : dennis stute -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier this month , lerch admitted he advised the libyans on how to build a piping system for a uranium-enrichment plant .
prosecutor wolfgang siegmund said earlier thursday the defendant helped libyan interests , but had not been a member of an international network of nuclear smugglers led by the rogue pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan .

defendant endangered international peace a previous trial which began in july 2006 had to be called off after the bomb plans - regarded as evidence by the defense team - were shredded by swiss authorities .
under an agreement with the defense to settle with a compromise , prosecutor siegmund dropped an allegation that the defendant was the builder and supplier of a gas ultra centrifuge system to refine uranium for libya 's bomb .
siegmund , who pressed for a six-year prison term , said thursday that libya in fact came nowhere close to making its own bomb , but the defendant 's actions had endangered international peace .

earlier this month , lerch admitted he advised the libyans on how to build a piping system for a uranium-enrichment plant .
prosecutor wolfgang siegmund said earlier thursday the defendant helped libyan interests , but had not been a member of an international network of nuclear smugglers led by the rogue pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan .
us and german intelligence agents uncovered the plans to export the piping system , earlier media reports said .
libya has since abandoned its nuclear ambitions .
the defendant was convicted of breaching german laws restricting exports of militarily useful products .
defendant endangered international peace a previous trial which began in july 2006 had to be called off after the bomb plans - regarded as evidence by the defense team - were shredded by swiss authorities .
under an agreement with the defense to settle with a compromise , prosecutor siegmund dropped an allegation that the defendant was the builder and supplier of a gas ultra centrifuge system to refine uranium for libya 's bomb .
siegmund , who pressed for a six-year prison term , said thursday that libya in fact came nowhere close to making its own bomb , but the defendant 's actions had endangered international peace .
the abdul qadeer khan network allegedly supplied equipment to iran , libya and north korea using front companies in south africa and malaysia . dpa news agency -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

social groups will be out on the streets to protest the event . it 's tough being rich these days .
not only are the well-heeled seeing their assets plunge in value in the global financial crisis , now even small highlights on the social calendar , such as the " millionaire fair " in munich , are at risk of being spoiled by a noisy group of social activists .
among the protest actions planned for the opening day of the exclusive life style event is a symbolic slave market that aims to turn the spotlight on wage dumping in germany and around the world .
" our aim is not to pillory people , but to attack existing social conditions , " said walter listl from the city 's social forum . " riches are the cause of poverty . "
just a few meters away from the entrance to the venue on thursday , oct .
16 , demonstrators will be auctioning off cheap labor , singing anti-capitalist songs and staging sketches lampooning the bank bailout .
inside , visitors will be admiring private jets , high-end cars , lavish jewelry and haute couture .
this is the first time that the millionaire fair , first held in 2002 , has taken place in germany .
previous venues have included shanghai , moscow and amsterdam .
the affluent southern german city of munich in the country 's richest state , bavaria , is an obvious choice .
it also played host to the luxury fair earlier in the year .
playground for the rich and famous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refreshments at the fair include champagne and caviar fair organizers expect the event to attract some 20,000 people , including the rich and famous , top business people , luxury goods retailers , bon viveurs and just the plain curious .
at 39 euros -lrb- $ 52 -rrb- for an entrance ticket , you do n't need to be a millionaire to get in .
and who knows who you might rub shoulders with .
film stars like joan collins and elizabeth hurley and singer bryan ferry were among the guests at previous millionaire fairs .
for four days , some 100 firms will be setting out their stalls across 16,000 square meters of exhibition space .
according to the official web site , " the creme de la créme of luxury goods industry will be presenting their most beautiful one-off creations , the most exclusive products and unusual services to the event 's discerning visitors . "
or as one supplier 's press release puts it , the fair will offer " a cornucopia of all the most beautiful and luxurious things the world has to offer . "
" obscene display of perverse wealth " in walter listl 's eyes , it represents " an obscene display of perverse wealth . "
" according to un statistics , a child dies every five seconds of malnutrition or from easily treatable diseases , " listl added .
" they ’ re showcasing mobile phones studded with precious gems .
we can ’ t just sit back and ignore that . "
germany 's first millionaire fair is prompting munich 's social forum to break new ground .
the network of some 40 local groups - all with a decidedly anticapitalist bent , according to walter listl - has not targeted specific events like this before .
" it 's the first time that we have staged something a bit spectacular aimed at a particular event of this kind , " listl said .
" we are doing it for very topical and acute reasons . "

96 parliamentarians voted against and 32 abstained .
under a previous parliamentary mandate , germany was allowed to send up to 3,500 troops to afghanistan .
the vote on thursday increases that number to 4,500 .
the mandate is valid for 14 months .
troop morale at a low the vote comes at a time when morale among german troops in afghanistan is low as they face increased attacks from a resurgent taliban .
five years ago , when the german army began its mission in northern afghanistan , the region was regarded as one of the country 's safest .
now , the solders run the daily risk of " being caught in an explosive or being shot at , " one officer said .
during the last year , the security situation has deteriorated not only in the north , but all across afghanistan .
the afghan presidential election , likely to shape the country 's future for years to come , is scheduled around autumn 2009 , making a further escalation of violence in the coming year more than likely .
as voter registration started last week , taliban spokesman kari jussif ahmadi warned the population against registering , saying it was a " waste of time , " as the militants were set to prevent the election from happening .
" more than half of the country is in our hands , and we will not let it happen , " he said .
added danger posed by upcoming election while the taliban are unlikely to prevent the polls - they failed to do so in 2004 despite grand announcements to the contrary - they are believed to be strong enough to severely disrupt the run-up to the election .
the international community has made it clear that securing the election will be one of the most important tasks in 2009 .
the german troops within the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- will also play a role in the training of afghan security forces , a process that must be speeded up after being promoted too timidly for a long time .
there is no doubt that this will be dangerous .
even today , the duty of the 4,500 german soldiers is a far cry from the beginning of the mission , when isaf troops really were peacekeepers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers ' deaths have changed the way troops view their mission soldiers at the german camp in the northern province of kunduz nicknamed the full moon " rocket weather , " because of the many attacks raining down on them by moonlight .
in september , a german soldier was killed in an attack .
" you have an odd feeling when you leave the camp on a mission , " said an officer , who did not want to give his name .
" it sensitizes you , but also creates a distance to the population .
just being present , just walking down to the bazaar , like we did two , three years ago , that 's not possible anymore . "
little support on the home front other soldiers believe that the german population does not appreciate their work , which only makes headline news when attacks occur .
" the soldiers want more interest in germany , and that there is not just focus -lrb- on them -rrb- when something happens , " the german bundeswehr in afghanistan said in a statement .
" more appreciation of the efforts here would be welcome , after all soldiers here can die for germany , " the army said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he added that he would do everything possible to make the meeting work out .
late wednesday , georgia and russia were supposed to gather for internationally-backed peace talks in geneva .
but they broke down on the first day when the rivals , who fought a war in august , blamed each other for the failure to even enter the same room .
talks are unlikely to resume until november , solana added .
sergei shamba , foreign minister of the pro-russian separatist region of abkhazia , told afp news service that on wednesday " there were two separate meetings , the russians and the abkhazians -lrb- in one -rrb- and the georgians in another , " he said .
' procedural difficulties ' at fault it would have been the first time representatives of the two sides have held direct negotiations since the five-day war after russia thwarted a georgian assault to retake its breakaway region of south ossetia .
russia has kept troops in south ossetia and another rebel region , abkhazia , and recognises both as independent states .
pierre morel , an official for the european union , which organized the talks with the united nations and organization for security and cooperation in europe , blamed " procedural difficulties " for the quick suspension of the negotiations .

russia would not take part in any further talks with georgia if representatives from south ossetia and abkhazia were not invited , russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said .
the americans injected a third element to the breakdown , with its head of delegation daniel fried saying that it was the south ossetians and abkhazians who failed to exhibit a " constructive spirit " to keep talks going .
" unfortunately ... the de facto authorities of south ossetia and abkhazia who were present at the meeting , i 'm sorry to say did not exhibit such a constructive spirit - they chose instead to walk out of the informational session , " he told afp .
tension between parties following the walkout , the parties demanded to be treated as full national delegations before coming back to talks , but " no one was prepared to do that , " said fried .
" this was unfortunate and so the session ended early because the south ossetians and abkhaz walked out , " he added .
even before the session , there was tension over the participation of the abkhazians and the south ossetians , with russia insisting there could be no agreements without their presence .
the georgians had argued that the official talks should only include representatives of georgia , russia , the united states , the european union , the osce and the un .
russia has said it wants security guarantees and a ban on all weapons sales to georgia , which in has demanded that all russian troops leave georgian territory , including south ossetia and abkhazia .
russia called on the georgians to sign " concrete and legally binding " security pacts with the two breakaway regions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 16.10.2008 german parliament approves extra troops for afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extra troops raises the total number of german soldiers in afghanistan to 4,500 germany 's lower house of parliament voted on thursday to increase the number of troops berlin can send to afghanistan by 1,000 soldiers and extended the mission 's mandate by 14 months . a majority of 442 lawmakers voted to support a proposal by chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition to extend berlin 's participation in a nato-led peacekeeping mission , which currently includes just over 50,000 soldiers .
96 parliamentarians voted against and 32 abstained .
under a previous parliamentary mandate , germany was allowed to send up to 3,500 troops to afghanistan .
the vote on thursday increases that number to 4,500 .
the mandate is valid for 14 months .
troop morale at a low the vote comes at a time when morale among german troops in afghanistan is low as they face increased attacks from a resurgent taliban .
five years ago , when the german army began its mission in northern afghanistan , the region was regarded as one of the country 's safest .
now , the solders run the daily risk of " being caught in an explosive or being shot at , " one officer said .
during the last year , the security situation has deteriorated not only in the north , but all across afghanistan .
the afghan presidential election , likely to shape the country 's future for years to come , is scheduled around autumn 2009 , making a further escalation of violence in the coming year more than likely .
as voter registration started last week , taliban spokesman kari jussif ahmadi warned the population against registering , saying it was a " waste of time , " as the militants were set to prevent the election from happening .
" more than half of the country is in our hands , and we will not let it happen , " he said .
added danger posed by upcoming election while the taliban are unlikely to prevent the polls - they failed to do so in 2004 despite grand announcements to the contrary - they are believed to be strong enough to severely disrupt the run-up to the election .
the international community has made it clear that securing the election will be one of the most important tasks in 2009 .
the german troops within the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- will also play a role in the training of afghan security forces , a process that must be speeded up after being promoted too timidly for a long time .
there is no doubt that this will be dangerous .
even today , the duty of the 4,500 german soldiers is a far cry from the beginning of the mission , when isaf troops really were peacekeepers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers ' deaths have changed the way troops view their mission soldiers at the german camp in the northern province of kunduz nicknamed the full moon " rocket weather , " because of the many attacks raining down on them by moonlight .
in september , a german soldier was killed in an attack .
" you have an odd feeling when you leave the camp on a mission , " said an officer , who did not want to give his name .
" it sensitizes you , but also creates a distance to the population .
just being present , just walking down to the bazaar , like we did two , three years ago , that 's not possible anymore . "
little support on the home front other soldiers believe that the german population does not appreciate their work , which only makes headline news when attacks occur .
" the soldiers want more interest in germany , and that there is not just focus -lrb- on them -rrb- when something happens , " the german bundeswehr in afghanistan said in a statement .
" more appreciation of the efforts here would be welcome , after all soldiers here can die for germany , " the army said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

96 parliamentarians voted against and 32 abstained .
under a previous parliamentary mandate , germany was allowed to send up to 3,500 troops to afghanistan .
the vote on thursday increases that number to 4,500 .
the mandate is valid for 14 months .
troop morale at a low the vote comes at a time when morale among german troops in afghanistan is low as they face increased attacks from a resurgent taliban .
five years ago , when the german army began its mission in northern afghanistan , the region was regarded as one of the country 's safest .
now , the solders run the daily risk of " being caught in an explosive or being shot at , " one officer said .
during the last year , the security situation has deteriorated not only in the north , but all across afghanistan .
the afghan presidential election , likely to shape the country 's future for years to come , is scheduled around autumn 2009 , making a further escalation of violence in the coming year more than likely .
as voter registration started last week , taliban spokesman kari jussif ahmadi warned the population against registering , saying it was a " waste of time , " as the militants were set to prevent the election from happening .
" more than half of the country is in our hands , and we will not let it happen , " he said .
added danger posed by upcoming election while the taliban are unlikely to prevent the polls - they failed to do so in 2004 despite grand announcements to the contrary - they are believed to be strong enough to severely disrupt the run-up to the election .
the international community has made it clear that securing the election will be one of the most important tasks in 2009 .
the german troops within the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- will also play a role in the training of afghan security forces , a process that must be speeded up after being promoted too timidly for a long time .
there is no doubt that this will be dangerous .
even today , the duty of the 4,500 german soldiers is a far cry from the beginning of the mission , when isaf troops really were peacekeepers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.10.2008 german industry calls for increased government investment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german industries are calling on the government to help them ride out the crisis with the credit crunch and a pending recession , governments do n't have much money to throw around .
according to german industry groups , berlin ca n't afford not to toss a little cash their way . the president of the german national industrial federation bdi , juergen thumann , has demanded more government investments to help alleviate the problems caused by the financial crisis . “ the federal government should in no way reduce the amount of their investments , in fact they should increase them , ” thumann was quoted as saying in the german daily der tagesspiegel . thumann said infrastructure projects should be renewed , especially in conjunction with private companies . “ i ’ m thinking of building roads , airports and power plants .
there are more than enough projects , ” he added . the bdi chief also encouraged the government to continue trying to balance the budget , even if it isn ’ t possible to do it in the next few years .
originally berlin had set a goal of 2011 , but in the face of the international financial crisis and the billions of euros being pumped into rescue packages , that now seems like a long shot . experts call for stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straubhaar is in favor of a stimulus package meanwhile the head of the hamburg world economics institute -lrb- hwwi -rrb- , thomas straubhaar , said that the government should give the people money to help stimulate the economy . “ every taxpayer should get a check from the government before the end of this year , ” he was quoted as saying in the german daily hamburger abendblatt . straubhaar suggested that each tax paying adult receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 134 -rrb- in november and 100 euros in december . “ everyone should get the same amount .
that 's because it isn ’ t just doing something for the people , but for the economy as well , ” he added . in spite of increasingly gloomy forecasts for the european economy , leaders have no plans for launching a concerted eu stimulus plan to boost activity , said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker . " who would pay for it and with what money ? " said juncker , who also chairs the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers .
" i do n't see how we could finance such a big stimulus plan . " germany on the brink of recession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts have said germany is headed for a recession this comes on the heels of an announcement by the german government that the country is on the verge of a recession , due to the financial crisis and the struggling world economy .
the ongoing economic downturn led the government to lower the 2009 growth forecast in europe 's biggest economy from 1.2 percent down to 0.2 percent .
but economy minister michael glos said in berlin that there is no need to panic .
for the current year , the minister is still expecting gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.7 percent .
though that number is also down from 2.5 percent .
" we are just seeing some slowdown in the economy , " glos said .
" there is nothing to sugarcoat or cover up . "
too early to foresee crisis ' outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said germany should reform its tax system glos insisted that his latest forecasts entailed a " high degree of uncertainty " as it was still too early to predict exactly how the current financial crisis would affect the real economy .
glos went on to say that the financial firestorm that swept through markets in recent weeks underscored the need for germany to overhaul its tax system .
" beyond what we 've already agreed , there is an urgent need for tax relief , " said glos .
according to government forecasts , the economic slowdown will also leave its mark on the german labor market , where unemployment has been shrinking for more than two years .
glos predicted that the jobless total will average an annual 3.3 million next year , the same level as this year . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to german industry groups , berlin ca n't afford not to toss a little cash their way . the president of the german national industrial federation bdi , juergen thumann , has demanded more government investments to help alleviate the problems caused by the financial crisis . “ the federal government should in no way reduce the amount of their investments , in fact they should increase them , ” thumann was quoted as saying in the german daily der tagesspiegel . thumann said infrastructure projects should be renewed , especially in conjunction with private companies . “ i ’ m thinking of building roads , airports and power plants .
there are more than enough projects , ” he added . the bdi chief also encouraged the government to continue trying to balance the budget , even if it isn ’ t possible to do it in the next few years .
originally berlin had set a goal of 2011 , but in the face of the international financial crisis and the billions of euros being pumped into rescue packages , that now seems like a long shot . experts call for stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straubhaar is in favor of a stimulus package meanwhile the head of the hamburg world economics institute -lrb- hwwi -rrb- , thomas straubhaar , said that the government should give the people money to help stimulate the economy . “ every taxpayer should get a check from the government before the end of this year , ” he was quoted as saying in the german daily hamburger abendblatt . straubhaar suggested that each tax paying adult receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 134 -rrb- in november and 100 euros in december . “ everyone should get the same amount .
that 's because it isn ’ t just doing something for the people , but for the economy as well , ” he added . in spite of increasingly gloomy forecasts for the european economy , leaders have no plans for launching a concerted eu stimulus plan to boost activity , said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker . " who would pay for it and with what money ? " said juncker , who also chairs the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers .

the ongoing economic downturn led the government to lower the 2009 growth forecast in europe 's biggest economy from 1.2 percent down to 0.2 percent .
but economy minister michael glos said in berlin that there is no need to panic .
for the current year , the minister is still expecting gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.7 percent .
though that number is also down from 2.5 percent .
" we are just seeing some slowdown in the economy , " glos said .
" there is nothing to sugarcoat or cover up . "

glos went on to say that the financial firestorm that swept through markets in recent weeks underscored the need for germany to overhaul its tax system .
" beyond what we 've already agreed , there is an urgent need for tax relief , " said glos .
according to government forecasts , the economic slowdown will also leave its mark on the german labor market , where unemployment has been shrinking for more than two years .
glos predicted that the jobless total will average an annual 3.3 million next year , the same level as this year . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not have the right to miss this opportunity for reconstructing our system of finance in the 21st century , " french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , said in brussels on thursday , oct 16 . for the first time , eu leaders also addressed the fallout of the credit crunch on the real economy amid mounting fears of a deep recession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's car industry is already feeling the bite of the financial crisis " of course we see that the economic crisis is there , and the question i asked was : if we can bring coordinated answers to the financial crisis , can we not bring a coordinated answer to the economic crisis ? "
sarkozy said , pledging that france would take initiatives on the matter . " outside the financial sector , the european council -lrb- summit -rrb- underlines its determination to take the necessary steps to support growth and jobs , " the final summit statement said . " it calls on the the european commission to make appropriate proposals before the end of the year notably to preserve the competitiveness of european industry . " international emergency summit eu leaders are also leading calls for an international emergency summit , perhaps after us elections next month , to reshape the financial system while washington has shown less enthusiasm . sarkozy said he and european commission president jose manuel barroso would travel to meet us president george w. bush on saturday to help prepare for a summit that would decide on a " refoundation of capitalism . " despite the tough talk , global stock markets on thursday continued their freefall , pummelled by signs the world 's biggest economies were headed for recession after a month of financial sector turmoil . in a statement , the eu also called for the first time for a coordinated system of financial supervision at eu level and the creation of a crisis cell to help manage the financial turmoil . as a first step , german chancellor angela merkel told reporters , national central bank governors will meet at least once a month to exchange information on financial supervision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets have reacted warily to rescue plans by western governments the heads of the european central bank , the eu presidency , the executive european commission and the eurogroup of 15 countries that share the euro currency will all take part in the financial crisis management cell . a 2 trillion euro -lrb- 2.7 trillion dollar -rrb- rescue package , initially approved by eurozone leaders at a meeting in paris over the weekend , includes measures to safeguard private savers , guarantee interbank lending and partly nationalize shaky financial insitutions .
it follows a similar initiative approved in the united states , where the global credit crunch originated .
new bretton woods the agreement in brussels came after hours of discussions that saw member states such as the czech republic complain that it would allow for too much state intervention .
but the real surprise in brussels came not from the czechs but from brown .
despite his reputation as a eurosceptic , fellow eu leaders listened carefully to britain 's former chancellor of the exchequer as he outlined his plans for " a new bretton woods " that would avoid future financial breakdowns .
the 1944 bretton woods conference laid out the foundations of post-world war ii capitalism by establishing rules for the international monetary and financial order and by creating such bodies as the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
" global financial markets present challenges that no one nation can solve in isolation , " brown said in a letter distributed to eu heads of state and government in brussels .
" we must therefore strengthen global cooperation and build a new global financial architecture for the years ahead - a new bretton woods , which recognizes the globalization of financial risk in the responsibilities of global institutions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has called for a " new bretton woods " brown 's four-point plan envisages " a global early warning system " to prevent future financial crises from spreading , " globally accepted standards of supervision and regulation , " effective " cross-border supervision " of the world 's 30 largest multinationals and " cooperation and concerted action " during times of crisis .
his proposals were expected to be discussed by a forthcoming group of eight summit extended to include emerging powers such as china and india .
fighting climate change # b # eu leaders also agreed on thursday to reach a final deal on how to fight climate change in december after polish threats of a veto were won over , officials said .
" the objectives remain unchanged and the calendar remains the same .
it is now up to -lrb- european commission -rrb- president -lrb- jose manuel -rrb- barroso and myself to find solutions for those countries that have expressed their worries , " sarkozy said .
as the summit opened on wednesday , poland threatened to veto a declaration calling for a decision on the eu 's proposed climate-change laws in december , saying that its concerns over the economic impact of the proposed laws had not been taken into account .
seven other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe backed that call , accusing the european commission of not taking their earlier efforts on climate change into account .
and italy joined the revolt , arguing that it would be too expensive to implement the laws given the present financial crisis .
but on thursday morning , the french government proposed a new resolution sticking to the december deadline but promising to take into account the " specific situation " in each member state . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not have the right to miss this opportunity for reconstructing our system of finance in the 21st century , " french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , said in brussels on thursday , oct 16 . for the first time , eu leaders also addressed the fallout of the credit crunch on the real economy amid mounting fears of a deep recession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's car industry is already feeling the bite of the financial crisis " of course we see that the economic crisis is there , and the question i asked was : if we can bring coordinated answers to the financial crisis , can we not bring a coordinated answer to the economic crisis ? "
sarkozy said , pledging that france would take initiatives on the matter . " outside the financial sector , the european council -lrb- summit -rrb- underlines its determination to take the necessary steps to support growth and jobs , " the final summit statement said . " it calls on the the european commission to make appropriate proposals before the end of the year notably to preserve the competitiveness of european industry . " international emergency summit eu leaders are also leading calls for an international emergency summit , perhaps after us elections next month , to reshape the financial system while washington has shown less enthusiasm . sarkozy said he and european commission president jose manuel barroso would travel to meet us president george w. bush on saturday to help prepare for a summit that would decide on a " refoundation of capitalism . " despite the tough talk , global stock markets on thursday continued their freefall , pummelled by signs the world 's biggest economies were headed for recession after a month of financial sector turmoil . in a statement , the eu also called for the first time for a coordinated system of financial supervision at eu level and the creation of a crisis cell to help manage the financial turmoil . as a first step , german chancellor angela merkel told reporters , national central bank governors will meet at least once a month to exchange information on financial supervision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets have reacted warily to rescue plans by western governments the heads of the european central bank , the eu presidency , the executive european commission and the eurogroup of 15 countries that share the euro currency will all take part in the financial crisis management cell . a 2 trillion euro -lrb- 2.7 trillion dollar -rrb- rescue package , initially approved by eurozone leaders at a meeting in paris over the weekend , includes measures to safeguard private savers , guarantee interbank lending and partly nationalize shaky financial insitutions .
it follows a similar initiative approved in the united states , where the global credit crunch originated .
new bretton woods the agreement in brussels came after hours of discussions that saw member states such as the czech republic complain that it would allow for too much state intervention .
but the real surprise in brussels came not from the czechs but from brown .
despite his reputation as a eurosceptic , fellow eu leaders listened carefully to britain 's former chancellor of the exchequer as he outlined his plans for " a new bretton woods " that would avoid future financial breakdowns .
the 1944 bretton woods conference laid out the foundations of post-world war ii capitalism by establishing rules for the international monetary and financial order and by creating such bodies as the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
" global financial markets present challenges that no one nation can solve in isolation , " brown said in a letter distributed to eu heads of state and government in brussels .
" we must therefore strengthen global cooperation and build a new global financial architecture for the years ahead - a new bretton woods , which recognizes the globalization of financial risk in the responsibilities of global institutions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has called for a " new bretton woods " brown 's four-point plan envisages " a global early warning system " to prevent future financial crises from spreading , " globally accepted standards of supervision and regulation , " effective " cross-border supervision " of the world 's 30 largest multinationals and " cooperation and concerted action " during times of crisis .
his proposals were expected to be discussed by a forthcoming group of eight summit extended to include emerging powers such as china and india .
fighting climate change # b # eu leaders also agreed on thursday to reach a final deal on how to fight climate change in december after polish threats of a veto were won over , officials said .
" the objectives remain unchanged and the calendar remains the same .
it is now up to -lrb- european commission -rrb- president -lrb- jose manuel -rrb- barroso and myself to find solutions for those countries that have expressed their worries , " sarkozy said .
as the summit opened on wednesday , poland threatened to veto a declaration calling for a decision on the eu 's proposed climate-change laws in december , saying that its concerns over the economic impact of the proposed laws had not been taken into account .
seven other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe backed that call , accusing the european commission of not taking their earlier efforts on climate change into account .
and italy joined the revolt , arguing that it would be too expensive to implement the laws given the present financial crisis .
but on thursday morning , the french government proposed a new resolution sticking to the december deadline but promising to take into account the " specific situation " in each member state . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to german industry groups , berlin ca n't afford not to toss a little cash their way . the president of the german national industrial federation bdi , juergen thumann , has demanded more government investments to help alleviate the problems caused by the financial crisis . “ the federal government should in no way reduce the amount of their investments , in fact they should increase them , ” thumann was quoted as saying in the german daily der tagesspiegel . thumann said infrastructure projects should be renewed , especially in conjunction with private companies . “ i ’ m thinking of building roads , airports and power plants .
there are more than enough projects , ” he added . the bdi chief also encouraged the government to continue trying to balance the budget , even if it isn ’ t possible to do it in the next few years .
originally berlin had set a goal of 2011 , but in the face of the international financial crisis and the billions of euros being pumped into rescue packages , that now seems like a long shot . experts call for stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straubhaar is in favor of a stimulus package meanwhile the head of the hamburg world economics institute -lrb- hwwi -rrb- , thomas straubhaar , said that the government should give the people money to help stimulate the economy . “ every taxpayer should get a check from the government before the end of this year , ” he was quoted as saying in the german daily hamburger abendblatt . straubhaar suggested that each tax paying adult receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 134 -rrb- in november and 100 euros in december . “ everyone should get the same amount .
that 's because it isn ’ t just doing something for the people , but for the economy as well , ” he added . in spite of increasingly gloomy forecasts for the european economy , leaders have no plans for launching a concerted eu stimulus plan to boost activity , said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker . " who would pay for it and with what money ? " said juncker , who also chairs the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers .
" i do n't see how we could finance such a big stimulus plan . " germany on the brink of recession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts have said germany is headed for a recession this comes on the heels of an announcement by the german government that the country is on the verge of a recession , due to the financial crisis and the struggling world economy .
the ongoing economic downturn led the government to lower the 2009 growth forecast in europe 's biggest economy from 1.2 percent down to 0.2 percent .
but economy minister michael glos said in berlin that there is no need to panic .
for the current year , the minister is still expecting gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.7 percent .
though that number is also down from 2.5 percent .
" we are just seeing some slowdown in the economy , " glos said .
" there is nothing to sugarcoat or cover up . "
too early to foresee crisis ' outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said germany should reform its tax system glos insisted that his latest forecasts entailed a " high degree of uncertainty " as it was still too early to predict exactly how the current financial crisis would affect the real economy .
glos went on to say that the financial firestorm that swept through markets in recent weeks underscored the need for germany to overhaul its tax system .
" beyond what we 've already agreed , there is an urgent need for tax relief , " said glos .
according to government forecasts , the economic slowdown will also leave its mark on the german labor market , where unemployment has been shrinking for more than two years .
glos predicted that the jobless total will average an annual 3.3 million next year , the same level as this year . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.10.2008 german industry calls for increased government investment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german industries are calling on the government to help them ride out the crisis with the credit crunch and a pending recession , governments do n't have much money to throw around .
according to german industry groups , berlin ca n't afford not to toss a little cash their way . the president of the german national industrial federation bdi , juergen thumann , has demanded more government investments to help alleviate the problems caused by the financial crisis . “ the federal government should in no way reduce the amount of their investments , in fact they should increase them , ” thumann was quoted as saying in the german daily der tagesspiegel . thumann said infrastructure projects should be renewed , especially in conjunction with private companies . “ i ’ m thinking of building roads , airports and power plants .
there are more than enough projects , ” he added . the bdi chief also encouraged the government to continue trying to balance the budget , even if it isn ’ t possible to do it in the next few years .
originally berlin had set a goal of 2011 , but in the face of the international financial crisis and the billions of euros being pumped into rescue packages , that now seems like a long shot . experts call for stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straubhaar is in favor of a stimulus package meanwhile the head of the hamburg world economics institute -lrb- hwwi -rrb- , thomas straubhaar , said that the government should give the people money to help stimulate the economy . “ every taxpayer should get a check from the government before the end of this year , ” he was quoted as saying in the german daily hamburger abendblatt . straubhaar suggested that each tax paying adult receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 134 -rrb- in november and 100 euros in december . “ everyone should get the same amount .
that 's because it isn ’ t just doing something for the people , but for the economy as well , ” he added . in spite of increasingly gloomy forecasts for the european economy , leaders have no plans for launching a concerted eu stimulus plan to boost activity , said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker . " who would pay for it and with what money ? " said juncker , who also chairs the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers .
" i do n't see how we could finance such a big stimulus plan . " germany on the brink of recession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts have said germany is headed for a recession this comes on the heels of an announcement by the german government that the country is on the verge of a recession , due to the financial crisis and the struggling world economy .
the ongoing economic downturn led the government to lower the 2009 growth forecast in europe 's biggest economy from 1.2 percent down to 0.2 percent .
but economy minister michael glos said in berlin that there is no need to panic .
for the current year , the minister is still expecting gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.7 percent .
though that number is also down from 2.5 percent .
" we are just seeing some slowdown in the economy , " glos said .
" there is nothing to sugarcoat or cover up . "
too early to foresee crisis ' outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said germany should reform its tax system glos insisted that his latest forecasts entailed a " high degree of uncertainty " as it was still too early to predict exactly how the current financial crisis would affect the real economy .
glos went on to say that the financial firestorm that swept through markets in recent weeks underscored the need for germany to overhaul its tax system .
" beyond what we 've already agreed , there is an urgent need for tax relief , " said glos .
according to government forecasts , the economic slowdown will also leave its mark on the german labor market , where unemployment has been shrinking for more than two years .

according to german industry groups , berlin ca n't afford not to toss a little cash their way . the president of the german national industrial federation bdi , juergen thumann , has demanded more government investments to help alleviate the problems caused by the financial crisis . “ the federal government should in no way reduce the amount of their investments , in fact they should increase them , ” thumann was quoted as saying in the german daily der tagesspiegel . thumann said infrastructure projects should be renewed , especially in conjunction with private companies . “ i ’ m thinking of building roads , airports and power plants .
there are more than enough projects , ” he added . the bdi chief also encouraged the government to continue trying to balance the budget , even if it isn ’ t possible to do it in the next few years .
originally berlin had set a goal of 2011 , but in the face of the international financial crisis and the billions of euros being pumped into rescue packages , that now seems like a long shot . experts call for stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straubhaar is in favor of a stimulus package meanwhile the head of the hamburg world economics institute -lrb- hwwi -rrb- , thomas straubhaar , said that the government should give the people money to help stimulate the economy . “ every taxpayer should get a check from the government before the end of this year , ” he was quoted as saying in the german daily hamburger abendblatt . straubhaar suggested that each tax paying adult receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 134 -rrb- in november and 100 euros in december . “ everyone should get the same amount .
that 's because it isn ’ t just doing something for the people , but for the economy as well , ” he added . in spite of increasingly gloomy forecasts for the european economy , leaders have no plans for launching a concerted eu stimulus plan to boost activity , said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker . " who would pay for it and with what money ? " said juncker , who also chairs the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers .
" i do n't see how we could finance such a big stimulus plan . " germany on the brink of recession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts have said germany is headed for a recession this comes on the heels of an announcement by the german government that the country is on the verge of a recession , due to the financial crisis and the struggling world economy .
the ongoing economic downturn led the government to lower the 2009 growth forecast in europe 's biggest economy from 1.2 percent down to 0.2 percent .
but economy minister michael glos said in berlin that there is no need to panic .
for the current year , the minister is still expecting gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.7 percent .
though that number is also down from 2.5 percent .
" we are just seeing some slowdown in the economy , " glos said .
" there is nothing to sugarcoat or cover up . "
too early to foresee crisis ' outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said germany should reform its tax system glos insisted that his latest forecasts entailed a " high degree of uncertainty " as it was still too early to predict exactly how the current financial crisis would affect the real economy .
glos went on to say that the financial firestorm that swept through markets in recent weeks underscored the need for germany to overhaul its tax system .
" beyond what we 've already agreed , there is an urgent need for tax relief , " said glos .
according to government forecasts , the economic slowdown will also leave its mark on the german labor market , where unemployment has been shrinking for more than two years .

originally berlin had set a goal of 2011 , but in the face of the international financial crisis and the billions of euros being pumped into rescue packages , that now seems like a long shot . experts call for stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straubhaar is in favor of a stimulus package meanwhile the head of the hamburg world economics institute -lrb- hwwi -rrb- , thomas straubhaar , said that the government should give the people money to help stimulate the economy . “ every taxpayer should get a check from the government before the end of this year , ” he was quoted as saying in the german daily hamburger abendblatt . straubhaar suggested that each tax paying adult receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 134 -rrb- in november and 100 euros in december . “ everyone should get the same amount .
that 's because it isn ’ t just doing something for the people , but for the economy as well , ” he added . in spite of increasingly gloomy forecasts for the european economy , leaders have no plans for launching a concerted eu stimulus plan to boost activity , said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker . " who would pay for it and with what money ? " said juncker , who also chairs the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers .
" i do n't see how we could finance such a big stimulus plan . " germany on the brink of recession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts have said germany is headed for a recession this comes on the heels of an announcement by the german government that the country is on the verge of a recession , due to the financial crisis and the struggling world economy .
the ongoing economic downturn led the government to lower the 2009 growth forecast in europe 's biggest economy from 1.2 percent down to 0.2 percent .
but economy minister michael glos said in berlin that there is no need to panic .
for the current year , the minister is still expecting gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.7 percent .
though that number is also down from 2.5 percent .
" we are just seeing some slowdown in the economy , " glos said .
" there is nothing to sugarcoat or cover up . "
too early to foresee crisis ' outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said germany should reform its tax system glos insisted that his latest forecasts entailed a " high degree of uncertainty " as it was still too early to predict exactly how the current financial crisis would affect the real economy .
glos went on to say that the financial firestorm that swept through markets in recent weeks underscored the need for germany to overhaul its tax system .
" beyond what we 've already agreed , there is an urgent need for tax relief , " said glos .
according to government forecasts , the economic slowdown will also leave its mark on the german labor market , where unemployment has been shrinking for more than two years .
glos predicted that the jobless total will average an annual 3.3 million next year , the same level as this year . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german financial newspaper reports that authorities knew about trouble at a hard-hit major bank , hypo real estate , much earlier than they first acknowledged . german authorities were aware of troubles at property financier hypo real estate much earlier than finance minister peer steinbrueck has said , the business daily handelsblatt reported on thursday , oct .

7 . rescue for hre the german government was forced to come to the rescue of hre , the country 's fourth-biggest bank , at the end of september , initially with a 27 billion euro -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- bailout . but that sum then had to be increased to 50 billion euros as it emerged that the bank 's woes were even more serious than previously thought . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier this month , lerch admitted he advised the libyans on how to build a piping system for a uranium-enrichment plant .
prosecutor wolfgang siegmund said earlier thursday the defendant helped libyan interests , but had not been a member of an international network of nuclear smugglers led by the rogue pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan .

germany 's first millionaire fair is prompting munich 's social forum to break new ground .
the network of some 40 local groups - all with a decidedly anticapitalist bent , according to walter listl - has not targeted specific events like this before .
" it 's the first time that we have staged something a bit spectacular aimed at a particular event of this kind , " listl said .
" we are doing it for very topical and acute reasons . "

the motto of the demonstration : " your wealth makes us sick . "
" we 're not planning to approach or talk to the millionaires or the wannabe millionaires , " said listl .
" we want to bring public attention to the degree of poverty that exists in this country - and elsewhere . "
it remains to be seen how the two worlds will react to one another , or even to what extent they will even meet .
there will be a police cordon around the venue .

96 parliamentarians voted against and 32 abstained .
under a previous parliamentary mandate , germany was allowed to send up to 3,500 troops to afghanistan .
the vote on thursday increases that number to 4,500 .
the mandate is valid for 14 months .
troop morale at a low the vote comes at a time when morale among german troops in afghanistan is low as they face increased attacks from a resurgent taliban .
five years ago , when the german army began its mission in northern afghanistan , the region was regarded as one of the country 's safest .
now , the solders run the daily risk of " being caught in an explosive or being shot at , " one officer said .
during the last year , the security situation has deteriorated not only in the north , but all across afghanistan .
the afghan presidential election , likely to shape the country 's future for years to come , is scheduled around autumn 2009 , making a further escalation of violence in the coming year more than likely .
as voter registration started last week , taliban spokesman kari jussif ahmadi warned the population against registering , saying it was a " waste of time , " as the militants were set to prevent the election from happening .
" more than half of the country is in our hands , and we will not let it happen , " he said .
added danger posed by upcoming election while the taliban are unlikely to prevent the polls - they failed to do so in 2004 despite grand announcements to the contrary - they are believed to be strong enough to severely disrupt the run-up to the election .
the international community has made it clear that securing the election will be one of the most important tasks in 2009 .
the german troops within the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- will also play a role in the training of afghan security forces , a process that must be speeded up after being promoted too timidly for a long time .
there is no doubt that this will be dangerous .
even today , the duty of the 4,500 german soldiers is a far cry from the beginning of the mission , when isaf troops really were peacekeepers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers ' deaths have changed the way troops view their mission soldiers at the german camp in the northern province of kunduz nicknamed the full moon " rocket weather , " because of the many attacks raining down on them by moonlight .
in september , a german soldier was killed in an attack .
" you have an odd feeling when you leave the camp on a mission , " said an officer , who did not want to give his name .
" it sensitizes you , but also creates a distance to the population .
just being present , just walking down to the bazaar , like we did two , three years ago , that 's not possible anymore . "
little support on the home front other soldiers believe that the german population does not appreciate their work , which only makes headline news when attacks occur .

96 parliamentarians voted against and 32 abstained .
under a previous parliamentary mandate , germany was allowed to send up to 3,500 troops to afghanistan .
the vote on thursday increases that number to 4,500 .
the mandate is valid for 14 months .
troop morale at a low the vote comes at a time when morale among german troops in afghanistan is low as they face increased attacks from a resurgent taliban .
five years ago , when the german army began its mission in northern afghanistan , the region was regarded as one of the country 's safest .
now , the solders run the daily risk of " being caught in an explosive or being shot at , " one officer said .
during the last year , the security situation has deteriorated not only in the north , but all across afghanistan .
the afghan presidential election , likely to shape the country 's future for years to come , is scheduled around autumn 2009 , making a further escalation of violence in the coming year more than likely .
as voter registration started last week , taliban spokesman kari jussif ahmadi warned the population against registering , saying it was a " waste of time , " as the militants were set to prevent the election from happening .
" more than half of the country is in our hands , and we will not let it happen , " he said .
added danger posed by upcoming election while the taliban are unlikely to prevent the polls - they failed to do so in 2004 despite grand announcements to the contrary - they are believed to be strong enough to severely disrupt the run-up to the election .
the international community has made it clear that securing the election will be one of the most important tasks in 2009 .
the german troops within the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- will also play a role in the training of afghan security forces , a process that must be speeded up after being promoted too timidly for a long time .
there is no doubt that this will be dangerous .
even today , the duty of the 4,500 german soldiers is a far cry from the beginning of the mission , when isaf troops really were peacekeepers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers ' deaths have changed the way troops view their mission soldiers at the german camp in the northern province of kunduz nicknamed the full moon " rocket weather , " because of the many attacks raining down on them by moonlight .
in september , a german soldier was killed in an attack .
" you have an odd feeling when you leave the camp on a mission , " said an officer , who did not want to give his name .
" it sensitizes you , but also creates a distance to the population .
just being present , just walking down to the bazaar , like we did two , three years ago , that 's not possible anymore . "
little support on the home front other soldiers believe that the german population does not appreciate their work , which only makes headline news when attacks occur .
" the soldiers want more interest in germany , and that there is not just focus -lrb- on them -rrb- when something happens , " the german bundeswehr in afghanistan said in a statement .
" more appreciation of the efforts here would be welcome , after all soldiers here can die for germany , " the army said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview with dw , the former us security advisor talks about how the west can avoid the mistakes of the russians . zbigniew brzezinski , the son of a diplomat , was born in warsaw on march 28 , 1928 .
in the 1950s , he was considered one of the leading western experts on the soviet union .
in 1960 , brzezinski advised john f. kennedy on eastern europe during his successful candidacy for the us presidency .
known for his hawkish foreign policy , brzezinski served as national security adviser to us president jimmy carter from 1977 to 1981 .
today , brzezinski is a scholar at the center for strategic and international studies in washington and advises us democratic presidential candidate barack obama . dw-world.de : while almost all political parties in germany want the troops to remain in afghanistan , a majority of the population would prefer a withdrawal .
what should the west do - withdraw , stay the course or increase the number of troops ? zbigniew brzezinski : i do n't think any of these options can be the answer .
withdrawal means that afghanistan will plunge immediately into a major crisis with unpredictable consequences .
simply putting more troops is not the solution to the problem .
staying the course is obviously unsatisfactory because right now there is mounting evidence that the situation is deteriorating . as jimmy carter 's security advisor in 1979 , you orchestrated the arming of the mujahedeen against afghanistan 's left-wing government , eventually drawing the soviet army into what you later referred to as the " afghan trap . "
has the west now fallen into that trap ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf force in afghanistan is battling a resurgent taliban the west should not repeat the mistakes that the soviets made .
the soviets invaded afghanistan on the illusion that a bunch of marxist afghan intellectuals could help them create a communist satellite using a foreign army to impose its will .
when the us reacted to the outrageous terrorist attacks of september 11 , which originated from afghanistan , it required only 300 american soldiers to overthrow the taliban .
the reason for that was that the afghans were genuinely grateful for the american support and the support of other countries . we are now running the risk of unintentionally duplicating what the soviets were doing : instead of capitalizing on that goodwill and leaving fairly soon thereafter while giving a lot of economic assistance to the afghans , we are trying to create a modern state - and a democratic version thereof - through a large foreign military presence .
i do not think that is a wise strategy . what you are suggesting seems to be exactly what the soviet union did : before it withdrew its troops , it tried to transfer the burden of fighting to the afghan forces - and failed .
why should nato succeed , given that it has much less afghan soldiers to rely on than the soviets had ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan population is not yet completely against help from foreign governments the soviets did that after devastating the afghan society and creating massive ill will .
one should not underestimate the enormous damage and incredible suffering that the soviets imposed in the afghan society by a ruthless military campaign , which drove millions of afghans out of the country and killed hundreds of thousands of them .
we have not done that yet .
but i think the risk is that the longer we rely on a military solution , the more likely it is that the resistance to us will become stronger and stronger .
i do n't think that it is in any way comparable to the resistance against the soviet occupation yet . how can the west avoid getting there ? we can not try to create a modern , centralized , democratic state in afghanistan from the top down using essentially foreign troops to impose such a solution .
this collides with the sense of ethnic identity and religious sensitivity in a country that is very resistant to foreign intrusions .
we need an altogether different approach .
some additional troops in the short run may be necessary , but the main emphasis has to be on decentralized political accommodation with the different elements which are collectively described as the taliban but in fact representing a much more diversified group . in their nearly completed national intelligence estimate , us intelligence agencies report a " breakdown in central authority " and " rampant corruption within the karzai government . "
the british ambassador to afghanistan is said to have called for an " acceptable dictator ... " how do you create a dictator out of nothing ?
the problem in afghanistan is that it is not possible to rule it from kabul effectively , and i do not see how we create a dictator in a deus ex machina fashion .
a dictator has to have either extensive social appeal or ruthless instruments of power - or preferably both .
i do n't see that in afghanistan unless it emerges by itself at some point . how should the west deal with the drug trade that provides the taliban with funds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracking down on the drug trade will not undercut the taliban , brzezinski said simply trying to wipe out the poppies and deprive the farmers of income will not undercut the taliban , it will strengthen them .
the europeans should pay the afghan farmers as much as it takes to abandon drug crops .
the europeans should do that because most of these drugs go to europe .
the drug problem in afghanistan is simultaneously a source of income for the taliban and a serious threat to europe .
in this respect , the european responsibility for dealing with it is self-evident . there have been repeated us attacks on pakistani territory .
do you think this could further destabilize the nuclear power pakistan ? us attacks on pakistani territory should be done only under very exceptional circumstances : when there is truly reliable intelligence that very senior operatives of al qaeda are potential targets and there is no indication that the pakistani authorities are going to do anything about it .
in those circumstances , such a reaction is justifiable since al qaeda attacked the united states .
but i think sporadic attacks against some taliban activities emanating from pakistan are likely to have the effect of simply widening the hostilities , and , in effect , transforming the problems we face in afghanistan into a problem that spans both afghanistan and pakistan thereby vastly complicating the challenge that we face - while at the same time probably further destabilizing pakistan . you support barack obama .
much like john mccain , he has called for a significant increase in us troops in afghanistan ... the call for some additional troops may be justified here or there .
but additional troops are not the solution in the long run .
i think obama has a much better understanding of the problems of the 21st century than mccain and the problems we face in afghanistan are not the only problems the 21st century is putting before us .
the american definition of its role in this world has to creatively adapt to the new global complexities .
i do n't see much evidence that mccain understands that need .
obama is much more qualified . interview : dennis stute -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the soviets invaded afghanistan on the illusion that a bunch of marxist afghan intellectuals could help them create a communist satellite using a foreign army to impose its will .
when the us reacted to the outrageous terrorist attacks of september 11 , which originated from afghanistan , it required only 300 american soldiers to overthrow the taliban .
the reason for that was that the afghans were genuinely grateful for the american support and the support of other countries . we are now running the risk of unintentionally duplicating what the soviets were doing : instead of capitalizing on that goodwill and leaving fairly soon thereafter while giving a lot of economic assistance to the afghans , we are trying to create a modern state - and a democratic version thereof - through a large foreign military presence .
i do not think that is a wise strategy . what you are suggesting seems to be exactly what the soviet union did : before it withdrew its troops , it tried to transfer the burden of fighting to the afghan forces - and failed .
why should nato succeed , given that it has much less afghan soldiers to rely on than the soviets had ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan population is not yet completely against help from foreign governments the soviets did that after devastating the afghan society and creating massive ill will .
one should not underestimate the enormous damage and incredible suffering that the soviets imposed in the afghan society by a ruthless military campaign , which drove millions of afghans out of the country and killed hundreds of thousands of them .
we have not done that yet .
but i think the risk is that the longer we rely on a military solution , the more likely it is that the resistance to us will become stronger and stronger .
i do n't think that it is in any way comparable to the resistance against the soviet occupation yet . how can the west avoid getting there ? we can not try to create a modern , centralized , democratic state in afghanistan from the top down using essentially foreign troops to impose such a solution .
this collides with the sense of ethnic identity and religious sensitivity in a country that is very resistant to foreign intrusions .
we need an altogether different approach .
some additional troops in the short run may be necessary , but the main emphasis has to be on decentralized political accommodation with the different elements which are collectively described as the taliban but in fact representing a much more diversified group . in their nearly completed national intelligence estimate , us intelligence agencies report a " breakdown in central authority " and " rampant corruption within the karzai government . "
the british ambassador to afghanistan is said to have called for an " acceptable dictator ... " how do you create a dictator out of nothing ?
the problem in afghanistan is that it is not possible to rule it from kabul effectively , and i do not see how we create a dictator in a deus ex machina fashion .
a dictator has to have either extensive social appeal or ruthless instruments of power - or preferably both .
i do n't see that in afghanistan unless it emerges by itself at some point . how should the west deal with the drug trade that provides the taliban with funds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracking down on the drug trade will not undercut the taliban , brzezinski said simply trying to wipe out the poppies and deprive the farmers of income will not undercut the taliban , it will strengthen them .
the europeans should pay the afghan farmers as much as it takes to abandon drug crops .
the europeans should do that because most of these drugs go to europe .
the drug problem in afghanistan is simultaneously a source of income for the taliban and a serious threat to europe .
in this respect , the european responsibility for dealing with it is self-evident . there have been repeated us attacks on pakistani territory .
do you think this could further destabilize the nuclear power pakistan ? us attacks on pakistani territory should be done only under very exceptional circumstances : when there is truly reliable intelligence that very senior operatives of al qaeda are potential targets and there is no indication that the pakistani authorities are going to do anything about it .
in those circumstances , such a reaction is justifiable since al qaeda attacked the united states .
but i think sporadic attacks against some taliban activities emanating from pakistan are likely to have the effect of simply widening the hostilities , and , in effect , transforming the problems we face in afghanistan into a problem that spans both afghanistan and pakistan thereby vastly complicating the challenge that we face - while at the same time probably further destabilizing pakistan . you support barack obama .
much like john mccain , he has called for a significant increase in us troops in afghanistan ... the call for some additional troops may be justified here or there .
but additional troops are not the solution in the long run .
i think obama has a much better understanding of the problems of the 21st century than mccain and the problems we face in afghanistan are not the only problems the 21st century is putting before us .
the american definition of its role in this world has to creatively adapt to the new global complexities .
i do n't see much evidence that mccain understands that need .

in an interview with dw , the former us security advisor talks about how the west can avoid the mistakes of the russians . zbigniew brzezinski , the son of a diplomat , was born in warsaw on march 28 , 1928 .
in the 1950s , he was considered one of the leading western experts on the soviet union .
in 1960 , brzezinski advised john f. kennedy on eastern europe during his successful candidacy for the us presidency .
known for his hawkish foreign policy , brzezinski served as national security adviser to us president jimmy carter from 1977 to 1981 .
today , brzezinski is a scholar at the center for strategic and international studies in washington and advises us democratic presidential candidate barack obama . dw-world.de : while almost all political parties in germany want the troops to remain in afghanistan , a majority of the population would prefer a withdrawal .
what should the west do - withdraw , stay the course or increase the number of troops ? zbigniew brzezinski : i do n't think any of these options can be the answer .
withdrawal means that afghanistan will plunge immediately into a major crisis with unpredictable consequences .
simply putting more troops is not the solution to the problem .
staying the course is obviously unsatisfactory because right now there is mounting evidence that the situation is deteriorating . as jimmy carter 's security advisor in 1979 , you orchestrated the arming of the mujahedeen against afghanistan 's left-wing government , eventually drawing the soviet army into what you later referred to as the " afghan trap .

the british ambassador to afghanistan is said to have called for an " acceptable dictator ... " how do you create a dictator out of nothing ?
the problem in afghanistan is that it is not possible to rule it from kabul effectively , and i do not see how we create a dictator in a deus ex machina fashion .
a dictator has to have either extensive social appeal or ruthless instruments of power - or preferably both .
i do n't see that in afghanistan unless it emerges by itself at some point . how should the west deal with the drug trade that provides the taliban with funds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracking down on the drug trade will not undercut the taliban , brzezinski said simply trying to wipe out the poppies and deprive the farmers of income will not undercut the taliban , it will strengthen them .
the europeans should pay the afghan farmers as much as it takes to abandon drug crops .
the europeans should do that because most of these drugs go to europe .
the drug problem in afghanistan is simultaneously a source of income for the taliban and a serious threat to europe .
in this respect , the european responsibility for dealing with it is self-evident . there have been repeated us attacks on pakistani territory .
do you think this could further destabilize the nuclear power pakistan ? us attacks on pakistani territory should be done only under very exceptional circumstances : when there is truly reliable intelligence that very senior operatives of al qaeda are potential targets and there is no indication that the pakistani authorities are going to do anything about it .
in those circumstances , such a reaction is justifiable since al qaeda attacked the united states .
but i think sporadic attacks against some taliban activities emanating from pakistan are likely to have the effect of simply widening the hostilities , and , in effect , transforming the problems we face in afghanistan into a problem that spans both afghanistan and pakistan thereby vastly complicating the challenge that we face - while at the same time probably further destabilizing pakistan . you support barack obama .
much like john mccain , he has called for a significant increase in us troops in afghanistan ... the call for some additional troops may be justified here or there .
but additional troops are not the solution in the long run .
i think obama has a much better understanding of the problems of the 21st century than mccain and the problems we face in afghanistan are not the only problems the 21st century is putting before us .
the american definition of its role in this world has to creatively adapt to the new global complexities .
i do n't see much evidence that mccain understands that need .
obama is much more qualified . interview : dennis stute -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking after meeting state premiers in berlin , the chancellor said the two sides had held " constructive talks " keeping in mind " the common responsiblity for our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has called the deal " tenable " and expects the rescue package to win parliamentary approval merkel said the two sides had agreed to share the burden of the rescue package , adding she was optimistic the legislative package would win approval in the german houses of parliament on friday .
german rescue package the biggest most of the eurozone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds .
germany 's rescue deal is the biggest , comprising 400 billion euros in guarantees , a 70-billion-euro fund and 10 billion euros of leeway .
berlin says it will need a credit of 100 billion euros to operate the bank-support scheme , but the trading fund will earn interest and dividend income from banks it takes over .
the ultimate net cost may be far less than the credit sum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has moved away from a case-to-case bailout for struggling banks finance minister peer steinbrueck explained that when the final accounts were calculated after the rescue , the states would pay 35 percent of the cost , or possibly receive 35 percent of the profits if there were any .
state premiers said this was because the states , as proprietors of state banks , would have to sustain other losses in the crisis .
" it 's a good outcome , " said juergen ruettgers , premier of north rhine westphalia .
merkel called the deal " tenable . "
berlin to create new agency for bank rescue germany has not identified which of its banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-quality derivatives .
the cost burden on the states from the wider bail-out is to be limited to 7.7 billion euros , with the federal government to pay all higher bills , steinbrueck said .
government politicians said germany would create a special agency for the bank rescue after the country 's central bank said its independence would be compromised if it became an arm of government policy .
instead of being a department of the bundesbank , it would be a legally separate unit at the bundesbank office in frankfurt .
the bundesbank , which is one of the principal central banks underpinning the european central bank in frankfurt , had earlier told berlin it did not want to be seen taking instructions from the german federal government .
to speed passage of the bill on friday , votes are set to be held in the bundestag lower chamber and the bundesrat upper chamber on the same day .

speaking after meeting state premiers in berlin , the chancellor said the two sides had held " constructive talks " keeping in mind " the common responsiblity for our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has called the deal " tenable " and expects the rescue package to win parliamentary approval merkel said the two sides had agreed to share the burden of the rescue package , adding she was optimistic the legislative package would win approval in the german houses of parliament on friday .
german rescue package the biggest most of the eurozone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds .
germany 's rescue deal is the biggest , comprising 400 billion euros in guarantees , a 70-billion-euro fund and 10 billion euros of leeway .
berlin says it will need a credit of 100 billion euros to operate the bank-support scheme , but the trading fund will earn interest and dividend income from banks it takes over .
the ultimate net cost may be far less than the credit sum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has moved away from a case-to-case bailout for struggling banks finance minister peer steinbrueck explained that when the final accounts were calculated after the rescue , the states would pay 35 percent of the cost , or possibly receive 35 percent of the profits if there were any .
state premiers said this was because the states , as proprietors of state banks , would have to sustain other losses in the crisis .
" it 's a good outcome , " said juergen ruettgers , premier of north rhine westphalia .
merkel called the deal " tenable . "
berlin to create new agency for bank rescue germany has not identified which of its banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-quality derivatives .
the cost burden on the states from the wider bail-out is to be limited to 7.7 billion euros , with the federal government to pay all higher bills , steinbrueck said .
government politicians said germany would create a special agency for the bank rescue after the country 's central bank said its independence would be compromised if it became an arm of government policy .
instead of being a department of the bundesbank , it would be a legally separate unit at the bundesbank office in frankfurt .
the bundesbank , which is one of the principal central banks underpinning the european central bank in frankfurt , had earlier told berlin it did not want to be seen taking instructions from the german federal government .
to speed passage of the bill on friday , votes are set to be held in the bundestag lower chamber and the bundesrat upper chamber on the same day .
in an unusual move , the bill is to be emailed back to the german government a few hundred metres away for the final formalities .

he added that he would do everything possible to make the meeting work out .
late wednesday , georgia and russia were supposed to gather for internationally-backed peace talks in geneva .
but they broke down on the first day when the rivals , who fought a war in august , blamed each other for the failure to even enter the same room .
talks are unlikely to resume until november , solana added .
sergei shamba , foreign minister of the pro-russian separatist region of abkhazia , told afp news service that on wednesday " there were two separate meetings , the russians and the abkhazians -lrb- in one -rrb- and the georgians in another , " he said .
' procedural difficulties ' at fault it would have been the first time representatives of the two sides have held direct negotiations since the five-day war after russia thwarted a georgian assault to retake its breakaway region of south ossetia .
russia has kept troops in south ossetia and another rebel region , abkhazia , and recognises both as independent states .
pierre morel , an official for the european union , which organized the talks with the united nations and organization for security and cooperation in europe , blamed " procedural difficulties " for the quick suspension of the negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana said he 's skeptical new talks will happen soon georgia said that russia had refused to meet its delegation .
american involvement " it 's regrettable that the russian federation has put the process from the very beginning under severe constraints , " georgia 's head of delegation and deputy foreign minister giga bokeria told afp .
russia would not take part in any further talks with georgia if representatives from south ossetia and abkhazia were not invited , russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said .
the americans injected a third element to the breakdown , with its head of delegation daniel fried saying that it was the south ossetians and abkhazians who failed to exhibit a " constructive spirit " to keep talks going .
" unfortunately ... the de facto authorities of south ossetia and abkhazia who were present at the meeting , i 'm sorry to say did not exhibit such a constructive spirit - they chose instead to walk out of the informational session , " he told afp .
tension between parties following the walkout , the parties demanded to be treated as full national delegations before coming back to talks , but " no one was prepared to do that , " said fried .
" this was unfortunate and so the session ended early because the south ossetians and abkhaz walked out , " he added .
even before the session , there was tension over the participation of the abkhazians and the south ossetians , with russia insisting there could be no agreements without their presence .
the georgians had argued that the official talks should only include representatives of georgia , russia , the united states , the european union , the osce and the un .
russia has said it wants security guarantees and a ban on all weapons sales to georgia , which in has demanded that all russian troops leave georgian territory , including south ossetia and abkhazia .
russia called on the georgians to sign " concrete and legally binding " security pacts with the two breakaway regions .
georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili accused moscow of adopting " soviet " tactics during the talks .
" despite the fact that georgia had a very constructive approach and the rare opportunity for negotiations , russia has left the negotiations .
this is how the soviet union acted in the past , " saakashvili said in comments broadcast on georgian public television . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 16.10.2008 german parliament approves extra troops for afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extra troops raises the total number of german soldiers in afghanistan to 4,500 germany 's lower house of parliament voted on thursday to increase the number of troops berlin can send to afghanistan by 1,000 soldiers and extended the mission 's mandate by 14 months . a majority of 442 lawmakers voted to support a proposal by chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition to extend berlin 's participation in a nato-led peacekeeping mission , which currently includes just over 50,000 soldiers .
96 parliamentarians voted against and 32 abstained .
under a previous parliamentary mandate , germany was allowed to send up to 3,500 troops to afghanistan .
the vote on thursday increases that number to 4,500 .
the mandate is valid for 14 months .
troop morale at a low the vote comes at a time when morale among german troops in afghanistan is low as they face increased attacks from a resurgent taliban .
five years ago , when the german army began its mission in northern afghanistan , the region was regarded as one of the country 's safest .
now , the solders run the daily risk of " being caught in an explosive or being shot at , " one officer said .
during the last year , the security situation has deteriorated not only in the north , but all across afghanistan .
the afghan presidential election , likely to shape the country 's future for years to come , is scheduled around autumn 2009 , making a further escalation of violence in the coming year more than likely .
as voter registration started last week , taliban spokesman kari jussif ahmadi warned the population against registering , saying it was a " waste of time , " as the militants were set to prevent the election from happening .
" more than half of the country is in our hands , and we will not let it happen , " he said .
added danger posed by upcoming election while the taliban are unlikely to prevent the polls - they failed to do so in 2004 despite grand announcements to the contrary - they are believed to be strong enough to severely disrupt the run-up to the election .
the international community has made it clear that securing the election will be one of the most important tasks in 2009 .
the german troops within the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- will also play a role in the training of afghan security forces , a process that must be speeded up after being promoted too timidly for a long time .
there is no doubt that this will be dangerous .
even today , the duty of the 4,500 german soldiers is a far cry from the beginning of the mission , when isaf troops really were peacekeepers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers ' deaths have changed the way troops view their mission soldiers at the german camp in the northern province of kunduz nicknamed the full moon " rocket weather , " because of the many attacks raining down on them by moonlight .
in september , a german soldier was killed in an attack .
" you have an odd feeling when you leave the camp on a mission , " said an officer , who did not want to give his name .
" it sensitizes you , but also creates a distance to the population .
just being present , just walking down to the bazaar , like we did two , three years ago , that 's not possible anymore . "
little support on the home front other soldiers believe that the german population does not appreciate their work , which only makes headline news when attacks occur .
" the soldiers want more interest in germany , and that there is not just focus -lrb- on them -rrb- when something happens , " the german bundeswehr in afghanistan said in a statement .
" more appreciation of the efforts here would be welcome , after all soldiers here can die for germany , " the army said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking after meeting state premiers in berlin , the chancellor said the two sides had held " constructive talks " keeping in mind " the common responsiblity for our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has called the deal " tenable " and expects the rescue package to win parliamentary approval merkel said the two sides had agreed to share the burden of the rescue package , adding she was optimistic the legislative package would win approval in the german houses of parliament on friday .
german rescue package the biggest most of the eurozone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds .
germany 's rescue deal is the biggest , comprising 400 billion euros in guarantees , a 70-billion-euro fund and 10 billion euros of leeway .
berlin says it will need a credit of 100 billion euros to operate the bank-support scheme , but the trading fund will earn interest and dividend income from banks it takes over .
the ultimate net cost may be far less than the credit sum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has moved away from a case-to-case bailout for struggling banks finance minister peer steinbrueck explained that when the final accounts were calculated after the rescue , the states would pay 35 percent of the cost , or possibly receive 35 percent of the profits if there were any .
state premiers said this was because the states , as proprietors of state banks , would have to sustain other losses in the crisis .
" it 's a good outcome , " said juergen ruettgers , premier of north rhine westphalia .
merkel called the deal " tenable . "
berlin to create new agency for bank rescue germany has not identified which of its banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-quality derivatives .
the cost burden on the states from the wider bail-out is to be limited to 7.7 billion euros , with the federal government to pay all higher bills , steinbrueck said .
government politicians said germany would create a special agency for the bank rescue after the country 's central bank said its independence would be compromised if it became an arm of government policy .
instead of being a department of the bundesbank , it would be a legally separate unit at the bundesbank office in frankfurt .
the bundesbank , which is one of the principal central banks underpinning the european central bank in frankfurt , had earlier told berlin it did not want to be seen taking instructions from the german federal government .
to speed passage of the bill on friday , votes are set to be held in the bundestag lower chamber and the bundesrat upper chamber on the same day .
in an unusual move , the bill is to be emailed back to the german government a few hundred metres away for the final formalities .
when the finance minister , chancellor and president have signed it , the government printer in cologne will print 30,000 copies . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not have the right to miss this opportunity for reconstructing our system of finance in the 21st century , " french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , said in brussels on thursday , oct 16 . for the first time , eu leaders also addressed the fallout of the credit crunch on the real economy amid mounting fears of a deep recession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's car industry is already feeling the bite of the financial crisis " of course we see that the economic crisis is there , and the question i asked was : if we can bring coordinated answers to the financial crisis , can we not bring a coordinated answer to the economic crisis ? "
sarkozy said , pledging that france would take initiatives on the matter . " outside the financial sector , the european council -lrb- summit -rrb- underlines its determination to take the necessary steps to support growth and jobs , " the final summit statement said . " it calls on the the european commission to make appropriate proposals before the end of the year notably to preserve the competitiveness of european industry . " international emergency summit eu leaders are also leading calls for an international emergency summit , perhaps after us elections next month , to reshape the financial system while washington has shown less enthusiasm . sarkozy said he and european commission president jose manuel barroso would travel to meet us president george w. bush on saturday to help prepare for a summit that would decide on a " refoundation of capitalism . " despite the tough talk , global stock markets on thursday continued their freefall , pummelled by signs the world 's biggest economies were headed for recession after a month of financial sector turmoil . in a statement , the eu also called for the first time for a coordinated system of financial supervision at eu level and the creation of a crisis cell to help manage the financial turmoil . as a first step , german chancellor angela merkel told reporters , national central bank governors will meet at least once a month to exchange information on financial supervision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets have reacted warily to rescue plans by western governments the heads of the european central bank , the eu presidency , the executive european commission and the eurogroup of 15 countries that share the euro currency will all take part in the financial crisis management cell . a 2 trillion euro -lrb- 2.7 trillion dollar -rrb- rescue package , initially approved by eurozone leaders at a meeting in paris over the weekend , includes measures to safeguard private savers , guarantee interbank lending and partly nationalize shaky financial insitutions .
it follows a similar initiative approved in the united states , where the global credit crunch originated .
new bretton woods the agreement in brussels came after hours of discussions that saw member states such as the czech republic complain that it would allow for too much state intervention .
but the real surprise in brussels came not from the czechs but from brown .
despite his reputation as a eurosceptic , fellow eu leaders listened carefully to britain 's former chancellor of the exchequer as he outlined his plans for " a new bretton woods " that would avoid future financial breakdowns .
the 1944 bretton woods conference laid out the foundations of post-world war ii capitalism by establishing rules for the international monetary and financial order and by creating such bodies as the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
" global financial markets present challenges that no one nation can solve in isolation , " brown said in a letter distributed to eu heads of state and government in brussels .
" we must therefore strengthen global cooperation and build a new global financial architecture for the years ahead - a new bretton woods , which recognizes the globalization of financial risk in the responsibilities of global institutions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has called for a " new bretton woods " brown 's four-point plan envisages " a global early warning system " to prevent future financial crises from spreading , " globally accepted standards of supervision and regulation , " effective " cross-border supervision " of the world 's 30 largest multinationals and " cooperation and concerted action " during times of crisis .
his proposals were expected to be discussed by a forthcoming group of eight summit extended to include emerging powers such as china and india .
fighting climate change # b # eu leaders also agreed on thursday to reach a final deal on how to fight climate change in december after polish threats of a veto were won over , officials said .
" the objectives remain unchanged and the calendar remains the same .
it is now up to -lrb- european commission -rrb- president -lrb- jose manuel -rrb- barroso and myself to find solutions for those countries that have expressed their worries , " sarkozy said .
as the summit opened on wednesday , poland threatened to veto a declaration calling for a decision on the eu 's proposed climate-change laws in december , saying that its concerns over the economic impact of the proposed laws had not been taken into account .
seven other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe backed that call , accusing the european commission of not taking their earlier efforts on climate change into account .
and italy joined the revolt , arguing that it would be too expensive to implement the laws given the present financial crisis .
but on thursday morning , the french government proposed a new resolution sticking to the december deadline but promising to take into account the " specific situation " in each member state . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not have the right to miss this opportunity for reconstructing our system of finance in the 21st century , " french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , said in brussels on thursday , oct 16 . for the first time , eu leaders also addressed the fallout of the credit crunch on the real economy amid mounting fears of a deep recession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's car industry is already feeling the bite of the financial crisis " of course we see that the economic crisis is there , and the question i asked was : if we can bring coordinated answers to the financial crisis , can we not bring a coordinated answer to the economic crisis ?

" outside the financial sector , the european council -lrb- summit -rrb- underlines its determination to take the necessary steps to support growth and jobs , " the final summit statement said .

but the real surprise in brussels came not from the czechs but from brown .
despite his reputation as a eurosceptic , fellow eu leaders listened carefully to britain 's former chancellor of the exchequer as he outlined his plans for " a new bretton woods " that would avoid future financial breakdowns .
the 1944 bretton woods conference laid out the foundations of post-world war ii capitalism by establishing rules for the international monetary and financial order and by creating such bodies as the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
" global financial markets present challenges that no one nation can solve in isolation , " brown said in a letter distributed to eu heads of state and government in brussels .
" we must therefore strengthen global cooperation and build a new global financial architecture for the years ahead - a new bretton woods , which recognizes the globalization of financial risk in the responsibilities of global institutions . "

as the summit opened on wednesday , poland threatened to veto a declaration calling for a decision on the eu 's proposed climate-change laws in december , saying that its concerns over the economic impact of the proposed laws had not been taken into account .
seven other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe backed that call , accusing the european commission of not taking their earlier efforts on climate change into account .
and italy joined the revolt , arguing that it would be too expensive to implement the laws given the present financial crisis .

speaking after meeting state premiers in berlin , the chancellor said the two sides had held " constructive talks " keeping in mind " the common responsiblity for our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has called the deal " tenable " and expects the rescue package to win parliamentary approval merkel said the two sides had agreed to share the burden of the rescue package , adding she was optimistic the legislative package would win approval in the german houses of parliament on friday .
german rescue package the biggest most of the eurozone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds .
germany 's rescue deal is the biggest , comprising 400 billion euros in guarantees , a 70-billion-euro fund and 10 billion euros of leeway .
berlin says it will need a credit of 100 billion euros to operate the bank-support scheme , but the trading fund will earn interest and dividend income from banks it takes over .
the ultimate net cost may be far less than the credit sum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has moved away from a case-to-case bailout for struggling banks finance minister peer steinbrueck explained that when the final accounts were calculated after the rescue , the states would pay 35 percent of the cost , or possibly receive 35 percent of the profits if there were any .
state premiers said this was because the states , as proprietors of state banks , would have to sustain other losses in the crisis .
" it 's a good outcome , " said juergen ruettgers , premier of north rhine westphalia .
merkel called the deal " tenable . "
berlin to create new agency for bank rescue germany has not identified which of its banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-quality derivatives .
the cost burden on the states from the wider bail-out is to be limited to 7.7 billion euros , with the federal government to pay all higher bills , steinbrueck said .
government politicians said germany would create a special agency for the bank rescue after the country 's central bank said its independence would be compromised if it became an arm of government policy .
instead of being a department of the bundesbank , it would be a legally separate unit at the bundesbank office in frankfurt .
the bundesbank , which is one of the principal central banks underpinning the european central bank in frankfurt , had earlier told berlin it did not want to be seen taking instructions from the german federal government .
to speed passage of the bill on friday , votes are set to be held in the bundestag lower chamber and the bundesrat upper chamber on the same day .
in an unusual move , the bill is to be emailed back to the german government a few hundred metres away for the final formalities .
when the finance minister , chancellor and president have signed it , the government printer in cologne will print 30,000 copies . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 16.10.2008 german parliament approves extra troops for afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extra troops raises the total number of german soldiers in afghanistan to 4,500 germany 's lower house of parliament voted on thursday to increase the number of troops berlin can send to afghanistan by 1,000 soldiers and extended the mission 's mandate by 14 months . a majority of 442 lawmakers voted to support a proposal by chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition to extend berlin 's participation in a nato-led peacekeeping mission , which currently includes just over 50,000 soldiers .
96 parliamentarians voted against and 32 abstained .
under a previous parliamentary mandate , germany was allowed to send up to 3,500 troops to afghanistan .
the vote on thursday increases that number to 4,500 .
the mandate is valid for 14 months .
troop morale at a low the vote comes at a time when morale among german troops in afghanistan is low as they face increased attacks from a resurgent taliban .
five years ago , when the german army began its mission in northern afghanistan , the region was regarded as one of the country 's safest .
now , the solders run the daily risk of " being caught in an explosive or being shot at , " one officer said .
during the last year , the security situation has deteriorated not only in the north , but all across afghanistan .
the afghan presidential election , likely to shape the country 's future for years to come , is scheduled around autumn 2009 , making a further escalation of violence in the coming year more than likely .
as voter registration started last week , taliban spokesman kari jussif ahmadi warned the population against registering , saying it was a " waste of time , " as the militants were set to prevent the election from happening .
" more than half of the country is in our hands , and we will not let it happen , " he said .
added danger posed by upcoming election while the taliban are unlikely to prevent the polls - they failed to do so in 2004 despite grand announcements to the contrary - they are believed to be strong enough to severely disrupt the run-up to the election .
the international community has made it clear that securing the election will be one of the most important tasks in 2009 .
the german troops within the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- will also play a role in the training of afghan security forces , a process that must be speeded up after being promoted too timidly for a long time .
there is no doubt that this will be dangerous .
even today , the duty of the 4,500 german soldiers is a far cry from the beginning of the mission , when isaf troops really were peacekeepers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers ' deaths have changed the way troops view their mission soldiers at the german camp in the northern province of kunduz nicknamed the full moon " rocket weather , " because of the many attacks raining down on them by moonlight .
in september , a german soldier was killed in an attack .
" you have an odd feeling when you leave the camp on a mission , " said an officer , who did not want to give his name .
" it sensitizes you , but also creates a distance to the population .
just being present , just walking down to the bazaar , like we did two , three years ago , that 's not possible anymore . "
little support on the home front other soldiers believe that the german population does not appreciate their work , which only makes headline news when attacks occur .
" the soldiers want more interest in germany , and that there is not just focus -lrb- on them -rrb- when something happens , " the german bundeswehr in afghanistan said in a statement .
" more appreciation of the efforts here would be welcome , after all soldiers here can die for germany , " the army said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he added that he would do everything possible to make the meeting work out .
late wednesday , georgia and russia were supposed to gather for internationally-backed peace talks in geneva .
but they broke down on the first day when the rivals , who fought a war in august , blamed each other for the failure to even enter the same room .
talks are unlikely to resume until november , solana added .
sergei shamba , foreign minister of the pro-russian separatist region of abkhazia , told afp news service that on wednesday " there were two separate meetings , the russians and the abkhazians -lrb- in one -rrb- and the georgians in another , " he said .
' procedural difficulties ' at fault it would have been the first time representatives of the two sides have held direct negotiations since the five-day war after russia thwarted a georgian assault to retake its breakaway region of south ossetia .
russia has kept troops in south ossetia and another rebel region , abkhazia , and recognises both as independent states .
pierre morel , an official for the european union , which organized the talks with the united nations and organization for security and cooperation in europe , blamed " procedural difficulties " for the quick suspension of the negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana said he 's skeptical new talks will happen soon georgia said that russia had refused to meet its delegation .
american involvement " it 's regrettable that the russian federation has put the process from the very beginning under severe constraints , " georgia 's head of delegation and deputy foreign minister giga bokeria told afp .
russia would not take part in any further talks with georgia if representatives from south ossetia and abkhazia were not invited , russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said .
the americans injected a third element to the breakdown , with its head of delegation daniel fried saying that it was the south ossetians and abkhazians who failed to exhibit a " constructive spirit " to keep talks going .
" unfortunately ... the de facto authorities of south ossetia and abkhazia who were present at the meeting , i 'm sorry to say did not exhibit such a constructive spirit - they chose instead to walk out of the informational session , " he told afp .
tension between parties following the walkout , the parties demanded to be treated as full national delegations before coming back to talks , but " no one was prepared to do that , " said fried .
" this was unfortunate and so the session ended early because the south ossetians and abkhaz walked out , " he added .
even before the session , there was tension over the participation of the abkhazians and the south ossetians , with russia insisting there could be no agreements without their presence .
the georgians had argued that the official talks should only include representatives of georgia , russia , the united states , the european union , the osce and the un .
russia has said it wants security guarantees and a ban on all weapons sales to georgia , which in has demanded that all russian troops leave georgian territory , including south ossetia and abkhazia .
russia called on the georgians to sign " concrete and legally binding " security pacts with the two breakaway regions .
georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili accused moscow of adopting " soviet " tactics during the talks .
" despite the fact that georgia had a very constructive approach and the rare opportunity for negotiations , russia has left the negotiations .
this is how the soviet union acted in the past , " saakashvili said in comments broadcast on georgian public television . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german financial newspaper reports that authorities knew about trouble at a hard-hit major bank , hypo real estate , much earlier than they first acknowledged . german authorities were aware of troubles at property financier hypo real estate much earlier than finance minister peer steinbrueck has said , the business daily handelsblatt reported on thursday , oct .
16 . the financial sector watchdog bafin launched a special investigation into hre and its irish subsidiary depfa back in february , the newspaper said . bafin chief jochen sanio had acknowledged as much during a hearing by the german parliament 's budgetary and financial committee , handelsblatt reported . denials from finance ministry until now , steinbrueck has maintained that no such investigation was possible because bafin has no jurisdiction in ireland . but , according to the sources quoted by handelsblatt , bafin submitted a request to the irish authorities in february and commissioned the german central bank , the bundesbank , to carry out the investigation . sanio said bafin presented the findings of the probe to hre 's management in july and had informed the finance ministry of the results on aug .
7 . rescue for hre the german government was forced to come to the rescue of hre , the country 's fourth-biggest bank , at the end of september , initially with a 27 billion euro -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- bailout . but that sum then had to be increased to 50 billion euros as it emerged that the bank 's woes were even more serious than previously thought . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview with dw , the former us security advisor talks about how the west can avoid the mistakes of the russians . zbigniew brzezinski , the son of a diplomat , was born in warsaw on march 28 , 1928 .
in the 1950s , he was considered one of the leading western experts on the soviet union .
in 1960 , brzezinski advised john f. kennedy on eastern europe during his successful candidacy for the us presidency .
known for his hawkish foreign policy , brzezinski served as national security adviser to us president jimmy carter from 1977 to 1981 .
today , brzezinski is a scholar at the center for strategic and international studies in washington and advises us democratic presidential candidate barack obama . dw-world.de : while almost all political parties in germany want the troops to remain in afghanistan , a majority of the population would prefer a withdrawal .
what should the west do - withdraw , stay the course or increase the number of troops ? zbigniew brzezinski : i do n't think any of these options can be the answer .
withdrawal means that afghanistan will plunge immediately into a major crisis with unpredictable consequences .
simply putting more troops is not the solution to the problem .
staying the course is obviously unsatisfactory because right now there is mounting evidence that the situation is deteriorating . as jimmy carter 's security advisor in 1979 , you orchestrated the arming of the mujahedeen against afghanistan 's left-wing government , eventually drawing the soviet army into what you later referred to as the " afghan trap . "
has the west now fallen into that trap ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf force in afghanistan is battling a resurgent taliban the west should not repeat the mistakes that the soviets made .
the soviets invaded afghanistan on the illusion that a bunch of marxist afghan intellectuals could help them create a communist satellite using a foreign army to impose its will .
when the us reacted to the outrageous terrorist attacks of september 11 , which originated from afghanistan , it required only 300 american soldiers to overthrow the taliban .
the reason for that was that the afghans were genuinely grateful for the american support and the support of other countries . we are now running the risk of unintentionally duplicating what the soviets were doing : instead of capitalizing on that goodwill and leaving fairly soon thereafter while giving a lot of economic assistance to the afghans , we are trying to create a modern state - and a democratic version thereof - through a large foreign military presence .
i do not think that is a wise strategy . what you are suggesting seems to be exactly what the soviet union did : before it withdrew its troops , it tried to transfer the burden of fighting to the afghan forces - and failed .
why should nato succeed , given that it has much less afghan soldiers to rely on than the soviets had ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan population is not yet completely against help from foreign governments the soviets did that after devastating the afghan society and creating massive ill will .
one should not underestimate the enormous damage and incredible suffering that the soviets imposed in the afghan society by a ruthless military campaign , which drove millions of afghans out of the country and killed hundreds of thousands of them .
we have not done that yet .
but i think the risk is that the longer we rely on a military solution , the more likely it is that the resistance to us will become stronger and stronger .
i do n't think that it is in any way comparable to the resistance against the soviet occupation yet . how can the west avoid getting there ? we can not try to create a modern , centralized , democratic state in afghanistan from the top down using essentially foreign troops to impose such a solution .
this collides with the sense of ethnic identity and religious sensitivity in a country that is very resistant to foreign intrusions .
we need an altogether different approach .
some additional troops in the short run may be necessary , but the main emphasis has to be on decentralized political accommodation with the different elements which are collectively described as the taliban but in fact representing a much more diversified group . in their nearly completed national intelligence estimate , us intelligence agencies report a " breakdown in central authority " and " rampant corruption within the karzai government . "
the british ambassador to afghanistan is said to have called for an " acceptable dictator ... " how do you create a dictator out of nothing ?
the problem in afghanistan is that it is not possible to rule it from kabul effectively , and i do not see how we create a dictator in a deus ex machina fashion .
a dictator has to have either extensive social appeal or ruthless instruments of power - or preferably both .
i do n't see that in afghanistan unless it emerges by itself at some point . how should the west deal with the drug trade that provides the taliban with funds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracking down on the drug trade will not undercut the taliban , brzezinski said simply trying to wipe out the poppies and deprive the farmers of income will not undercut the taliban , it will strengthen them .
the europeans should pay the afghan farmers as much as it takes to abandon drug crops .
the europeans should do that because most of these drugs go to europe .
the drug problem in afghanistan is simultaneously a source of income for the taliban and a serious threat to europe .
in this respect , the european responsibility for dealing with it is self-evident . there have been repeated us attacks on pakistani territory .
do you think this could further destabilize the nuclear power pakistan ? us attacks on pakistani territory should be done only under very exceptional circumstances : when there is truly reliable intelligence that very senior operatives of al qaeda are potential targets and there is no indication that the pakistani authorities are going to do anything about it .
in those circumstances , such a reaction is justifiable since al qaeda attacked the united states .
but i think sporadic attacks against some taliban activities emanating from pakistan are likely to have the effect of simply widening the hostilities , and , in effect , transforming the problems we face in afghanistan into a problem that spans both afghanistan and pakistan thereby vastly complicating the challenge that we face - while at the same time probably further destabilizing pakistan . you support barack obama .
much like john mccain , he has called for a significant increase in us troops in afghanistan ... the call for some additional troops may be justified here or there .
but additional troops are not the solution in the long run .
i think obama has a much better understanding of the problems of the 21st century than mccain and the problems we face in afghanistan are not the only problems the 21st century is putting before us .
the american definition of its role in this world has to creatively adapt to the new global complexities .

96 parliamentarians voted against and 32 abstained .
under a previous parliamentary mandate , germany was allowed to send up to 3,500 troops to afghanistan .
the vote on thursday increases that number to 4,500 .
the mandate is valid for 14 months .
troop morale at a low the vote comes at a time when morale among german troops in afghanistan is low as they face increased attacks from a resurgent taliban .
five years ago , when the german army began its mission in northern afghanistan , the region was regarded as one of the country 's safest .
now , the solders run the daily risk of " being caught in an explosive or being shot at , " one officer said .
during the last year , the security situation has deteriorated not only in the north , but all across afghanistan .
the afghan presidential election , likely to shape the country 's future for years to come , is scheduled around autumn 2009 , making a further escalation of violence in the coming year more than likely .
as voter registration started last week , taliban spokesman kari jussif ahmadi warned the population against registering , saying it was a " waste of time , " as the militants were set to prevent the election from happening .
" more than half of the country is in our hands , and we will not let it happen , " he said .
added danger posed by upcoming election while the taliban are unlikely to prevent the polls - they failed to do so in 2004 despite grand announcements to the contrary - they are believed to be strong enough to severely disrupt the run-up to the election .
the international community has made it clear that securing the election will be one of the most important tasks in 2009 .
the german troops within the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- will also play a role in the training of afghan security forces , a process that must be speeded up after being promoted too timidly for a long time .
there is no doubt that this will be dangerous .
even today , the duty of the 4,500 german soldiers is a far cry from the beginning of the mission , when isaf troops really were peacekeepers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers ' deaths have changed the way troops view their mission soldiers at the german camp in the northern province of kunduz nicknamed the full moon " rocket weather , " because of the many attacks raining down on them by moonlight .
in september , a german soldier was killed in an attack .
" you have an odd feeling when you leave the camp on a mission , " said an officer , who did not want to give his name .
" it sensitizes you , but also creates a distance to the population .
just being present , just walking down to the bazaar , like we did two , three years ago , that 's not possible anymore . "
little support on the home front other soldiers believe that the german population does not appreciate their work , which only makes headline news when attacks occur .
" the soldiers want more interest in germany , and that there is not just focus -lrb- on them -rrb- when something happens , " the german bundeswehr in afghanistan said in a statement .
" more appreciation of the efforts here would be welcome , after all soldiers here can die for germany , " the army said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier this month , lerch admitted he advised the libyans on how to build a piping system for a uranium-enrichment plant .
prosecutor wolfgang siegmund said earlier thursday the defendant helped libyan interests , but had not been a member of an international network of nuclear smugglers led by the rogue pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan .
us and german intelligence agents uncovered the plans to export the piping system , earlier media reports said .
libya has since abandoned its nuclear ambitions .
the defendant was convicted of breaching german laws restricting exports of militarily useful products .
defendant endangered international peace a previous trial which began in july 2006 had to be called off after the bomb plans - regarded as evidence by the defense team - were shredded by swiss authorities .
under an agreement with the defense to settle with a compromise , prosecutor siegmund dropped an allegation that the defendant was the builder and supplier of a gas ultra centrifuge system to refine uranium for libya 's bomb .
siegmund , who pressed for a six-year prison term , said thursday that libya in fact came nowhere close to making its own bomb , but the defendant 's actions had endangered international peace .

speaking after meeting state premiers in berlin , the chancellor said the two sides had held " constructive talks " keeping in mind " the common responsiblity for our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has called the deal " tenable " and expects the rescue package to win parliamentary approval merkel said the two sides had agreed to share the burden of the rescue package , adding she was optimistic the legislative package would win approval in the german houses of parliament on friday .
german rescue package the biggest most of the eurozone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds .
germany 's rescue deal is the biggest , comprising 400 billion euros in guarantees , a 70-billion-euro fund and 10 billion euros of leeway .
berlin says it will need a credit of 100 billion euros to operate the bank-support scheme , but the trading fund will earn interest and dividend income from banks it takes over .
the ultimate net cost may be far less than the credit sum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has moved away from a case-to-case bailout for struggling banks finance minister peer steinbrueck explained that when the final accounts were calculated after the rescue , the states would pay 35 percent of the cost , or possibly receive 35 percent of the profits if there were any .
state premiers said this was because the states , as proprietors of state banks , would have to sustain other losses in the crisis .
" it 's a good outcome , " said juergen ruettgers , premier of north rhine westphalia .
merkel called the deal " tenable . "
berlin to create new agency for bank rescue germany has not identified which of its banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-quality derivatives .
the cost burden on the states from the wider bail-out is to be limited to 7.7 billion euros , with the federal government to pay all higher bills , steinbrueck said .
government politicians said germany would create a special agency for the bank rescue after the country 's central bank said its independence would be compromised if it became an arm of government policy .
instead of being a department of the bundesbank , it would be a legally separate unit at the bundesbank office in frankfurt .
the bundesbank , which is one of the principal central banks underpinning the european central bank in frankfurt , had earlier told berlin it did not want to be seen taking instructions from the german federal government .
to speed passage of the bill on friday , votes are set to be held in the bundestag lower chamber and the bundesrat upper chamber on the same day .
in an unusual move , the bill is to be emailed back to the german government a few hundred metres away for the final formalities .

he added that he would do everything possible to make the meeting work out .
late wednesday , georgia and russia were supposed to gather for internationally-backed peace talks in geneva .
but they broke down on the first day when the rivals , who fought a war in august , blamed each other for the failure to even enter the same room .
talks are unlikely to resume until november , solana added .
sergei shamba , foreign minister of the pro-russian separatist region of abkhazia , told afp news service that on wednesday " there were two separate meetings , the russians and the abkhazians -lrb- in one -rrb- and the georgians in another , " he said .
' procedural difficulties ' at fault it would have been the first time representatives of the two sides have held direct negotiations since the five-day war after russia thwarted a georgian assault to retake its breakaway region of south ossetia .
russia has kept troops in south ossetia and another rebel region , abkhazia , and recognises both as independent states .
pierre morel , an official for the european union , which organized the talks with the united nations and organization for security and cooperation in europe , blamed " procedural difficulties " for the quick suspension of the negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana said he 's skeptical new talks will happen soon georgia said that russia had refused to meet its delegation .
american involvement " it 's regrettable that the russian federation has put the process from the very beginning under severe constraints , " georgia 's head of delegation and deputy foreign minister giga bokeria told afp .
russia would not take part in any further talks with georgia if representatives from south ossetia and abkhazia were not invited , russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said .
the americans injected a third element to the breakdown , with its head of delegation daniel fried saying that it was the south ossetians and abkhazians who failed to exhibit a " constructive spirit " to keep talks going .
" unfortunately ... the de facto authorities of south ossetia and abkhazia who were present at the meeting , i 'm sorry to say did not exhibit such a constructive spirit - they chose instead to walk out of the informational session , " he told afp .
tension between parties following the walkout , the parties demanded to be treated as full national delegations before coming back to talks , but " no one was prepared to do that , " said fried .
" this was unfortunate and so the session ended early because the south ossetians and abkhaz walked out , " he added .
even before the session , there was tension over the participation of the abkhazians and the south ossetians , with russia insisting there could be no agreements without their presence .
the georgians had argued that the official talks should only include representatives of georgia , russia , the united states , the european union , the osce and the un .
russia has said it wants security guarantees and a ban on all weapons sales to georgia , which in has demanded that all russian troops leave georgian territory , including south ossetia and abkhazia .
russia called on the georgians to sign " concrete and legally binding " security pacts with the two breakaway regions .
georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili accused moscow of adopting " soviet " tactics during the talks .
" despite the fact that georgia had a very constructive approach and the rare opportunity for negotiations , russia has left the negotiations .
this is how the soviet union acted in the past , " saakashvili said in comments broadcast on georgian public television . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

siegmund , who pressed for a six-year prison term , said thursday that libya in fact came nowhere close to making its own bomb , but the defendant 's actions had endangered international peace .

a german financial newspaper reports that authorities knew about trouble at a hard-hit major bank , hypo real estate , much earlier than they first acknowledged . german authorities were aware of troubles at property financier hypo real estate much earlier than finance minister peer steinbrueck has said , the business daily handelsblatt reported on thursday , oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 16.10.2008 brzezinski : west must avoid russia 's mistakes in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brzezinski warned against trying to create a democracy in afghanistan from the top down zbigniew brzezinski was instrumental in arming the afghan mujahedeen against the soviet union .
in an interview with dw , the former us security advisor talks about how the west can avoid the mistakes of the russians . zbigniew brzezinski , the son of a diplomat , was born in warsaw on march 28 , 1928 .
in the 1950s , he was considered one of the leading western experts on the soviet union .
in 1960 , brzezinski advised john f. kennedy on eastern europe during his successful candidacy for the us presidency .
known for his hawkish foreign policy , brzezinski served as national security adviser to us president jimmy carter from 1977 to 1981 .
today , brzezinski is a scholar at the center for strategic and international studies in washington and advises us democratic presidential candidate barack obama . dw-world.de : while almost all political parties in germany want the troops to remain in afghanistan , a majority of the population would prefer a withdrawal .
what should the west do - withdraw , stay the course or increase the number of troops ? zbigniew brzezinski : i do n't think any of these options can be the answer .
withdrawal means that afghanistan will plunge immediately into a major crisis with unpredictable consequences .
simply putting more troops is not the solution to the problem .
staying the course is obviously unsatisfactory because right now there is mounting evidence that the situation is deteriorating . as jimmy carter 's security advisor in 1979 , you orchestrated the arming of the mujahedeen against afghanistan 's left-wing government , eventually drawing the soviet army into what you later referred to as the " afghan trap . "
has the west now fallen into that trap ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf force in afghanistan is battling a resurgent taliban the west should not repeat the mistakes that the soviets made .
the soviets invaded afghanistan on the illusion that a bunch of marxist afghan intellectuals could help them create a communist satellite using a foreign army to impose its will .
when the us reacted to the outrageous terrorist attacks of september 11 , which originated from afghanistan , it required only 300 american soldiers to overthrow the taliban .
the reason for that was that the afghans were genuinely grateful for the american support and the support of other countries . we are now running the risk of unintentionally duplicating what the soviets were doing : instead of capitalizing on that goodwill and leaving fairly soon thereafter while giving a lot of economic assistance to the afghans , we are trying to create a modern state - and a democratic version thereof - through a large foreign military presence .
i do not think that is a wise strategy . what you are suggesting seems to be exactly what the soviet union did : before it withdrew its troops , it tried to transfer the burden of fighting to the afghan forces - and failed .
why should nato succeed , given that it has much less afghan soldiers to rely on than the soviets had ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan population is not yet completely against help from foreign governments the soviets did that after devastating the afghan society and creating massive ill will .
one should not underestimate the enormous damage and incredible suffering that the soviets imposed in the afghan society by a ruthless military campaign , which drove millions of afghans out of the country and killed hundreds of thousands of them .
we have not done that yet .
but i think the risk is that the longer we rely on a military solution , the more likely it is that the resistance to us will become stronger and stronger .
i do n't think that it is in any way comparable to the resistance against the soviet occupation yet . how can the west avoid getting there ? we can not try to create a modern , centralized , democratic state in afghanistan from the top down using essentially foreign troops to impose such a solution .
this collides with the sense of ethnic identity and religious sensitivity in a country that is very resistant to foreign intrusions .
we need an altogether different approach .
some additional troops in the short run may be necessary , but the main emphasis has to be on decentralized political accommodation with the different elements which are collectively described as the taliban but in fact representing a much more diversified group . in their nearly completed national intelligence estimate , us intelligence agencies report a " breakdown in central authority " and " rampant corruption within the karzai government . "
the british ambassador to afghanistan is said to have called for an " acceptable dictator ... " how do you create a dictator out of nothing ?
the problem in afghanistan is that it is not possible to rule it from kabul effectively , and i do not see how we create a dictator in a deus ex machina fashion .
a dictator has to have either extensive social appeal or ruthless instruments of power - or preferably both .
i do n't see that in afghanistan unless it emerges by itself at some point . how should the west deal with the drug trade that provides the taliban with funds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracking down on the drug trade will not undercut the taliban , brzezinski said simply trying to wipe out the poppies and deprive the farmers of income will not undercut the taliban , it will strengthen them .
the europeans should pay the afghan farmers as much as it takes to abandon drug crops .
the europeans should do that because most of these drugs go to europe .
the drug problem in afghanistan is simultaneously a source of income for the taliban and a serious threat to europe .
in this respect , the european responsibility for dealing with it is self-evident . there have been repeated us attacks on pakistani territory .
do you think this could further destabilize the nuclear power pakistan ? us attacks on pakistani territory should be done only under very exceptional circumstances : when there is truly reliable intelligence that very senior operatives of al qaeda are potential targets and there is no indication that the pakistani authorities are going to do anything about it .
in those circumstances , such a reaction is justifiable since al qaeda attacked the united states .
but i think sporadic attacks against some taliban activities emanating from pakistan are likely to have the effect of simply widening the hostilities , and , in effect , transforming the problems we face in afghanistan into a problem that spans both afghanistan and pakistan thereby vastly complicating the challenge that we face - while at the same time probably further destabilizing pakistan . you support barack obama .
much like john mccain , he has called for a significant increase in us troops in afghanistan ... the call for some additional troops may be justified here or there .
but additional troops are not the solution in the long run .
i think obama has a much better understanding of the problems of the 21st century than mccain and the problems we face in afghanistan are not the only problems the 21st century is putting before us .
the american definition of its role in this world has to creatively adapt to the new global complexities .
i do n't see much evidence that mccain understands that need .
obama is much more qualified . interview : dennis stute -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to german industry groups , berlin ca n't afford not to toss a little cash their way . the president of the german national industrial federation bdi , juergen thumann , has demanded more government investments to help alleviate the problems caused by the financial crisis . “ the federal government should in no way reduce the amount of their investments , in fact they should increase them , ” thumann was quoted as saying in the german daily der tagesspiegel . thumann said infrastructure projects should be renewed , especially in conjunction with private companies . “ i ’ m thinking of building roads , airports and power plants .
there are more than enough projects , ” he added . the bdi chief also encouraged the government to continue trying to balance the budget , even if it isn ’ t possible to do it in the next few years .
originally berlin had set a goal of 2011 , but in the face of the international financial crisis and the billions of euros being pumped into rescue packages , that now seems like a long shot . experts call for stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straubhaar is in favor of a stimulus package meanwhile the head of the hamburg world economics institute -lrb- hwwi -rrb- , thomas straubhaar , said that the government should give the people money to help stimulate the economy . “ every taxpayer should get a check from the government before the end of this year , ” he was quoted as saying in the german daily hamburger abendblatt . straubhaar suggested that each tax paying adult receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 134 -rrb- in november and 100 euros in december . “ everyone should get the same amount .
that 's because it isn ’ t just doing something for the people , but for the economy as well , ” he added . in spite of increasingly gloomy forecasts for the european economy , leaders have no plans for launching a concerted eu stimulus plan to boost activity , said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker . " who would pay for it and with what money ? " said juncker , who also chairs the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers .
" i do n't see how we could finance such a big stimulus plan . " germany on the brink of recession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts have said germany is headed for a recession this comes on the heels of an announcement by the german government that the country is on the verge of a recession , due to the financial crisis and the struggling world economy .
the ongoing economic downturn led the government to lower the 2009 growth forecast in europe 's biggest economy from 1.2 percent down to 0.2 percent .
but economy minister michael glos said in berlin that there is no need to panic .
for the current year , the minister is still expecting gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.7 percent .
though that number is also down from 2.5 percent .
" we are just seeing some slowdown in the economy , " glos said .
" there is nothing to sugarcoat or cover up . "
too early to foresee crisis ' outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said germany should reform its tax system glos insisted that his latest forecasts entailed a " high degree of uncertainty " as it was still too early to predict exactly how the current financial crisis would affect the real economy .
glos went on to say that the financial firestorm that swept through markets in recent weeks underscored the need for germany to overhaul its tax system .
" beyond what we 've already agreed , there is an urgent need for tax relief , " said glos .
according to government forecasts , the economic slowdown will also leave its mark on the german labor market , where unemployment has been shrinking for more than two years .
glos predicted that the jobless total will average an annual 3.3 million next year , the same level as this year . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking after meeting state premiers in berlin , the chancellor said the two sides had held " constructive talks " keeping in mind " the common responsiblity for our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has called the deal " tenable " and expects the rescue package to win parliamentary approval merkel said the two sides had agreed to share the burden of the rescue package , adding she was optimistic the legislative package would win approval in the german houses of parliament on friday .
german rescue package the biggest most of the eurozone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds .
germany 's rescue deal is the biggest , comprising 400 billion euros in guarantees , a 70-billion-euro fund and 10 billion euros of leeway .
berlin says it will need a credit of 100 billion euros to operate the bank-support scheme , but the trading fund will earn interest and dividend income from banks it takes over .
the ultimate net cost may be far less than the credit sum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has moved away from a case-to-case bailout for struggling banks finance minister peer steinbrueck explained that when the final accounts were calculated after the rescue , the states would pay 35 percent of the cost , or possibly receive 35 percent of the profits if there were any .
state premiers said this was because the states , as proprietors of state banks , would have to sustain other losses in the crisis .
" it 's a good outcome , " said juergen ruettgers , premier of north rhine westphalia .
merkel called the deal " tenable . "
berlin to create new agency for bank rescue germany has not identified which of its banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-quality derivatives .
the cost burden on the states from the wider bail-out is to be limited to 7.7 billion euros , with the federal government to pay all higher bills , steinbrueck said .
government politicians said germany would create a special agency for the bank rescue after the country 's central bank said its independence would be compromised if it became an arm of government policy .
instead of being a department of the bundesbank , it would be a legally separate unit at the bundesbank office in frankfurt .
the bundesbank , which is one of the principal central banks underpinning the european central bank in frankfurt , had earlier told berlin it did not want to be seen taking instructions from the german federal government .
to speed passage of the bill on friday , votes are set to be held in the bundestag lower chamber and the bundesrat upper chamber on the same day .
in an unusual move , the bill is to be emailed back to the german government a few hundred metres away for the final formalities .
when the finance minister , chancellor and president have signed it , the government printer in cologne will print 30,000 copies . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not have the right to miss this opportunity for reconstructing our system of finance in the 21st century , " french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , said in brussels on thursday , oct 16 . for the first time , eu leaders also addressed the fallout of the credit crunch on the real economy amid mounting fears of a deep recession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's car industry is already feeling the bite of the financial crisis " of course we see that the economic crisis is there , and the question i asked was : if we can bring coordinated answers to the financial crisis , can we not bring a coordinated answer to the economic crisis ? "
sarkozy said , pledging that france would take initiatives on the matter . " outside the financial sector , the european council -lrb- summit -rrb- underlines its determination to take the necessary steps to support growth and jobs , " the final summit statement said . " it calls on the the european commission to make appropriate proposals before the end of the year notably to preserve the competitiveness of european industry . " international emergency summit eu leaders are also leading calls for an international emergency summit , perhaps after us elections next month , to reshape the financial system while washington has shown less enthusiasm . sarkozy said he and european commission president jose manuel barroso would travel to meet us president george w. bush on saturday to help prepare for a summit that would decide on a " refoundation of capitalism . " despite the tough talk , global stock markets on thursday continued their freefall , pummelled by signs the world 's biggest economies were headed for recession after a month of financial sector turmoil . in a statement , the eu also called for the first time for a coordinated system of financial supervision at eu level and the creation of a crisis cell to help manage the financial turmoil . as a first step , german chancellor angela merkel told reporters , national central bank governors will meet at least once a month to exchange information on financial supervision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets have reacted warily to rescue plans by western governments the heads of the european central bank , the eu presidency , the executive european commission and the eurogroup of 15 countries that share the euro currency will all take part in the financial crisis management cell . a 2 trillion euro -lrb- 2.7 trillion dollar -rrb- rescue package , initially approved by eurozone leaders at a meeting in paris over the weekend , includes measures to safeguard private savers , guarantee interbank lending and partly nationalize shaky financial insitutions .
it follows a similar initiative approved in the united states , where the global credit crunch originated .
new bretton woods the agreement in brussels came after hours of discussions that saw member states such as the czech republic complain that it would allow for too much state intervention .
but the real surprise in brussels came not from the czechs but from brown .
despite his reputation as a eurosceptic , fellow eu leaders listened carefully to britain 's former chancellor of the exchequer as he outlined his plans for " a new bretton woods " that would avoid future financial breakdowns .
the 1944 bretton woods conference laid out the foundations of post-world war ii capitalism by establishing rules for the international monetary and financial order and by creating such bodies as the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
" global financial markets present challenges that no one nation can solve in isolation , " brown said in a letter distributed to eu heads of state and government in brussels .
" we must therefore strengthen global cooperation and build a new global financial architecture for the years ahead - a new bretton woods , which recognizes the globalization of financial risk in the responsibilities of global institutions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has called for a " new bretton woods " brown 's four-point plan envisages " a global early warning system " to prevent future financial crises from spreading , " globally accepted standards of supervision and regulation , " effective " cross-border supervision " of the world 's 30 largest multinationals and " cooperation and concerted action " during times of crisis .
his proposals were expected to be discussed by a forthcoming group of eight summit extended to include emerging powers such as china and india .
fighting climate change # b # eu leaders also agreed on thursday to reach a final deal on how to fight climate change in december after polish threats of a veto were won over , officials said .
" the objectives remain unchanged and the calendar remains the same .
it is now up to -lrb- european commission -rrb- president -lrb- jose manuel -rrb- barroso and myself to find solutions for those countries that have expressed their worries , " sarkozy said .
as the summit opened on wednesday , poland threatened to veto a declaration calling for a decision on the eu 's proposed climate-change laws in december , saying that its concerns over the economic impact of the proposed laws had not been taken into account .
seven other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe backed that call , accusing the european commission of not taking their earlier efforts on climate change into account .
and italy joined the revolt , arguing that it would be too expensive to implement the laws given the present financial crisis .
but on thursday morning , the french government proposed a new resolution sticking to the december deadline but promising to take into account the " specific situation " in each member state . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

social groups will be out on the streets to protest the event . it 's tough being rich these days .
not only are the well-heeled seeing their assets plunge in value in the global financial crisis , now even small highlights on the social calendar , such as the " millionaire fair " in munich , are at risk of being spoiled by a noisy group of social activists .
among the protest actions planned for the opening day of the exclusive life style event is a symbolic slave market that aims to turn the spotlight on wage dumping in germany and around the world .
" our aim is not to pillory people , but to attack existing social conditions , " said walter listl from the city 's social forum . " riches are the cause of poverty . "
just a few meters away from the entrance to the venue on thursday , oct .
16 , demonstrators will be auctioning off cheap labor , singing anti-capitalist songs and staging sketches lampooning the bank bailout .
inside , visitors will be admiring private jets , high-end cars , lavish jewelry and haute couture .
this is the first time that the millionaire fair , first held in 2002 , has taken place in germany .
previous venues have included shanghai , moscow and amsterdam .
the affluent southern german city of munich in the country 's richest state , bavaria , is an obvious choice .
it also played host to the luxury fair earlier in the year .
playground for the rich and famous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refreshments at the fair include champagne and caviar fair organizers expect the event to attract some 20,000 people , including the rich and famous , top business people , luxury goods retailers , bon viveurs and just the plain curious .
at 39 euros -lrb- $ 52 -rrb- for an entrance ticket , you do n't need to be a millionaire to get in .
and who knows who you might rub shoulders with .
film stars like joan collins and elizabeth hurley and singer bryan ferry were among the guests at previous millionaire fairs .
for four days , some 100 firms will be setting out their stalls across 16,000 square meters of exhibition space .
according to the official web site , " the creme de la créme of luxury goods industry will be presenting their most beautiful one-off creations , the most exclusive products and unusual services to the event 's discerning visitors . "

he added that he would do everything possible to make the meeting work out .
late wednesday , georgia and russia were supposed to gather for internationally-backed peace talks in geneva .
but they broke down on the first day when the rivals , who fought a war in august , blamed each other for the failure to even enter the same room .
talks are unlikely to resume until november , solana added .
sergei shamba , foreign minister of the pro-russian separatist region of abkhazia , told afp news service that on wednesday " there were two separate meetings , the russians and the abkhazians -lrb- in one -rrb- and the georgians in another , " he said .
' procedural difficulties ' at fault it would have been the first time representatives of the two sides have held direct negotiations since the five-day war after russia thwarted a georgian assault to retake its breakaway region of south ossetia .
russia has kept troops in south ossetia and another rebel region , abkhazia , and recognises both as independent states .
pierre morel , an official for the european union , which organized the talks with the united nations and organization for security and cooperation in europe , blamed " procedural difficulties " for the quick suspension of the negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana said he 's skeptical new talks will happen soon georgia said that russia had refused to meet its delegation .
american involvement " it 's regrettable that the russian federation has put the process from the very beginning under severe constraints , " georgia 's head of delegation and deputy foreign minister giga bokeria told afp .
russia would not take part in any further talks with georgia if representatives from south ossetia and abkhazia were not invited , russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said .
the americans injected a third element to the breakdown , with its head of delegation daniel fried saying that it was the south ossetians and abkhazians who failed to exhibit a " constructive spirit " to keep talks going .
" unfortunately ... the de facto authorities of south ossetia and abkhazia who were present at the meeting , i 'm sorry to say did not exhibit such a constructive spirit - they chose instead to walk out of the informational session , " he told afp .
tension between parties following the walkout , the parties demanded to be treated as full national delegations before coming back to talks , but " no one was prepared to do that , " said fried .
" this was unfortunate and so the session ended early because the south ossetians and abkhaz walked out , " he added .
even before the session , there was tension over the participation of the abkhazians and the south ossetians , with russia insisting there could be no agreements without their presence .
the georgians had argued that the official talks should only include representatives of georgia , russia , the united states , the european union , the osce and the un .
russia has said it wants security guarantees and a ban on all weapons sales to georgia , which in has demanded that all russian troops leave georgian territory , including south ossetia and abkhazia .
russia called on the georgians to sign " concrete and legally binding " security pacts with the two breakaway regions .
georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili accused moscow of adopting " soviet " tactics during the talks .
" despite the fact that georgia had a very constructive approach and the rare opportunity for negotiations , russia has left the negotiations .
this is how the soviet union acted in the past , " saakashvili said in comments broadcast on georgian public television . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 16.10.2008 german parliament approves extra troops for afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extra troops raises the total number of german soldiers in afghanistan to 4,500 germany 's lower house of parliament voted on thursday to increase the number of troops berlin can send to afghanistan by 1,000 soldiers and extended the mission 's mandate by 14 months . a majority of 442 lawmakers voted to support a proposal by chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition to extend berlin 's participation in a nato-led peacekeeping mission , which currently includes just over 50,000 soldiers .
96 parliamentarians voted against and 32 abstained .
under a previous parliamentary mandate , germany was allowed to send up to 3,500 troops to afghanistan .
the vote on thursday increases that number to 4,500 .
the mandate is valid for 14 months .
troop morale at a low the vote comes at a time when morale among german troops in afghanistan is low as they face increased attacks from a resurgent taliban .
five years ago , when the german army began its mission in northern afghanistan , the region was regarded as one of the country 's safest .
now , the solders run the daily risk of " being caught in an explosive or being shot at , " one officer said .
during the last year , the security situation has deteriorated not only in the north , but all across afghanistan .
the afghan presidential election , likely to shape the country 's future for years to come , is scheduled around autumn 2009 , making a further escalation of violence in the coming year more than likely .
as voter registration started last week , taliban spokesman kari jussif ahmadi warned the population against registering , saying it was a " waste of time , " as the militants were set to prevent the election from happening .
" more than half of the country is in our hands , and we will not let it happen , " he said .
added danger posed by upcoming election while the taliban are unlikely to prevent the polls - they failed to do so in 2004 despite grand announcements to the contrary - they are believed to be strong enough to severely disrupt the run-up to the election .
the international community has made it clear that securing the election will be one of the most important tasks in 2009 .
the german troops within the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- will also play a role in the training of afghan security forces , a process that must be speeded up after being promoted too timidly for a long time .
there is no doubt that this will be dangerous .
even today , the duty of the 4,500 german soldiers is a far cry from the beginning of the mission , when isaf troops really were peacekeepers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers ' deaths have changed the way troops view their mission soldiers at the german camp in the northern province of kunduz nicknamed the full moon " rocket weather , " because of the many attacks raining down on them by moonlight .
in september , a german soldier was killed in an attack .
" you have an odd feeling when you leave the camp on a mission , " said an officer , who did not want to give his name .
" it sensitizes you , but also creates a distance to the population .
just being present , just walking down to the bazaar , like we did two , three years ago , that 's not possible anymore . "

96 parliamentarians voted against and 32 abstained .
under a previous parliamentary mandate , germany was allowed to send up to 3,500 troops to afghanistan .
the vote on thursday increases that number to 4,500 .
the mandate is valid for 14 months .
troop morale at a low the vote comes at a time when morale among german troops in afghanistan is low as they face increased attacks from a resurgent taliban .
five years ago , when the german army began its mission in northern afghanistan , the region was regarded as one of the country 's safest .
now , the solders run the daily risk of " being caught in an explosive or being shot at , " one officer said .
during the last year , the security situation has deteriorated not only in the north , but all across afghanistan .
the afghan presidential election , likely to shape the country 's future for years to come , is scheduled around autumn 2009 , making a further escalation of violence in the coming year more than likely .
as voter registration started last week , taliban spokesman kari jussif ahmadi warned the population against registering , saying it was a " waste of time , " as the militants were set to prevent the election from happening .
" more than half of the country is in our hands , and we will not let it happen , " he said .
added danger posed by upcoming election while the taliban are unlikely to prevent the polls - they failed to do so in 2004 despite grand announcements to the contrary - they are believed to be strong enough to severely disrupt the run-up to the election .
the international community has made it clear that securing the election will be one of the most important tasks in 2009 .
the german troops within the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- will also play a role in the training of afghan security forces , a process that must be speeded up after being promoted too timidly for a long time .
there is no doubt that this will be dangerous .
even today , the duty of the 4,500 german soldiers is a far cry from the beginning of the mission , when isaf troops really were peacekeepers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers ' deaths have changed the way troops view their mission soldiers at the german camp in the northern province of kunduz nicknamed the full moon " rocket weather , " because of the many attacks raining down on them by moonlight .
in september , a german soldier was killed in an attack .
" you have an odd feeling when you leave the camp on a mission , " said an officer , who did not want to give his name .
" it sensitizes you , but also creates a distance to the population .
just being present , just walking down to the bazaar , like we did two , three years ago , that 's not possible anymore . "

in an interview with dw , the former us security advisor talks about how the west can avoid the mistakes of the russians . zbigniew brzezinski , the son of a diplomat , was born in warsaw on march 28 , 1928 .
in the 1950s , he was considered one of the leading western experts on the soviet union .
in 1960 , brzezinski advised john f. kennedy on eastern europe during his successful candidacy for the us presidency .
known for his hawkish foreign policy , brzezinski served as national security adviser to us president jimmy carter from 1977 to 1981 .
today , brzezinski is a scholar at the center for strategic and international studies in washington and advises us democratic presidential candidate barack obama . dw-world.de : while almost all political parties in germany want the troops to remain in afghanistan , a majority of the population would prefer a withdrawal .
what should the west do - withdraw , stay the course or increase the number of troops ? zbigniew brzezinski : i do n't think any of these options can be the answer .
withdrawal means that afghanistan will plunge immediately into a major crisis with unpredictable consequences .
simply putting more troops is not the solution to the problem .
staying the course is obviously unsatisfactory because right now there is mounting evidence that the situation is deteriorating . as jimmy carter 's security advisor in 1979 , you orchestrated the arming of the mujahedeen against afghanistan 's left-wing government , eventually drawing the soviet army into what you later referred to as the " afghan trap . "
has the west now fallen into that trap ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf force in afghanistan is battling a resurgent taliban the west should not repeat the mistakes that the soviets made .
the soviets invaded afghanistan on the illusion that a bunch of marxist afghan intellectuals could help them create a communist satellite using a foreign army to impose its will .
when the us reacted to the outrageous terrorist attacks of september 11 , which originated from afghanistan , it required only 300 american soldiers to overthrow the taliban .
the reason for that was that the afghans were genuinely grateful for the american support and the support of other countries . we are now running the risk of unintentionally duplicating what the soviets were doing : instead of capitalizing on that goodwill and leaving fairly soon thereafter while giving a lot of economic assistance to the afghans , we are trying to create a modern state - and a democratic version thereof - through a large foreign military presence .
i do not think that is a wise strategy . what you are suggesting seems to be exactly what the soviet union did : before it withdrew its troops , it tried to transfer the burden of fighting to the afghan forces - and failed .
why should nato succeed , given that it has much less afghan soldiers to rely on than the soviets had ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan population is not yet completely against help from foreign governments the soviets did that after devastating the afghan society and creating massive ill will .
one should not underestimate the enormous damage and incredible suffering that the soviets imposed in the afghan society by a ruthless military campaign , which drove millions of afghans out of the country and killed hundreds of thousands of them .
we have not done that yet .
but i think the risk is that the longer we rely on a military solution , the more likely it is that the resistance to us will become stronger and stronger .
i do n't think that it is in any way comparable to the resistance against the soviet occupation yet . how can the west avoid getting there ? we can not try to create a modern , centralized , democratic state in afghanistan from the top down using essentially foreign troops to impose such a solution .
this collides with the sense of ethnic identity and religious sensitivity in a country that is very resistant to foreign intrusions .
we need an altogether different approach .
some additional troops in the short run may be necessary , but the main emphasis has to be on decentralized political accommodation with the different elements which are collectively described as the taliban but in fact representing a much more diversified group . in their nearly completed national intelligence estimate , us intelligence agencies report a " breakdown in central authority " and " rampant corruption within the karzai government . "
the british ambassador to afghanistan is said to have called for an " acceptable dictator ... " how do you create a dictator out of nothing ?
the problem in afghanistan is that it is not possible to rule it from kabul effectively , and i do not see how we create a dictator in a deus ex machina fashion .
a dictator has to have either extensive social appeal or ruthless instruments of power - or preferably both .
i do n't see that in afghanistan unless it emerges by itself at some point . how should the west deal with the drug trade that provides the taliban with funds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracking down on the drug trade will not undercut the taliban , brzezinski said simply trying to wipe out the poppies and deprive the farmers of income will not undercut the taliban , it will strengthen them .
the europeans should pay the afghan farmers as much as it takes to abandon drug crops .
the europeans should do that because most of these drugs go to europe .
the drug problem in afghanistan is simultaneously a source of income for the taliban and a serious threat to europe .
in this respect , the european responsibility for dealing with it is self-evident . there have been repeated us attacks on pakistani territory .
do you think this could further destabilize the nuclear power pakistan ? us attacks on pakistani territory should be done only under very exceptional circumstances : when there is truly reliable intelligence that very senior operatives of al qaeda are potential targets and there is no indication that the pakistani authorities are going to do anything about it .
in those circumstances , such a reaction is justifiable since al qaeda attacked the united states .
but i think sporadic attacks against some taliban activities emanating from pakistan are likely to have the effect of simply widening the hostilities , and , in effect , transforming the problems we face in afghanistan into a problem that spans both afghanistan and pakistan thereby vastly complicating the challenge that we face - while at the same time probably further destabilizing pakistan . you support barack obama .
much like john mccain , he has called for a significant increase in us troops in afghanistan ... the call for some additional troops may be justified here or there .
but additional troops are not the solution in the long run .
i think obama has a much better understanding of the problems of the 21st century than mccain and the problems we face in afghanistan are not the only problems the 21st century is putting before us .
the american definition of its role in this world has to creatively adapt to the new global complexities .
i do n't see much evidence that mccain understands that need .

in an interview with dw , the former us security advisor talks about how the west can avoid the mistakes of the russians . zbigniew brzezinski , the son of a diplomat , was born in warsaw on march 28 , 1928 .
in the 1950s , he was considered one of the leading western experts on the soviet union .
in 1960 , brzezinski advised john f. kennedy on eastern europe during his successful candidacy for the us presidency .
known for his hawkish foreign policy , brzezinski served as national security adviser to us president jimmy carter from 1977 to 1981 .
today , brzezinski is a scholar at the center for strategic and international studies in washington and advises us democratic presidential candidate barack obama . dw-world.de : while almost all political parties in germany want the troops to remain in afghanistan , a majority of the population would prefer a withdrawal .
what should the west do - withdraw , stay the course or increase the number of troops ? zbigniew brzezinski : i do n't think any of these options can be the answer .
withdrawal means that afghanistan will plunge immediately into a major crisis with unpredictable consequences .
simply putting more troops is not the solution to the problem .
staying the course is obviously unsatisfactory because right now there is mounting evidence that the situation is deteriorating . as jimmy carter 's security advisor in 1979 , you orchestrated the arming of the mujahedeen against afghanistan 's left-wing government , eventually drawing the soviet army into what you later referred to as the " afghan trap . "
has the west now fallen into that trap ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf force in afghanistan is battling a resurgent taliban the west should not repeat the mistakes that the soviets made .
the soviets invaded afghanistan on the illusion that a bunch of marxist afghan intellectuals could help them create a communist satellite using a foreign army to impose its will .
when the us reacted to the outrageous terrorist attacks of september 11 , which originated from afghanistan , it required only 300 american soldiers to overthrow the taliban .
the reason for that was that the afghans were genuinely grateful for the american support and the support of other countries . we are now running the risk of unintentionally duplicating what the soviets were doing : instead of capitalizing on that goodwill and leaving fairly soon thereafter while giving a lot of economic assistance to the afghans , we are trying to create a modern state - and a democratic version thereof - through a large foreign military presence .
i do not think that is a wise strategy . what you are suggesting seems to be exactly what the soviet union did : before it withdrew its troops , it tried to transfer the burden of fighting to the afghan forces - and failed .
why should nato succeed , given that it has much less afghan soldiers to rely on than the soviets had ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan population is not yet completely against help from foreign governments the soviets did that after devastating the afghan society and creating massive ill will .
one should not underestimate the enormous damage and incredible suffering that the soviets imposed in the afghan society by a ruthless military campaign , which drove millions of afghans out of the country and killed hundreds of thousands of them .
we have not done that yet .
but i think the risk is that the longer we rely on a military solution , the more likely it is that the resistance to us will become stronger and stronger .
i do n't think that it is in any way comparable to the resistance against the soviet occupation yet . how can the west avoid getting there ? we can not try to create a modern , centralized , democratic state in afghanistan from the top down using essentially foreign troops to impose such a solution .
this collides with the sense of ethnic identity and religious sensitivity in a country that is very resistant to foreign intrusions .
we need an altogether different approach .
some additional troops in the short run may be necessary , but the main emphasis has to be on decentralized political accommodation with the different elements which are collectively described as the taliban but in fact representing a much more diversified group . in their nearly completed national intelligence estimate , us intelligence agencies report a " breakdown in central authority " and " rampant corruption within the karzai government . "
the british ambassador to afghanistan is said to have called for an " acceptable dictator ... " how do you create a dictator out of nothing ?
the problem in afghanistan is that it is not possible to rule it from kabul effectively , and i do not see how we create a dictator in a deus ex machina fashion .
a dictator has to have either extensive social appeal or ruthless instruments of power - or preferably both .
i do n't see that in afghanistan unless it emerges by itself at some point . how should the west deal with the drug trade that provides the taliban with funds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracking down on the drug trade will not undercut the taliban , brzezinski said simply trying to wipe out the poppies and deprive the farmers of income will not undercut the taliban , it will strengthen them .
the europeans should pay the afghan farmers as much as it takes to abandon drug crops .
the europeans should do that because most of these drugs go to europe .
the drug problem in afghanistan is simultaneously a source of income for the taliban and a serious threat to europe .
in this respect , the european responsibility for dealing with it is self-evident . there have been repeated us attacks on pakistani territory .
do you think this could further destabilize the nuclear power pakistan ? us attacks on pakistani territory should be done only under very exceptional circumstances : when there is truly reliable intelligence that very senior operatives of al qaeda are potential targets and there is no indication that the pakistani authorities are going to do anything about it .
in those circumstances , such a reaction is justifiable since al qaeda attacked the united states .
but i think sporadic attacks against some taliban activities emanating from pakistan are likely to have the effect of simply widening the hostilities , and , in effect , transforming the problems we face in afghanistan into a problem that spans both afghanistan and pakistan thereby vastly complicating the challenge that we face - while at the same time probably further destabilizing pakistan . you support barack obama .
much like john mccain , he has called for a significant increase in us troops in afghanistan ... the call for some additional troops may be justified here or there .
but additional troops are not the solution in the long run .
i think obama has a much better understanding of the problems of the 21st century than mccain and the problems we face in afghanistan are not the only problems the 21st century is putting before us .
the american definition of its role in this world has to creatively adapt to the new global complexities .
i do n't see much evidence that mccain understands that need .

he added that he would do everything possible to make the meeting work out .
late wednesday , georgia and russia were supposed to gather for internationally-backed peace talks in geneva .
but they broke down on the first day when the rivals , who fought a war in august , blamed each other for the failure to even enter the same room .
talks are unlikely to resume until november , solana added .
sergei shamba , foreign minister of the pro-russian separatist region of abkhazia , told afp news service that on wednesday " there were two separate meetings , the russians and the abkhazians -lrb- in one -rrb- and the georgians in another , " he said .
' procedural difficulties ' at fault it would have been the first time representatives of the two sides have held direct negotiations since the five-day war after russia thwarted a georgian assault to retake its breakaway region of south ossetia .
russia has kept troops in south ossetia and another rebel region , abkhazia , and recognises both as independent states .
pierre morel , an official for the european union , which organized the talks with the united nations and organization for security and cooperation in europe , blamed " procedural difficulties " for the quick suspension of the negotiations .

american involvement " it 's regrettable that the russian federation has put the process from the very beginning under severe constraints , " georgia 's head of delegation and deputy foreign minister giga bokeria told afp .
russia would not take part in any further talks with georgia if representatives from south ossetia and abkhazia were not invited , russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said .
the americans injected a third element to the breakdown , with its head of delegation daniel fried saying that it was the south ossetians and abkhazians who failed to exhibit a " constructive spirit " to keep talks going .
" unfortunately ... the de facto authorities of south ossetia and abkhazia who were present at the meeting , i 'm sorry to say did not exhibit such a constructive spirit - they chose instead to walk out of the informational session , " he told afp .
tension between parties following the walkout , the parties demanded to be treated as full national delegations before coming back to talks , but " no one was prepared to do that , " said fried .
" this was unfortunate and so the session ended early because the south ossetians and abkhaz walked out , " he added .
even before the session , there was tension over the participation of the abkhazians and the south ossetians , with russia insisting there could be no agreements without their presence .
the georgians had argued that the official talks should only include representatives of georgia , russia , the united states , the european union , the osce and the un .
russia has said it wants security guarantees and a ban on all weapons sales to georgia , which in has demanded that all russian troops leave georgian territory , including south ossetia and abkhazia .
russia called on the georgians to sign " concrete and legally binding " security pacts with the two breakaway regions .
georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili accused moscow of adopting " soviet " tactics during the talks .

he added that he would do everything possible to make the meeting work out .
late wednesday , georgia and russia were supposed to gather for internationally-backed peace talks in geneva .
but they broke down on the first day when the rivals , who fought a war in august , blamed each other for the failure to even enter the same room .
talks are unlikely to resume until november , solana added .
sergei shamba , foreign minister of the pro-russian separatist region of abkhazia , told afp news service that on wednesday " there were two separate meetings , the russians and the abkhazians -lrb- in one -rrb- and the georgians in another , " he said .

tension between parties following the walkout , the parties demanded to be treated as full national delegations before coming back to talks , but " no one was prepared to do that , " said fried .
" this was unfortunate and so the session ended early because the south ossetians and abkhaz walked out , " he added .
even before the session , there was tension over the participation of the abkhazians and the south ossetians , with russia insisting there could be no agreements without their presence .

according to german industry groups , berlin ca n't afford not to toss a little cash their way . the president of the german national industrial federation bdi , juergen thumann , has demanded more government investments to help alleviate the problems caused by the financial crisis . “ the federal government should in no way reduce the amount of their investments , in fact they should increase them , ” thumann was quoted as saying in the german daily der tagesspiegel . thumann said infrastructure projects should be renewed , especially in conjunction with private companies . “ i ’ m thinking of building roads , airports and power plants .
there are more than enough projects , ” he added . the bdi chief also encouraged the government to continue trying to balance the budget , even if it isn ’ t possible to do it in the next few years .
originally berlin had set a goal of 2011 , but in the face of the international financial crisis and the billions of euros being pumped into rescue packages , that now seems like a long shot . experts call for stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straubhaar is in favor of a stimulus package meanwhile the head of the hamburg world economics institute -lrb- hwwi -rrb- , thomas straubhaar , said that the government should give the people money to help stimulate the economy . “ every taxpayer should get a check from the government before the end of this year , ” he was quoted as saying in the german daily hamburger abendblatt . straubhaar suggested that each tax paying adult receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 134 -rrb- in november and 100 euros in december . “ everyone should get the same amount .
that 's because it isn ’ t just doing something for the people , but for the economy as well , ” he added . in spite of increasingly gloomy forecasts for the european economy , leaders have no plans for launching a concerted eu stimulus plan to boost activity , said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker .

the ongoing economic downturn led the government to lower the 2009 growth forecast in europe 's biggest economy from 1.2 percent down to 0.2 percent .
but economy minister michael glos said in berlin that there is no need to panic .
for the current year , the minister is still expecting gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.7 percent .
though that number is also down from 2.5 percent .
" we are just seeing some slowdown in the economy , " glos said .
" there is nothing to sugarcoat or cover up . "

glos went on to say that the financial firestorm that swept through markets in recent weeks underscored the need for germany to overhaul its tax system .
" beyond what we 've already agreed , there is an urgent need for tax relief , " said glos .
according to government forecasts , the economic slowdown will also leave its mark on the german labor market , where unemployment has been shrinking for more than two years .

originally berlin had set a goal of 2011 , but in the face of the international financial crisis and the billions of euros being pumped into rescue packages , that now seems like a long shot . experts call for stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straubhaar is in favor of a stimulus package meanwhile the head of the hamburg world economics institute -lrb- hwwi -rrb- , thomas straubhaar , said that the government should give the people money to help stimulate the economy . “ every taxpayer should get a check from the government before the end of this year , ” he was quoted as saying in the german daily hamburger abendblatt . straubhaar suggested that each tax paying adult receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 134 -rrb- in november and 100 euros in december . “ everyone should get the same amount .
that 's because it isn ’ t just doing something for the people , but for the economy as well , ” he added . in spite of increasingly gloomy forecasts for the european economy , leaders have no plans for launching a concerted eu stimulus plan to boost activity , said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker . " who would pay for it and with what money ? " said juncker , who also chairs the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers .
" i do n't see how we could finance such a big stimulus plan . " germany on the brink of recession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts have said germany is headed for a recession this comes on the heels of an announcement by the german government that the country is on the verge of a recession , due to the financial crisis and the struggling world economy .
the ongoing economic downturn led the government to lower the 2009 growth forecast in europe 's biggest economy from 1.2 percent down to 0.2 percent .
but economy minister michael glos said in berlin that there is no need to panic .
for the current year , the minister is still expecting gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.7 percent .
though that number is also down from 2.5 percent .
" we are just seeing some slowdown in the economy , " glos said .
" there is nothing to sugarcoat or cover up . "
too early to foresee crisis ' outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said germany should reform its tax system glos insisted that his latest forecasts entailed a " high degree of uncertainty " as it was still too early to predict exactly how the current financial crisis would affect the real economy .
glos went on to say that the financial firestorm that swept through markets in recent weeks underscored the need for germany to overhaul its tax system .
" beyond what we 've already agreed , there is an urgent need for tax relief , " said glos .
according to government forecasts , the economic slowdown will also leave its mark on the german labor market , where unemployment has been shrinking for more than two years .
glos predicted that the jobless total will average an annual 3.3 million next year , the same level as this year . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not have the right to miss this opportunity for reconstructing our system of finance in the 21st century , " french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , said in brussels on thursday , oct 16 . for the first time , eu leaders also addressed the fallout of the credit crunch on the real economy amid mounting fears of a deep recession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's car industry is already feeling the bite of the financial crisis " of course we see that the economic crisis is there , and the question i asked was : if we can bring coordinated answers to the financial crisis , can we not bring a coordinated answer to the economic crisis ? "
sarkozy said , pledging that france would take initiatives on the matter . " outside the financial sector , the european council -lrb- summit -rrb- underlines its determination to take the necessary steps to support growth and jobs , " the final summit statement said . " it calls on the the european commission to make appropriate proposals before the end of the year notably to preserve the competitiveness of european industry . " international emergency summit eu leaders are also leading calls for an international emergency summit , perhaps after us elections next month , to reshape the financial system while washington has shown less enthusiasm . sarkozy said he and european commission president jose manuel barroso would travel to meet us president george w. bush on saturday to help prepare for a summit that would decide on a " refoundation of capitalism . " despite the tough talk , global stock markets on thursday continued their freefall , pummelled by signs the world 's biggest economies were headed for recession after a month of financial sector turmoil . in a statement , the eu also called for the first time for a coordinated system of financial supervision at eu level and the creation of a crisis cell to help manage the financial turmoil . as a first step , german chancellor angela merkel told reporters , national central bank governors will meet at least once a month to exchange information on financial supervision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets have reacted warily to rescue plans by western governments the heads of the european central bank , the eu presidency , the executive european commission and the eurogroup of 15 countries that share the euro currency will all take part in the financial crisis management cell . a 2 trillion euro -lrb- 2.7 trillion dollar -rrb- rescue package , initially approved by eurozone leaders at a meeting in paris over the weekend , includes measures to safeguard private savers , guarantee interbank lending and partly nationalize shaky financial insitutions .

new bretton woods the agreement in brussels came after hours of discussions that saw member states such as the czech republic complain that it would allow for too much state intervention .
but the real surprise in brussels came not from the czechs but from brown .
despite his reputation as a eurosceptic , fellow eu leaders listened carefully to britain 's former chancellor of the exchequer as he outlined his plans for " a new bretton woods " that would avoid future financial breakdowns .
the 1944 bretton woods conference laid out the foundations of post-world war ii capitalism by establishing rules for the international monetary and financial order and by creating such bodies as the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
" global financial markets present challenges that no one nation can solve in isolation , " brown said in a letter distributed to eu heads of state and government in brussels .
" we must therefore strengthen global cooperation and build a new global financial architecture for the years ahead - a new bretton woods , which recognizes the globalization of financial risk in the responsibilities of global institutions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has called for a " new bretton woods " brown 's four-point plan envisages " a global early warning system " to prevent future financial crises from spreading , " globally accepted standards of supervision and regulation , " effective " cross-border supervision " of the world 's 30 largest multinationals and " cooperation and concerted action " during times of crisis .
his proposals were expected to be discussed by a forthcoming group of eight summit extended to include emerging powers such as china and india .
fighting climate change # b # eu leaders also agreed on thursday to reach a final deal on how to fight climate change in december after polish threats of a veto were won over , officials said .
" the objectives remain unchanged and the calendar remains the same .
it is now up to -lrb- european commission -rrb- president -lrb- jose manuel -rrb- barroso and myself to find solutions for those countries that have expressed their worries , " sarkozy said .
as the summit opened on wednesday , poland threatened to veto a declaration calling for a decision on the eu 's proposed climate-change laws in december , saying that its concerns over the economic impact of the proposed laws had not been taken into account .
seven other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe backed that call , accusing the european commission of not taking their earlier efforts on climate change into account .
and italy joined the revolt , arguing that it would be too expensive to implement the laws given the present financial crisis .
but on thursday morning , the french government proposed a new resolution sticking to the december deadline but promising to take into account the " specific situation " in each member state . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier this month , lerch admitted he advised the libyans on how to build a piping system for a uranium-enrichment plant .
prosecutor wolfgang siegmund said earlier thursday the defendant helped libyan interests , but had not been a member of an international network of nuclear smugglers led by the rogue pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan .
us and german intelligence agents uncovered the plans to export the piping system , earlier media reports said .
libya has since abandoned its nuclear ambitions .
the defendant was convicted of breaching german laws restricting exports of militarily useful products .
defendant endangered international peace a previous trial which began in july 2006 had to be called off after the bomb plans - regarded as evidence by the defense team - were shredded by swiss authorities .
under an agreement with the defense to settle with a compromise , prosecutor siegmund dropped an allegation that the defendant was the builder and supplier of a gas ultra centrifuge system to refine uranium for libya 's bomb .
siegmund , who pressed for a six-year prison term , said thursday that libya in fact came nowhere close to making its own bomb , but the defendant 's actions had endangered international peace .

speaking after meeting state premiers in berlin , the chancellor said the two sides had held " constructive talks " keeping in mind " the common responsiblity for our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has called the deal " tenable " and expects the rescue package to win parliamentary approval merkel said the two sides had agreed to share the burden of the rescue package , adding she was optimistic the legislative package would win approval in the german houses of parliament on friday .
german rescue package the biggest most of the eurozone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds .
germany 's rescue deal is the biggest , comprising 400 billion euros in guarantees , a 70-billion-euro fund and 10 billion euros of leeway .
berlin says it will need a credit of 100 billion euros to operate the bank-support scheme , but the trading fund will earn interest and dividend income from banks it takes over .
the ultimate net cost may be far less than the credit sum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has moved away from a case-to-case bailout for struggling banks finance minister peer steinbrueck explained that when the final accounts were calculated after the rescue , the states would pay 35 percent of the cost , or possibly receive 35 percent of the profits if there were any .
state premiers said this was because the states , as proprietors of state banks , would have to sustain other losses in the crisis .
" it 's a good outcome , " said juergen ruettgers , premier of north rhine westphalia .
merkel called the deal " tenable . "
berlin to create new agency for bank rescue germany has not identified which of its banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-quality derivatives .
the cost burden on the states from the wider bail-out is to be limited to 7.7 billion euros , with the federal government to pay all higher bills , steinbrueck said .
government politicians said germany would create a special agency for the bank rescue after the country 's central bank said its independence would be compromised if it became an arm of government policy .
instead of being a department of the bundesbank , it would be a legally separate unit at the bundesbank office in frankfurt .
the bundesbank , which is one of the principal central banks underpinning the european central bank in frankfurt , had earlier told berlin it did not want to be seen taking instructions from the german federal government .
to speed passage of the bill on friday , votes are set to be held in the bundestag lower chamber and the bundesrat upper chamber on the same day .
in an unusual move , the bill is to be emailed back to the german government a few hundred metres away for the final formalities .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has called the deal " tenable " and expects the rescue package to win parliamentary approval merkel said the two sides had agreed to share the burden of the rescue package , adding she was optimistic the legislative package would win approval in the german houses of parliament on friday .
german rescue package the biggest most of the eurozone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds .
germany 's rescue deal is the biggest , comprising 400 billion euros in guarantees , a 70-billion-euro fund and 10 billion euros of leeway .
berlin says it will need a credit of 100 billion euros to operate the bank-support scheme , but the trading fund will earn interest and dividend income from banks it takes over .
the ultimate net cost may be far less than the credit sum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has moved away from a case-to-case bailout for struggling banks finance minister peer steinbrueck explained that when the final accounts were calculated after the rescue , the states would pay 35 percent of the cost , or possibly receive 35 percent of the profits if there were any .
state premiers said this was because the states , as proprietors of state banks , would have to sustain other losses in the crisis .
" it 's a good outcome , " said juergen ruettgers , premier of north rhine westphalia .
merkel called the deal " tenable . "
berlin to create new agency for bank rescue germany has not identified which of its banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-quality derivatives .
the cost burden on the states from the wider bail-out is to be limited to 7.7 billion euros , with the federal government to pay all higher bills , steinbrueck said .
government politicians said germany would create a special agency for the bank rescue after the country 's central bank said its independence would be compromised if it became an arm of government policy .
instead of being a department of the bundesbank , it would be a legally separate unit at the bundesbank office in frankfurt .
the bundesbank , which is one of the principal central banks underpinning the european central bank in frankfurt , had earlier told berlin it did not want to be seen taking instructions from the german federal government .
to speed passage of the bill on friday , votes are set to be held in the bundestag lower chamber and the bundesrat upper chamber on the same day .

" we do not have the right to miss this opportunity for reconstructing our system of finance in the 21st century , " french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , said in brussels on thursday , oct 16 . for the first time , eu leaders also addressed the fallout of the credit crunch on the real economy amid mounting fears of a deep recession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's car industry is already feeling the bite of the financial crisis " of course we see that the economic crisis is there , and the question i asked was : if we can bring coordinated answers to the financial crisis , can we not bring a coordinated answer to the economic crisis ? "
sarkozy said , pledging that france would take initiatives on the matter . " outside the financial sector , the european council -lrb- summit -rrb- underlines its determination to take the necessary steps to support growth and jobs , " the final summit statement said . " it calls on the the european commission to make appropriate proposals before the end of the year notably to preserve the competitiveness of european industry . " international emergency summit eu leaders are also leading calls for an international emergency summit , perhaps after us elections next month , to reshape the financial system while washington has shown less enthusiasm . sarkozy said he and european commission president jose manuel barroso would travel to meet us president george w. bush on saturday to help prepare for a summit that would decide on a " refoundation of capitalism . " despite the tough talk , global stock markets on thursday continued their freefall , pummelled by signs the world 's biggest economies were headed for recession after a month of financial sector turmoil . in a statement , the eu also called for the first time for a coordinated system of financial supervision at eu level and the creation of a crisis cell to help manage the financial turmoil . as a first step , german chancellor angela merkel told reporters , national central bank governors will meet at least once a month to exchange information on financial supervision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets have reacted warily to rescue plans by western governments the heads of the european central bank , the eu presidency , the executive european commission and the eurogroup of 15 countries that share the euro currency will all take part in the financial crisis management cell . a 2 trillion euro -lrb- 2.7 trillion dollar -rrb- rescue package , initially approved by eurozone leaders at a meeting in paris over the weekend , includes measures to safeguard private savers , guarantee interbank lending and partly nationalize shaky financial insitutions .
it follows a similar initiative approved in the united states , where the global credit crunch originated .
new bretton woods the agreement in brussels came after hours of discussions that saw member states such as the czech republic complain that it would allow for too much state intervention .
but the real surprise in brussels came not from the czechs but from brown .
despite his reputation as a eurosceptic , fellow eu leaders listened carefully to britain 's former chancellor of the exchequer as he outlined his plans for " a new bretton woods " that would avoid future financial breakdowns .
the 1944 bretton woods conference laid out the foundations of post-world war ii capitalism by establishing rules for the international monetary and financial order and by creating such bodies as the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
" global financial markets present challenges that no one nation can solve in isolation , " brown said in a letter distributed to eu heads of state and government in brussels .
" we must therefore strengthen global cooperation and build a new global financial architecture for the years ahead - a new bretton woods , which recognizes the globalization of financial risk in the responsibilities of global institutions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has called for a " new bretton woods " brown 's four-point plan envisages " a global early warning system " to prevent future financial crises from spreading , " globally accepted standards of supervision and regulation , " effective " cross-border supervision " of the world 's 30 largest multinationals and " cooperation and concerted action " during times of crisis .
his proposals were expected to be discussed by a forthcoming group of eight summit extended to include emerging powers such as china and india .
fighting climate change # b # eu leaders also agreed on thursday to reach a final deal on how to fight climate change in december after polish threats of a veto were won over , officials said .
" the objectives remain unchanged and the calendar remains the same .
it is now up to -lrb- european commission -rrb- president -lrb- jose manuel -rrb- barroso and myself to find solutions for those countries that have expressed their worries , " sarkozy said .
as the summit opened on wednesday , poland threatened to veto a declaration calling for a decision on the eu 's proposed climate-change laws in december , saying that its concerns over the economic impact of the proposed laws had not been taken into account .
seven other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe backed that call , accusing the european commission of not taking their earlier efforts on climate change into account .
and italy joined the revolt , arguing that it would be too expensive to implement the laws given the present financial crisis .
but on thursday morning , the french government proposed a new resolution sticking to the december deadline but promising to take into account the " specific situation " in each member state . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite his reputation as a eurosceptic , fellow eu leaders listened carefully to britain 's former chancellor of the exchequer as he outlined his plans for " a new bretton woods " that would avoid future financial breakdowns .
the 1944 bretton woods conference laid out the foundations of post-world war ii capitalism by establishing rules for the international monetary and financial order and by creating such bodies as the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
" global financial markets present challenges that no one nation can solve in isolation , " brown said in a letter distributed to eu heads of state and government in brussels .

" this was unfortunate and so the session ended early because the south ossetians and abkhaz walked out , " he added .
even before the session , there was tension over the participation of the abkhazians and the south ossetians , with russia insisting there could be no agreements without their presence .
the georgians had argued that the official talks should only include representatives of georgia , russia , the united states , the european union , the osce and the un .

he has been implicated in the vendetta that led to the august 2007 slayings of six members of his clan in duisburg , germany .
pelle , 46 , was found in a bunker in the country in southern calabria .
police said he fell to his knees when they arrived saying , " i surrender . "
suspected of heading the pelle-romeo family , one of two feuding clans in the village of san luca , pelle had been on the run since the duisburg killings .
the main suspect in the killings , giovanni strangio , 29 , of the nirta-strangio clan , remains at large .
trial of suspected mafiosi fifty-eight suspected mafiosi will go on trial this month and in november following a probe into the feud between the pelle-vottari and nirta-strangio clans , which has claimed nearly 20 lives since 1991 .
the feud became international news when six members of the pelle-romeo clan , aged 16 to 39 , were killed execution-style outside a pizza restaurant in duisburg in the early hours of august 15 , 2007 .
their bodies were dumped in two cars outside the restaurant .

in an interview with dw , the former us security advisor talks about how the west can avoid the mistakes of the russians . zbigniew brzezinski , the son of a diplomat , was born in warsaw on march 28 , 1928 .
in the 1950s , he was considered one of the leading western experts on the soviet union .
in 1960 , brzezinski advised john f. kennedy on eastern europe during his successful candidacy for the us presidency .
known for his hawkish foreign policy , brzezinski served as national security adviser to us president jimmy carter from 1977 to 1981 .
today , brzezinski is a scholar at the center for strategic and international studies in washington and advises us democratic presidential candidate barack obama . dw-world.de : while almost all political parties in germany want the troops to remain in afghanistan , a majority of the population would prefer a withdrawal .
what should the west do - withdraw , stay the course or increase the number of troops ? zbigniew brzezinski : i do n't think any of these options can be the answer .
withdrawal means that afghanistan will plunge immediately into a major crisis with unpredictable consequences .
simply putting more troops is not the solution to the problem .
staying the course is obviously unsatisfactory because right now there is mounting evidence that the situation is deteriorating . as jimmy carter 's security advisor in 1979 , you orchestrated the arming of the mujahedeen against afghanistan 's left-wing government , eventually drawing the soviet army into what you later referred to as the " afghan trap . "
has the west now fallen into that trap ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf force in afghanistan is battling a resurgent taliban the west should not repeat the mistakes that the soviets made .
the soviets invaded afghanistan on the illusion that a bunch of marxist afghan intellectuals could help them create a communist satellite using a foreign army to impose its will .
when the us reacted to the outrageous terrorist attacks of september 11 , which originated from afghanistan , it required only 300 american soldiers to overthrow the taliban .
the reason for that was that the afghans were genuinely grateful for the american support and the support of other countries . we are now running the risk of unintentionally duplicating what the soviets were doing : instead of capitalizing on that goodwill and leaving fairly soon thereafter while giving a lot of economic assistance to the afghans , we are trying to create a modern state - and a democratic version thereof - through a large foreign military presence .
i do not think that is a wise strategy . what you are suggesting seems to be exactly what the soviet union did : before it withdrew its troops , it tried to transfer the burden of fighting to the afghan forces - and failed .
why should nato succeed , given that it has much less afghan soldiers to rely on than the soviets had ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan population is not yet completely against help from foreign governments the soviets did that after devastating the afghan society and creating massive ill will .
one should not underestimate the enormous damage and incredible suffering that the soviets imposed in the afghan society by a ruthless military campaign , which drove millions of afghans out of the country and killed hundreds of thousands of them .
we have not done that yet .
but i think the risk is that the longer we rely on a military solution , the more likely it is that the resistance to us will become stronger and stronger .
i do n't think that it is in any way comparable to the resistance against the soviet occupation yet . how can the west avoid getting there ? we can not try to create a modern , centralized , democratic state in afghanistan from the top down using essentially foreign troops to impose such a solution .
this collides with the sense of ethnic identity and religious sensitivity in a country that is very resistant to foreign intrusions .
we need an altogether different approach .
some additional troops in the short run may be necessary , but the main emphasis has to be on decentralized political accommodation with the different elements which are collectively described as the taliban but in fact representing a much more diversified group . in their nearly completed national intelligence estimate , us intelligence agencies report a " breakdown in central authority " and " rampant corruption within the karzai government . "
the british ambassador to afghanistan is said to have called for an " acceptable dictator ... " how do you create a dictator out of nothing ?
the problem in afghanistan is that it is not possible to rule it from kabul effectively , and i do not see how we create a dictator in a deus ex machina fashion .
a dictator has to have either extensive social appeal or ruthless instruments of power - or preferably both .
i do n't see that in afghanistan unless it emerges by itself at some point . how should the west deal with the drug trade that provides the taliban with funds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracking down on the drug trade will not undercut the taliban , brzezinski said simply trying to wipe out the poppies and deprive the farmers of income will not undercut the taliban , it will strengthen them .
the europeans should pay the afghan farmers as much as it takes to abandon drug crops .
the europeans should do that because most of these drugs go to europe .
the drug problem in afghanistan is simultaneously a source of income for the taliban and a serious threat to europe .
in this respect , the european responsibility for dealing with it is self-evident . there have been repeated us attacks on pakistani territory .
do you think this could further destabilize the nuclear power pakistan ? us attacks on pakistani territory should be done only under very exceptional circumstances : when there is truly reliable intelligence that very senior operatives of al qaeda are potential targets and there is no indication that the pakistani authorities are going to do anything about it .
in those circumstances , such a reaction is justifiable since al qaeda attacked the united states .
but i think sporadic attacks against some taliban activities emanating from pakistan are likely to have the effect of simply widening the hostilities , and , in effect , transforming the problems we face in afghanistan into a problem that spans both afghanistan and pakistan thereby vastly complicating the challenge that we face - while at the same time probably further destabilizing pakistan . you support barack obama .
much like john mccain , he has called for a significant increase in us troops in afghanistan ... the call for some additional troops may be justified here or there .
but additional troops are not the solution in the long run .
i think obama has a much better understanding of the problems of the 21st century than mccain and the problems we face in afghanistan are not the only problems the 21st century is putting before us .
the american definition of its role in this world has to creatively adapt to the new global complexities .
i do n't see much evidence that mccain understands that need .
obama is much more qualified . interview : dennis stute -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the europeans should pay the afghan farmers as much as it takes to abandon drug crops .
the europeans should do that because most of these drugs go to europe .
the drug problem in afghanistan is simultaneously a source of income for the taliban and a serious threat to europe .
in this respect , the european responsibility for dealing with it is self-evident . there have been repeated us attacks on pakistani territory .
do you think this could further destabilize the nuclear power pakistan ? us attacks on pakistani territory should be done only under very exceptional circumstances : when there is truly reliable intelligence that very senior operatives of al qaeda are potential targets and there is no indication that the pakistani authorities are going to do anything about it .
in those circumstances , such a reaction is justifiable since al qaeda attacked the united states .
but i think sporadic attacks against some taliban activities emanating from pakistan are likely to have the effect of simply widening the hostilities , and , in effect , transforming the problems we face in afghanistan into a problem that spans both afghanistan and pakistan thereby vastly complicating the challenge that we face - while at the same time probably further destabilizing pakistan . you support barack obama .

in an interview with dw , the former us security advisor talks about how the west can avoid the mistakes of the russians . zbigniew brzezinski , the son of a diplomat , was born in warsaw on march 28 , 1928 .
in the 1950s , he was considered one of the leading western experts on the soviet union .
in 1960 , brzezinski advised john f. kennedy on eastern europe during his successful candidacy for the us presidency .
known for his hawkish foreign policy , brzezinski served as national security adviser to us president jimmy carter from 1977 to 1981 .
today , brzezinski is a scholar at the center for strategic and international studies in washington and advises us democratic presidential candidate barack obama . dw-world.de : while almost all political parties in germany want the troops to remain in afghanistan , a majority of the population would prefer a withdrawal .
what should the west do - withdraw , stay the course or increase the number of troops ? zbigniew brzezinski : i do n't think any of these options can be the answer .
withdrawal means that afghanistan will plunge immediately into a major crisis with unpredictable consequences .
simply putting more troops is not the solution to the problem .
staying the course is obviously unsatisfactory because right now there is mounting evidence that the situation is deteriorating . as jimmy carter 's security advisor in 1979 , you orchestrated the arming of the mujahedeen against afghanistan 's left-wing government , eventually drawing the soviet army into what you later referred to as the " afghan trap . "
has the west now fallen into that trap ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf force in afghanistan is battling a resurgent taliban the west should not repeat the mistakes that the soviets made .
the soviets invaded afghanistan on the illusion that a bunch of marxist afghan intellectuals could help them create a communist satellite using a foreign army to impose its will .
when the us reacted to the outrageous terrorist attacks of september 11 , which originated from afghanistan , it required only 300 american soldiers to overthrow the taliban .
the reason for that was that the afghans were genuinely grateful for the american support and the support of other countries . we are now running the risk of unintentionally duplicating what the soviets were doing : instead of capitalizing on that goodwill and leaving fairly soon thereafter while giving a lot of economic assistance to the afghans , we are trying to create a modern state - and a democratic version thereof - through a large foreign military presence .
i do not think that is a wise strategy . what you are suggesting seems to be exactly what the soviet union did : before it withdrew its troops , it tried to transfer the burden of fighting to the afghan forces - and failed .
why should nato succeed , given that it has much less afghan soldiers to rely on than the soviets had ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan population is not yet completely against help from foreign governments the soviets did that after devastating the afghan society and creating massive ill will .
one should not underestimate the enormous damage and incredible suffering that the soviets imposed in the afghan society by a ruthless military campaign , which drove millions of afghans out of the country and killed hundreds of thousands of them .
we have not done that yet .
but i think the risk is that the longer we rely on a military solution , the more likely it is that the resistance to us will become stronger and stronger .
i do n't think that it is in any way comparable to the resistance against the soviet occupation yet . how can the west avoid getting there ? we can not try to create a modern , centralized , democratic state in afghanistan from the top down using essentially foreign troops to impose such a solution .
this collides with the sense of ethnic identity and religious sensitivity in a country that is very resistant to foreign intrusions .
we need an altogether different approach .
some additional troops in the short run may be necessary , but the main emphasis has to be on decentralized political accommodation with the different elements which are collectively described as the taliban but in fact representing a much more diversified group . in their nearly completed national intelligence estimate , us intelligence agencies report a " breakdown in central authority " and " rampant corruption within the karzai government . "
the british ambassador to afghanistan is said to have called for an " acceptable dictator ... " how do you create a dictator out of nothing ?
the problem in afghanistan is that it is not possible to rule it from kabul effectively , and i do not see how we create a dictator in a deus ex machina fashion .
a dictator has to have either extensive social appeal or ruthless instruments of power - or preferably both .
i do n't see that in afghanistan unless it emerges by itself at some point . how should the west deal with the drug trade that provides the taliban with funds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracking down on the drug trade will not undercut the taliban , brzezinski said simply trying to wipe out the poppies and deprive the farmers of income will not undercut the taliban , it will strengthen them .

social groups will be out on the streets to protest the event . it 's tough being rich these days .
not only are the well-heeled seeing their assets plunge in value in the global financial crisis , now even small highlights on the social calendar , such as the " millionaire fair " in munich , are at risk of being spoiled by a noisy group of social activists .
among the protest actions planned for the opening day of the exclusive life style event is a symbolic slave market that aims to turn the spotlight on wage dumping in germany and around the world .
" our aim is not to pillory people , but to attack existing social conditions , " said walter listl from the city 's social forum . " riches are the cause of poverty . "
just a few meters away from the entrance to the venue on thursday , oct .
16 , demonstrators will be auctioning off cheap labor , singing anti-capitalist songs and staging sketches lampooning the bank bailout .
inside , visitors will be admiring private jets , high-end cars , lavish jewelry and haute couture .
this is the first time that the millionaire fair , first held in 2002 , has taken place in germany .
previous venues have included shanghai , moscow and amsterdam .
the affluent southern german city of munich in the country 's richest state , bavaria , is an obvious choice .
it also played host to the luxury fair earlier in the year .
playground for the rich and famous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refreshments at the fair include champagne and caviar fair organizers expect the event to attract some 20,000 people , including the rich and famous , top business people , luxury goods retailers , bon viveurs and just the plain curious .
at 39 euros -lrb- $ 52 -rrb- for an entrance ticket , you do n't need to be a millionaire to get in .
and who knows who you might rub shoulders with .
film stars like joan collins and elizabeth hurley and singer bryan ferry were among the guests at previous millionaire fairs .
for four days , some 100 firms will be setting out their stalls across 16,000 square meters of exhibition space .
according to the official web site , " the creme de la créme of luxury goods industry will be presenting their most beautiful one-off creations , the most exclusive products and unusual services to the event 's discerning visitors . "
or as one supplier 's press release puts it , the fair will offer " a cornucopia of all the most beautiful and luxurious things the world has to offer . "
" obscene display of perverse wealth " in walter listl 's eyes , it represents " an obscene display of perverse wealth . "
" according to un statistics , a child dies every five seconds of malnutrition or from easily treatable diseases , " listl added .
" they ’ re showcasing mobile phones studded with precious gems .
we can ’ t just sit back and ignore that . "
germany 's first millionaire fair is prompting munich 's social forum to break new ground .
the network of some 40 local groups - all with a decidedly anticapitalist bent , according to walter listl - has not targeted specific events like this before .
" it 's the first time that we have staged something a bit spectacular aimed at a particular event of this kind , " listl said .
" we are doing it for very topical and acute reasons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gap between rich and poor in germany is widening the timing of the millionaire fair and the global financial crisis as well as the growing gap between rich and poor in a country whose express goal has been " prosperity for all " has got the social activists out on the streets .
the motto of the demonstration : " your wealth makes us sick . "
" we 're not planning to approach or talk to the millionaires or the wannabe millionaires , " said listl .
" we want to bring public attention to the degree of poverty that exists in this country - and elsewhere . "
it remains to be seen how the two worlds will react to one another , or even to what extent they will even meet .
there will be a police cordon around the venue .

social groups will be out on the streets to protest the event . it 's tough being rich these days .
not only are the well-heeled seeing their assets plunge in value in the global financial crisis , now even small highlights on the social calendar , such as the " millionaire fair " in munich , are at risk of being spoiled by a noisy group of social activists .
among the protest actions planned for the opening day of the exclusive life style event is a symbolic slave market that aims to turn the spotlight on wage dumping in germany and around the world .
" our aim is not to pillory people , but to attack existing social conditions , " said walter listl from the city 's social forum . " riches are the cause of poverty . "
just a few meters away from the entrance to the venue on thursday , oct .
16 , demonstrators will be auctioning off cheap labor , singing anti-capitalist songs and staging sketches lampooning the bank bailout .
inside , visitors will be admiring private jets , high-end cars , lavish jewelry and haute couture .
this is the first time that the millionaire fair , first held in 2002 , has taken place in germany .
previous venues have included shanghai , moscow and amsterdam .
the affluent southern german city of munich in the country 's richest state , bavaria , is an obvious choice .
it also played host to the luxury fair earlier in the year .
playground for the rich and famous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refreshments at the fair include champagne and caviar fair organizers expect the event to attract some 20,000 people , including the rich and famous , top business people , luxury goods retailers , bon viveurs and just the plain curious .
at 39 euros -lrb- $ 52 -rrb- for an entrance ticket , you do n't need to be a millionaire to get in .
and who knows who you might rub shoulders with .
film stars like joan collins and elizabeth hurley and singer bryan ferry were among the guests at previous millionaire fairs .
for four days , some 100 firms will be setting out their stalls across 16,000 square meters of exhibition space .
according to the official web site , " the creme de la créme of luxury goods industry will be presenting their most beautiful one-off creations , the most exclusive products and unusual services to the event 's discerning visitors . "
or as one supplier 's press release puts it , the fair will offer " a cornucopia of all the most beautiful and luxurious things the world has to offer . "
" obscene display of perverse wealth " in walter listl 's eyes , it represents " an obscene display of perverse wealth . "
" according to un statistics , a child dies every five seconds of malnutrition or from easily treatable diseases , " listl added .
" they ’ re showcasing mobile phones studded with precious gems .
we can ’ t just sit back and ignore that . "
germany 's first millionaire fair is prompting munich 's social forum to break new ground .
the network of some 40 local groups - all with a decidedly anticapitalist bent , according to walter listl - has not targeted specific events like this before .
" it 's the first time that we have staged something a bit spectacular aimed at a particular event of this kind , " listl said .
" we are doing it for very topical and acute reasons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gap between rich and poor in germany is widening the timing of the millionaire fair and the global financial crisis as well as the growing gap between rich and poor in a country whose express goal has been " prosperity for all " has got the social activists out on the streets .
the motto of the demonstration : " your wealth makes us sick . "
" we 're not planning to approach or talk to the millionaires or the wannabe millionaires , " said listl .
" we want to bring public attention to the degree of poverty that exists in this country - and elsewhere . "
it remains to be seen how the two worlds will react to one another , or even to what extent they will even meet .
there will be a police cordon around the venue .

a german financial newspaper reports that authorities knew about trouble at a hard-hit major bank , hypo real estate , much earlier than they first acknowledged . german authorities were aware of troubles at property financier hypo real estate much earlier than finance minister peer steinbrueck has said , the business daily handelsblatt reported on thursday , oct .

according to german industry groups , berlin ca n't afford not to toss a little cash their way . the president of the german national industrial federation bdi , juergen thumann , has demanded more government investments to help alleviate the problems caused by the financial crisis . “ the federal government should in no way reduce the amount of their investments , in fact they should increase them , ” thumann was quoted as saying in the german daily der tagesspiegel . thumann said infrastructure projects should be renewed , especially in conjunction with private companies . “ i ’ m thinking of building roads , airports and power plants .
there are more than enough projects , ” he added . the bdi chief also encouraged the government to continue trying to balance the budget , even if it isn ’ t possible to do it in the next few years .
originally berlin had set a goal of 2011 , but in the face of the international financial crisis and the billions of euros being pumped into rescue packages , that now seems like a long shot . experts call for stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straubhaar is in favor of a stimulus package meanwhile the head of the hamburg world economics institute -lrb- hwwi -rrb- , thomas straubhaar , said that the government should give the people money to help stimulate the economy . “ every taxpayer should get a check from the government before the end of this year , ” he was quoted as saying in the german daily hamburger abendblatt . straubhaar suggested that each tax paying adult receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 134 -rrb- in november and 100 euros in december . “ everyone should get the same amount .
that 's because it isn ’ t just doing something for the people , but for the economy as well , ” he added . in spite of increasingly gloomy forecasts for the european economy , leaders have no plans for launching a concerted eu stimulus plan to boost activity , said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker . " who would pay for it and with what money ? " said juncker , who also chairs the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers .
" i do n't see how we could finance such a big stimulus plan . " germany on the brink of recession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts have said germany is headed for a recession this comes on the heels of an announcement by the german government that the country is on the verge of a recession , due to the financial crisis and the struggling world economy .
the ongoing economic downturn led the government to lower the 2009 growth forecast in europe 's biggest economy from 1.2 percent down to 0.2 percent .
but economy minister michael glos said in berlin that there is no need to panic .
for the current year , the minister is still expecting gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.7 percent .
though that number is also down from 2.5 percent .
" we are just seeing some slowdown in the economy , " glos said .
" there is nothing to sugarcoat or cover up . "
too early to foresee crisis ' outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said germany should reform its tax system glos insisted that his latest forecasts entailed a " high degree of uncertainty " as it was still too early to predict exactly how the current financial crisis would affect the real economy .
glos went on to say that the financial firestorm that swept through markets in recent weeks underscored the need for germany to overhaul its tax system .
" beyond what we 've already agreed , there is an urgent need for tax relief , " said glos .
according to government forecasts , the economic slowdown will also leave its mark on the german labor market , where unemployment has been shrinking for more than two years .

according to german industry groups , berlin ca n't afford not to toss a little cash their way . the president of the german national industrial federation bdi , juergen thumann , has demanded more government investments to help alleviate the problems caused by the financial crisis . “ the federal government should in no way reduce the amount of their investments , in fact they should increase them , ” thumann was quoted as saying in the german daily der tagesspiegel . thumann said infrastructure projects should be renewed , especially in conjunction with private companies . “ i ’ m thinking of building roads , airports and power plants .
there are more than enough projects , ” he added . the bdi chief also encouraged the government to continue trying to balance the budget , even if it isn ’ t possible to do it in the next few years .
originally berlin had set a goal of 2011 , but in the face of the international financial crisis and the billions of euros being pumped into rescue packages , that now seems like a long shot . experts call for stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straubhaar is in favor of a stimulus package meanwhile the head of the hamburg world economics institute -lrb- hwwi -rrb- , thomas straubhaar , said that the government should give the people money to help stimulate the economy . “ every taxpayer should get a check from the government before the end of this year , ” he was quoted as saying in the german daily hamburger abendblatt . straubhaar suggested that each tax paying adult receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 134 -rrb- in november and 100 euros in december . “ everyone should get the same amount .
that 's because it isn ’ t just doing something for the people , but for the economy as well , ” he added . in spite of increasingly gloomy forecasts for the european economy , leaders have no plans for launching a concerted eu stimulus plan to boost activity , said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker . " who would pay for it and with what money ? " said juncker , who also chairs the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers .
" i do n't see how we could finance such a big stimulus plan . " germany on the brink of recession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts have said germany is headed for a recession this comes on the heels of an announcement by the german government that the country is on the verge of a recession , due to the financial crisis and the struggling world economy .
the ongoing economic downturn led the government to lower the 2009 growth forecast in europe 's biggest economy from 1.2 percent down to 0.2 percent .
but economy minister michael glos said in berlin that there is no need to panic .
for the current year , the minister is still expecting gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.7 percent .
though that number is also down from 2.5 percent .
" we are just seeing some slowdown in the economy , " glos said .
" there is nothing to sugarcoat or cover up . "
too early to foresee crisis ' outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said germany should reform its tax system glos insisted that his latest forecasts entailed a " high degree of uncertainty " as it was still too early to predict exactly how the current financial crisis would affect the real economy .
glos went on to say that the financial firestorm that swept through markets in recent weeks underscored the need for germany to overhaul its tax system .
" beyond what we 've already agreed , there is an urgent need for tax relief , " said glos .
according to government forecasts , the economic slowdown will also leave its mark on the german labor market , where unemployment has been shrinking for more than two years .

16 . the financial sector watchdog bafin launched a special investigation into hre and its irish subsidiary depfa back in february , the newspaper said . bafin chief jochen sanio had acknowledged as much during a hearing by the german parliament 's budgetary and financial committee , handelsblatt reported . denials from finance ministry until now , steinbrueck has maintained that no such investigation was possible because bafin has no jurisdiction in ireland . but , according to the sources quoted by handelsblatt , bafin submitted a request to the irish authorities in february and commissioned the german central bank , the bundesbank , to carry out the investigation . sanio said bafin presented the findings of the probe to hre 's management in july and had informed the finance ministry of the results on aug .
7 . rescue for hre the german government was forced to come to the rescue of hre , the country 's fourth-biggest bank , at the end of september , initially with a 27 billion euro -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- bailout . but that sum then had to be increased to 50 billion euros as it emerged that the bank 's woes were even more serious than previously thought . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier this month , lerch admitted he advised the libyans on how to build a piping system for a uranium-enrichment plant .
prosecutor wolfgang siegmund said earlier thursday the defendant helped libyan interests , but had not been a member of an international network of nuclear smugglers led by the rogue pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan .
us and german intelligence agents uncovered the plans to export the piping system , earlier media reports said .
libya has since abandoned its nuclear ambitions .
the defendant was convicted of breaching german laws restricting exports of militarily useful products .
defendant endangered international peace a previous trial which began in july 2006 had to be called off after the bomb plans - regarded as evidence by the defense team - were shredded by swiss authorities .
under an agreement with the defense to settle with a compromise , prosecutor siegmund dropped an allegation that the defendant was the builder and supplier of a gas ultra centrifuge system to refine uranium for libya 's bomb .
siegmund , who pressed for a six-year prison term , said thursday that libya in fact came nowhere close to making its own bomb , but the defendant 's actions had endangered international peace .

eu leaders called for the restructuring of international finance systems . european union leaders were due to wrap up a two-day summit on thursday , oct .
16 , while facing the worst financial crisis since the great depression .
many analysts consider a us recession unavoidable . in early trading on thursday main european stock markets were down sharply , with london and frankfurt opening five percent lower . after their first day of meetings in brussels , eu heads of state and government called for a common european response to the global credit crunch . " after a few false starts , europe has shown that it is capable of acting , " austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said wednesday . british prime minister gordon brown joined french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel in calling for better regulation of global financial markets . " we urgently need what you might call the ' new bretton woods , ' so that we can restore confidence in the system while dealing with the areas that have been exposed in recent weeks , " brown said before the summit began , referring to the international financial system set up in 1944 that created the world bank and international monetary fund . centralized supervision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and brown agreed on the need for major market reforms brown 's proposals included placing the world 's top companies , including " some of the biggest financial institutions , " under international supervision , and the creation of " an early warning system " designed to prevent future financial crises from spreading . " instead of having national supervisors , we need a global way of supervising our financial system , " brown said in his appeal for a global summit to discuss market reforms as well as improved transparency and international coordination . sarkozy was the first european leader to call for a major restructuring of the existing financial system 's rules and the relationships among the world 's major industrial states . " the system must be completely overhauled , an overhaul that must be global , " sarkozy said . comprehensive , coordinated reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets tumbled wednesday amid growing fears of a global recession at their summit , eu leaders were set to rubber-stamp a 2-trillion-euro -lrb- $ 2.7 trillion -rrb- financial rescue plan inspired by britain and approved by eurozone leaders on sunday .
the plan includes measures to guarantee interbank lending and to nationalize parts of the shaky financial institutions by providing them with liquidity in exchange for shares . " the european council reaffirms its determination to act in a comprehensive and coordinated manner to restore the good functioning of the financial system , " leaders were set to announce , according to a draft statement seen by the german dpa news agency . in order to make european leaders also called for a meeting of the group of eight highly industrialized nations to be held before the end of the year to revamp international finance structures . g8 members to convene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said g8 leaders should meet before the end of the year the g8 members , the united states , japan , canada , russia , great britain , france , germany and italy , said they were united in their pledge to strengthen financial instutitions and restore investors ' confidence in markets . " while our focus now is on the immediate task of stabilizing markets and restoring confidence , changes to the regulatory and institutional regimes for the world 's financial sectors are needed to remedy deficiencies exposed by the current crisis , " the group said in a statement released wednesday in washington . the group of wealthy nations also said they would hold a leaders meeting with key countries " at an appropriate time in the near future to adopt an agenda for reforms . " a solid backer of the idea , merkel said the g8 's meeting should be held before the end of 2008 and include heads of state from emerging nations . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

96 parliamentarians voted against and 32 abstained .
under a previous parliamentary mandate , germany was allowed to send up to 3,500 troops to afghanistan .
the vote on thursday increases that number to 4,500 .
the mandate is valid for 14 months .
troop morale at a low the vote comes at a time when morale among german troops in afghanistan is low as they face increased attacks from a resurgent taliban .
five years ago , when the german army began its mission in northern afghanistan , the region was regarded as one of the country 's safest .
now , the solders run the daily risk of " being caught in an explosive or being shot at , " one officer said .
during the last year , the security situation has deteriorated not only in the north , but all across afghanistan .
the afghan presidential election , likely to shape the country 's future for years to come , is scheduled around autumn 2009 , making a further escalation of violence in the coming year more than likely .
as voter registration started last week , taliban spokesman kari jussif ahmadi warned the population against registering , saying it was a " waste of time , " as the militants were set to prevent the election from happening .
" more than half of the country is in our hands , and we will not let it happen , " he said .
added danger posed by upcoming election while the taliban are unlikely to prevent the polls - they failed to do so in 2004 despite grand announcements to the contrary - they are believed to be strong enough to severely disrupt the run-up to the election .
the international community has made it clear that securing the election will be one of the most important tasks in 2009 .
the german troops within the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- will also play a role in the training of afghan security forces , a process that must be speeded up after being promoted too timidly for a long time .
there is no doubt that this will be dangerous .
even today , the duty of the 4,500 german soldiers is a far cry from the beginning of the mission , when isaf troops really were peacekeepers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers ' deaths have changed the way troops view their mission soldiers at the german camp in the northern province of kunduz nicknamed the full moon " rocket weather , " because of the many attacks raining down on them by moonlight .
in september , a german soldier was killed in an attack .
" you have an odd feeling when you leave the camp on a mission , " said an officer , who did not want to give his name .
" it sensitizes you , but also creates a distance to the population .
just being present , just walking down to the bazaar , like we did two , three years ago , that 's not possible anymore . "
little support on the home front other soldiers believe that the german population does not appreciate their work , which only makes headline news when attacks occur .
" the soldiers want more interest in germany , and that there is not just focus -lrb- on them -rrb- when something happens , " the german bundeswehr in afghanistan said in a statement .
" more appreciation of the efforts here would be welcome , after all soldiers here can die for germany , " the army said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" instead of having national supervisors , we need a global way of supervising our financial system , " brown said in his appeal for a global summit to discuss market reforms as well as improved transparency and international coordination . sarkozy was the first european leader to call for a major restructuring of the existing financial system 's rules and the relationships among the world 's major industrial states .

earlier this month , lerch admitted he advised the libyans on how to build a piping system for a uranium-enrichment plant .
prosecutor wolfgang siegmund said earlier thursday the defendant helped libyan interests , but had not been a member of an international network of nuclear smugglers led by the rogue pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan .

libya has since abandoned its nuclear ambitions .
the defendant was convicted of breaching german laws restricting exports of militarily useful products .
defendant endangered international peace a previous trial which began in july 2006 had to be called off after the bomb plans - regarded as evidence by the defense team - were shredded by swiss authorities .
under an agreement with the defense to settle with a compromise , prosecutor siegmund dropped an allegation that the defendant was the builder and supplier of a gas ultra centrifuge system to refine uranium for libya 's bomb .
siegmund , who pressed for a six-year prison term , said thursday that libya in fact came nowhere close to making its own bomb , but the defendant 's actions had endangered international peace .

speaking after meeting state premiers in berlin , the chancellor said the two sides had held " constructive talks " keeping in mind " the common responsiblity for our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has called the deal " tenable " and expects the rescue package to win parliamentary approval merkel said the two sides had agreed to share the burden of the rescue package , adding she was optimistic the legislative package would win approval in the german houses of parliament on friday .
german rescue package the biggest most of the eurozone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds .
germany 's rescue deal is the biggest , comprising 400 billion euros in guarantees , a 70-billion-euro fund and 10 billion euros of leeway .
berlin says it will need a credit of 100 billion euros to operate the bank-support scheme , but the trading fund will earn interest and dividend income from banks it takes over .
the ultimate net cost may be far less than the credit sum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has moved away from a case-to-case bailout for struggling banks finance minister peer steinbrueck explained that when the final accounts were calculated after the rescue , the states would pay 35 percent of the cost , or possibly receive 35 percent of the profits if there were any .
state premiers said this was because the states , as proprietors of state banks , would have to sustain other losses in the crisis .
" it 's a good outcome , " said juergen ruettgers , premier of north rhine westphalia .
merkel called the deal " tenable . "
berlin to create new agency for bank rescue germany has not identified which of its banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-quality derivatives .
the cost burden on the states from the wider bail-out is to be limited to 7.7 billion euros , with the federal government to pay all higher bills , steinbrueck said .
government politicians said germany would create a special agency for the bank rescue after the country 's central bank said its independence would be compromised if it became an arm of government policy .
instead of being a department of the bundesbank , it would be a legally separate unit at the bundesbank office in frankfurt .
the bundesbank , which is one of the principal central banks underpinning the european central bank in frankfurt , had earlier told berlin it did not want to be seen taking instructions from the german federal government .

speaking after meeting state premiers in berlin , the chancellor said the two sides had held " constructive talks " keeping in mind " the common responsiblity for our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has called the deal " tenable " and expects the rescue package to win parliamentary approval merkel said the two sides had agreed to share the burden of the rescue package , adding she was optimistic the legislative package would win approval in the german houses of parliament on friday .
german rescue package the biggest most of the eurozone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds .
germany 's rescue deal is the biggest , comprising 400 billion euros in guarantees , a 70-billion-euro fund and 10 billion euros of leeway .
berlin says it will need a credit of 100 billion euros to operate the bank-support scheme , but the trading fund will earn interest and dividend income from banks it takes over .
the ultimate net cost may be far less than the credit sum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has moved away from a case-to-case bailout for struggling banks finance minister peer steinbrueck explained that when the final accounts were calculated after the rescue , the states would pay 35 percent of the cost , or possibly receive 35 percent of the profits if there were any .
state premiers said this was because the states , as proprietors of state banks , would have to sustain other losses in the crisis .
" it 's a good outcome , " said juergen ruettgers , premier of north rhine westphalia .
merkel called the deal " tenable . "
berlin to create new agency for bank rescue germany has not identified which of its banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-quality derivatives .
the cost burden on the states from the wider bail-out is to be limited to 7.7 billion euros , with the federal government to pay all higher bills , steinbrueck said .
government politicians said germany would create a special agency for the bank rescue after the country 's central bank said its independence would be compromised if it became an arm of government policy .
instead of being a department of the bundesbank , it would be a legally separate unit at the bundesbank office in frankfurt .
the bundesbank , which is one of the principal central banks underpinning the european central bank in frankfurt , had earlier told berlin it did not want to be seen taking instructions from the german federal government .
to speed passage of the bill on friday , votes are set to be held in the bundestag lower chamber and the bundesrat upper chamber on the same day .
in an unusual move , the bill is to be emailed back to the german government a few hundred metres away for the final formalities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 16.10.2008 brzezinski : west must avoid russia 's mistakes in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brzezinski warned against trying to create a democracy in afghanistan from the top down zbigniew brzezinski was instrumental in arming the afghan mujahedeen against the soviet union .
in an interview with dw , the former us security advisor talks about how the west can avoid the mistakes of the russians . zbigniew brzezinski , the son of a diplomat , was born in warsaw on march 28 , 1928 .
in the 1950s , he was considered one of the leading western experts on the soviet union .
in 1960 , brzezinski advised john f. kennedy on eastern europe during his successful candidacy for the us presidency .
known for his hawkish foreign policy , brzezinski served as national security adviser to us president jimmy carter from 1977 to 1981 .
today , brzezinski is a scholar at the center for strategic and international studies in washington and advises us democratic presidential candidate barack obama . dw-world.de : while almost all political parties in germany want the troops to remain in afghanistan , a majority of the population would prefer a withdrawal .
what should the west do - withdraw , stay the course or increase the number of troops ? zbigniew brzezinski : i do n't think any of these options can be the answer .
withdrawal means that afghanistan will plunge immediately into a major crisis with unpredictable consequences .
simply putting more troops is not the solution to the problem .
staying the course is obviously unsatisfactory because right now there is mounting evidence that the situation is deteriorating . as jimmy carter 's security advisor in 1979 , you orchestrated the arming of the mujahedeen against afghanistan 's left-wing government , eventually drawing the soviet army into what you later referred to as the " afghan trap . "
has the west now fallen into that trap ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf force in afghanistan is battling a resurgent taliban the west should not repeat the mistakes that the soviets made .
the soviets invaded afghanistan on the illusion that a bunch of marxist afghan intellectuals could help them create a communist satellite using a foreign army to impose its will .
when the us reacted to the outrageous terrorist attacks of september 11 , which originated from afghanistan , it required only 300 american soldiers to overthrow the taliban .
the reason for that was that the afghans were genuinely grateful for the american support and the support of other countries . we are now running the risk of unintentionally duplicating what the soviets were doing : instead of capitalizing on that goodwill and leaving fairly soon thereafter while giving a lot of economic assistance to the afghans , we are trying to create a modern state - and a democratic version thereof - through a large foreign military presence .
i do not think that is a wise strategy . what you are suggesting seems to be exactly what the soviet union did : before it withdrew its troops , it tried to transfer the burden of fighting to the afghan forces - and failed .
why should nato succeed , given that it has much less afghan soldiers to rely on than the soviets had ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan population is not yet completely against help from foreign governments the soviets did that after devastating the afghan society and creating massive ill will .
one should not underestimate the enormous damage and incredible suffering that the soviets imposed in the afghan society by a ruthless military campaign , which drove millions of afghans out of the country and killed hundreds of thousands of them .
we have not done that yet .
but i think the risk is that the longer we rely on a military solution , the more likely it is that the resistance to us will become stronger and stronger .
i do n't think that it is in any way comparable to the resistance against the soviet occupation yet . how can the west avoid getting there ? we can not try to create a modern , centralized , democratic state in afghanistan from the top down using essentially foreign troops to impose such a solution .
this collides with the sense of ethnic identity and religious sensitivity in a country that is very resistant to foreign intrusions .
we need an altogether different approach .
some additional troops in the short run may be necessary , but the main emphasis has to be on decentralized political accommodation with the different elements which are collectively described as the taliban but in fact representing a much more diversified group . in their nearly completed national intelligence estimate , us intelligence agencies report a " breakdown in central authority " and " rampant corruption within the karzai government . "
the british ambassador to afghanistan is said to have called for an " acceptable dictator ... " how do you create a dictator out of nothing ?
the problem in afghanistan is that it is not possible to rule it from kabul effectively , and i do not see how we create a dictator in a deus ex machina fashion .
a dictator has to have either extensive social appeal or ruthless instruments of power - or preferably both .
i do n't see that in afghanistan unless it emerges by itself at some point . how should the west deal with the drug trade that provides the taliban with funds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracking down on the drug trade will not undercut the taliban , brzezinski said simply trying to wipe out the poppies and deprive the farmers of income will not undercut the taliban , it will strengthen them .
the europeans should pay the afghan farmers as much as it takes to abandon drug crops .
the europeans should do that because most of these drugs go to europe .
the drug problem in afghanistan is simultaneously a source of income for the taliban and a serious threat to europe .
in this respect , the european responsibility for dealing with it is self-evident . there have been repeated us attacks on pakistani territory .
do you think this could further destabilize the nuclear power pakistan ? us attacks on pakistani territory should be done only under very exceptional circumstances : when there is truly reliable intelligence that very senior operatives of al qaeda are potential targets and there is no indication that the pakistani authorities are going to do anything about it .
in those circumstances , such a reaction is justifiable since al qaeda attacked the united states .
but i think sporadic attacks against some taliban activities emanating from pakistan are likely to have the effect of simply widening the hostilities , and , in effect , transforming the problems we face in afghanistan into a problem that spans both afghanistan and pakistan thereby vastly complicating the challenge that we face - while at the same time probably further destabilizing pakistan . you support barack obama .
much like john mccain , he has called for a significant increase in us troops in afghanistan ... the call for some additional troops may be justified here or there .
but additional troops are not the solution in the long run .
i think obama has a much better understanding of the problems of the 21st century than mccain and the problems we face in afghanistan are not the only problems the 21st century is putting before us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 16.10.2008 brzezinski : west must avoid russia 's mistakes in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brzezinski warned against trying to create a democracy in afghanistan from the top down zbigniew brzezinski was instrumental in arming the afghan mujahedeen against the soviet union .
in an interview with dw , the former us security advisor talks about how the west can avoid the mistakes of the russians . zbigniew brzezinski , the son of a diplomat , was born in warsaw on march 28 , 1928 .
in the 1950s , he was considered one of the leading western experts on the soviet union .
in 1960 , brzezinski advised john f. kennedy on eastern europe during his successful candidacy for the us presidency .
known for his hawkish foreign policy , brzezinski served as national security adviser to us president jimmy carter from 1977 to 1981 .
today , brzezinski is a scholar at the center for strategic and international studies in washington and advises us democratic presidential candidate barack obama . dw-world.de : while almost all political parties in germany want the troops to remain in afghanistan , a majority of the population would prefer a withdrawal .
what should the west do - withdraw , stay the course or increase the number of troops ? zbigniew brzezinski : i do n't think any of these options can be the answer .
withdrawal means that afghanistan will plunge immediately into a major crisis with unpredictable consequences .
simply putting more troops is not the solution to the problem .
staying the course is obviously unsatisfactory because right now there is mounting evidence that the situation is deteriorating . as jimmy carter 's security advisor in 1979 , you orchestrated the arming of the mujahedeen against afghanistan 's left-wing government , eventually drawing the soviet army into what you later referred to as the " afghan trap . "
has the west now fallen into that trap ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf force in afghanistan is battling a resurgent taliban the west should not repeat the mistakes that the soviets made .
the soviets invaded afghanistan on the illusion that a bunch of marxist afghan intellectuals could help them create a communist satellite using a foreign army to impose its will .
when the us reacted to the outrageous terrorist attacks of september 11 , which originated from afghanistan , it required only 300 american soldiers to overthrow the taliban .
the reason for that was that the afghans were genuinely grateful for the american support and the support of other countries . we are now running the risk of unintentionally duplicating what the soviets were doing : instead of capitalizing on that goodwill and leaving fairly soon thereafter while giving a lot of economic assistance to the afghans , we are trying to create a modern state - and a democratic version thereof - through a large foreign military presence .
i do not think that is a wise strategy . what you are suggesting seems to be exactly what the soviet union did : before it withdrew its troops , it tried to transfer the burden of fighting to the afghan forces - and failed .
why should nato succeed , given that it has much less afghan soldiers to rely on than the soviets had ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan population is not yet completely against help from foreign governments the soviets did that after devastating the afghan society and creating massive ill will .
one should not underestimate the enormous damage and incredible suffering that the soviets imposed in the afghan society by a ruthless military campaign , which drove millions of afghans out of the country and killed hundreds of thousands of them .
we have not done that yet .
but i think the risk is that the longer we rely on a military solution , the more likely it is that the resistance to us will become stronger and stronger .
i do n't think that it is in any way comparable to the resistance against the soviet occupation yet . how can the west avoid getting there ? we can not try to create a modern , centralized , democratic state in afghanistan from the top down using essentially foreign troops to impose such a solution .
this collides with the sense of ethnic identity and religious sensitivity in a country that is very resistant to foreign intrusions .
we need an altogether different approach .
some additional troops in the short run may be necessary , but the main emphasis has to be on decentralized political accommodation with the different elements which are collectively described as the taliban but in fact representing a much more diversified group . in their nearly completed national intelligence estimate , us intelligence agencies report a " breakdown in central authority " and " rampant corruption within the karzai government . "
the british ambassador to afghanistan is said to have called for an " acceptable dictator ... " how do you create a dictator out of nothing ?
the problem in afghanistan is that it is not possible to rule it from kabul effectively , and i do not see how we create a dictator in a deus ex machina fashion .
a dictator has to have either extensive social appeal or ruthless instruments of power - or preferably both .
i do n't see that in afghanistan unless it emerges by itself at some point . how should the west deal with the drug trade that provides the taliban with funds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracking down on the drug trade will not undercut the taliban , brzezinski said simply trying to wipe out the poppies and deprive the farmers of income will not undercut the taliban , it will strengthen them .
the europeans should pay the afghan farmers as much as it takes to abandon drug crops .
the europeans should do that because most of these drugs go to europe .
the drug problem in afghanistan is simultaneously a source of income for the taliban and a serious threat to europe .
in this respect , the european responsibility for dealing with it is self-evident . there have been repeated us attacks on pakistani territory .
do you think this could further destabilize the nuclear power pakistan ? us attacks on pakistani territory should be done only under very exceptional circumstances : when there is truly reliable intelligence that very senior operatives of al qaeda are potential targets and there is no indication that the pakistani authorities are going to do anything about it .
in those circumstances , such a reaction is justifiable since al qaeda attacked the united states .
but i think sporadic attacks against some taliban activities emanating from pakistan are likely to have the effect of simply widening the hostilities , and , in effect , transforming the problems we face in afghanistan into a problem that spans both afghanistan and pakistan thereby vastly complicating the challenge that we face - while at the same time probably further destabilizing pakistan . you support barack obama .
much like john mccain , he has called for a significant increase in us troops in afghanistan ... the call for some additional troops may be justified here or there .
but additional troops are not the solution in the long run .
i think obama has a much better understanding of the problems of the 21st century than mccain and the problems we face in afghanistan are not the only problems the 21st century is putting before us .
the american definition of its role in this world has to creatively adapt to the new global complexities .

in an interview with dw , the former us security advisor talks about how the west can avoid the mistakes of the russians . zbigniew brzezinski , the son of a diplomat , was born in warsaw on march 28 , 1928 .
in the 1950s , he was considered one of the leading western experts on the soviet union .
in 1960 , brzezinski advised john f. kennedy on eastern europe during his successful candidacy for the us presidency .
known for his hawkish foreign policy , brzezinski served as national security adviser to us president jimmy carter from 1977 to 1981 .
today , brzezinski is a scholar at the center for strategic and international studies in washington and advises us democratic presidential candidate barack obama . dw-world.de : while almost all political parties in germany want the troops to remain in afghanistan , a majority of the population would prefer a withdrawal .
what should the west do - withdraw , stay the course or increase the number of troops ? zbigniew brzezinski : i do n't think any of these options can be the answer .
withdrawal means that afghanistan will plunge immediately into a major crisis with unpredictable consequences .
simply putting more troops is not the solution to the problem .
staying the course is obviously unsatisfactory because right now there is mounting evidence that the situation is deteriorating . as jimmy carter 's security advisor in 1979 , you orchestrated the arming of the mujahedeen against afghanistan 's left-wing government , eventually drawing the soviet army into what you later referred to as the " afghan trap . "
has the west now fallen into that trap ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf force in afghanistan is battling a resurgent taliban the west should not repeat the mistakes that the soviets made .
the soviets invaded afghanistan on the illusion that a bunch of marxist afghan intellectuals could help them create a communist satellite using a foreign army to impose its will .
when the us reacted to the outrageous terrorist attacks of september 11 , which originated from afghanistan , it required only 300 american soldiers to overthrow the taliban .
the reason for that was that the afghans were genuinely grateful for the american support and the support of other countries . we are now running the risk of unintentionally duplicating what the soviets were doing : instead of capitalizing on that goodwill and leaving fairly soon thereafter while giving a lot of economic assistance to the afghans , we are trying to create a modern state - and a democratic version thereof - through a large foreign military presence .
i do not think that is a wise strategy . what you are suggesting seems to be exactly what the soviet union did : before it withdrew its troops , it tried to transfer the burden of fighting to the afghan forces - and failed .
why should nato succeed , given that it has much less afghan soldiers to rely on than the soviets had ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan population is not yet completely against help from foreign governments the soviets did that after devastating the afghan society and creating massive ill will .
one should not underestimate the enormous damage and incredible suffering that the soviets imposed in the afghan society by a ruthless military campaign , which drove millions of afghans out of the country and killed hundreds of thousands of them .
we have not done that yet .
but i think the risk is that the longer we rely on a military solution , the more likely it is that the resistance to us will become stronger and stronger .
i do n't think that it is in any way comparable to the resistance against the soviet occupation yet . how can the west avoid getting there ? we can not try to create a modern , centralized , democratic state in afghanistan from the top down using essentially foreign troops to impose such a solution .
this collides with the sense of ethnic identity and religious sensitivity in a country that is very resistant to foreign intrusions .
we need an altogether different approach .
some additional troops in the short run may be necessary , but the main emphasis has to be on decentralized political accommodation with the different elements which are collectively described as the taliban but in fact representing a much more diversified group . in their nearly completed national intelligence estimate , us intelligence agencies report a " breakdown in central authority " and " rampant corruption within the karzai government . "
the british ambassador to afghanistan is said to have called for an " acceptable dictator ... " how do you create a dictator out of nothing ?
the problem in afghanistan is that it is not possible to rule it from kabul effectively , and i do not see how we create a dictator in a deus ex machina fashion .
a dictator has to have either extensive social appeal or ruthless instruments of power - or preferably both .
i do n't see that in afghanistan unless it emerges by itself at some point . how should the west deal with the drug trade that provides the taliban with funds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracking down on the drug trade will not undercut the taliban , brzezinski said simply trying to wipe out the poppies and deprive the farmers of income will not undercut the taliban , it will strengthen them .
the europeans should pay the afghan farmers as much as it takes to abandon drug crops .
the europeans should do that because most of these drugs go to europe .
the drug problem in afghanistan is simultaneously a source of income for the taliban and a serious threat to europe .
in this respect , the european responsibility for dealing with it is self-evident . there have been repeated us attacks on pakistani territory .
do you think this could further destabilize the nuclear power pakistan ? us attacks on pakistani territory should be done only under very exceptional circumstances : when there is truly reliable intelligence that very senior operatives of al qaeda are potential targets and there is no indication that the pakistani authorities are going to do anything about it .
in those circumstances , such a reaction is justifiable since al qaeda attacked the united states .
but i think sporadic attacks against some taliban activities emanating from pakistan are likely to have the effect of simply widening the hostilities , and , in effect , transforming the problems we face in afghanistan into a problem that spans both afghanistan and pakistan thereby vastly complicating the challenge that we face - while at the same time probably further destabilizing pakistan . you support barack obama .
much like john mccain , he has called for a significant increase in us troops in afghanistan ... the call for some additional troops may be justified here or there .
but additional troops are not the solution in the long run .
i think obama has a much better understanding of the problems of the 21st century than mccain and the problems we face in afghanistan are not the only problems the 21st century is putting before us .
the american definition of its role in this world has to creatively adapt to the new global complexities .
i do n't see much evidence that mccain understands that need .

he added that he would do everything possible to make the meeting work out .
late wednesday , georgia and russia were supposed to gather for internationally-backed peace talks in geneva .

" unfortunately ... the de facto authorities of south ossetia and abkhazia who were present at the meeting , i 'm sorry to say did not exhibit such a constructive spirit - they chose instead to walk out of the informational session , " he told afp .
tension between parties following the walkout , the parties demanded to be treated as full national delegations before coming back to talks , but " no one was prepared to do that , " said fried .
" this was unfortunate and so the session ended early because the south ossetians and abkhaz walked out , " he added .
even before the session , there was tension over the participation of the abkhazians and the south ossetians , with russia insisting there could be no agreements without their presence .
the georgians had argued that the official talks should only include representatives of georgia , russia , the united states , the european union , the osce and the un .
russia has said it wants security guarantees and a ban on all weapons sales to georgia , which in has demanded that all russian troops leave georgian territory , including south ossetia and abkhazia .

16 . the financial sector watchdog bafin launched a special investigation into hre and its irish subsidiary depfa back in february , the newspaper said . bafin chief jochen sanio had acknowledged as much during a hearing by the german parliament 's budgetary and financial committee , handelsblatt reported . denials from finance ministry until now , steinbrueck has maintained that no such investigation was possible because bafin has no jurisdiction in ireland . but , according to the sources quoted by handelsblatt , bafin submitted a request to the irish authorities in february and commissioned the german central bank , the bundesbank , to carry out the investigation . sanio said bafin presented the findings of the probe to hre 's management in july and had informed the finance ministry of the results on aug .
7 . rescue for hre the german government was forced to come to the rescue of hre , the country 's fourth-biggest bank , at the end of september , initially with a 27 billion euro -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- bailout . but that sum then had to be increased to 50 billion euros as it emerged that the bank 's woes were even more serious than previously thought . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to german industry groups , berlin ca n't afford not to toss a little cash their way . the president of the german national industrial federation bdi , juergen thumann , has demanded more government investments to help alleviate the problems caused by the financial crisis . “ the federal government should in no way reduce the amount of their investments , in fact they should increase them , ” thumann was quoted as saying in the german daily der tagesspiegel . thumann said infrastructure projects should be renewed , especially in conjunction with private companies . “ i ’ m thinking of building roads , airports and power plants .
there are more than enough projects , ” he added . the bdi chief also encouraged the government to continue trying to balance the budget , even if it isn ’ t possible to do it in the next few years .
originally berlin had set a goal of 2011 , but in the face of the international financial crisis and the billions of euros being pumped into rescue packages , that now seems like a long shot . experts call for stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straubhaar is in favor of a stimulus package meanwhile the head of the hamburg world economics institute -lrb- hwwi -rrb- , thomas straubhaar , said that the government should give the people money to help stimulate the economy . “ every taxpayer should get a check from the government before the end of this year , ” he was quoted as saying in the german daily hamburger abendblatt . straubhaar suggested that each tax paying adult receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 134 -rrb- in november and 100 euros in december . “ everyone should get the same amount .
that 's because it isn ’ t just doing something for the people , but for the economy as well , ” he added . in spite of increasingly gloomy forecasts for the european economy , leaders have no plans for launching a concerted eu stimulus plan to boost activity , said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker .

the ongoing economic downturn led the government to lower the 2009 growth forecast in europe 's biggest economy from 1.2 percent down to 0.2 percent .
but economy minister michael glos said in berlin that there is no need to panic .
for the current year , the minister is still expecting gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.7 percent .
though that number is also down from 2.5 percent .
" we are just seeing some slowdown in the economy , " glos said .

glos went on to say that the financial firestorm that swept through markets in recent weeks underscored the need for germany to overhaul its tax system .
" beyond what we 've already agreed , there is an urgent need for tax relief , " said glos .
according to government forecasts , the economic slowdown will also leave its mark on the german labor market , where unemployment has been shrinking for more than two years .

according to german industry groups , berlin ca n't afford not to toss a little cash their way . the president of the german national industrial federation bdi , juergen thumann , has demanded more government investments to help alleviate the problems caused by the financial crisis . “ the federal government should in no way reduce the amount of their investments , in fact they should increase them , ” thumann was quoted as saying in the german daily der tagesspiegel . thumann said infrastructure projects should be renewed , especially in conjunction with private companies . “ i ’ m thinking of building roads , airports and power plants .
there are more than enough projects , ” he added . the bdi chief also encouraged the government to continue trying to balance the budget , even if it isn ’ t possible to do it in the next few years .
originally berlin had set a goal of 2011 , but in the face of the international financial crisis and the billions of euros being pumped into rescue packages , that now seems like a long shot . experts call for stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straubhaar is in favor of a stimulus package meanwhile the head of the hamburg world economics institute -lrb- hwwi -rrb- , thomas straubhaar , said that the government should give the people money to help stimulate the economy . “ every taxpayer should get a check from the government before the end of this year , ” he was quoted as saying in the german daily hamburger abendblatt . straubhaar suggested that each tax paying adult receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 134 -rrb- in november and 100 euros in december . “ everyone should get the same amount .
that 's because it isn ’ t just doing something for the people , but for the economy as well , ” he added . in spite of increasingly gloomy forecasts for the european economy , leaders have no plans for launching a concerted eu stimulus plan to boost activity , said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker . " who would pay for it and with what money ? " said juncker , who also chairs the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers .
" i do n't see how we could finance such a big stimulus plan . " germany on the brink of recession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts have said germany is headed for a recession this comes on the heels of an announcement by the german government that the country is on the verge of a recession , due to the financial crisis and the struggling world economy .
the ongoing economic downturn led the government to lower the 2009 growth forecast in europe 's biggest economy from 1.2 percent down to 0.2 percent .
but economy minister michael glos said in berlin that there is no need to panic .
for the current year , the minister is still expecting gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.7 percent .
though that number is also down from 2.5 percent .
" we are just seeing some slowdown in the economy , " glos said .
" there is nothing to sugarcoat or cover up . "
too early to foresee crisis ' outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said germany should reform its tax system glos insisted that his latest forecasts entailed a " high degree of uncertainty " as it was still too early to predict exactly how the current financial crisis would affect the real economy .
glos went on to say that the financial firestorm that swept through markets in recent weeks underscored the need for germany to overhaul its tax system .
" beyond what we 've already agreed , there is an urgent need for tax relief , " said glos .
according to government forecasts , the economic slowdown will also leave its mark on the german labor market , where unemployment has been shrinking for more than two years .
glos predicted that the jobless total will average an annual 3.3 million next year , the same level as this year . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police said he fell to his knees when they arrived saying , " i surrender . "
suspected of heading the pelle-romeo family , one of two feuding clans in the village of san luca , pelle had been on the run since the duisburg killings .

their bodies were dumped in two cars outside the restaurant .

96 parliamentarians voted against and 32 abstained .
under a previous parliamentary mandate , germany was allowed to send up to 3,500 troops to afghanistan .
the vote on thursday increases that number to 4,500 .
the mandate is valid for 14 months .
troop morale at a low the vote comes at a time when morale among german troops in afghanistan is low as they face increased attacks from a resurgent taliban .
five years ago , when the german army began its mission in northern afghanistan , the region was regarded as one of the country 's safest .
now , the solders run the daily risk of " being caught in an explosive or being shot at , " one officer said .
during the last year , the security situation has deteriorated not only in the north , but all across afghanistan .
the afghan presidential election , likely to shape the country 's future for years to come , is scheduled around autumn 2009 , making a further escalation of violence in the coming year more than likely .
as voter registration started last week , taliban spokesman kari jussif ahmadi warned the population against registering , saying it was a " waste of time , " as the militants were set to prevent the election from happening .
" more than half of the country is in our hands , and we will not let it happen , " he said .
added danger posed by upcoming election while the taliban are unlikely to prevent the polls - they failed to do so in 2004 despite grand announcements to the contrary - they are believed to be strong enough to severely disrupt the run-up to the election .
the international community has made it clear that securing the election will be one of the most important tasks in 2009 .
the german troops within the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- will also play a role in the training of afghan security forces , a process that must be speeded up after being promoted too timidly for a long time .
there is no doubt that this will be dangerous .
even today , the duty of the 4,500 german soldiers is a far cry from the beginning of the mission , when isaf troops really were peacekeepers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers ' deaths have changed the way troops view their mission soldiers at the german camp in the northern province of kunduz nicknamed the full moon " rocket weather , " because of the many attacks raining down on them by moonlight .

earlier this month , lerch admitted he advised the libyans on how to build a piping system for a uranium-enrichment plant .
prosecutor wolfgang siegmund said earlier thursday the defendant helped libyan interests , but had not been a member of an international network of nuclear smugglers led by the rogue pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan .
us and german intelligence agents uncovered the plans to export the piping system , earlier media reports said .
libya has since abandoned its nuclear ambitions .
the defendant was convicted of breaching german laws restricting exports of militarily useful products .
defendant endangered international peace a previous trial which began in july 2006 had to be called off after the bomb plans - regarded as evidence by the defense team - were shredded by swiss authorities .
under an agreement with the defense to settle with a compromise , prosecutor siegmund dropped an allegation that the defendant was the builder and supplier of a gas ultra centrifuge system to refine uranium for libya 's bomb .
siegmund , who pressed for a six-year prison term , said thursday that libya in fact came nowhere close to making its own bomb , but the defendant 's actions had endangered international peace .

96 parliamentarians voted against and 32 abstained .
under a previous parliamentary mandate , germany was allowed to send up to 3,500 troops to afghanistan .
the vote on thursday increases that number to 4,500 .

troop morale at a low the vote comes at a time when morale among german troops in afghanistan is low as they face increased attacks from a resurgent taliban .
five years ago , when the german army began its mission in northern afghanistan , the region was regarded as one of the country 's safest .
now , the solders run the daily risk of " being caught in an explosive or being shot at , " one officer said .
during the last year , the security situation has deteriorated not only in the north , but all across afghanistan .
the afghan presidential election , likely to shape the country 's future for years to come , is scheduled around autumn 2009 , making a further escalation of violence in the coming year more than likely .
as voter registration started last week , taliban spokesman kari jussif ahmadi warned the population against registering , saying it was a " waste of time , " as the militants were set to prevent the election from happening .
" more than half of the country is in our hands , and we will not let it happen , " he said .
added danger posed by upcoming election while the taliban are unlikely to prevent the polls - they failed to do so in 2004 despite grand announcements to the contrary - they are believed to be strong enough to severely disrupt the run-up to the election .
the international community has made it clear that securing the election will be one of the most important tasks in 2009 .
the german troops within the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- will also play a role in the training of afghan security forces , a process that must be speeded up after being promoted too timidly for a long time .
there is no doubt that this will be dangerous .
even today , the duty of the 4,500 german soldiers is a far cry from the beginning of the mission , when isaf troops really were peacekeepers .

speaking after meeting state premiers in berlin , the chancellor said the two sides had held " constructive talks " keeping in mind " the common responsiblity for our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has called the deal " tenable " and expects the rescue package to win parliamentary approval merkel said the two sides had agreed to share the burden of the rescue package , adding she was optimistic the legislative package would win approval in the german houses of parliament on friday .
german rescue package the biggest most of the eurozone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds .
germany 's rescue deal is the biggest , comprising 400 billion euros in guarantees , a 70-billion-euro fund and 10 billion euros of leeway .
berlin says it will need a credit of 100 billion euros to operate the bank-support scheme , but the trading fund will earn interest and dividend income from banks it takes over .
the ultimate net cost may be far less than the credit sum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has moved away from a case-to-case bailout for struggling banks finance minister peer steinbrueck explained that when the final accounts were calculated after the rescue , the states would pay 35 percent of the cost , or possibly receive 35 percent of the profits if there were any .
state premiers said this was because the states , as proprietors of state banks , would have to sustain other losses in the crisis .
" it 's a good outcome , " said juergen ruettgers , premier of north rhine westphalia .
merkel called the deal " tenable . "
berlin to create new agency for bank rescue germany has not identified which of its banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-quality derivatives .
the cost burden on the states from the wider bail-out is to be limited to 7.7 billion euros , with the federal government to pay all higher bills , steinbrueck said .
government politicians said germany would create a special agency for the bank rescue after the country 's central bank said its independence would be compromised if it became an arm of government policy .
instead of being a department of the bundesbank , it would be a legally separate unit at the bundesbank office in frankfurt .
the bundesbank , which is one of the principal central banks underpinning the european central bank in frankfurt , had earlier told berlin it did not want to be seen taking instructions from the german federal government .
to speed passage of the bill on friday , votes are set to be held in the bundestag lower chamber and the bundesrat upper chamber on the same day .
in an unusual move , the bill is to be emailed back to the german government a few hundred metres away for the final formalities .
when the finance minister , chancellor and president have signed it , the government printer in cologne will print 30,000 copies . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking after meeting state premiers in berlin , the chancellor said the two sides had held " constructive talks " keeping in mind " the common responsiblity for our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has called the deal " tenable " and expects the rescue package to win parliamentary approval merkel said the two sides had agreed to share the burden of the rescue package , adding she was optimistic the legislative package would win approval in the german houses of parliament on friday .
german rescue package the biggest most of the eurozone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds .
germany 's rescue deal is the biggest , comprising 400 billion euros in guarantees , a 70-billion-euro fund and 10 billion euros of leeway .
berlin says it will need a credit of 100 billion euros to operate the bank-support scheme , but the trading fund will earn interest and dividend income from banks it takes over .
the ultimate net cost may be far less than the credit sum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has moved away from a case-to-case bailout for struggling banks finance minister peer steinbrueck explained that when the final accounts were calculated after the rescue , the states would pay 35 percent of the cost , or possibly receive 35 percent of the profits if there were any .
state premiers said this was because the states , as proprietors of state banks , would have to sustain other losses in the crisis .
" it 's a good outcome , " said juergen ruettgers , premier of north rhine westphalia .
merkel called the deal " tenable . "
berlin to create new agency for bank rescue germany has not identified which of its banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-quality derivatives .
the cost burden on the states from the wider bail-out is to be limited to 7.7 billion euros , with the federal government to pay all higher bills , steinbrueck said .
government politicians said germany would create a special agency for the bank rescue after the country 's central bank said its independence would be compromised if it became an arm of government policy .
instead of being a department of the bundesbank , it would be a legally separate unit at the bundesbank office in frankfurt .
the bundesbank , which is one of the principal central banks underpinning the european central bank in frankfurt , had earlier told berlin it did not want to be seen taking instructions from the german federal government .
to speed passage of the bill on friday , votes are set to be held in the bundestag lower chamber and the bundesrat upper chamber on the same day .
in an unusual move , the bill is to be emailed back to the german government a few hundred metres away for the final formalities .

eu leaders called for the restructuring of international finance systems . european union leaders were due to wrap up a two-day summit on thursday , oct .
16 , while facing the worst financial crisis since the great depression .
many analysts consider a us recession unavoidable . in early trading on thursday main european stock markets were down sharply , with london and frankfurt opening five percent lower . after their first day of meetings in brussels , eu heads of state and government called for a common european response to the global credit crunch . " after a few false starts , europe has shown that it is capable of acting , " austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said wednesday . british prime minister gordon brown joined french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel in calling for better regulation of global financial markets .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- us elections 2008 -pipe- rivals get personal in spiky debate bbc news / us elections 2008 graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- video and audio -pipe- have your say -pipe- 04:19 gmt , thursday , 16 october 2008 05:19 uk rivals get personal in spiky debate by kevin connolly bbc news , new york i was starting to think that it was time we got real and stopped referring to these stilted , stage-managed , stuttering candidate encounters as debates at all .
after all , the earlier meetings of campaign 2008 were only faintly reminiscent of the world of genuine political argument - just as olympic fencing with its padded suits , elaborate rules and obsession with safety is a pale shadow of the bloodthirsty and dangerous world of real sword fighting .
well - i was wrong .
on long island , barack obama and john mccain restored a sense of vigour to the debating process with a tense , edgy and occasionally highly-personal face-to-face showdown .
i could n't help smiling when i heard that both camps were insisting on having air-conditioning outlets positioned above the respective heads of their candidates to make sure they did n't start looking hot and sticky - and therefore shifty - under the lights .
there had been nothing in oxford , st louis or nashville to prompt either of them to break into a sweat .
in long island , they both had reason to be glad of that cooling flow of air .
punchy questions in part , that was down to the format of the debate which allowed the two men to argue directly with each other as they sat together around a horse-shoe shaped table .
but a little credit must go to the moderator , the veteran cbs news anchor bob schieffer , who asked punchy and direct questions and had enough poise to sit back and let the two candidates fight it out directly .
it produced some spiky exchanges - after one discussion of whether or not americans should be paying higher taxes , mr mccain tried to have the last word by saying : " let 's not raise anybody 's taxes . "
mr obama almost spoke over him to add : " i do n't mind paying a little more . "
schieffer 's best question was probably a direct challenge to the candidates to establish whether or not they were prepared to repeat to each other 's faces the kind of slurs and distortions their campaign workers and surrogates happily peddle every day .
mr obama 's best direct shot was probably when he chided his rival with the words : " john , 100 % of your tv ads are negative . "
mr mccain was more aggressive - partly because that 's the way he is , partly because he is now trailing badly in opinion polls in a whole string of battleground states and is therefore the candidate who needs to change the game .
he made a couple of dismissive references to mr obama 's " eloquence " - for which you can read slippery stretching of the truth .
and he accused him directly of not keeping to a promise to restrict himself to using limited funds from the public purse for his campaign - an offer he made before he realised the huge advantage that his colossal fund-raising machine could offer .
mr mccain looked directly at mr obama and said : " you did n't keep your word on campaign finance . "
in the jargon of american politics , that was " taking it to obama " - but while mccain supporters will feel he landed plenty of scoring punches it did n't feel to me that he 'd done nearly enough to reverse the tide of bad economic news and bad opinion polls which are combining to choke the life out of his campaign .
joe the plumber the debate lasted 90 minutes and for the first 45 of them the atmosphere between the candidates crackled with genuine disagreement and , i thought , thinly-veiled dislike .
but there was a whiff of the surreal about the debate , too , which helped to offset the tension a little .
very early on , mr mccain mentioned by name a plumber from ohio who 'd been seen in many television news clips discussing with barack obama how his tax plans would affect small businesses .
mr mccain addressed the plumber - joe wurzelbacher - directly through the camera - a good , if rather over-used populist trick .
mr obama though , then did the same thing .
and when the debate came onto the subject of healthcare , the wurzelbachers were back front and centre in the political life of the nation again listening along with the rest of us to a discussion of how the rival plans would impact their lives .
mr wurzelbacher is now the most famous plumber in north america since super mario , although he must have got quite a shock when his name first popped up .
competing visions not all of the debate lived up to the promise of the early passages .
the two candidates produced fairly predictable presentations on issues like health and education and at one point even found themselves discussing - albeit briefly - the peruvian free trade agreement .
you 'd have got long odds against that coming up at the start of the evening .
the question of who won is more difficult than usual because the two men are aiming to give such different performances .
as a front-runner , mr obama seeks to look cool and measured - as underdog , mr mccain has to look scrappier and more aggressive .
they 'll probably both be pleased with their performances i think , although it 's impossible to imagine that mr mccain 's was convincing enough to shift the terms of an election that is slipping out of his grasp .
so my winner -lrb- with a nod to bob schieffer for his sharp questioning -rrb- is the american voter who has dutifully watched the earlier debates in huge numbers and been rewarded only with dull and predictable exchanges .
at last the country was given a debate worthy of the name , which reminded us what this race is about and what drives the competing visions of the two men fighting for the most powerful job on earth .

john mccain tells his rival that he " is not president bush " i was starting to think that it was time we got real and stopped referring to these stilted , stage-managed , stuttering candidate encounters as debates at all .
after all , the earlier meetings of campaign 2008 were only faintly reminiscent of the world of genuine political argument - just as olympic fencing with its padded suits , elaborate rules and obsession with safety is a pale shadow of the bloodthirsty and dangerous world of real sword fighting .
well - i was wrong .
on long island , barack obama and john mccain restored a sense of vigour to the debating process with a tense , edgy and occasionally highly-personal face-to-face showdown .
i could n't help smiling when i heard that both camps were insisting on having air-conditioning outlets positioned above the respective heads of their candidates to make sure they did n't start looking hot and sticky - and therefore shifty - under the lights .
there had been nothing in oxford , st louis or nashville to prompt either of them to break into a sweat .
in long island , they both had reason to be glad of that cooling flow of air .
punchy questions in part , that was down to the format of the debate which allowed the two men to argue directly with each other as they sat together around a horse-shoe shaped table .
schieffer 's questioning produced fierce exchanges between the candidates but a little credit must go to the moderator , the veteran cbs news anchor bob schieffer , who asked punchy and direct questions and had enough poise to sit back and let the two candidates fight it out directly .
it produced some spiky exchanges - after one discussion of whether or not americans should be paying higher taxes , mr mccain tried to have the last word by saying : " let 's not raise anybody 's taxes . "
mr obama almost spoke over him to add : " i do n't mind paying a little more . "
schieffer 's best question was probably a direct challenge to the candidates to establish whether or not they were prepared to repeat to each other 's faces the kind of slurs and distortions their campaign workers and surrogates happily peddle every day .
mr obama 's best direct shot was probably when he chided his rival with the words : " john , 100 % of your tv ads are negative . "

the candidates accuse each other of negative campaigning and false adverts mr mccain was more aggressive - partly because that 's the way he is , partly because he is now trailing badly in opinion polls in a whole string of battleground states and is therefore the candidate who needs to change the game .
he made a couple of dismissive references to mr obama 's " eloquence " - for which you can read slippery stretching of the truth .
and he accused him directly of not keeping to a promise to restrict himself to using limited funds from the public purse for his campaign - an offer he made before he realised the huge advantage that his colossal fund-raising machine could offer .
mr mccain looked directly at mr obama and said : " you did n't keep your word on campaign finance . "
in the jargon of american politics , that was " taking it to obama " - but while mccain supporters will feel he landed plenty of scoring punches it did n't feel to me that he 'd done nearly enough to reverse the tide of bad economic news and bad opinion polls which are combining to choke the life out of his campaign .
joe the plumber the debate lasted 90 minutes and for the first 45 of them the atmosphere between the candidates crackled with genuine disagreement and , i thought , thinly-veiled dislike .
but there was a whiff of the surreal about the debate , too , which helped to offset the tension a little .
key words used most frequently by barack obama in the debate enlarge image very early on , mr mccain mentioned by name a plumber from ohio who 'd been seen in many television news clips discussing with barack obama how his tax plans would affect small businesses .
mr mccain addressed the plumber - joe wurzelbacher - directly through the camera - a good , if rather over-used populist trick .
mr obama though , then did the same thing .
and when the debate came onto the subject of healthcare , the wurzelbachers were back front and centre in the political life of the nation again listening along with the rest of us to a discussion of how the rival plans would impact their lives .
mr wurzelbacher is now the most famous plumber in north america since super mario , although he must have got quite a shock when his name first popped up .
competing visions not all of the debate lived up to the promise of the early passages .
the two candidates produced fairly predictable presentations on issues like health and education and at one point even found themselves discussing - albeit briefly - the peruvian free trade agreement .
you 'd have got long odds against that coming up at the start of the evening .
key words used most frequently by john mccain in the debate enlarge image the question of who won is more difficult than usual because the two men are aiming to give such different performances .
as a front-runner , mr obama seeks to look cool and measured - as underdog , mr mccain has to look scrappier and more aggressive .
they 'll probably both be pleased with their performances i think , although it 's impossible to imagine that mr mccain 's was convincing enough to shift the terms of an election that is slipping out of his grasp .
so my winner -lrb- with a nod to bob schieffer for his sharp questioning -rrb- is the american voter who has dutifully watched the earlier debates in huge numbers and been rewarded only with dull and predictable exchanges .
at last the country was given a debate worthy of the name , which reminded us what this race is about and what drives the competing visions of the two men fighting for the most powerful job on earth .

nine out of 10 children now do at least two hours of pe and sport a week , according to figures being released .
in 2002 , an estimated one quarter of pupils were doing that much sport .
the figures are also expected to show a rise in schools ' competitive sport , which ministers hope will form a permanent legacy of the 2012 olympics .
statistics from the school sport survey for 2007-08 will be released later on 16 october .
they are based on a survey of 21,631 schools and 6.2m pupils .
they will show that the government has met its 2008 target of 85 % of pupils taking part in at least two hours of sport every week in school and in after-school clubs and matches .
a total of 90 % are now said to do this much sport through their schools , up from 86 % last year .
teenagers among primary schools , the figures suggest a rise in participation from 52 % in 2004-05 to 96 % this year .
participation is highest among pupils aged from five to 13 -lrb- 90 % do two hours or more a week -rrb- .
teenagers in their gcse years do less sport .
among year 10s -lrb- 14- and 15-year-olds -rrb- , 71 % do two hours of school sport and among year 11s that drops to 66 % .
last year 's school sports survey put the proportion of pupils taking part in inter-school competitive sport at 40 % , a rise of 18 % since 2003-04 .
pe is compulsory under the national curriculum in england .
school sport was a national embarrassment a decade ago ed balls , schools secretary the government 's pe strategy , launched in 2002 , aims to boost sport for young people through a variety of schemes , including more training for teachers and " school sport partnership " , where 450 partnerships have been set up linking specialist sports colleges with secondary , primary and special schools .
children ’ s secretary ed balls said : " we have made massive progress in the last few years and laid a firm foundation for a permanent 2012 olympic legacy .
it ’ s a testament to the fantastic , hard work of the youth sport trust , schools and sports clubs .
" ignore the half-pint full critics who carp nothing has changed .
school sport was a national embarrassment a decade ago .
sport had all but withered and died in many schools ; thousands of playing fields had been sold off ; there was negligible investment ; and an ingrained anti-competitive culture .
" school and youth sport has now never been as well funded ; there is a permanent infrastructure and support in place ; and more children doing pe and sport than ever before .
children don ’ t want to be wrapped in cotton wool - they want to compete at their own level , in the sports they want .
" we now need to raise our game to persuade more children to make the right choices and exercise outside school - children exercising more sport in the holidays and after school so all children can do at least five hours a week . "
uk picture as education is a devolved matter in the uk , policies on school sport vary across the nations .
in northern ireland , the assembly government recommends two hours of pe for secondary school pupils .
at primary level , last year a new sports programme was launched for primary schools where coaches from the gaelic athletic association and the irish football association go into schools to work with children aged four to eight .
the scottish government also expects pupils to have two hours of sport at school .
a spokesman said : " guidelines under curriculum for excellence , scotland 's new approach to learning and teaching , explicitly reflect our expectation that schools work towards providing two hours of good quality pe for each child every week and explore other ways of promoting a wide range of physical activities and sport .
" furthermore , since 2004 , £ 12m per year has been invested in the active school programme , which is delivering a range of physical activities in and around the school day , helping increase participation in sport . "
in wales , the assembly government is working in partnership with the sports council for wales to improve standards in pe and the range of sports offered .
a spokesman said a key element of this was the establishment of partnerships between clusters of schools to make " best use of facilities and expertise - with a target of two hours curriculum time each week for all pupils " .
it was planned that by 2010 all schools would be involved with such partnerships , he said .

school sport was a national embarrassment a decade ago .
sport had all but withered and died in many schools ; thousands of playing fields had been sold off ; there was negligible investment ; and an ingrained anti-competitive culture .
" school and youth sport has now never been as well funded ; there is a permanent infrastructure and support in place ; and more children doing pe and sport than ever before .
children don ’ t want to be wrapped in cotton wool - they want to compete at their own level , in the sports they want .
" we now need to raise our game to persuade more children to make the right choices and exercise outside school - children exercising more sport in the holidays and after school so all children can do at least five hours a week . "
uk picture as education is a devolved matter in the uk , policies on school sport vary across the nations .
in northern ireland , the assembly government recommends two hours of pe for secondary school pupils .
at primary level , last year a new sports programme was launched for primary schools where coaches from the gaelic athletic association and the irish football association go into schools to work with children aged four to eight .
the scottish government also expects pupils to have two hours of sport at school .
a spokesman said : " guidelines under curriculum for excellence , scotland 's new approach to learning and teaching , explicitly reflect our expectation that schools work towards providing two hours of good quality pe for each child every week and explore other ways of promoting a wide range of physical activities and sport .
" furthermore , since 2004 , £ 12m per year has been invested in the active school programme , which is delivering a range of physical activities in and around the school day , helping increase participation in sport . "
in wales , the assembly government is working in partnership with the sports council for wales to improve standards in pe and the range of sports offered .
a spokesman said a key element of this was the establishment of partnerships between clusters of schools to make " best use of facilities and expertise - with a target of two hours curriculum time each week for all pupils " .
it was planned that by 2010 all schools would be involved with such partnerships , he said .

nine out of 10 children now do at least two hours of pe and sport a week , according to figures being released .
in 2002 , an estimated one quarter of pupils were doing that much sport .
the figures are also expected to show a rise in schools ' competitive sport , which ministers hope will form a permanent legacy of the 2012 olympics .
statistics from the school sport survey for 2007-08 will be released later on 16 october .
they are based on a survey of 21,631 schools and 6.2m pupils .
they will show that the government has met its 2008 target of 85 % of pupils taking part in at least two hours of sport every week in school and in after-school clubs and matches .
a total of 90 % are now said to do this much sport through their schools , up from 86 % last year .
teenagers among primary schools , the figures suggest a rise in participation from 52 % in 2004-05 to 96 % this year .
participation is highest among pupils aged from five to 13 -lrb- 90 % do two hours or more a week -rrb- .
teenagers in their gcse years do less sport .
among year 10s -lrb- 14- and 15-year-olds -rrb- , 71 % do two hours of school sport and among year 11s that drops to 66 % .
last year 's school sports survey put the proportion of pupils taking part in inter-school competitive sport at 40 % , a rise of 18 % since 2003-04 .
pe is compulsory under the national curriculum in england .
school sport was a national embarrassment a decade ago ed balls , schools secretary the government 's pe strategy , launched in 2002 , aims to boost sport for young people through a variety of schemes , including more training for teachers and " school sport partnership " , where 450 partnerships have been set up linking specialist sports colleges with secondary , primary and special schools .
children ’ s secretary ed balls said : " we have made massive progress in the last few years and laid a firm foundation for a permanent 2012 olympic legacy .
it ’ s a testament to the fantastic , hard work of the youth sport trust , schools and sports clubs .
" ignore the half-pint full critics who carp nothing has changed .
school sport was a national embarrassment a decade ago .
sport had all but withered and died in many schools ; thousands of playing fields had been sold off ; there was negligible investment ; and an ingrained anti-competitive culture .
" school and youth sport has now never been as well funded ; there is a permanent infrastructure and support in place ; and more children doing pe and sport than ever before .
children don ’ t want to be wrapped in cotton wool - they want to compete at their own level , in the sports they want .
" we now need to raise our game to persuade more children to make the right choices and exercise outside school - children exercising more sport in the holidays and after school so all children can do at least five hours a week . "
uk picture as education is a devolved matter in the uk , policies on school sport vary across the nations .
in northern ireland , the assembly government recommends two hours of pe for secondary school pupils .
at primary level , last year a new sports programme was launched for primary schools where coaches from the gaelic athletic association and the irish football association go into schools to work with children aged four to eight .
the scottish government also expects pupils to have two hours of sport at school .
a spokesman said : " guidelines under curriculum for excellence , scotland 's new approach to learning and teaching , explicitly reflect our expectation that schools work towards providing two hours of good quality pe for each child every week and explore other ways of promoting a wide range of physical activities and sport .
" furthermore , since 2004 , £ 12m per year has been invested in the active school programme , which is delivering a range of physical activities in and around the school day , helping increase participation in sport . "
in wales , the assembly government is working in partnership with the sports council for wales to improve standards in pe and the range of sports offered .
a spokesman said a key element of this was the establishment of partnerships between clusters of schools to make " best use of facilities and expertise - with a target of two hours curriculum time each week for all pupils " .
it was planned that by 2010 all schools would be involved with such partnerships , he said .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- fact-checking the presidential debate bbc news / americas graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 05:37 gmt , thursday , 16 october 2008 06:37 uk fact-checking the presidential debate the final presidential debate between john mccain and barack obama covered a lot of ground .
the bbc news website assessed some of the claims made by the candidates to find who was telling the truth and who was bending it .
mccain 's negative ads claim : barack obama said : " 100 % , john , of your ads - 100 % of them have been negative .
fact : the non-partisan wisconsin advertising project says that " during the week of september 28-october 4 , nearly 100 % of the mccain campaign 's advertisements were negative .
during the same period , 34 % of the obama campaign 's ads were negative .
but the same organisation estimated that 73 % of the ads mr mccain aired since the start of the campaign have been negative while 61 % of mr obama 's ads have been negative .
verdict : mr obama was wrong to claim that mr mccain 's ads were 100 % negative .
mr mccain has been more negative than mr obama , but his ads were only 100 % negative during the week of 28 september - 4 october .
joe the plumber will be fined claim : john mccain said that if plumber joe wurzelbacher does not " adopt the healthcare plan that senator obama mandates , he 's going to fine you " .
fact : mr obama 's healthcare proposals would place a requirement on large companies that they contribute to a national health fund if they fail to make " a meaningful contribution " to their employees ' health care costs .
but the democratic candidate 's plan explicitly exempts small businesses form the requirement .
verdict : joe the plumber will be fine , not fined - mr mccain 's claim was false .
obama 's unpopular positions claim : mr obama , when asked which policy positions he had taken which had been unpopular with his own party , said : " i support charter schools and pay for performance for teachers .
does n't make me popular with the teachers union .
i support clean coal technology .
does n't make me popular with environmentalists .
so i 've got a history of reaching across the aisle . "
fact : the washington post 's fact checker notes that " early in this campaign , obama spoke out in favour of merit pay for teachers and hinted that he was not absolutely against further exploring private and parochial school vouchers , but as the campaign has progressed , has put much less of an emphasis on reform ideas that rankle the teacher unions , and has instead talked about raising teacher pay across the board , increasing education funding generally and reforming the no child left behind law so that it puts less focus on standardised tests . "
on clean coal , the post further reports that mr obama " upset many environmentalists in 2005 when he came out for huge subsidies for technology to liquefy coal for transportation fuel " , but that he " backed off the idea quite quickly in the face of this opposition -lsb- and -rsb- returned to advocating for further research on ' clean coal " ' putting him " very much on the same page with most democrats and even some environmentalists .
verdict : mr obama overstated the extent to which he has taken unpopular positions within his own party .
bill ayers 's obama party claim : john mccain said that mr obama had " launched -lsb- his -rsb- political campaign in mr ayers ' living room " .
fact : mr obama did attend a coffee meeting at bill ayers 's home shortly after declaring his intention to run for the illinois state senate in september 1995 .
but , according to lynn sweet of the chicago sun-times , the ayers event was only one of a number of informal gatherings in the chicago neighbourhood where mr obama lived .
the actual launch of mr obama 's state senate run was at the hyde park ramada inn on september 19 , 1995 .
verdict : bill ayers undoubtedly hosted an informal event for mr obama during the early stages of his political career , but any claim that the ayers 's event was in some way pivotal for mr obama 's political career is an exaggeration .

but , according to lynn sweet of the chicago sun-times , the ayers event was only one of a number of informal gatherings in the chicago neighbourhood where mr obama lived .
the actual launch of mr obama 's state senate run was at the hyde park ramada inn on september 19 , 1995 .
verdict : bill ayers undoubtedly hosted an informal event for mr obama during the early stages of his political career , but any claim that the ayers 's event was in some way pivotal for mr obama 's political career is an exaggeration .

the bbc news website assessed some of the claims made by the candidates to find who was telling the truth and who was bending it .
mccain 's negative ads claim : barack obama said : " 100 % , john , of your ads - 100 % of them have been negative .
fact : the non-partisan wisconsin advertising project says that " during the week of september 28-october 4 , nearly 100 % of the mccain campaign 's advertisements were negative .
during the same period , 34 % of the obama campaign 's ads were negative .
but the same organisation estimated that 73 % of the ads mr mccain aired since the start of the campaign have been negative while 61 % of mr obama 's ads have been negative .
verdict : mr obama was wrong to claim that mr mccain 's ads were 100 % negative .
mr mccain has been more negative than mr obama , but his ads were only 100 % negative during the week of 28 september - 4 october .
joe the plumber will be fined claim : john mccain said that if plumber joe wurzelbacher does not " adopt the healthcare plan that senator obama mandates , he 's going to fine you " .
fact : mr obama 's healthcare proposals would place a requirement on large companies that they contribute to a national health fund if they fail to make " a meaningful contribution " to their employees ' health care costs .
but the democratic candidate 's plan explicitly exempts small businesses form the requirement .
verdict : joe the plumber will be fine , not fined - mr mccain 's claim was false .
obama 's unpopular positions claim : mr obama , when asked which policy positions he had taken which had been unpopular with his own party , said : " i support charter schools and pay for performance for teachers .
does n't make me popular with the teachers union .
i support clean coal technology .
does n't make me popular with environmentalists .
so i 've got a history of reaching across the aisle . "
fact : the washington post 's fact checker notes that " early in this campaign , obama spoke out in favour of merit pay for teachers and hinted that he was not absolutely against further exploring private and parochial school vouchers , but as the campaign has progressed , has put much less of an emphasis on reform ideas that rankle the teacher unions , and has instead talked about raising teacher pay across the board , increasing education funding generally and reforming the no child left behind law so that it puts less focus on standardised tests . "
on clean coal , the post further reports that mr obama " upset many environmentalists in 2005 when he came out for huge subsidies for technology to liquefy coal for transportation fuel " , but that he " backed off the idea quite quickly in the face of this opposition -lsb- and -rsb- returned to advocating for further research on ' clean coal " ' putting him " very much on the same page with most democrats and even some environmentalists .
verdict : mr obama overstated the extent to which he has taken unpopular positions within his own party .
bill ayers 's obama party claim : john mccain said that mr obama had " launched -lsb- his -rsb- political campaign in mr ayers ' living room " .
fact : mr obama did attend a coffee meeting at bill ayers 's home shortly after declaring his intention to run for the illinois state senate in september 1995 .

" new species are becoming established all the time and some have the potential to take hold and accelerate : we 've got a watchlist of species that could potentially cause devastation . "
in a few year 's time , the ecology of the uk could look very different from today .
while many new species will be harmless and add to our rich mix of biodiversity , a few could become problematic , scientists warn .
ecologists are already keeping an eye on those non-native species that have already established in the uk but have the potential to spread . "
until recently , these birds have been seen as fairly benign " grahame madge the ring-necked parakeet -lrb- psittacula krameri -rrb- is one such species .
this vividly coloured bird , originally from south asia and africa , has been adding a spot of exotic glamour to various sites around the south-east of england since it arrived in the 1960s .
mr madge said : " until recently , these birds have been seen as fairly benign and have largely been adopted as part of the british fauna . "
however , the population has now increased significantly .
some scientists now believe that if the numbers continue to grow and the birds ' range increases , the parakeets could begin to compete with native species and could cause problems for agriculture .
as a result , the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- is currently undertaking a risk assessment to look at the potential impacts of the tropical birds .
as well as trying to keep track of the species that we have at home , scientists are also keeping a close watch on the invasive species that are currently wreaking havoc in neighbouring european countries . "
the citrus longhorn beetle has already reached places like italy ... the alarm bells should be really ringing for the uk " sara redstone , kew for example , ludwigia , which is also known as water primrose , is currently causing enormous problems in france .
this aquatic plant , which is native to south america , can spread extremely quickly and form dense mats that can clog up waterways to cause huge flooding risks and damage other aquatic plants and vertebrates .
the plant has come into the uk through sales in garden centres - but work by the centre for ecology and hydrology and the environment agency has so far kept the spread of the plants under control .
researchers are also looking further afield to see what creatures can come into the uk through trade and import .
sara redstone from the royal botanic gardens , kew , said : " there are a number of insects species that we 've seen having a dramatic impact in the us and some of these are now being intercepted on material entering the uk .
" for example , the citrus and asian longhorn beetle and emerald ash borer are having a drastic effect on street trees and natural woodland in parts of north america , where there are no known biological or chemical defences . "
dr redstone added : " the citrus longhorn beetle has already reached places like italy and the asian longhorn has been found in austria - the alarm bells should be really ringing for the uk . "
malaria risk climate change could also have an impact on the invasive species that are able to take hold in the uk .
previously , colder winters meant that many non-native creatures would be killed off by any cold snaps .
but warmer winters and earlier springs are making the uk a much more hospitable base for many species .
the argentine ant is one such creature that is causing ecologists some concern .
david roy , from the centre for ecology and hydrology , said : " it is a nuisance in buildings and is highly aggressive , wiping out native species .
it is very hard to eradicate . "
originally from south america , modelling studies have shown that the ant is able to increase its range from south to north thanks to the changing climate .
it has already been causing problems throughout the mediterranean , but dr roy warns that it could soon be heading even further north .
scientists are also worried about how a changing climate will affect the spread of disease carrying species such as mosquitoes .
sara redstone believes that action needs to be taken - and soon .
" there is a lot we can learn by observing what is happening in other parts of the world .
" every year we bring in tens of hundreds of species , and only a small proportion are either a problem or a potential problem .
" but i think everyone needs to be more aware .
" organisations need to have a collective responsibility , the government needs to also accept responsibility , but as individuals we need to be responsible too . "

" new species are becoming established all the time and some have the potential to take hold and accelerate : we 've got a watchlist of species that could potentially cause devastation . "
in a few year 's time , the ecology of the uk could look very different from today .
while many new species will be harmless and add to our rich mix of biodiversity , a few could become problematic , scientists warn .
ecologists are already keeping an eye on those non-native species that have already established in the uk but have the potential to spread .
until recently , these birds have been seen as fairly benign grahame madge the ring-necked parakeet -lrb- psittacula krameri -rrb- is one such species .
this vividly coloured bird , originally from south asia and africa , has been adding a spot of exotic glamour to various sites around the south-east of england since it arrived in the 1960s .
mr madge said : " until recently , these birds have been seen as fairly benign and have largely been adopted as part of the british fauna . "
however , the population has now increased significantly .
some scientists now believe that if the numbers continue to grow and the birds ' range increases , the parakeets could begin to compete with native species and could cause problems for agriculture .
as a result , the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- is currently undertaking a risk assessment to look at the potential impacts of the tropical birds .

advertisement grahame madge on the exotic ring-necked parakeet as well as trying to keep track of the species that we have at home , scientists are also keeping a close watch on the invasive species that are currently wreaking havoc in neighbouring european countries .
the citrus longhorn beetle has already reached places like italy ... the alarm bells should be really ringing for the uk sara redstone , kew for example , ludwigia , which is also known as water primrose , is currently causing enormous problems in france .
this aquatic plant , which is native to south america , can spread extremely quickly and form dense mats that can clog up waterways to cause huge flooding risks and damage other aquatic plants and vertebrates .
the plant has come into the uk through sales in garden centres - but work by the centre for ecology and hydrology and the environment agency has so far kept the spread of the plants under control .
researchers are also looking further afield to see what creatures can come into the uk through trade and import .
could new insects spell the end for our native trees ?
sara redstone from the royal botanic gardens , kew , said : " there are a number of insects species that we 've seen having a dramatic impact in the us and some of these are now being intercepted on material entering the uk .
" for example , the citrus and asian longhorn beetle and emerald ash borer are having a drastic effect on street trees and natural woodland in parts of north america , where there are no known biological or chemical defences . "
dr redstone added : " the citrus longhorn beetle has already reached places like italy and the asian longhorn has been found in austria - the alarm bells should be really ringing for the uk . "
malaria risk climate change could also have an impact on the invasive species that are able to take hold in the uk .
previously , colder winters meant that many non-native creatures would be killed off by any cold snaps .
but warmer winters and earlier springs are making the uk a much more hospitable base for many species .
the argentine ant is one such creature that is causing ecologists some concern .
the uk 's native ants could be at threat from argentine ants david roy , from the centre for ecology and hydrology , said : " it is a nuisance in buildings and is highly aggressive , wiping out native species .
it is very hard to eradicate . "
originally from south america , modelling studies have shown that the ant is able to increase its range from south to north thanks to the changing climate .
it has already been causing problems throughout the mediterranean , but dr roy warns that it could soon be heading even further north .
scientists are also worried about how a changing climate will affect the spread of disease carrying species such as mosquitoes .
sara redstone believes that action needs to be taken - and soon .
" there is a lot we can learn by observing what is happening in other parts of the world .
" every year we bring in tens of hundreds of species , and only a small proportion are either a problem or a potential problem .
" but i think everyone needs to be more aware .
" organisations need to have a collective responsibility , the government needs to also accept responsibility , but as individuals we need to be responsible too . "

in his first annual review in the role , keith towler said there was a gap between the policies which exist and their implementation .
he also talks about slow progress in tackling child poverty issues .
in 2001 wales became the first part of the uk to appoint an independent children 's commissioner . "
it would be a real pity if we do not have the courage to recognise the problems and take whatever action necessary to close those gaps " keith towler , children 's commissioner for wales the annual review details the planned activities of the commissioner for the upcoming year and reports on what has happened in the past twelve months .
mr towler said the gap between policies and services was evident despite the good intentions of those trying to implement them .
he blamed some of the problems in delivering services on inadequate funding , with many projects not knowing whether they will still be there from one year to the next .
in a bid to solve the problems he identified in his report , mr towler said he would provide encouragement and support for services , but would not accept excuses .
" the fact that this gap is evident across a number of policy and service areas , in different parts of wales , is a regular feature not only of news coverage but of advice and support cases brought to my attention , underlines the need to recognise the problem and look for ways to address it , " he said .
" having made the progress we have in wales , it would be a real pity if we do not have the courage to recognise the problems and take whatever action necessary to close those gaps .
" we must identify ways for national and local governments and children 's organisations to share information and evidence and work together effectively to improve the lives of our country 's children and young people . "
mr towler took over the commissioner 's role in march and is travelling across the country to raise awareness about his role .

nasty campaigns this debate was marked by testy exchanges on a number of issues .
one of these was negative campaigning .
both candidates sought to position themselves as victims of unpleasant - and incorrect - attack ads .
mr obama said that he has been called a terrorist by crowds at rallies for mr mccain 's vice-presidential running-mate sarah palin , and that she did nothing to stop them .
mr mccain said mr obama 's campaign was spending " unprecedented " amounts of money on negative ads which falsely portrayed his election pledges .
terrorist link ?
the give and take becomes testier .
mr mccain brings up mr obama 's associations with william ayers - a member of the 1960s-era radical group the weather underground which carried out a domestic bombing campaign in the us - and acorn , a community group accused of violating us law while registering voters .
mr obama refutes the claims , saying the attempts to link him to ayers and acorn " says more about your campaign than it says about me " .
the bush legacy " i am not president bush , " mr mccain says , countering mr obama 's frequent attempts to portray the republican candidate as offering four more years of president george w bush 's policies .
mr obama says that on " core economic issues " mr mccain has been a " vigorous " supporter of mr bush .
mr mccain attacks mr obama 's senate voting record , saying he supported big budgets .
he promises to cut taxes and balance budgets if elected .
joe the plumber some of the more memorable exchanges of the debate involved " joe the plumber " .
joe is a real man , not a campaign invention .
he is a plumber from ohio who has complained about how mr obama 's tax plans would affect his small business plans .
mr obama defends his tax policies while mr mccain says they amount to " class warfare " .
the running mates the candidates defend their choices of vice-presidential running mates .
mr obama says joe biden is " one of the finest public servants " in the us and he has " excellent foreign policy credentials " .
he calls him a fighter for working-class families who has not forgotten where he came from .
mr mccain calls sarah palin a " role model for women " who has cut taxes in alaska , where she is governor .
mr mccain says she would be a " breath of fresh air " in washington .
roe vs wade the candidates debate abortion - a divisive topic in the us - after a question about the appointment of judges to the supreme court .
mr obama defends the roe vs wade judgement that upheld the right of women to have an abortion .
mr mccain positions himself as the pro-life candidate .
healthcare mr mccain attacks mr obama 's healthcare proposals , saying if you like them " you will love canada or england " .
he seems surprised to hear from mr obama that his proposed health care plan would involve no fine for small businesses - like joe the plumber 's - that do not provide medical inurance for employees .

the rate of price increases seems to have slowed , but many basic foodstuffs like rice and lentils are far more expensive than they were a year ago .
' alarming ' hunger in indian states and that means people on or below the borderline - hundreds of millions of people - are struggling to make ends meet .
in the most extreme cases , severe malnutrition is a life-threatening condition .
there are about eight million children under the age of five in india who are in urgent need of therapeutic feeding and nutritional treatment .
but there are also tens of millions of children who suffer from chronic malnutrition which may not be immediately visible .
they are deprived of many of the nutrients they need to lead healthy productive lives .
in india , the rise in the cost of food has not created a crisis , it has simply made a bad situation worse .
rising inflation has received considerable attention in the indian media , but the recent focus has been on the global financial turmoil , and its impact on indian markets .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
chris morris discovers why india 's young people are the hardest hit by high food prices that is of little immediate relevance , though , to the vast majority of people in this country .
what matters is the price of vegetables , the price of flour , and whether there is any work to be had to buy the food they need .
two thirds of india 's population are forced to get by on less than two dollars -lrb- £ 1.15 ; 1.47 euros -rrb- a day .
and the little money they do make now buys less food than it used to .
something has to give .
return to map christian fraser , cairo , egypt inflation in egypt is at a 16-year high with soaring food prices triggering violent protests in some areas of the country this year , prompting the government to raise public sector salaries by 30 % .
but the pay rise was soon followed by increases in prices of fuel , which sent the cost of goods and services even higher .
an egyptian family can spend as much as 80 % of its income on food egyptian economist samir radwan says that while the levels of salaries and subsidies may have risen , " the government 's liberalizing of some other commodity prices means the poor are actually worse off than they were before may " .
many poorer families in cairo - some of whom spend 80 % of their household income on food - have been making savings by cutting their meals from three a day to just two .
egypt is also the world 's largest importer of wheat , which explains why the country has been hit so hard by these international price rises .
finance minister youssef boutros-ghali says a large part of the inflation in his country stems from the higher prices of imported goods .
but he believes that , as the year progresses , things will start to look better .
egypt is the world 's largest importer of wheat , which explains why the country has been hit so hard by these international price rises the wheat egypt has , in the past , bought from russia and ukraine now looks much cheaper .
" look at international commodity prices , " he says .
" wheat used to be $ 480 a tonne , it has now fallen to around $ 200 a tonne .
corn is the same .
soybean the same .
edible oils the same .
all of this is bound to translate here .
we will see prices fall . "
return to map julia caesar , london , uk despite the uk 's wide variety of shops competing for custom , many here are feeling the pinch .
but , after nine long months of price rises , food inflation seems to be slowing down .
according to the bbc 's food price index compiled by verdict , which tracks the cost of a typical trolley of uk food items , meat and fish products rose by 22.9 % from january to august .
world service food price index global hunger index in full general store-cupboard items , such as tinned foods , registered a 15 % increase and seven items in the survey leapt in price by more than 40 % .
a pack of four croissants , for example , was 47.4 % more expensive and a 125g packet of ham went up by 45.4 % .
another survey shows that fruit and vegetables have seen the biggest price rises - up by 30 % at leading supermarket chains in the uk over the past year .
retailers are blaming poor crop harvests and high supply chain costs .
but at least the shoppers in the uk have choice and they are making the most of it , according to consumer research .
in the last 12 months , 41 % of shoppers have switched to cheaper brands , with two-thirds searching for promotions and deals more often than a year ago .
hard discounters have become more popular too , forcing big-name supermarkets to compete more on price than they used to .
return to map michael bristow , beijing , china those in charge of the chinese economy received some welcome news this summer - inflation fell to its lowest level in more than a year .
earlier in 2008 , prices - particular for basic food items such as pork and eggs - had been rising faster than at any time in the past decade .
chinese people are sensitive to price rises for everyday items shoppers across the county complained that they had cut back on the kind of food purchases they make every day .
it was a worrying time for the chinese leadership .
as in other countries , inflation has sometimes led to street protests in china .
in a keynote speech given to china 's parliament , premier wen jiabao said tackling inflation was top of the government 's agenda .
but even in the midst of this bad news , chinese officials said they were confident that they would get inflation under control .
they claimed the food price rises were the result of temporary supply problems and not because of long-term shortages .
that confidence now seems to have been well-placed .
beijing shoppers say prices are still going up , but more slowly than before .
a senior finance official recently predicted that inflation in china would slow to 3 % in 2009 from a high of 8.7 % earlier this year .
having largely escaped the worst effects of the global financial crisis , economists are urging china to concentrate on turning that prediction into a reality .
and the government will need to , because chinese people remain acutely sensitive to price rises , particularly for everyday items .
return to map liz blunt , addis ababa , ethiopia it is easy to tell when one of the local " kebeles " in addis ababa is selling wheat - residents cluster outside hoping to be able to buy a sack of half-price grain and unemployed youngsters hang around hoping to earn a little money by carrying their sacks .
wheat prices in addis are higher than in other capitals the " kebeles " are a leftover from communist times - part local government offices , part community centres , part instruments of social control .
now the ethiopian government is using them to distribute subsidised wheat .
food prices have more than doubled in the past year here .
it was easy at first to blame world prices , market forces and globalisation .
but , with wheat prices in ethiopia much higher than world prices , it looked as if there would be a lot of profit to be made by importing wheat , yet market forces show no sign of bringing down the price .
the government 's attempts to flood the market have cost a lot but have had little effect .
if you are lucky enough to be at the front of the queue when the wheat arrives , you can buy a 100 kilo sack for 350 birr -lrb- around $ 35 ; 25 euros -rrb- .
but the markets are still selling wheat for 600 or even 700 birr per sack .
not surprisingly , much of the subsidised wheat is taken straight down the road to the market where it is sold for twice the price .
perhaps merchants and farmers are being greedy , but more likely there is just not enough food in the country .
return to map jonathan head , bangkok , thailand rice - the staple crop in this part of asia - reached record prices this year .
even after falling back from highs of around $ 1000 -lrb- 735 euros ; £ 573 -rrb- for a tonne of good quality rice , to $ 600-800 , it is still double what was being paid last year .
rising rice prices have not generated more cash for farmers yet the majority of farmers - who farm small plots of land of three hectares or less - have taken home very little of this bonanza .
the reasons are complex , and vary from country to country , but they underline a simple fact : whereas driving up the price of other smallholder agricultural commodities such as coffee or rubber often does enrich those who work the land , it rarely works that way in the case of rice .
many small rice farmers do not actually grow enough for their families to eat so they still have to buy rice at market prices .
in cambodia , for example , despite the government 's pride in becoming one of the world 's ten largest rice exporters , only a third of rice farmers produce any surplus they can sell - and one fifth of the population does not get enough to eat .
farmers usually have no storage facilities , so they need to sell their rice the moment it is harvested world food prices : what happened ?
this lead to a bizarre situation where the government planned to sell 1.6m tonnes of locally grown rice on world markets this year , but was also forced to ask the asian development bank for a $ 38m food security aid package for cambodians who could not feed themselves .
thailand - the region 's largest exporter - has done well out of rising prices , but its farmers have not as most of the profits have gone to the middlemen .
farmers usually have no storage facilities , so they need to sell their rice the moment it is harvested .
as prices started to ease from their highs in may , almost everyone in the region breathed a sigh of relief .
return to map daniel schweimler , buenos aires , argentina there is no doubt that food prices in argentina are rising - you just need to ask any shopper .
but to get an idea of just how much will depend on who you talk to .
argentina 's official statistics office , the indec , says inflation is under control , at around nine percent a year .
but shoppers , independent economists , newspapers and even some staff at the indec say those figures do not reflect the reality .
prices , they say , are rising at more than 20 % annually .
government measures to control food prices have sparked strikes about one third of the argentine wage goes on food , and meat takes up a fair amount of space in the basket .
argentines are the biggest per capita consumers of beef in the world and the government has worked hard to keep the price down - negotiating with producers and restricting exports .
but soya has become the new argentine beef .
they are n't eating it but exporting it - mostly to china and india .
the little cream bean was , until recently , fetching high prices on world markets and has been the driving force behind argentina 's economic recovery from the crisis it suffered seven years ago .
more and more land previously used for other crops or for pasture is being turned over to the lucrative soya crop , reducing supplies and pushing up prices .
earlier this year farmers nationwide protested against government plans to increase export taxes , mostly on soya .
the four-month protest and the worst drought in a century in argentina 's northern provinces have both had an effect in a country which produces nearly all its own food and imports little .

the rate of price increases seems to have slowed , but many basic foodstuffs like rice and lentils are far more expensive than they were a year ago .
' alarming ' hunger in indian states and that means people on or below the borderline - hundreds of millions of people - are struggling to make ends meet .
in the most extreme cases , severe malnutrition is a life-threatening condition .
there are about eight million children under the age of five in india who are in urgent need of therapeutic feeding and nutritional treatment .
but there are also tens of millions of children who suffer from chronic malnutrition which may not be immediately visible .
they are deprived of many of the nutrients they need to lead healthy productive lives .
in india , the rise in the cost of food has not created a crisis , it has simply made a bad situation worse .
rising inflation has received considerable attention in the indian media , but the recent focus has been on the global financial turmoil , and its impact on indian markets .

chris morris discovers why india 's young people are the hardest hit by high food prices that is of little immediate relevance , though , to the vast majority of people in this country .
what matters is the price of vegetables , the price of flour , and whether there is any work to be had to buy the food they need .
two thirds of india 's population are forced to get by on less than two dollars -lrb- £ 1.15 ; 1.47 euros -rrb- a day .
and the little money they do make now buys less food than it used to .
something has to give .
return to map christian fraser , cairo , egypt inflation in egypt is at a 16-year high with soaring food prices triggering violent protests in some areas of the country this year , prompting the government to raise public sector salaries by 30 % .
but the pay rise was soon followed by increases in prices of fuel , which sent the cost of goods and services even higher .
an egyptian family can spend as much as 80 % of its income on food egyptian economist samir radwan says that while the levels of salaries and subsidies may have risen , " the government 's liberalizing of some other commodity prices means the poor are actually worse off than they were before may " .
many poorer families in cairo - some of whom spend 80 % of their household income on food - have been making savings by cutting their meals from three a day to just two .
egypt is also the world 's largest importer of wheat , which explains why the country has been hit so hard by these international price rises .
finance minister youssef boutros-ghali says a large part of the inflation in his country stems from the higher prices of imported goods .
but he believes that , as the year progresses , things will start to look better .
egypt is the world 's largest importer of wheat , which explains why the country has been hit so hard by these international price rises the wheat egypt has , in the past , bought from russia and ukraine now looks much cheaper .
" look at international commodity prices , " he says .
" wheat used to be $ 480 a tonne , it has now fallen to around $ 200 a tonne .
corn is the same .
soybean the same .
edible oils the same .
all of this is bound to translate here .
we will see prices fall . "
return to map julia caesar , london , uk despite the uk 's wide variety of shops competing for custom , many here are feeling the pinch .
but , after nine long months of price rises , food inflation seems to be slowing down .
according to the bbc 's food price index compiled by verdict , which tracks the cost of a typical trolley of uk food items , meat and fish products rose by 22.9 % from january to august .
world service food price index global hunger index in full general store-cupboard items , such as tinned foods , registered a 15 % increase and seven items in the survey leapt in price by more than 40 % .
a pack of four croissants , for example , was 47.4 % more expensive and a 125g packet of ham went up by 45.4 % .
another survey shows that fruit and vegetables have seen the biggest price rises - up by 30 % at leading supermarket chains in the uk over the past year .
retailers are blaming poor crop harvests and high supply chain costs .
but at least the shoppers in the uk have choice and they are making the most of it , according to consumer research .
in the last 12 months , 41 % of shoppers have switched to cheaper brands , with two-thirds searching for promotions and deals more often than a year ago .
hard discounters have become more popular too , forcing big-name supermarkets to compete more on price than they used to .
return to map michael bristow , beijing , china those in charge of the chinese economy received some welcome news this summer - inflation fell to its lowest level in more than a year .
earlier in 2008 , prices - particular for basic food items such as pork and eggs - had been rising faster than at any time in the past decade .
chinese people are sensitive to price rises for everyday items shoppers across the county complained that they had cut back on the kind of food purchases they make every day .
it was a worrying time for the chinese leadership .
as in other countries , inflation has sometimes led to street protests in china .
in a keynote speech given to china 's parliament , premier wen jiabao said tackling inflation was top of the government 's agenda .
but even in the midst of this bad news , chinese officials said they were confident that they would get inflation under control .
they claimed the food price rises were the result of temporary supply problems and not because of long-term shortages .
that confidence now seems to have been well-placed .
beijing shoppers say prices are still going up , but more slowly than before .
a senior finance official recently predicted that inflation in china would slow to 3 % in 2009 from a high of 8.7 % earlier this year .
having largely escaped the worst effects of the global financial crisis , economists are urging china to concentrate on turning that prediction into a reality .
and the government will need to , because chinese people remain acutely sensitive to price rises , particularly for everyday items .
return to map liz blunt , addis ababa , ethiopia it is easy to tell when one of the local " kebeles " in addis ababa is selling wheat - residents cluster outside hoping to be able to buy a sack of half-price grain and unemployed youngsters hang around hoping to earn a little money by carrying their sacks .
wheat prices in addis are higher than in other capitals the " kebeles " are a leftover from communist times - part local government offices , part community centres , part instruments of social control .
now the ethiopian government is using them to distribute subsidised wheat .
food prices have more than doubled in the past year here .
it was easy at first to blame world prices , market forces and globalisation .
but , with wheat prices in ethiopia much higher than world prices , it looked as if there would be a lot of profit to be made by importing wheat , yet market forces show no sign of bringing down the price .
the government 's attempts to flood the market have cost a lot but have had little effect .
if you are lucky enough to be at the front of the queue when the wheat arrives , you can buy a 100 kilo sack for 350 birr -lrb- around $ 35 ; 25 euros -rrb- .
but the markets are still selling wheat for 600 or even 700 birr per sack .
not surprisingly , much of the subsidised wheat is taken straight down the road to the market where it is sold for twice the price .
perhaps merchants and farmers are being greedy , but more likely there is just not enough food in the country .
return to map jonathan head , bangkok , thailand rice - the staple crop in this part of asia - reached record prices this year .
even after falling back from highs of around $ 1000 -lrb- 735 euros ; £ 573 -rrb- for a tonne of good quality rice , to $ 600-800 , it is still double what was being paid last year .
rising rice prices have not generated more cash for farmers yet the majority of farmers - who farm small plots of land of three hectares or less - have taken home very little of this bonanza .
the reasons are complex , and vary from country to country , but they underline a simple fact : whereas driving up the price of other smallholder agricultural commodities such as coffee or rubber often does enrich those who work the land , it rarely works that way in the case of rice .
many small rice farmers do not actually grow enough for their families to eat so they still have to buy rice at market prices .
in cambodia , for example , despite the government 's pride in becoming one of the world 's ten largest rice exporters , only a third of rice farmers produce any surplus they can sell - and one fifth of the population does not get enough to eat .
farmers usually have no storage facilities , so they need to sell their rice the moment it is harvested world food prices : what happened ?
this lead to a bizarre situation where the government planned to sell 1.6m tonnes of locally grown rice on world markets this year , but was also forced to ask the asian development bank for a $ 38m food security aid package for cambodians who could not feed themselves .
thailand - the region 's largest exporter - has done well out of rising prices , but its farmers have not as most of the profits have gone to the middlemen .
farmers usually have no storage facilities , so they need to sell their rice the moment it is harvested .
as prices started to ease from their highs in may , almost everyone in the region breathed a sigh of relief .
return to map daniel schweimler , buenos aires , argentina there is no doubt that food prices in argentina are rising - you just need to ask any shopper .
but to get an idea of just how much will depend on who you talk to .
argentina 's official statistics office , the indec , says inflation is under control , at around nine percent a year .
but shoppers , independent economists , newspapers and even some staff at the indec say those figures do not reflect the reality .
prices , they say , are rising at more than 20 % annually .
government measures to control food prices have sparked strikes about one third of the argentine wage goes on food , and meat takes up a fair amount of space in the basket .
argentines are the biggest per capita consumers of beef in the world and the government has worked hard to keep the price down - negotiating with producers and restricting exports .
but soya has become the new argentine beef .
they are n't eating it but exporting it - mostly to china and india .
the little cream bean was , until recently , fetching high prices on world markets and has been the driving force behind argentina 's economic recovery from the crisis it suffered seven years ago .
more and more land previously used for other crops or for pasture is being turned over to the lucrative soya crop , reducing supplies and pushing up prices .
earlier this year farmers nationwide protested against government plans to increase export taxes , mostly on soya .
the four-month protest and the worst drought in a century in argentina 's northern provinces have both had an effect in a country which produces nearly all its own food and imports little .

return to map julia caesar , london , uk despite the uk 's wide variety of shops competing for custom , many here are feeling the pinch .
but , after nine long months of price rises , food inflation seems to be slowing down .
according to the bbc 's food price index compiled by verdict , which tracks the cost of a typical trolley of uk food items , meat and fish products rose by 22.9 % from january to august .
world service food price index global hunger index in full general store-cupboard items , such as tinned foods , registered a 15 % increase and seven items in the survey leapt in price by more than 40 % .
a pack of four croissants , for example , was 47.4 % more expensive and a 125g packet of ham went up by 45.4 % .
another survey shows that fruit and vegetables have seen the biggest price rises - up by 30 % at leading supermarket chains in the uk over the past year .
retailers are blaming poor crop harvests and high supply chain costs .
but at least the shoppers in the uk have choice and they are making the most of it , according to consumer research .
in the last 12 months , 41 % of shoppers have switched to cheaper brands , with two-thirds searching for promotions and deals more often than a year ago .
hard discounters have become more popular too , forcing big-name supermarkets to compete more on price than they used to .
return to map michael bristow , beijing , china those in charge of the chinese economy received some welcome news this summer - inflation fell to its lowest level in more than a year .
earlier in 2008 , prices - particular for basic food items such as pork and eggs - had been rising faster than at any time in the past decade .
chinese people are sensitive to price rises for everyday items shoppers across the county complained that they had cut back on the kind of food purchases they make every day .
it was a worrying time for the chinese leadership .
as in other countries , inflation has sometimes led to street protests in china .
in a keynote speech given to china 's parliament , premier wen jiabao said tackling inflation was top of the government 's agenda .
but even in the midst of this bad news , chinese officials said they were confident that they would get inflation under control .
they claimed the food price rises were the result of temporary supply problems and not because of long-term shortages .
that confidence now seems to have been well-placed .
beijing shoppers say prices are still going up , but more slowly than before .
a senior finance official recently predicted that inflation in china would slow to 3 % in 2009 from a high of 8.7 % earlier this year .
having largely escaped the worst effects of the global financial crisis , economists are urging china to concentrate on turning that prediction into a reality .
and the government will need to , because chinese people remain acutely sensitive to price rises , particularly for everyday items .
return to map liz blunt , addis ababa , ethiopia it is easy to tell when one of the local " kebeles " in addis ababa is selling wheat - residents cluster outside hoping to be able to buy a sack of half-price grain and unemployed youngsters hang around hoping to earn a little money by carrying their sacks .
wheat prices in addis are higher than in other capitals the " kebeles " are a leftover from communist times - part local government offices , part community centres , part instruments of social control .
now the ethiopian government is using them to distribute subsidised wheat .
food prices have more than doubled in the past year here .
it was easy at first to blame world prices , market forces and globalisation .
but , with wheat prices in ethiopia much higher than world prices , it looked as if there would be a lot of profit to be made by importing wheat , yet market forces show no sign of bringing down the price .
the government 's attempts to flood the market have cost a lot but have had little effect .
if you are lucky enough to be at the front of the queue when the wheat arrives , you can buy a 100 kilo sack for 350 birr -lrb- around $ 35 ; 25 euros -rrb- .
but the markets are still selling wheat for 600 or even 700 birr per sack .
not surprisingly , much of the subsidised wheat is taken straight down the road to the market where it is sold for twice the price .
perhaps merchants and farmers are being greedy , but more likely there is just not enough food in the country .
return to map jonathan head , bangkok , thailand rice - the staple crop in this part of asia - reached record prices this year .
even after falling back from highs of around $ 1000 -lrb- 735 euros ; £ 573 -rrb- for a tonne of good quality rice , to $ 600-800 , it is still double what was being paid last year .
rising rice prices have not generated more cash for farmers yet the majority of farmers - who farm small plots of land of three hectares or less - have taken home very little of this bonanza .
the reasons are complex , and vary from country to country , but they underline a simple fact : whereas driving up the price of other smallholder agricultural commodities such as coffee or rubber often does enrich those who work the land , it rarely works that way in the case of rice .
many small rice farmers do not actually grow enough for their families to eat so they still have to buy rice at market prices .
in cambodia , for example , despite the government 's pride in becoming one of the world 's ten largest rice exporters , only a third of rice farmers produce any surplus they can sell - and one fifth of the population does not get enough to eat .
farmers usually have no storage facilities , so they need to sell their rice the moment it is harvested world food prices : what happened ?
this lead to a bizarre situation where the government planned to sell 1.6m tonnes of locally grown rice on world markets this year , but was also forced to ask the asian development bank for a $ 38m food security aid package for cambodians who could not feed themselves .
thailand - the region 's largest exporter - has done well out of rising prices , but its farmers have not as most of the profits have gone to the middlemen .
farmers usually have no storage facilities , so they need to sell their rice the moment it is harvested .
as prices started to ease from their highs in may , almost everyone in the region breathed a sigh of relief .
return to map daniel schweimler , buenos aires , argentina there is no doubt that food prices in argentina are rising - you just need to ask any shopper .
but to get an idea of just how much will depend on who you talk to .
argentina 's official statistics office , the indec , says inflation is under control , at around nine percent a year .
but shoppers , independent economists , newspapers and even some staff at the indec say those figures do not reflect the reality .
prices , they say , are rising at more than 20 % annually .
government measures to control food prices have sparked strikes about one third of the argentine wage goes on food , and meat takes up a fair amount of space in the basket .
argentines are the biggest per capita consumers of beef in the world and the government has worked hard to keep the price down - negotiating with producers and restricting exports .
but soya has become the new argentine beef .
they are n't eating it but exporting it - mostly to china and india .
the little cream bean was , until recently , fetching high prices on world markets and has been the driving force behind argentina 's economic recovery from the crisis it suffered seven years ago .
more and more land previously used for other crops or for pasture is being turned over to the lucrative soya crop , reducing supplies and pushing up prices .
earlier this year farmers nationwide protested against government plans to increase export taxes , mostly on soya .
the four-month protest and the worst drought in a century in argentina 's northern provinces have both had an effect in a country which produces nearly all its own food and imports little .

the rate of price increases seems to have slowed , but many basic foodstuffs like rice and lentils are far more expensive than they were a year ago .
' alarming ' hunger in indian states and that means people on or below the borderline - hundreds of millions of people - are struggling to make ends meet .
in the most extreme cases , severe malnutrition is a life-threatening condition .
there are about eight million children under the age of five in india who are in urgent need of therapeutic feeding and nutritional treatment .
but there are also tens of millions of children who suffer from chronic malnutrition which may not be immediately visible .
they are deprived of many of the nutrients they need to lead healthy productive lives .
in india , the rise in the cost of food has not created a crisis , it has simply made a bad situation worse .
rising inflation has received considerable attention in the indian media , but the recent focus has been on the global financial turmoil , and its impact on indian markets .

chris morris discovers why india 's young people are the hardest hit by high food prices that is of little immediate relevance , though , to the vast majority of people in this country .
what matters is the price of vegetables , the price of flour , and whether there is any work to be had to buy the food they need .
two thirds of india 's population are forced to get by on less than two dollars -lrb- £ 1.15 ; 1.47 euros -rrb- a day .
and the little money they do make now buys less food than it used to .
something has to give .
return to map christian fraser , cairo , egypt inflation in egypt is at a 16-year high with soaring food prices triggering violent protests in some areas of the country this year , prompting the government to raise public sector salaries by 30 % .
but the pay rise was soon followed by increases in prices of fuel , which sent the cost of goods and services even higher .
an egyptian family can spend as much as 80 % of its income on food egyptian economist samir radwan says that while the levels of salaries and subsidies may have risen , " the government 's liberalizing of some other commodity prices means the poor are actually worse off than they were before may " .
many poorer families in cairo - some of whom spend 80 % of their household income on food - have been making savings by cutting their meals from three a day to just two .
egypt is also the world 's largest importer of wheat , which explains why the country has been hit so hard by these international price rises .
finance minister youssef boutros-ghali says a large part of the inflation in his country stems from the higher prices of imported goods .
but he believes that , as the year progresses , things will start to look better .
egypt is the world 's largest importer of wheat , which explains why the country has been hit so hard by these international price rises the wheat egypt has , in the past , bought from russia and ukraine now looks much cheaper .

this lead to a bizarre situation where the government planned to sell 1.6m tonnes of locally grown rice on world markets this year , but was also forced to ask the asian development bank for a $ 38m food security aid package for cambodians who could not feed themselves .
thailand - the region 's largest exporter - has done well out of rising prices , but its farmers have not as most of the profits have gone to the middlemen .

return to map daniel schweimler , buenos aires , argentina there is no doubt that food prices in argentina are rising - you just need to ask any shopper .
but to get an idea of just how much will depend on who you talk to .
argentina 's official statistics office , the indec , says inflation is under control , at around nine percent a year .
but shoppers , independent economists , newspapers and even some staff at the indec say those figures do not reflect the reality .
prices , they say , are rising at more than 20 % annually .
government measures to control food prices have sparked strikes about one third of the argentine wage goes on food , and meat takes up a fair amount of space in the basket .
argentines are the biggest per capita consumers of beef in the world and the government has worked hard to keep the price down - negotiating with producers and restricting exports .
but soya has become the new argentine beef .
they are n't eating it but exporting it - mostly to china and india .
the little cream bean was , until recently , fetching high prices on world markets and has been the driving force behind argentina 's economic recovery from the crisis it suffered seven years ago .
more and more land previously used for other crops or for pasture is being turned over to the lucrative soya crop , reducing supplies and pushing up prices .
earlier this year farmers nationwide protested against government plans to increase export taxes , mostly on soya .
the four-month protest and the worst drought in a century in argentina 's northern provinces have both had an effect in a country which produces nearly all its own food and imports little .

the rate of price increases seems to have slowed , but many basic foodstuffs like rice and lentils are far more expensive than they were a year ago .
' alarming ' hunger in indian states and that means people on or below the borderline - hundreds of millions of people - are struggling to make ends meet .
in the most extreme cases , severe malnutrition is a life-threatening condition .
there are about eight million children under the age of five in india who are in urgent need of therapeutic feeding and nutritional treatment .
but there are also tens of millions of children who suffer from chronic malnutrition which may not be immediately visible .
they are deprived of many of the nutrients they need to lead healthy productive lives .
in india , the rise in the cost of food has not created a crisis , it has simply made a bad situation worse .
rising inflation has received considerable attention in the indian media , but the recent focus has been on the global financial turmoil , and its impact on indian markets .

chris morris discovers why india 's young people are the hardest hit by high food prices that is of little immediate relevance , though , to the vast majority of people in this country .
what matters is the price of vegetables , the price of flour , and whether there is any work to be had to buy the food they need .
two thirds of india 's population are forced to get by on less than two dollars -lrb- £ 1.15 ; 1.47 euros -rrb- a day .
and the little money they do make now buys less food than it used to .
something has to give .
return to map christian fraser , cairo , egypt inflation in egypt is at a 16-year high with soaring food prices triggering violent protests in some areas of the country this year , prompting the government to raise public sector salaries by 30 % .
but the pay rise was soon followed by increases in prices of fuel , which sent the cost of goods and services even higher .
an egyptian family can spend as much as 80 % of its income on food egyptian economist samir radwan says that while the levels of salaries and subsidies may have risen , " the government 's liberalizing of some other commodity prices means the poor are actually worse off than they were before may " .
many poorer families in cairo - some of whom spend 80 % of their household income on food - have been making savings by cutting their meals from three a day to just two .
egypt is also the world 's largest importer of wheat , which explains why the country has been hit so hard by these international price rises .
finance minister youssef boutros-ghali says a large part of the inflation in his country stems from the higher prices of imported goods .
but he believes that , as the year progresses , things will start to look better .
egypt is the world 's largest importer of wheat , which explains why the country has been hit so hard by these international price rises the wheat egypt has , in the past , bought from russia and ukraine now looks much cheaper .
" look at international commodity prices , " he says .
" wheat used to be $ 480 a tonne , it has now fallen to around $ 200 a tonne .
corn is the same .
soybean the same .
edible oils the same .
all of this is bound to translate here .
we will see prices fall . "
return to map julia caesar , london , uk despite the uk 's wide variety of shops competing for custom , many here are feeling the pinch .
but , after nine long months of price rises , food inflation seems to be slowing down .
according to the bbc 's food price index compiled by verdict , which tracks the cost of a typical trolley of uk food items , meat and fish products rose by 22.9 % from january to august .
world service food price index global hunger index in full general store-cupboard items , such as tinned foods , registered a 15 % increase and seven items in the survey leapt in price by more than 40 % .
a pack of four croissants , for example , was 47.4 % more expensive and a 125g packet of ham went up by 45.4 % .
another survey shows that fruit and vegetables have seen the biggest price rises - up by 30 % at leading supermarket chains in the uk over the past year .
retailers are blaming poor crop harvests and high supply chain costs .
but at least the shoppers in the uk have choice and they are making the most of it , according to consumer research .
in the last 12 months , 41 % of shoppers have switched to cheaper brands , with two-thirds searching for promotions and deals more often than a year ago .
hard discounters have become more popular too , forcing big-name supermarkets to compete more on price than they used to .
return to map michael bristow , beijing , china those in charge of the chinese economy received some welcome news this summer - inflation fell to its lowest level in more than a year .
earlier in 2008 , prices - particular for basic food items such as pork and eggs - had been rising faster than at any time in the past decade .
chinese people are sensitive to price rises for everyday items shoppers across the county complained that they had cut back on the kind of food purchases they make every day .
it was a worrying time for the chinese leadership .
as in other countries , inflation has sometimes led to street protests in china .
in a keynote speech given to china 's parliament , premier wen jiabao said tackling inflation was top of the government 's agenda .
but even in the midst of this bad news , chinese officials said they were confident that they would get inflation under control .
they claimed the food price rises were the result of temporary supply problems and not because of long-term shortages .
that confidence now seems to have been well-placed .
beijing shoppers say prices are still going up , but more slowly than before .
a senior finance official recently predicted that inflation in china would slow to 3 % in 2009 from a high of 8.7 % earlier this year .
having largely escaped the worst effects of the global financial crisis , economists are urging china to concentrate on turning that prediction into a reality .
and the government will need to , because chinese people remain acutely sensitive to price rises , particularly for everyday items .
return to map liz blunt , addis ababa , ethiopia it is easy to tell when one of the local " kebeles " in addis ababa is selling wheat - residents cluster outside hoping to be able to buy a sack of half-price grain and unemployed youngsters hang around hoping to earn a little money by carrying their sacks .
wheat prices in addis are higher than in other capitals the " kebeles " are a leftover from communist times - part local government offices , part community centres , part instruments of social control .
now the ethiopian government is using them to distribute subsidised wheat .
food prices have more than doubled in the past year here .
it was easy at first to blame world prices , market forces and globalisation .
but , with wheat prices in ethiopia much higher than world prices , it looked as if there would be a lot of profit to be made by importing wheat , yet market forces show no sign of bringing down the price .
the government 's attempts to flood the market have cost a lot but have had little effect .
if you are lucky enough to be at the front of the queue when the wheat arrives , you can buy a 100 kilo sack for 350 birr -lrb- around $ 35 ; 25 euros -rrb- .
but the markets are still selling wheat for 600 or even 700 birr per sack .
not surprisingly , much of the subsidised wheat is taken straight down the road to the market where it is sold for twice the price .
perhaps merchants and farmers are being greedy , but more likely there is just not enough food in the country .
return to map jonathan head , bangkok , thailand rice - the staple crop in this part of asia - reached record prices this year .
even after falling back from highs of around $ 1000 -lrb- 735 euros ; £ 573 -rrb- for a tonne of good quality rice , to $ 600-800 , it is still double what was being paid last year .
rising rice prices have not generated more cash for farmers yet the majority of farmers - who farm small plots of land of three hectares or less - have taken home very little of this bonanza .
the reasons are complex , and vary from country to country , but they underline a simple fact : whereas driving up the price of other smallholder agricultural commodities such as coffee or rubber often does enrich those who work the land , it rarely works that way in the case of rice .
many small rice farmers do not actually grow enough for their families to eat so they still have to buy rice at market prices .
in cambodia , for example , despite the government 's pride in becoming one of the world 's ten largest rice exporters , only a third of rice farmers produce any surplus they can sell - and one fifth of the population does not get enough to eat .

the rate of price increases seems to have slowed , but many basic foodstuffs like rice and lentils are far more expensive than they were a year ago .
' alarming ' hunger in indian states and that means people on or below the borderline - hundreds of millions of people - are struggling to make ends meet .
in the most extreme cases , severe malnutrition is a life-threatening condition .
there are about eight million children under the age of five in india who are in urgent need of therapeutic feeding and nutritional treatment .
but there are also tens of millions of children who suffer from chronic malnutrition which may not be immediately visible .
they are deprived of many of the nutrients they need to lead healthy productive lives .
in india , the rise in the cost of food has not created a crisis , it has simply made a bad situation worse .
rising inflation has received considerable attention in the indian media , but the recent focus has been on the global financial turmoil , and its impact on indian markets .

chris morris discovers why india 's young people are the hardest hit by high food prices that is of little immediate relevance , though , to the vast majority of people in this country .
what matters is the price of vegetables , the price of flour , and whether there is any work to be had to buy the food they need .
two thirds of india 's population are forced to get by on less than two dollars -lrb- £ 1.15 ; 1.47 euros -rrb- a day .
and the little money they do make now buys less food than it used to .
something has to give .
return to map christian fraser , cairo , egypt inflation in egypt is at a 16-year high with soaring food prices triggering violent protests in some areas of the country this year , prompting the government to raise public sector salaries by 30 % .
but the pay rise was soon followed by increases in prices of fuel , which sent the cost of goods and services even higher .
an egyptian family can spend as much as 80 % of its income on food egyptian economist samir radwan says that while the levels of salaries and subsidies may have risen , " the government 's liberalizing of some other commodity prices means the poor are actually worse off than they were before may " .
many poorer families in cairo - some of whom spend 80 % of their household income on food - have been making savings by cutting their meals from three a day to just two .
egypt is also the world 's largest importer of wheat , which explains why the country has been hit so hard by these international price rises .
finance minister youssef boutros-ghali says a large part of the inflation in his country stems from the higher prices of imported goods .
but he believes that , as the year progresses , things will start to look better .
egypt is the world 's largest importer of wheat , which explains why the country has been hit so hard by these international price rises the wheat egypt has , in the past , bought from russia and ukraine now looks much cheaper .
" look at international commodity prices , " he says .
" wheat used to be $ 480 a tonne , it has now fallen to around $ 200 a tonne .
corn is the same .
soybean the same .
edible oils the same .
all of this is bound to translate here .
we will see prices fall . "
return to map julia caesar , london , uk despite the uk 's wide variety of shops competing for custom , many here are feeling the pinch .
but , after nine long months of price rises , food inflation seems to be slowing down .
according to the bbc 's food price index compiled by verdict , which tracks the cost of a typical trolley of uk food items , meat and fish products rose by 22.9 % from january to august .
world service food price index global hunger index in full general store-cupboard items , such as tinned foods , registered a 15 % increase and seven items in the survey leapt in price by more than 40 % .
a pack of four croissants , for example , was 47.4 % more expensive and a 125g packet of ham went up by 45.4 % .
another survey shows that fruit and vegetables have seen the biggest price rises - up by 30 % at leading supermarket chains in the uk over the past year .
retailers are blaming poor crop harvests and high supply chain costs .
but at least the shoppers in the uk have choice and they are making the most of it , according to consumer research .
in the last 12 months , 41 % of shoppers have switched to cheaper brands , with two-thirds searching for promotions and deals more often than a year ago .
hard discounters have become more popular too , forcing big-name supermarkets to compete more on price than they used to .
return to map michael bristow , beijing , china those in charge of the chinese economy received some welcome news this summer - inflation fell to its lowest level in more than a year .
earlier in 2008 , prices - particular for basic food items such as pork and eggs - had been rising faster than at any time in the past decade .
chinese people are sensitive to price rises for everyday items shoppers across the county complained that they had cut back on the kind of food purchases they make every day .
it was a worrying time for the chinese leadership .
as in other countries , inflation has sometimes led to street protests in china .
in a keynote speech given to china 's parliament , premier wen jiabao said tackling inflation was top of the government 's agenda .
but even in the midst of this bad news , chinese officials said they were confident that they would get inflation under control .
they claimed the food price rises were the result of temporary supply problems and not because of long-term shortages .
that confidence now seems to have been well-placed .
beijing shoppers say prices are still going up , but more slowly than before .
a senior finance official recently predicted that inflation in china would slow to 3 % in 2009 from a high of 8.7 % earlier this year .
having largely escaped the worst effects of the global financial crisis , economists are urging china to concentrate on turning that prediction into a reality .
and the government will need to , because chinese people remain acutely sensitive to price rises , particularly for everyday items .
return to map liz blunt , addis ababa , ethiopia it is easy to tell when one of the local " kebeles " in addis ababa is selling wheat - residents cluster outside hoping to be able to buy a sack of half-price grain and unemployed youngsters hang around hoping to earn a little money by carrying their sacks .
wheat prices in addis are higher than in other capitals the " kebeles " are a leftover from communist times - part local government offices , part community centres , part instruments of social control .
now the ethiopian government is using them to distribute subsidised wheat .
food prices have more than doubled in the past year here .
it was easy at first to blame world prices , market forces and globalisation .
but , with wheat prices in ethiopia much higher than world prices , it looked as if there would be a lot of profit to be made by importing wheat , yet market forces show no sign of bringing down the price .
the government 's attempts to flood the market have cost a lot but have had little effect .
if you are lucky enough to be at the front of the queue when the wheat arrives , you can buy a 100 kilo sack for 350 birr -lrb- around $ 35 ; 25 euros -rrb- .
but the markets are still selling wheat for 600 or even 700 birr per sack .
not surprisingly , much of the subsidised wheat is taken straight down the road to the market where it is sold for twice the price .
perhaps merchants and farmers are being greedy , but more likely there is just not enough food in the country .
return to map jonathan head , bangkok , thailand rice - the staple crop in this part of asia - reached record prices this year .
even after falling back from highs of around $ 1000 -lrb- 735 euros ; £ 573 -rrb- for a tonne of good quality rice , to $ 600-800 , it is still double what was being paid last year .
rising rice prices have not generated more cash for farmers yet the majority of farmers - who farm small plots of land of three hectares or less - have taken home very little of this bonanza .
the reasons are complex , and vary from country to country , but they underline a simple fact : whereas driving up the price of other smallholder agricultural commodities such as coffee or rubber often does enrich those who work the land , it rarely works that way in the case of rice .
many small rice farmers do not actually grow enough for their families to eat so they still have to buy rice at market prices .
in cambodia , for example , despite the government 's pride in becoming one of the world 's ten largest rice exporters , only a third of rice farmers produce any surplus they can sell - and one fifth of the population does not get enough to eat .
farmers usually have no storage facilities , so they need to sell their rice the moment it is harvested world food prices : what happened ?
this lead to a bizarre situation where the government planned to sell 1.6m tonnes of locally grown rice on world markets this year , but was also forced to ask the asian development bank for a $ 38m food security aid package for cambodians who could not feed themselves .
thailand - the region 's largest exporter - has done well out of rising prices , but its farmers have not as most of the profits have gone to the middlemen .
farmers usually have no storage facilities , so they need to sell their rice the moment it is harvested .
as prices started to ease from their highs in may , almost everyone in the region breathed a sigh of relief .
return to map daniel schweimler , buenos aires , argentina there is no doubt that food prices in argentina are rising - you just need to ask any shopper .
but to get an idea of just how much will depend on who you talk to .
argentina 's official statistics office , the indec , says inflation is under control , at around nine percent a year .
but shoppers , independent economists , newspapers and even some staff at the indec say those figures do not reflect the reality .
prices , they say , are rising at more than 20 % annually .
government measures to control food prices have sparked strikes about one third of the argentine wage goes on food , and meat takes up a fair amount of space in the basket .
argentines are the biggest per capita consumers of beef in the world and the government has worked hard to keep the price down - negotiating with producers and restricting exports .
but soya has become the new argentine beef .
they are n't eating it but exporting it - mostly to china and india .
the little cream bean was , until recently , fetching high prices on world markets and has been the driving force behind argentina 's economic recovery from the crisis it suffered seven years ago .
more and more land previously used for other crops or for pasture is being turned over to the lucrative soya crop , reducing supplies and pushing up prices .
earlier this year farmers nationwide protested against government plans to increase export taxes , mostly on soya .
the four-month protest and the worst drought in a century in argentina 's northern provinces have both had an effect in a country which produces nearly all its own food and imports little .

another survey shows that fruit and vegetables have seen the biggest price rises - up by 30 % at leading supermarket chains in the uk over the past year .
retailers are blaming poor crop harvests and high supply chain costs .
but at least the shoppers in the uk have choice and they are making the most of it , according to consumer research .
in the last 12 months , 41 % of shoppers have switched to cheaper brands , with two-thirds searching for promotions and deals more often than a year ago .
hard discounters have become more popular too , forcing big-name supermarkets to compete more on price than they used to .
return to map michael bristow , beijing , china those in charge of the chinese economy received some welcome news this summer - inflation fell to its lowest level in more than a year .
earlier in 2008 , prices - particular for basic food items such as pork and eggs - had been rising faster than at any time in the past decade .
chinese people are sensitive to price rises for everyday items shoppers across the county complained that they had cut back on the kind of food purchases they make every day .
it was a worrying time for the chinese leadership .
as in other countries , inflation has sometimes led to street protests in china .
in a keynote speech given to china 's parliament , premier wen jiabao said tackling inflation was top of the government 's agenda .
but even in the midst of this bad news , chinese officials said they were confident that they would get inflation under control .
they claimed the food price rises were the result of temporary supply problems and not because of long-term shortages .
that confidence now seems to have been well-placed .
beijing shoppers say prices are still going up , but more slowly than before .
a senior finance official recently predicted that inflation in china would slow to 3 % in 2009 from a high of 8.7 % earlier this year .
having largely escaped the worst effects of the global financial crisis , economists are urging china to concentrate on turning that prediction into a reality .
and the government will need to , because chinese people remain acutely sensitive to price rises , particularly for everyday items .
return to map liz blunt , addis ababa , ethiopia it is easy to tell when one of the local " kebeles " in addis ababa is selling wheat - residents cluster outside hoping to be able to buy a sack of half-price grain and unemployed youngsters hang around hoping to earn a little money by carrying their sacks .
wheat prices in addis are higher than in other capitals the " kebeles " are a leftover from communist times - part local government offices , part community centres , part instruments of social control .
now the ethiopian government is using them to distribute subsidised wheat .
food prices have more than doubled in the past year here .
it was easy at first to blame world prices , market forces and globalisation .
but , with wheat prices in ethiopia much higher than world prices , it looked as if there would be a lot of profit to be made by importing wheat , yet market forces show no sign of bringing down the price .
the government 's attempts to flood the market have cost a lot but have had little effect .
if you are lucky enough to be at the front of the queue when the wheat arrives , you can buy a 100 kilo sack for 350 birr -lrb- around $ 35 ; 25 euros -rrb- .
but the markets are still selling wheat for 600 or even 700 birr per sack .
not surprisingly , much of the subsidised wheat is taken straight down the road to the market where it is sold for twice the price .
perhaps merchants and farmers are being greedy , but more likely there is just not enough food in the country .
return to map jonathan head , bangkok , thailand rice - the staple crop in this part of asia - reached record prices this year .
even after falling back from highs of around $ 1000 -lrb- 735 euros ; £ 573 -rrb- for a tonne of good quality rice , to $ 600-800 , it is still double what was being paid last year .
rising rice prices have not generated more cash for farmers yet the majority of farmers - who farm small plots of land of three hectares or less - have taken home very little of this bonanza .
the reasons are complex , and vary from country to country , but they underline a simple fact : whereas driving up the price of other smallholder agricultural commodities such as coffee or rubber often does enrich those who work the land , it rarely works that way in the case of rice .
many small rice farmers do not actually grow enough for their families to eat so they still have to buy rice at market prices .
in cambodia , for example , despite the government 's pride in becoming one of the world 's ten largest rice exporters , only a third of rice farmers produce any surplus they can sell - and one fifth of the population does not get enough to eat .
farmers usually have no storage facilities , so they need to sell their rice the moment it is harvested world food prices : what happened ?
this lead to a bizarre situation where the government planned to sell 1.6m tonnes of locally grown rice on world markets this year , but was also forced to ask the asian development bank for a $ 38m food security aid package for cambodians who could not feed themselves .
thailand - the region 's largest exporter - has done well out of rising prices , but its farmers have not as most of the profits have gone to the middlemen .
farmers usually have no storage facilities , so they need to sell their rice the moment it is harvested .
as prices started to ease from their highs in may , almost everyone in the region breathed a sigh of relief .
return to map daniel schweimler , buenos aires , argentina there is no doubt that food prices in argentina are rising - you just need to ask any shopper .
but to get an idea of just how much will depend on who you talk to .
argentina 's official statistics office , the indec , says inflation is under control , at around nine percent a year .
but shoppers , independent economists , newspapers and even some staff at the indec say those figures do not reflect the reality .
prices , they say , are rising at more than 20 % annually .
government measures to control food prices have sparked strikes about one third of the argentine wage goes on food , and meat takes up a fair amount of space in the basket .
argentines are the biggest per capita consumers of beef in the world and the government has worked hard to keep the price down - negotiating with producers and restricting exports .
but soya has become the new argentine beef .
they are n't eating it but exporting it - mostly to china and india .
the little cream bean was , until recently , fetching high prices on world markets and has been the driving force behind argentina 's economic recovery from the crisis it suffered seven years ago .
more and more land previously used for other crops or for pasture is being turned over to the lucrative soya crop , reducing supplies and pushing up prices .
earlier this year farmers nationwide protested against government plans to increase export taxes , mostly on soya .
the four-month protest and the worst drought in a century in argentina 's northern provinces have both had an effect in a country which produces nearly all its own food and imports little .

bbc news -pipe- special reports -pipe- cost of food : global roundup bbc news / special reports graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 06:57 gmt , thursday , 16 october 2008 07:57 uk cost of food : global roundup full coverage : the cost of food chris morris , delhi , india ordinary indians are facing significantly increased hardship because of the rise in the cost of food .
the rate of price increases seems to have slowed , but many basic foodstuffs like rice and lentils are far more expensive than they were a year ago .
' alarming ' hunger in indian states and that means people on or below the borderline - hundreds of millions of people - are struggling to make ends meet .
in the most extreme cases , severe malnutrition is a life-threatening condition .
there are about eight million children under the age of five in india who are in urgent need of therapeutic feeding and nutritional treatment .
but there are also tens of millions of children who suffer from chronic malnutrition which may not be immediately visible .
they are deprived of many of the nutrients they need to lead healthy productive lives .
in india , the rise in the cost of food has not created a crisis , it has simply made a bad situation worse .
rising inflation has received considerable attention in the indian media , but the recent focus has been on the global financial turmoil , and its impact on indian markets .
that is of little immediate relevance , though , to the vast majority of people in this country .
what matters is the price of vegetables , the price of flour , and whether there is any work to be had to buy the food they need .
two thirds of india 's population are forced to get by on less than two dollars -lrb- £ 1.15 ; 1.47 euros -rrb- a day .
and the little money they do make now buys less food than it used to .
something has to give .
return to map christian fraser , cairo , egypt inflation in egypt is at a 16-year high with soaring food prices triggering violent protests in some areas of the country this year , prompting the government to raise public sector salaries by 30 % .
but the pay rise was soon followed by increases in prices of fuel , which sent the cost of goods and services even higher .
egyptian economist samir radwan says that while the levels of salaries and subsidies may have risen , " the government 's liberalizing of some other commodity prices means the poor are actually worse off than they were before may " .
many poorer families in cairo - some of whom spend 80 % of their household income on food - have been making savings by cutting their meals from three a day to just two .
egypt is also the world 's largest importer of wheat , which explains why the country has been hit so hard by these international price rises .
finance minister youssef boutros-ghali says a large part of the inflation in his country stems from the higher prices of imported goods .
but he believes that , as the year progresses , things will start to look better . "
egypt is the world 's largest importer of wheat , which explains why the country has been hit so hard by these international price rises " the wheat egypt has , in the past , bought from russia and ukraine now looks much cheaper .
" look at international commodity prices , " he says .
" wheat used to be $ 480 a tonne , it has now fallen to around $ 200 a tonne .
corn is the same .
soybean the same .
edible oils the same .
all of this is bound to translate here .
we will see prices fall . "
return to map julia caesar , london , uk despite the uk 's wide variety of shops competing for custom , many here are feeling the pinch .
but , after nine long months of price rises , food inflation seems to be slowing down .
according to the bbc 's food price index compiled by verdict , which tracks the cost of a typical trolley of uk food items , meat and fish products rose by 22.9 % from january to august .
world service food price index global hunger index in full general store-cupboard items , such as tinned foods , registered a 15 % increase and seven items in the survey leapt in price by more than 40 % .
a pack of four croissants , for example , was 47.4 % more expensive and a 125g packet of ham went up by 45.4 % .
