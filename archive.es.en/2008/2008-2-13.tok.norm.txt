bank fees also . to what extent does inflation affect you ? according to the federal institute of statistics , the average inflation was 0.7 percent here in 2007 .
the forecast for 2008 is 1.5 percent because of the petroleum prices and again because banks will rise interest rates . how easy is it for you to get by ? easy because we are dinkies - double income no kids . would an increase in your wages be necessary to make it easier for you to meet you basic needs ? more money is always good , but , at the same time , the tax rate also increases because we have a progressive tax system , not a linear one . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? it 's good that we are not part of the eu .
our unemployment rate is much lower than in the rest of europe and a lot of people are immigrating to switzerland - especially germans - because the taxes are lower .
value-added tax is some 19 to 21 percent in the eu and 2.4 to 7.6 percent in switzerland .

as fears of a recession circle the globe , dw-world.de asked people from seven european countries about their impressions of the cost of living .
the series continues in luxembourg . leonor was born in france and is currently living in luxembourg city where she works as a personal assistant .

here the salaries are good , so we have more possibilities and it 's easy to earn money . how easy is it for you to get by ? for the first time in my life i do n't have a problem at the end of the month , because here the salaries are higher than in other european countries .
of course , the rent and the everyday living are higher too , but still it 's easy to have a good lifestyle . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? in the last few months i 've felt europe is not as strong as it used to be .
when i talk with my friends in france they say it 's becoming harder each day because salaries are blocked but prices are growing . in luxembourg salaries are evaluated through indexation , so when the prices grow 0.5 percent the salaries also grow 0.5 percent .
this usually happens once a year .
however , the problem in luxembourg is that house prices are growing every month and so it becomes difficult to find a flat to rent or to buy on your own .
that 's why most people here share a house . between france and luxembourg the economic issues are different , but still these two small examples show us how difficult it will be for us to keep living in europe and how difficult it will be for foreigners to arrive and work here .
in luxembourg most workers in every sector come from another country . nb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.02.2008 germany 's brockhaus encyclopedia goes online großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brockhaus has been the leader in encyclopedia knowledge in germany the german encyclopedia publisher brockhaus said it would place its reference works on the internet to offset falling revenues .
unlike popular reference work wikipedia , it will be ad-sponsored and professionally edited . it 's the paper death of a classic .
the german publisher brockhaus has been printing its encyclopedias for nearly 200 years , and anyone who 's had the money has boasted a collection of the handsome works on their bookshelves for all the world to admire . but the internet has been a thorn in brockhaus ' side years now , forcing the company to reevaluate its strategy .
the german version of the democratic digital reference work wikipedia has been seen as cutting into brockhaus ' profits . " though official figures are not yet out for 2007 , we can expect losses of around several million euros , " a brockhaus spokesperson said earlier this week . consolidating online bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander bob brockhaus , head of the company the publisher 's management is reviewing ways to reduce costs , which could also include slashing around 50 jobs at the mannheim office .
brockhaus employs nearly 450 people nationwide , around 250 of whom are in mannheim . brockhaus is planning to launch its free encyclopedic portal in mid-april , with the publisher banking on its soundly researched information to set itself apart from wikipedia , which can be edited by all internet users . " brockhaus online will provide relevant , reviewed information from all fields of knowledge , " a press statement said . the brockhaus branch in leipzig , which includes about 60 employees , was transformed into a purely online editorial office last year . brockhaus said it would fund its new internet product through advertising .
the company also intends to create an online service for schools that will be free of advertising . the future is online " market analyses clearly show that customers will research specific information on the internet more and more in the future , " the brockhaus spokesperson said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will wikipedia users head to brockhaus ' ad-supported entries ?
the 21st edition of the brockhaus encyclopedia was likely the last in printed form .
" now , everything will happen online , " the spokesperson said . " but , we will clearly distinguish ourselves from providers like wikipedia , by banking on relevance , accuracy and reliability , " the spokesperson said .
" and , our information can not be manipulated . " the online reference work wikipedia was established in 2001 , with the aim of having internet users themselves create the encyclopedia 's content .
the web site 's democratic nature has made some of its entries on contested subjects prone to manipulation .
several studies have , however , shown that wikipedia 's error rates are on par with those of major encyclopedias . millions of people around the world use the service .
according to wikipedia , 10,000 people regularly write entries in germany alone . donations cover wikipedia 's annual worldwide costs of $ 5 million -lrb- 3.4 million euros -rrb- , most of which is spent on technological equipment and administration . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

civil libertarians argue that the controversial measures infringe on people 's privacy and wo n't fight crime .

opponents to a change in the law fear abuse of human embryos . the german research foundation , which defines itself as a funding organization that promotes public scientific research , in 2007 called for a loosening of restrictions of germany 's stem cell law , which allows scientists to only work with imported cells created before the national stem cell act was adopted in 2002 .
since the request for altering the law , german politicians from all parties have been defining their various stances on the issue . from politicians who completely oppose the use of human embryonic stem cells to others who want german scientists to have unfettered access to these basic building blocks of life , divisions have n't been drawn according to party affiliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-celled human embryo from a fertility clinic the largest group of parliamentarians , which encompasses both social and christian democrats , including german education and research minister annette schavan and german chancellor angela merkel , suggest a one-time change to the jan .
1 , 2002 restriction .
the group proposes that stem lines from embryos created before 2007 should be allowed to be imported into germany . rene roespel , a social democrat and co-initiator of the proposal , said that the number of stem cell lines available to german scientists would then increase from 40 to 500 . behind the scientific curve emphasizing the chances stem cell research offers to combat disease , german scientists have said their research is impaired by the current law and have called on politicians to ease restrictions on embryonic stem cell research . " we are only able to import embryonic cells created before jan .
1 , 2002 , which makes them quite old and we have to assume that many of them are now genetically damaged or no longer stable , " said juergen hescheler , a stem cell expert at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists say they are behind the research curve due to restrictive laws he said that many german scientists are hoping for a change in the law to allow them to import newer cell lines of better quality . " now , scientists are significantly more careful about preparing and cultivating human embryonic cells , so it is internationally accepted that the newer cell lines are much better , " he said . in addition to the questionable quality of pre-2002 imported cells , joerg hacker , vice-president of the german research foundation , said there was another reason for the call in 2007 for a law reform . " there is a risk of punishment of german scientists who work on international projects using stem cells lines from after 2002 , " he explained . currently , scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use post-2002 embryonic cells .
if they do , they run the risk of criminal prosecution at home . stem cell versatility vs. ethical concerns embryonic stem cells can develop into any type of cell , which prompts scientists to believe they offer strong potential for finding cures for diseases such as diabetes , parkinson 's and heart maladies . formerly , the cells could only be extracted by destroying human embryos , which opponents say is equivalent to taking a human life .
germany 's history with nazi medical experiments on humans has also contributed to the national sensitivity with the issue . however , only stem cell lines from " additional " embryos which are not implanted but develop during in vitro fertility treatments come into question under the proposal ; importing lines from embryos generated exclusively for stem cell research remains forbidden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells in a petri dish but even the definition of an embryo itself is a gray area . " there is a clear distinction between pre-embryos and their implantation into the uterus , " said hescheler .
" these -lsb- embryonic cells -rsb- are human material which should be respected , but i do not see them as true embryos with functions and brain or organ development . " he added that " real -lsb- human -rsb- life begins after the acceptance of them by mothers following implantation . " ethics mediators also divided in an opinion piece published in 2007 by germany 's national ethics council , hermann barth argued that the 2002 stem cell law " resulted from a compromise in which both the advocates of comprehensive embryo protection and those in favor of a system oriented towards the freedom of research set aside their own , more far-reaching convictions . " within certain conditions , barth wrote , " this compromise would best be served by opening the door to stem cell research a little wider by means of a prudent amendment of the stem cell law . " the setting of a later cut-off date , albeit in the past , is the appropriate means : it is adequate , takes account of the normative principles of the embryo protection law and conforms to the spirit of the 2002 compromise , " he continued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching stem cells is miles away from applying them in treatments , scientists say other members of the ethics council wrote last year that " a change in the jan .
1 , 2002 cut-off date -lsb- stipulated by the stem cell law -rsb- would essentially mean to endorse the destruction of embryos abroad and to profit from procedures which are banned -lsb- in germany -rsb- by the embryo protection law . " a 1990 embryo protection law prohibits any utilization of embryos that does not serve their preservation .
a logical consequence , those members argued , would then have to include a reevaluation of germany 's embryo protection law . " in this case , it would have to be evaluated whether or not it would not be more consistent to use embryos ... and fertilized eggs , which can no longer be employed for reproduction purposes for research , rather than importing ... cells from abroad , " council members wrote . but until such a debate takes place " it is the import law which is currently under consideration and debate , " hacker stressed . a shift in the debate ironically , advances in science may help to take the heat off the ethical debate .
last november , teams of us and japanese researchers said they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells . on the surface , this could mean that scientists would no longer have to rely on embryonic stem cells . but , cautioned hacker , " these new , reprogrammed cells still have to be compared with real embryonic stem cell lines to see if they function they same way . " shortly after the november announcement of the scientific breakthrough , the german government announced it would double its funding for stem cell research from 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.4 million -rrb- to just under 10 million euros , albeit only for adult stem cells . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he 's better received in germany than anywhere else right now and no one shows as much understanding for israel and its security needs than berlin . but angela merkel 's demonstrative friendship , which differentiates her from her predecessor gerhard schröder , could harm israel more than help it .
she 's supporting israel in the wrong way - a way that wo n't bring peace to the jewish state . " we advocate the two-state solution together with israel , " said merkel before her meeting with olmert .
but , unfortunately , that 's not exactly true .
israel talks about the two-state solution while at the same time doing everything to prevent it . palestinian territory minced , weakened the area where the palestinian state could be formed - less than 25 percent of the palestine that existed during the mandate period - continues to shrink .
the wall has already eaten into palestinian land .
it 's robbing the cities and villages in the west bank of their hinterland , water supply and resources .
it 's destroying the foundation of palestinian society and the prerequisites for a viable palestinian state . even worse , israel 's unrestricted settlement policy is chopping up the future palestinian territory , breaking it into small cantons similar to the south african apartheid state . not only gaza , with its 1.6 million residents , is completely cut off from the outside world .
even cities like bethlehem have been walled in and surrounded by a ring of settlements .
nablus , tulkarm , jenin , ramallah - all these once economically significant palestinian cities have degenerated into poor ghettos whose residents are totally deprived of freedom of movement . the problem is particularly evident in jerusalem , which the israelis call their eternal and indivisible capital and which the palestinians also claim as the capital of their future state . the israeli housing minister recently announced that hundreds of new apartments would be built in palestinian east jerusalem - for israelis , of course , not for the palestinians living in east jerusalem .
they are increasingly pressed for space , were annexed against their will by israel and are treated as second-class citizens at best in the undivided city . two-state solution in need of true supporters what kind of two-state solution , then , does israel support , together with germany ?
where should this palestinian state be formed ?
and how should it become viable ? anyone who cares about israel 's fate has to ask these questions .
those who feel as committed to the existence of the jewish state as the german government does should do everything to stop the two-state solution from being undermined . bettina marx is deutsche welle 's israel expert and formerly worked as a correspondent in tel aviv . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unlike popular reference work wikipedia , it will be ad-sponsored and professionally edited . it 's the paper death of a classic .
the german publisher brockhaus has been printing its encyclopedias for nearly 200 years , and anyone who 's had the money has boasted a collection of the handsome works on their bookshelves for all the world to admire . but the internet has been a thorn in brockhaus ' side years now , forcing the company to reevaluate its strategy .
the german version of the democratic digital reference work wikipedia has been seen as cutting into brockhaus ' profits . " though official figures are not yet out for 2007 , we can expect losses of around several million euros , " a brockhaus spokesperson said earlier this week . consolidating online bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander bob brockhaus , head of the company the publisher 's management is reviewing ways to reduce costs , which could also include slashing around 50 jobs at the mannheim office .
brockhaus employs nearly 450 people nationwide , around 250 of whom are in mannheim . brockhaus is planning to launch its free encyclopedic portal in mid-april , with the publisher banking on its soundly researched information to set itself apart from wikipedia , which can be edited by all internet users . " brockhaus online will provide relevant , reviewed information from all fields of knowledge , " a press statement said . the brockhaus branch in leipzig , which includes about 60 employees , was transformed into a purely online editorial office last year . brockhaus said it would fund its new internet product through advertising .
the company also intends to create an online service for schools that will be free of advertising . the future is online " market analyses clearly show that customers will research specific information on the internet more and more in the future , " the brockhaus spokesperson said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will wikipedia users head to brockhaus ' ad-supported entries ?
the 21st edition of the brockhaus encyclopedia was likely the last in printed form .
" now , everything will happen online , " the spokesperson said . " but , we will clearly distinguish ourselves from providers like wikipedia , by banking on relevance , accuracy and reliability , " the spokesperson said .
" and , our information can not be manipulated . " the online reference work wikipedia was established in 2001 , with the aim of having internet users themselves create the encyclopedia 's content .
the web site 's democratic nature has made some of its entries on contested subjects prone to manipulation .
several studies have , however , shown that wikipedia 's error rates are on par with those of major encyclopedias . millions of people around the world use the service .
according to wikipedia , 10,000 people regularly write entries in germany alone . donations cover wikipedia 's annual worldwide costs of $ 5 million -lrb- 3.4 million euros -rrb- , most of which is spent on technological equipment and administration . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in republishing the cartoon , editors vowed to defend freedom of expression . the act was in response to news on tuesday that police had foiled a murder plot against the cartoonist . " we are doing this to document what is at stake in this case , and to unambiguously back and support the freedom of speech that we as a newspaper will always defend , " wrote the berlingske tidende , which reprinted the cartoon in its wednesday edition . police arrested a danish citizen of moroccan descent and two tunisians on tuesday , who were reportedly planning to murder 73-year-old kurt westergaard , the cartoonist at the danish paper jyllands-posten , which originally published all 12 drawings in september 2005 . mixed views among muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other muslims chose a less violent form of protest stomping on the danish flag two years ago but wednesday 's reprinting has prompted criticism among muslims .

" it will make our young people feel more isolated , " he said .
" the printing of the cartoon is an insult to our intellectual capacity .
we are not against freedom of speech , but we are opposed to continued discrimination of the muslim minority in denmark . " chedid added that his group was considering holding a demonstration in front of the danish parliament , but emphasized that it would be of a peaceful nature .

as fears of a recession circle the globe , dw-world.de asked people from seven european countries about their impressions of the cost of living .
the series continues in luxembourg . leonor was born in france and is currently living in luxembourg city where she works as a personal assistant .
she shares a house in the center of the city with five others . monthly income : 2,300 euros -lrb- $ 3,400 -rrb- rent : 550 euros per month -lrb- $ 813 -rrb- monthly utilities : 50 euros -lrb- $ 73.90 -rrb- bus / metro ticket : 1.30 euros -lrb- $ 1.90 -rrb- one liter milk : 1 euro -lrb- $ 1.48 -rrb- loaf of bread : 0.80 euros -lrb- $ 1.18 -rrb- domestic stamp : 0.50 euros -lrb- $ 0.74 -rrb- movie ticket : 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 12.55 -rrb- to what extent does inflation affect you ? in luxembourg we do n't " feel " inflation like my parents who live in france do for example .
here the salaries are good , so we have more possibilities and it 's easy to earn money . how easy is it for you to get by ? for the first time in my life i do n't have a problem at the end of the month , because here the salaries are higher than in other european countries .
of course , the rent and the everyday living are higher too , but still it 's easy to have a good lifestyle . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? in the last few months i 've felt europe is not as strong as it used to be .
when i talk with my friends in france they say it 's becoming harder each day because salaries are blocked but prices are growing . in luxembourg salaries are evaluated through indexation , so when the prices grow 0.5 percent the salaries also grow 0.5 percent .
this usually happens once a year .
however , the problem in luxembourg is that house prices are growing every month and so it becomes difficult to find a flat to rent or to buy on your own .
that 's why most people here share a house . between france and luxembourg the economic issues are different , but still these two small examples show us how difficult it will be for us to keep living in europe and how difficult it will be for foreigners to arrive and work here .
in luxembourg most workers in every sector come from another country . nb .

as fears of a recession circle the globe , dw-world.de asked people from seven european countries about their impressions of the cost of living .
the series continues in luxembourg . leonor was born in france and is currently living in luxembourg city where she works as a personal assistant .
she shares a house in the center of the city with five others . monthly income : 2,300 euros -lrb- $ 3,400 -rrb- rent : 550 euros per month -lrb- $ 813 -rrb- monthly utilities : 50 euros -lrb- $ 73.90 -rrb- bus / metro ticket : 1.30 euros -lrb- $ 1.90 -rrb- one liter milk : 1 euro -lrb- $ 1.48 -rrb- loaf of bread : 0.80 euros -lrb- $ 1.18 -rrb- domestic stamp : 0.50 euros -lrb- $ 0.74 -rrb- movie ticket : 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 12.55 -rrb- to what extent does inflation affect you ? in luxembourg we do n't " feel " inflation like my parents who live in france do for example .
here the salaries are good , so we have more possibilities and it 's easy to earn money . how easy is it for you to get by ? for the first time in my life i do n't have a problem at the end of the month , because here the salaries are higher than in other european countries .
of course , the rent and the everyday living are higher too , but still it 's easy to have a good lifestyle . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? in the last few months i 've felt europe is not as strong as it used to be .
when i talk with my friends in france they say it 's becoming harder each day because salaries are blocked but prices are growing . in luxembourg salaries are evaluated through indexation , so when the prices grow 0.5 percent the salaries also grow 0.5 percent .
this usually happens once a year .
however , the problem in luxembourg is that house prices are growing every month and so it becomes difficult to find a flat to rent or to buy on your own .
that 's why most people here share a house . between france and luxembourg the economic issues are different , but still these two small examples show us how difficult it will be for us to keep living in europe and how difficult it will be for foreigners to arrive and work here .
in luxembourg most workers in every sector come from another country . nb .

bank fees also . to what extent does inflation affect you ? according to the federal institute of statistics , the average inflation was 0.7 percent here in 2007 .
the forecast for 2008 is 1.5 percent because of the petroleum prices and again because banks will rise interest rates . how easy is it for you to get by ? easy because we are dinkies - double income no kids . would an increase in your wages be necessary to make it easier for you to meet you basic needs ? more money is always good , but , at the same time , the tax rate also increases because we have a progressive tax system , not a linear one . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? it 's good that we are not part of the eu .
our unemployment rate is much lower than in the rest of europe and a lot of people are immigrating to switzerland - especially germans - because the taxes are lower .
value-added tax is some 19 to 21 percent in the eu and 2.4 to 7.6 percent in switzerland .

brussels said the steps are needed to guarantee the free movement of europeans inside the schengen no-borders area . the plan , which was presented on wednesday , feb .
13 , could see eu funds used to develop surveillance equipment like cameras , sensors and pilot-less drones .
civil libertarians argue that the controversial measures infringe on people 's privacy and wo n't fight crime . " secure travel through collective responsibility " but proponents of the plan called the proposals " further building blocks in the often stated aim of the european union to build a space of free and secure travel through collective responsibility and solidarity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opportunities for visa-free travel inside the eu increased in december 2007 the plan would help eu customs , police and justice authorities better manage the estimated 300 million external border crossings each year at europe 's 1,792 designated frontier check points . moreover , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said , the measures would target the biggest category of illegal immigrants in europe : people who over-stay their visas . if the 27 eu nations approve the plans , which the italian commissioner hopes will enter force between 2010 and 2015 , people traveling to europe would be screened for security risks at several levels . to get a short-term visa , they would have to provide biometric and other details to the consulate concerned in their country of residence , which would be entered into the visa information system database . system would troll for expired visas on arrival , this data would be checked with a new entry-exit register that would note the time and place of entry of any non-eu national .
it would then send an alert once their visas expire and no exit has been recorded . the extra security measures could be compensated by accelerated , automated check-in procedures for registered travelers considered safe by consular authorities . " the citizens of the eu have earned our attention , " frattini wrote on his web site .
" we have to keep their daily subway or bus ride from turning into a death zone . " all eu states except britain , ireland , cyprus , romania and bulgaria are part of the borderless area , to which non-eu members norway and iceland also belong . similar to us ports of entry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several of frattini 's security proposals have met with stiff opposition frattini said the register would be similar to the electronic scanning of fingerprints and eyes at us ports of entry and would " make better use of technology . "
biometric security checks are already in place in airports in frankfurt , london and stockholm . the initiative would only come into force upon approval by the european parliament and by member states .
frattini has not said how much he expects the security measures to cost . on top of addressing a potential terrorist threat , officials in brussels said the plan is also geared toward cracking down on the thousands of foreigners who enter the eu on a valid visa but then become illegal immigrants by overstaying their visit . " these people are a main factor behind illegal immigration , " frattini said last month at an informal meeting of eu interior ministers . part of series of new security checks the new system , however , would only record the identities of people who enter the 27-member bloc legally , not the hundreds of thousands estimated to immigrate to the eu illegally each year . frattini 's proposals have come under fire from civil liberties advocates , who say they pose a formidable threat to people 's privacy . " more and more surveillance measures are called for , decided and put in place , but actual security benefits are seen less and less , " wolfgang kreissl-doerfler , a german member of the european parliament , said in a statement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 13.02.2008 german parliament to discuss reforming stem cell law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research grabs the spotlight again some scientists and politicians believe the 2002 law restricting the use of stem cells in german research is no longer in sync with modern medicine .
opponents to a change in the law fear abuse of human embryos . the german research foundation , which defines itself as a funding organization that promotes public scientific research , in 2007 called for a loosening of restrictions of germany 's stem cell law , which allows scientists to only work with imported cells created before the national stem cell act was adopted in 2002 .
since the request for altering the law , german politicians from all parties have been defining their various stances on the issue . from politicians who completely oppose the use of human embryonic stem cells to others who want german scientists to have unfettered access to these basic building blocks of life , divisions have n't been drawn according to party affiliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-celled human embryo from a fertility clinic the largest group of parliamentarians , which encompasses both social and christian democrats , including german education and research minister annette schavan and german chancellor angela merkel , suggest a one-time change to the jan .
1 , 2002 restriction .
the group proposes that stem lines from embryos created before 2007 should be allowed to be imported into germany . rene roespel , a social democrat and co-initiator of the proposal , said that the number of stem cell lines available to german scientists would then increase from 40 to 500 . behind the scientific curve emphasizing the chances stem cell research offers to combat disease , german scientists have said their research is impaired by the current law and have called on politicians to ease restrictions on embryonic stem cell research . " we are only able to import embryonic cells created before jan .
1 , 2002 , which makes them quite old and we have to assume that many of them are now genetically damaged or no longer stable , " said juergen hescheler , a stem cell expert at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists say they are behind the research curve due to restrictive laws he said that many german scientists are hoping for a change in the law to allow them to import newer cell lines of better quality . " now , scientists are significantly more careful about preparing and cultivating human embryonic cells , so it is internationally accepted that the newer cell lines are much better , " he said . in addition to the questionable quality of pre-2002 imported cells , joerg hacker , vice-president of the german research foundation , said there was another reason for the call in 2007 for a law reform . " there is a risk of punishment of german scientists who work on international projects using stem cells lines from after 2002 , " he explained . currently , scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use post-2002 embryonic cells .
if they do , they run the risk of criminal prosecution at home . stem cell versatility vs. ethical concerns embryonic stem cells can develop into any type of cell , which prompts scientists to believe they offer strong potential for finding cures for diseases such as diabetes , parkinson 's and heart maladies . formerly , the cells could only be extracted by destroying human embryos , which opponents say is equivalent to taking a human life .
germany 's history with nazi medical experiments on humans has also contributed to the national sensitivity with the issue . however , only stem cell lines from " additional " embryos which are not implanted but develop during in vitro fertility treatments come into question under the proposal ; importing lines from embryos generated exclusively for stem cell research remains forbidden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells in a petri dish but even the definition of an embryo itself is a gray area . " there is a clear distinction between pre-embryos and their implantation into the uterus , " said hescheler .
" these -lsb- embryonic cells -rsb- are human material which should be respected , but i do not see them as true embryos with functions and brain or organ development . " he added that " real -lsb- human -rsb- life begins after the acceptance of them by mothers following implantation . " ethics mediators also divided in an opinion piece published in 2007 by germany 's national ethics council , hermann barth argued that the 2002 stem cell law " resulted from a compromise in which both the advocates of comprehensive embryo protection and those in favor of a system oriented towards the freedom of research set aside their own , more far-reaching convictions . " within certain conditions , barth wrote , " this compromise would best be served by opening the door to stem cell research a little wider by means of a prudent amendment of the stem cell law . " the setting of a later cut-off date , albeit in the past , is the appropriate means : it is adequate , takes account of the normative principles of the embryo protection law and conforms to the spirit of the 2002 compromise , " he continued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching stem cells is miles away from applying them in treatments , scientists say other members of the ethics council wrote last year that " a change in the jan .
1 , 2002 cut-off date -lsb- stipulated by the stem cell law -rsb- would essentially mean to endorse the destruction of embryos abroad and to profit from procedures which are banned -lsb- in germany -rsb- by the embryo protection law . " a 1990 embryo protection law prohibits any utilization of embryos that does not serve their preservation .
a logical consequence , those members argued , would then have to include a reevaluation of germany 's embryo protection law . " in this case , it would have to be evaluated whether or not it would not be more consistent to use embryos ... and fertilized eggs , which can no longer be employed for reproduction purposes for research , rather than importing ... cells from abroad , " council members wrote . but until such a debate takes place " it is the import law which is currently under consideration and debate , " hacker stressed . a shift in the debate ironically , advances in science may help to take the heat off the ethical debate .
last november , teams of us and japanese researchers said they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells . on the surface , this could mean that scientists would no longer have to rely on embryonic stem cells . but , cautioned hacker , " these new , reprogrammed cells still have to be compared with real embryonic stem cell lines to see if they function they same way . " shortly after the november announcement of the scientific breakthrough , the german government announced it would double its funding for stem cell research from 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.4 million -rrb- to just under 10 million euros , albeit only for adult stem cells . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since the request for altering the law , german politicians from all parties have been defining their various stances on the issue . from politicians who completely oppose the use of human embryonic stem cells to others who want german scientists to have unfettered access to these basic building blocks of life , divisions have n't been drawn according to party affiliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-celled human embryo from a fertility clinic the largest group of parliamentarians , which encompasses both social and christian democrats , including german education and research minister annette schavan and german chancellor angela merkel , suggest a one-time change to the jan .
1 , 2002 restriction .
the group proposes that stem lines from embryos created before 2007 should be allowed to be imported into germany . rene roespel , a social democrat and co-initiator of the proposal , said that the number of stem cell lines available to german scientists would then increase from 40 to 500 . behind the scientific curve emphasizing the chances stem cell research offers to combat disease , german scientists have said their research is impaired by the current law and have called on politicians to ease restrictions on embryonic stem cell research . " we are only able to import embryonic cells created before jan .
1 , 2002 , which makes them quite old and we have to assume that many of them are now genetically damaged or no longer stable , " said juergen hescheler , a stem cell expert at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists say they are behind the research curve due to restrictive laws he said that many german scientists are hoping for a change in the law to allow them to import newer cell lines of better quality . " now , scientists are significantly more careful about preparing and cultivating human embryonic cells , so it is internationally accepted that the newer cell lines are much better , " he said . in addition to the questionable quality of pre-2002 imported cells , joerg hacker , vice-president of the german research foundation , said there was another reason for the call in 2007 for a law reform . " there is a risk of punishment of german scientists who work on international projects using stem cells lines from after 2002 , " he explained . currently , scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use post-2002 embryonic cells .
if they do , they run the risk of criminal prosecution at home . stem cell versatility vs. ethical concerns embryonic stem cells can develop into any type of cell , which prompts scientists to believe they offer strong potential for finding cures for diseases such as diabetes , parkinson 's and heart maladies . formerly , the cells could only be extracted by destroying human embryos , which opponents say is equivalent to taking a human life .
germany 's history with nazi medical experiments on humans has also contributed to the national sensitivity with the issue . however , only stem cell lines from " additional " embryos which are not implanted but develop during in vitro fertility treatments come into question under the proposal ; importing lines from embryos generated exclusively for stem cell research remains forbidden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells in a petri dish but even the definition of an embryo itself is a gray area . " there is a clear distinction between pre-embryos and their implantation into the uterus , " said hescheler .
" these -lsb- embryonic cells -rsb- are human material which should be respected , but i do not see them as true embryos with functions and brain or organ development . " he added that " real -lsb- human -rsb- life begins after the acceptance of them by mothers following implantation . " ethics mediators also divided in an opinion piece published in 2007 by germany 's national ethics council , hermann barth argued that the 2002 stem cell law " resulted from a compromise in which both the advocates of comprehensive embryo protection and those in favor of a system oriented towards the freedom of research set aside their own , more far-reaching convictions . " within certain conditions , barth wrote , " this compromise would best be served by opening the door to stem cell research a little wider by means of a prudent amendment of the stem cell law . " the setting of a later cut-off date , albeit in the past , is the appropriate means : it is adequate , takes account of the normative principles of the embryo protection law and conforms to the spirit of the 2002 compromise , " he continued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching stem cells is miles away from applying them in treatments , scientists say other members of the ethics council wrote last year that " a change in the jan .
1 , 2002 cut-off date -lsb- stipulated by the stem cell law -rsb- would essentially mean to endorse the destruction of embryos abroad and to profit from procedures which are banned -lsb- in germany -rsb- by the embryo protection law . " a 1990 embryo protection law prohibits any utilization of embryos that does not serve their preservation .
a logical consequence , those members argued , would then have to include a reevaluation of germany 's embryo protection law . " in this case , it would have to be evaluated whether or not it would not be more consistent to use embryos ... and fertilized eggs , which can no longer be employed for reproduction purposes for research , rather than importing ... cells from abroad , " council members wrote . but until such a debate takes place " it is the import law which is currently under consideration and debate , " hacker stressed . a shift in the debate ironically , advances in science may help to take the heat off the ethical debate .
last november , teams of us and japanese researchers said they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells . on the surface , this could mean that scientists would no longer have to rely on embryonic stem cells . but , cautioned hacker , " these new , reprogrammed cells still have to be compared with real embryonic stem cell lines to see if they function they same way . " shortly after the november announcement of the scientific breakthrough , the german government announced it would double its funding for stem cell research from 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.4 million -rrb- to just under 10 million euros , albeit only for adult stem cells . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 13.02.2008 german parliament to discuss reforming stem cell law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research grabs the spotlight again some scientists and politicians believe the 2002 law restricting the use of stem cells in german research is no longer in sync with modern medicine .
opponents to a change in the law fear abuse of human embryos . the german research foundation , which defines itself as a funding organization that promotes public scientific research , in 2007 called for a loosening of restrictions of germany 's stem cell law , which allows scientists to only work with imported cells created before the national stem cell act was adopted in 2002 .
since the request for altering the law , german politicians from all parties have been defining their various stances on the issue . from politicians who completely oppose the use of human embryonic stem cells to others who want german scientists to have unfettered access to these basic building blocks of life , divisions have n't been drawn according to party affiliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-celled human embryo from a fertility clinic the largest group of parliamentarians , which encompasses both social and christian democrats , including german education and research minister annette schavan and german chancellor angela merkel , suggest a one-time change to the jan .
1 , 2002 restriction .
the group proposes that stem lines from embryos created before 2007 should be allowed to be imported into germany . rene roespel , a social democrat and co-initiator of the proposal , said that the number of stem cell lines available to german scientists would then increase from 40 to 500 . behind the scientific curve emphasizing the chances stem cell research offers to combat disease , german scientists have said their research is impaired by the current law and have called on politicians to ease restrictions on embryonic stem cell research . " we are only able to import embryonic cells created before jan .
1 , 2002 , which makes them quite old and we have to assume that many of them are now genetically damaged or no longer stable , " said juergen hescheler , a stem cell expert at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists say they are behind the research curve due to restrictive laws he said that many german scientists are hoping for a change in the law to allow them to import newer cell lines of better quality . " now , scientists are significantly more careful about preparing and cultivating human embryonic cells , so it is internationally accepted that the newer cell lines are much better , " he said . in addition to the questionable quality of pre-2002 imported cells , joerg hacker , vice-president of the german research foundation , said there was another reason for the call in 2007 for a law reform . " there is a risk of punishment of german scientists who work on international projects using stem cells lines from after 2002 , " he explained . currently , scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use post-2002 embryonic cells .
if they do , they run the risk of criminal prosecution at home . stem cell versatility vs. ethical concerns embryonic stem cells can develop into any type of cell , which prompts scientists to believe they offer strong potential for finding cures for diseases such as diabetes , parkinson 's and heart maladies . formerly , the cells could only be extracted by destroying human embryos , which opponents say is equivalent to taking a human life .
germany 's history with nazi medical experiments on humans has also contributed to the national sensitivity with the issue . however , only stem cell lines from " additional " embryos which are not implanted but develop during in vitro fertility treatments come into question under the proposal ; importing lines from embryos generated exclusively for stem cell research remains forbidden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells in a petri dish but even the definition of an embryo itself is a gray area . " there is a clear distinction between pre-embryos and their implantation into the uterus , " said hescheler .
" these -lsb- embryonic cells -rsb- are human material which should be respected , but i do not see them as true embryos with functions and brain or organ development . " he added that " real -lsb- human -rsb- life begins after the acceptance of them by mothers following implantation . " ethics mediators also divided in an opinion piece published in 2007 by germany 's national ethics council , hermann barth argued that the 2002 stem cell law " resulted from a compromise in which both the advocates of comprehensive embryo protection and those in favor of a system oriented towards the freedom of research set aside their own , more far-reaching convictions .

in republishing the cartoon , editors vowed to defend freedom of expression . the act was in response to news on tuesday that police had foiled a murder plot against the cartoonist . " we are doing this to document what is at stake in this case , and to unambiguously back and support the freedom of speech that we as a newspaper will always defend , " wrote the berlingske tidende , which reprinted the cartoon in its wednesday edition . police arrested a danish citizen of moroccan descent and two tunisians on tuesday , who were reportedly planning to murder 73-year-old kurt westergaard , the cartoonist at the danish paper jyllands-posten , which originally published all 12 drawings in september 2005 . mixed views among muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other muslims chose a less violent form of protest stomping on the danish flag two years ago but wednesday 's reprinting has prompted criticism among muslims .

" it will make our young people feel more isolated , " he said .
" the printing of the cartoon is an insult to our intellectual capacity .
we are not against freedom of speech , but we are opposed to continued discrimination of the muslim minority in denmark . " chedid added that his group was considering holding a demonstration in front of the danish parliament , but emphasized that it would be of a peaceful nature . " no blood was ever shed in denmark because of this , and no blood will be shed , " chedid said in an interview with the associated press .
" we are trying to calm down people , but let 's see what happens .
let 's open a dialogue . " following the 12 drawings ' original publication in 2005 , rioting continued in some muslim countries through the beginning of 2006 . three danish embassies were attacked and at least 50 people were killed in protests in 2006 in the middle east , africa and asia . since then , several young muslims have been convicted in denmark of planning bomb attacks partly connected to protests against the cartoons . according to reuters , denmark 's security and intelligence service said tuesday 's arrests near aarhus in the western part of the country were made after lengthy surveillance .
the aim was to prevent a murder , which police said was in the early stages of planning . cartoonist still in hiding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoonist and his wife have been under heavy police protection for months danish media reported that the man of moroccan descent had been released but faced preliminary charges .
the two tunisians are to face deportation later this week . one editorialist in the danish paper politiken commented that the murder plot was an attack on denmark 's democratic culture . " regardless of whether jyllands-posten at the time used freedom of speech unwisely and with damaging consequences , the paper deserves unconditional solidarity when it is threatened with terror , " the editorialist wrote , as cited by reuters . " freedom of expression gives you the right to think , to speak and to draw what you like ... no matter how many terrorist plots there are , " an editorial in the berlingske tidende paper noted , as cited by the afp news agency . generally , the danish press has condemned the alleged murder plot against cartoonist westergaard , who has lived in hiding for the past three months . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in republishing the cartoon , editors vowed to defend freedom of expression . the act was in response to news on tuesday that police had foiled a murder plot against the cartoonist . " we are doing this to document what is at stake in this case , and to unambiguously back and support the freedom of speech that we as a newspaper will always defend , " wrote the berlingske tidende , which reprinted the cartoon in its wednesday edition . police arrested a danish citizen of moroccan descent and two tunisians on tuesday , who were reportedly planning to murder 73-year-old kurt westergaard , the cartoonist at the danish paper jyllands-posten , which originally published all 12 drawings in september 2005 . mixed views among muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other muslims chose a less violent form of protest stomping on the danish flag two years ago but wednesday 's reprinting has prompted criticism among muslims . " we believe this is very foolish and does not help building the bridges we need , " imam mostafa chendid , a leading danish muslim cleric , told reuters news service . " it will make our young people feel more isolated , " he said .
" the printing of the cartoon is an insult to our intellectual capacity .
we are not against freedom of speech , but we are opposed to continued discrimination of the muslim minority in denmark . " chedid added that his group was considering holding a demonstration in front of the danish parliament , but emphasized that it would be of a peaceful nature . " no blood was ever shed in denmark because of this , and no blood will be shed , " chedid said in an interview with the associated press .
" we are trying to calm down people , but let 's see what happens .
let 's open a dialogue . " following the 12 drawings ' original publication in 2005 , rioting continued in some muslim countries through the beginning of 2006 . three danish embassies were attacked and at least 50 people were killed in protests in 2006 in the middle east , africa and asia . since then , several young muslims have been convicted in denmark of planning bomb attacks partly connected to protests against the cartoons . according to reuters , denmark 's security and intelligence service said tuesday 's arrests near aarhus in the western part of the country were made after lengthy surveillance .
the aim was to prevent a murder , which police said was in the early stages of planning . cartoonist still in hiding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoonist and his wife have been under heavy police protection for months danish media reported that the man of moroccan descent had been released but faced preliminary charges .
the two tunisians are to face deportation later this week . one editorialist in the danish paper politiken commented that the murder plot was an attack on denmark 's democratic culture . " regardless of whether jyllands-posten at the time used freedom of speech unwisely and with damaging consequences , the paper deserves unconditional solidarity when it is threatened with terror , " the editorialist wrote , as cited by reuters . " freedom of expression gives you the right to think , to speak and to draw what you like ... no matter how many terrorist plots there are , " an editorial in the berlingske tidende paper noted , as cited by the afp news agency . generally , the danish press has condemned the alleged murder plot against cartoonist westergaard , who has lived in hiding for the past three months . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unlike popular reference work wikipedia , it will be ad-sponsored and professionally edited . it 's the paper death of a classic .
the german publisher brockhaus has been printing its encyclopedias for nearly 200 years , and anyone who 's had the money has boasted a collection of the handsome works on their bookshelves for all the world to admire . but the internet has been a thorn in brockhaus ' side years now , forcing the company to reevaluate its strategy .
the german version of the democratic digital reference work wikipedia has been seen as cutting into brockhaus ' profits . " though official figures are not yet out for 2007 , we can expect losses of around several million euros , " a brockhaus spokesperson said earlier this week . consolidating online bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander bob brockhaus , head of the company the publisher 's management is reviewing ways to reduce costs , which could also include slashing around 50 jobs at the mannheim office .
brockhaus employs nearly 450 people nationwide , around 250 of whom are in mannheim . brockhaus is planning to launch its free encyclopedic portal in mid-april , with the publisher banking on its soundly researched information to set itself apart from wikipedia , which can be edited by all internet users . " brockhaus online will provide relevant , reviewed information from all fields of knowledge , " a press statement said . the brockhaus branch in leipzig , which includes about 60 employees , was transformed into a purely online editorial office last year . brockhaus said it would fund its new internet product through advertising .
the company also intends to create an online service for schools that will be free of advertising . the future is online " market analyses clearly show that customers will research specific information on the internet more and more in the future , " the brockhaus spokesperson said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will wikipedia users head to brockhaus ' ad-supported entries ?
the 21st edition of the brockhaus encyclopedia was likely the last in printed form .
" now , everything will happen online , " the spokesperson said . " but , we will clearly distinguish ourselves from providers like wikipedia , by banking on relevance , accuracy and reliability , " the spokesperson said .
" and , our information can not be manipulated . " the online reference work wikipedia was established in 2001 , with the aim of having internet users themselves create the encyclopedia 's content .
the web site 's democratic nature has made some of its entries on contested subjects prone to manipulation .
several studies have , however , shown that wikipedia 's error rates are on par with those of major encyclopedias . millions of people around the world use the service .
according to wikipedia , 10,000 people regularly write entries in germany alone . donations cover wikipedia 's annual worldwide costs of $ 5 million -lrb- 3.4 million euros -rrb- , most of which is spent on technological equipment and administration . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the republication was to protest a plot to murder one of the cartoonists . five major daily danish newspapers , 10 smaller papers and a swedish daily reprinted on wednesday , feb .
13 , one of the 12 drawings of mohammed that a danish paper had published two years ago and which triggered global protests . the drawing was a caricature of the prophet , whose head was adorned with a turban that looked like a bomb with a lit fuse .
in republishing the cartoon , editors vowed to defend freedom of expression . the act was in response to news on tuesday that police had foiled a murder plot against the cartoonist . " we are doing this to document what is at stake in this case , and to unambiguously back and support the freedom of speech that we as a newspaper will always defend , " wrote the berlingske tidende , which reprinted the cartoon in its wednesday edition . police arrested a danish citizen of moroccan descent and two tunisians on tuesday , who were reportedly planning to murder 73-year-old kurt westergaard , the cartoonist at the danish paper jyllands-posten , which originally published all 12 drawings in september 2005 . mixed views among muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other muslims chose a less violent form of protest stomping on the danish flag two years ago but wednesday 's reprinting has prompted criticism among muslims . " we believe this is very foolish and does not help building the bridges we need , " imam mostafa chendid , a leading danish muslim cleric , told reuters news service . " it will make our young people feel more isolated , " he said .
" the printing of the cartoon is an insult to our intellectual capacity .
we are not against freedom of speech , but we are opposed to continued discrimination of the muslim minority in denmark . " chedid added that his group was considering holding a demonstration in front of the danish parliament , but emphasized that it would be of a peaceful nature . " no blood was ever shed in denmark because of this , and no blood will be shed , " chedid said in an interview with the associated press .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 13.02.2008 german parliament to discuss reforming stem cell law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research grabs the spotlight again some scientists and politicians believe the 2002 law restricting the use of stem cells in german research is no longer in sync with modern medicine .
opponents to a change in the law fear abuse of human embryos . the german research foundation , which defines itself as a funding organization that promotes public scientific research , in 2007 called for a loosening of restrictions of germany 's stem cell law , which allows scientists to only work with imported cells created before the national stem cell act was adopted in 2002 .
since the request for altering the law , german politicians from all parties have been defining their various stances on the issue . from politicians who completely oppose the use of human embryonic stem cells to others who want german scientists to have unfettered access to these basic building blocks of life , divisions have n't been drawn according to party affiliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-celled human embryo from a fertility clinic the largest group of parliamentarians , which encompasses both social and christian democrats , including german education and research minister annette schavan and german chancellor angela merkel , suggest a one-time change to the jan .
1 , 2002 restriction .
the group proposes that stem lines from embryos created before 2007 should be allowed to be imported into germany . rene roespel , a social democrat and co-initiator of the proposal , said that the number of stem cell lines available to german scientists would then increase from 40 to 500 . behind the scientific curve emphasizing the chances stem cell research offers to combat disease , german scientists have said their research is impaired by the current law and have called on politicians to ease restrictions on embryonic stem cell research . " we are only able to import embryonic cells created before jan .
1 , 2002 , which makes them quite old and we have to assume that many of them are now genetically damaged or no longer stable , " said juergen hescheler , a stem cell expert at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists say they are behind the research curve due to restrictive laws he said that many german scientists are hoping for a change in the law to allow them to import newer cell lines of better quality . " now , scientists are significantly more careful about preparing and cultivating human embryonic cells , so it is internationally accepted that the newer cell lines are much better , " he said . in addition to the questionable quality of pre-2002 imported cells , joerg hacker , vice-president of the german research foundation , said there was another reason for the call in 2007 for a law reform . " there is a risk of punishment of german scientists who work on international projects using stem cells lines from after 2002 , " he explained . currently , scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use post-2002 embryonic cells .
if they do , they run the risk of criminal prosecution at home . stem cell versatility vs. ethical concerns embryonic stem cells can develop into any type of cell , which prompts scientists to believe they offer strong potential for finding cures for diseases such as diabetes , parkinson 's and heart maladies . formerly , the cells could only be extracted by destroying human embryos , which opponents say is equivalent to taking a human life .
germany 's history with nazi medical experiments on humans has also contributed to the national sensitivity with the issue . however , only stem cell lines from " additional " embryos which are not implanted but develop during in vitro fertility treatments come into question under the proposal ; importing lines from embryos generated exclusively for stem cell research remains forbidden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells in a petri dish but even the definition of an embryo itself is a gray area . " there is a clear distinction between pre-embryos and their implantation into the uterus , " said hescheler .
" these -lsb- embryonic cells -rsb- are human material which should be respected , but i do not see them as true embryos with functions and brain or organ development . " he added that " real -lsb- human -rsb- life begins after the acceptance of them by mothers following implantation . " ethics mediators also divided in an opinion piece published in 2007 by germany 's national ethics council , hermann barth argued that the 2002 stem cell law " resulted from a compromise in which both the advocates of comprehensive embryo protection and those in favor of a system oriented towards the freedom of research set aside their own , more far-reaching convictions . " within certain conditions , barth wrote , " this compromise would best be served by opening the door to stem cell research a little wider by means of a prudent amendment of the stem cell law . " the setting of a later cut-off date , albeit in the past , is the appropriate means : it is adequate , takes account of the normative principles of the embryo protection law and conforms to the spirit of the 2002 compromise , " he continued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching stem cells is miles away from applying them in treatments , scientists say other members of the ethics council wrote last year that " a change in the jan .
1 , 2002 cut-off date -lsb- stipulated by the stem cell law -rsb- would essentially mean to endorse the destruction of embryos abroad and to profit from procedures which are banned -lsb- in germany -rsb- by the embryo protection law . " a 1990 embryo protection law prohibits any utilization of embryos that does not serve their preservation .
a logical consequence , those members argued , would then have to include a reevaluation of germany 's embryo protection law . " in this case , it would have to be evaluated whether or not it would not be more consistent to use embryos ... and fertilized eggs , which can no longer be employed for reproduction purposes for research , rather than importing ... cells from abroad , " council members wrote . but until such a debate takes place " it is the import law which is currently under consideration and debate , " hacker stressed . a shift in the debate ironically , advances in science may help to take the heat off the ethical debate .
last november , teams of us and japanese researchers said they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells . on the surface , this could mean that scientists would no longer have to rely on embryonic stem cells . but , cautioned hacker , " these new , reprogrammed cells still have to be compared with real embryonic stem cell lines to see if they function they same way . " shortly after the november announcement of the scientific breakthrough , the german government announced it would double its funding for stem cell research from 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.4 million -rrb- to just under 10 million euros , albeit only for adult stem cells . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the group proposes that stem lines from embryos created before 2007 should be allowed to be imported into germany . rene roespel , a social democrat and co-initiator of the proposal , said that the number of stem cell lines available to german scientists would then increase from 40 to 500 . behind the scientific curve emphasizing the chances stem cell research offers to combat disease , german scientists have said their research is impaired by the current law and have called on politicians to ease restrictions on embryonic stem cell research . " we are only able to import embryonic cells created before jan .
1 , 2002 , which makes them quite old and we have to assume that many of them are now genetically damaged or no longer stable , " said juergen hescheler , a stem cell expert at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists say they are behind the research curve due to restrictive laws he said that many german scientists are hoping for a change in the law to allow them to import newer cell lines of better quality . " now , scientists are significantly more careful about preparing and cultivating human embryonic cells , so it is internationally accepted that the newer cell lines are much better , " he said . in addition to the questionable quality of pre-2002 imported cells , joerg hacker , vice-president of the german research foundation , said there was another reason for the call in 2007 for a law reform . " there is a risk of punishment of german scientists who work on international projects using stem cells lines from after 2002 , " he explained . currently , scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use post-2002 embryonic cells .
if they do , they run the risk of criminal prosecution at home . stem cell versatility vs. ethical concerns embryonic stem cells can develop into any type of cell , which prompts scientists to believe they offer strong potential for finding cures for diseases such as diabetes , parkinson 's and heart maladies . formerly , the cells could only be extracted by destroying human embryos , which opponents say is equivalent to taking a human life .
germany 's history with nazi medical experiments on humans has also contributed to the national sensitivity with the issue . however , only stem cell lines from " additional " embryos which are not implanted but develop during in vitro fertility treatments come into question under the proposal ; importing lines from embryos generated exclusively for stem cell research remains forbidden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells in a petri dish but even the definition of an embryo itself is a gray area . " there is a clear distinction between pre-embryos and their implantation into the uterus , " said hescheler .
" these -lsb- embryonic cells -rsb- are human material which should be respected , but i do not see them as true embryos with functions and brain or organ development . " he added that " real -lsb- human -rsb- life begins after the acceptance of them by mothers following implantation . " ethics mediators also divided in an opinion piece published in 2007 by germany 's national ethics council , hermann barth argued that the 2002 stem cell law " resulted from a compromise in which both the advocates of comprehensive embryo protection and those in favor of a system oriented towards the freedom of research set aside their own , more far-reaching convictions . " within certain conditions , barth wrote , " this compromise would best be served by opening the door to stem cell research a little wider by means of a prudent amendment of the stem cell law . " the setting of a later cut-off date , albeit in the past , is the appropriate means : it is adequate , takes account of the normative principles of the embryo protection law and conforms to the spirit of the 2002 compromise , " he continued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching stem cells is miles away from applying them in treatments , scientists say other members of the ethics council wrote last year that " a change in the jan .
1 , 2002 cut-off date -lsb- stipulated by the stem cell law -rsb- would essentially mean to endorse the destruction of embryos abroad and to profit from procedures which are banned -lsb- in germany -rsb- by the embryo protection law . " a 1990 embryo protection law prohibits any utilization of embryos that does not serve their preservation .
a logical consequence , those members argued , would then have to include a reevaluation of germany 's embryo protection law . " in this case , it would have to be evaluated whether or not it would not be more consistent to use embryos ... and fertilized eggs , which can no longer be employed for reproduction purposes for research , rather than importing ... cells from abroad , " council members wrote . but until such a debate takes place " it is the import law which is currently under consideration and debate , " hacker stressed . a shift in the debate ironically , advances in science may help to take the heat off the ethical debate .
last november , teams of us and japanese researchers said they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells . on the surface , this could mean that scientists would no longer have to rely on embryonic stem cells . but , cautioned hacker , " these new , reprogrammed cells still have to be compared with real embryonic stem cell lines to see if they function they same way . " shortly after the november announcement of the scientific breakthrough , the german government announced it would double its funding for stem cell research from 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.4 million -rrb- to just under 10 million euros , albeit only for adult stem cells . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opponents to a change in the law fear abuse of human embryos . the german research foundation , which defines itself as a funding organization that promotes public scientific research , in 2007 called for a loosening of restrictions of germany 's stem cell law , which allows scientists to only work with imported cells created before the national stem cell act was adopted in 2002 .

he 's better received in germany than anywhere else right now and no one shows as much understanding for israel and its security needs than berlin . but angela merkel 's demonstrative friendship , which differentiates her from her predecessor gerhard schröder , could harm israel more than help it .
she 's supporting israel in the wrong way - a way that wo n't bring peace to the jewish state . " we advocate the two-state solution together with israel , " said merkel before her meeting with olmert .
but , unfortunately , that 's not exactly true .
israel talks about the two-state solution while at the same time doing everything to prevent it . palestinian territory minced , weakened the area where the palestinian state could be formed - less than 25 percent of the palestine that existed during the mandate period - continues to shrink .
the wall has already eaten into palestinian land .
it 's robbing the cities and villages in the west bank of their hinterland , water supply and resources .
it 's destroying the foundation of palestinian society and the prerequisites for a viable palestinian state . even worse , israel 's unrestricted settlement policy is chopping up the future palestinian territory , breaking it into small cantons similar to the south african apartheid state . not only gaza , with its 1.6 million residents , is completely cut off from the outside world .
even cities like bethlehem have been walled in and surrounded by a ring of settlements .
nablus , tulkarm , jenin , ramallah - all these once economically significant palestinian cities have degenerated into poor ghettos whose residents are totally deprived of freedom of movement . the problem is particularly evident in jerusalem , which the israelis call their eternal and indivisible capital and which the palestinians also claim as the capital of their future state . the israeli housing minister recently announced that hundreds of new apartments would be built in palestinian east jerusalem - for israelis , of course , not for the palestinians living in east jerusalem .
they are increasingly pressed for space , were annexed against their will by israel and are treated as second-class citizens at best in the undivided city . two-state solution in need of true supporters what kind of two-state solution , then , does israel support , together with germany ?
where should this palestinian state be formed ?
and how should it become viable ? anyone who cares about israel 's fate has to ask these questions .
those who feel as committed to the existence of the jewish state as the german government does should do everything to stop the two-state solution from being undermined . bettina marx is deutsche welle 's israel expert and formerly worked as a correspondent in tel aviv . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are more than three times richer than the european union average , as measured by gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- per inhabitant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is rich in waterways - and money the poorest members of the eu were all found in parts of romania , bulgaria and poland , where wealth is less than a third of the bloc 's average .

the study was released by eurostat , the eu 's statistical office .
results confirmed studies carried out in previous years .
central london tops the list average gdp per head in central london is estimated at 67,798 euros -lrb- about $ 98,600 -rrb- , some 303 percent of the eu average of 22,400 euros .
by contrast , the eu 's poorest citizens , who live in northeast romania , have to make do with average gdp per head levels of just 7,542 euros - just 24 percent of the eu average .

hamburg represented the fourth-richest area in the entire eu , at 202 percent of the average gdp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 13.02.2008 german parliament to discuss reforming stem cell law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research grabs the spotlight again some scientists and politicians believe the 2002 law restricting the use of stem cells in german research is no longer in sync with modern medicine .
opponents to a change in the law fear abuse of human embryos . the german research foundation , which defines itself as a funding organization that promotes public scientific research , in 2007 called for a loosening of restrictions of germany 's stem cell law , which allows scientists to only work with imported cells created before the national stem cell act was adopted in 2002 .
since the request for altering the law , german politicians from all parties have been defining their various stances on the issue . from politicians who completely oppose the use of human embryonic stem cells to others who want german scientists to have unfettered access to these basic building blocks of life , divisions have n't been drawn according to party affiliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-celled human embryo from a fertility clinic the largest group of parliamentarians , which encompasses both social and christian democrats , including german education and research minister annette schavan and german chancellor angela merkel , suggest a one-time change to the jan .
1 , 2002 restriction .
the group proposes that stem lines from embryos created before 2007 should be allowed to be imported into germany . rene roespel , a social democrat and co-initiator of the proposal , said that the number of stem cell lines available to german scientists would then increase from 40 to 500 . behind the scientific curve emphasizing the chances stem cell research offers to combat disease , german scientists have said their research is impaired by the current law and have called on politicians to ease restrictions on embryonic stem cell research . " we are only able to import embryonic cells created before jan .
1 , 2002 , which makes them quite old and we have to assume that many of them are now genetically damaged or no longer stable , " said juergen hescheler , a stem cell expert at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists say they are behind the research curve due to restrictive laws he said that many german scientists are hoping for a change in the law to allow them to import newer cell lines of better quality . " now , scientists are significantly more careful about preparing and cultivating human embryonic cells , so it is internationally accepted that the newer cell lines are much better , " he said . in addition to the questionable quality of pre-2002 imported cells , joerg hacker , vice-president of the german research foundation , said there was another reason for the call in 2007 for a law reform . " there is a risk of punishment of german scientists who work on international projects using stem cells lines from after 2002 , " he explained . currently , scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use post-2002 embryonic cells .
if they do , they run the risk of criminal prosecution at home . stem cell versatility vs. ethical concerns embryonic stem cells can develop into any type of cell , which prompts scientists to believe they offer strong potential for finding cures for diseases such as diabetes , parkinson 's and heart maladies . formerly , the cells could only be extracted by destroying human embryos , which opponents say is equivalent to taking a human life .
germany 's history with nazi medical experiments on humans has also contributed to the national sensitivity with the issue . however , only stem cell lines from " additional " embryos which are not implanted but develop during in vitro fertility treatments come into question under the proposal ; importing lines from embryos generated exclusively for stem cell research remains forbidden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells in a petri dish but even the definition of an embryo itself is a gray area . " there is a clear distinction between pre-embryos and their implantation into the uterus , " said hescheler .
" these -lsb- embryonic cells -rsb- are human material which should be respected , but i do not see them as true embryos with functions and brain or organ development . " he added that " real -lsb- human -rsb- life begins after the acceptance of them by mothers following implantation . " ethics mediators also divided in an opinion piece published in 2007 by germany 's national ethics council , hermann barth argued that the 2002 stem cell law " resulted from a compromise in which both the advocates of comprehensive embryo protection and those in favor of a system oriented towards the freedom of research set aside their own , more far-reaching convictions . " within certain conditions , barth wrote , " this compromise would best be served by opening the door to stem cell research a little wider by means of a prudent amendment of the stem cell law . " the setting of a later cut-off date , albeit in the past , is the appropriate means : it is adequate , takes account of the normative principles of the embryo protection law and conforms to the spirit of the 2002 compromise , " he continued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching stem cells is miles away from applying them in treatments , scientists say other members of the ethics council wrote last year that " a change in the jan .
1 , 2002 cut-off date -lsb- stipulated by the stem cell law -rsb- would essentially mean to endorse the destruction of embryos abroad and to profit from procedures which are banned -lsb- in germany -rsb- by the embryo protection law . " a 1990 embryo protection law prohibits any utilization of embryos that does not serve their preservation .
a logical consequence , those members argued , would then have to include a reevaluation of germany 's embryo protection law . " in this case , it would have to be evaluated whether or not it would not be more consistent to use embryos ... and fertilized eggs , which can no longer be employed for reproduction purposes for research , rather than importing ... cells from abroad , " council members wrote . but until such a debate takes place " it is the import law which is currently under consideration and debate , " hacker stressed . a shift in the debate ironically , advances in science may help to take the heat off the ethical debate .
last november , teams of us and japanese researchers said they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells . on the surface , this could mean that scientists would no longer have to rely on embryonic stem cells . but , cautioned hacker , " these new , reprogrammed cells still have to be compared with real embryonic stem cell lines to see if they function they same way . " shortly after the november announcement of the scientific breakthrough , the german government announced it would double its funding for stem cell research from 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.4 million -rrb- to just under 10 million euros , albeit only for adult stem cells . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is a clear distinction between pre-embryos and their implantation into the uterus , " said hescheler .
" these -lsb- embryonic cells -rsb- are human material which should be respected , but i do not see them as true embryos with functions and brain or organ development . " he added that " real -lsb- human -rsb- life begins after the acceptance of them by mothers following implantation . " ethics mediators also divided in an opinion piece published in 2007 by germany 's national ethics council , hermann barth argued that the 2002 stem cell law " resulted from a compromise in which both the advocates of comprehensive embryo protection and those in favor of a system oriented towards the freedom of research set aside their own , more far-reaching convictions . " within certain conditions , barth wrote , " this compromise would best be served by opening the door to stem cell research a little wider by means of a prudent amendment of the stem cell law . " the setting of a later cut-off date , albeit in the past , is the appropriate means : it is adequate , takes account of the normative principles of the embryo protection law and conforms to the spirit of the 2002 compromise , " he continued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching stem cells is miles away from applying them in treatments , scientists say other members of the ethics council wrote last year that " a change in the jan .
1 , 2002 cut-off date -lsb- stipulated by the stem cell law -rsb- would essentially mean to endorse the destruction of embryos abroad and to profit from procedures which are banned -lsb- in germany -rsb- by the embryo protection law . " a 1990 embryo protection law prohibits any utilization of embryos that does not serve their preservation .
a logical consequence , those members argued , would then have to include a reevaluation of germany 's embryo protection law . " in this case , it would have to be evaluated whether or not it would not be more consistent to use embryos ... and fertilized eggs , which can no longer be employed for reproduction purposes for research , rather than importing ... cells from abroad , " council members wrote . but until such a debate takes place " it is the import law which is currently under consideration and debate , " hacker stressed . a shift in the debate ironically , advances in science may help to take the heat off the ethical debate .
last november , teams of us and japanese researchers said they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells . on the surface , this could mean that scientists would no longer have to rely on embryonic stem cells . but , cautioned hacker , " these new , reprogrammed cells still have to be compared with real embryonic stem cell lines to see if they function they same way . " shortly after the november announcement of the scientific breakthrough , the german government announced it would double its funding for stem cell research from 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.4 million -rrb- to just under 10 million euros , albeit only for adult stem cells . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just make it efficient , italian says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grillo , who goads politicians , has been called the michael moore of italy would italy really trade " la dolce vita " for a dose of teutonic efficiency ?
one outspoken italian comedian thinks the remedy for his country 's ills lies in a good , old-fashioned military takeover . " take my country - please ! " in a twist on henny youngman 's comic one-liner , a beloved italian comedian satirically appealed to germany to do something it has done repeatedly in the past : launch an invasion . " italy is appealing to the fraternal germans : please declare war on us ! " pleaded stand-up comic beppe grillo .
" we 'll be happy to surrender .
you 're our last hope . neapolitan garbage heads to bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash piled up on naples streets when dumps were full " we are already sending you garbage from campania -lsb- the naples region -rsb- .
please take away our politicians too .
we 'll pay you well to do so ! "
grillo said . the comedian was referring to a deal struck last year between italy and germany that has seen garbage from naples is being carted by train to bremen for incineration , as part of a one-off effort to ease weeks-old waste build-up in the italian city . and , of course , grillo - sometimes referred to as " italy 's michael moore " - he was putting a slight twist on his usual shtick , which is based on poking fun at chaos and corruption in italian life . sixty governments , and counting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elections are a snap if you own the media grillo made his comments - which played off the stereotypes of germans as being über-organized and militarily avaricious , as well as the italian penchant for toppling and building governments at the drop of a hat - in an interview with german newsweekly die zeit .
the interviewer had asked for his two cents on the latest collapse of the italian government and the resignation of prime minister romano prodi . grillo , who has been banned from italian tv but plays live to large audiences in big italian venues , reserved especially scathing remarks for opposition leader and former government head silvio berlusconi .
the media mogul , who owns three major television channels and italy 's biggest publishing group , is seeking a comeback in the april general election . the bliss of being berlusconi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could italians live with german cuisine ?
german chancellor angela merkel ought to think about becoming a media magnate herself , grillo said . " if merkel had three channels and 40 newspapers and magazines , she would not need to form a grand coalition , " grillo said .
" she would just get 80 percent of the votes at every election .
why do n't you suggest this to merkel ? " no word form grillo on whether the benefits of a possible teutonic takeover - ostensibly , a responsive democracy and efficient public service - would outweigh the culinary and lifestyle negatives . sauerkraut instead of spaghetti ? beer over barolo ? more pretzels than pancetta ?

unlike popular reference work wikipedia , it will be ad-sponsored and professionally edited . it 's the paper death of a classic .
the german publisher brockhaus has been printing its encyclopedias for nearly 200 years , and anyone who 's had the money has boasted a collection of the handsome works on their bookshelves for all the world to admire . but the internet has been a thorn in brockhaus ' side years now , forcing the company to reevaluate its strategy .
the german version of the democratic digital reference work wikipedia has been seen as cutting into brockhaus ' profits . " though official figures are not yet out for 2007 , we can expect losses of around several million euros , " a brockhaus spokesperson said earlier this week . consolidating online bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander bob brockhaus , head of the company the publisher 's management is reviewing ways to reduce costs , which could also include slashing around 50 jobs at the mannheim office .
brockhaus employs nearly 450 people nationwide , around 250 of whom are in mannheim . brockhaus is planning to launch its free encyclopedic portal in mid-april , with the publisher banking on its soundly researched information to set itself apart from wikipedia , which can be edited by all internet users . " brockhaus online will provide relevant , reviewed information from all fields of knowledge , " a press statement said . the brockhaus branch in leipzig , which includes about 60 employees , was transformed into a purely online editorial office last year . brockhaus said it would fund its new internet product through advertising .
the company also intends to create an online service for schools that will be free of advertising . the future is online " market analyses clearly show that customers will research specific information on the internet more and more in the future , " the brockhaus spokesperson said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will wikipedia users head to brockhaus ' ad-supported entries ?
the 21st edition of the brockhaus encyclopedia was likely the last in printed form .
" now , everything will happen online , " the spokesperson said . " but , we will clearly distinguish ourselves from providers like wikipedia , by banking on relevance , accuracy and reliability , " the spokesperson said .
" and , our information can not be manipulated . " the online reference work wikipedia was established in 2001 , with the aim of having internet users themselves create the encyclopedia 's content .
the web site 's democratic nature has made some of its entries on contested subjects prone to manipulation .
several studies have , however , shown that wikipedia 's error rates are on par with those of major encyclopedias . millions of people around the world use the service .
according to wikipedia , 10,000 people regularly write entries in germany alone . donations cover wikipedia 's annual worldwide costs of $ 5 million -lrb- 3.4 million euros -rrb- , most of which is spent on technological equipment and administration . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opponents to a change in the law fear abuse of human embryos . the german research foundation , which defines itself as a funding organization that promotes public scientific research , in 2007 called for a loosening of restrictions of germany 's stem cell law , which allows scientists to only work with imported cells created before the national stem cell act was adopted in 2002 .
since the request for altering the law , german politicians from all parties have been defining their various stances on the issue . from politicians who completely oppose the use of human embryonic stem cells to others who want german scientists to have unfettered access to these basic building blocks of life , divisions have n't been drawn according to party affiliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-celled human embryo from a fertility clinic the largest group of parliamentarians , which encompasses both social and christian democrats , including german education and research minister annette schavan and german chancellor angela merkel , suggest a one-time change to the jan .
1 , 2002 restriction .
the group proposes that stem lines from embryos created before 2007 should be allowed to be imported into germany . rene roespel , a social democrat and co-initiator of the proposal , said that the number of stem cell lines available to german scientists would then increase from 40 to 500 . behind the scientific curve emphasizing the chances stem cell research offers to combat disease , german scientists have said their research is impaired by the current law and have called on politicians to ease restrictions on embryonic stem cell research . " we are only able to import embryonic cells created before jan .
1 , 2002 , which makes them quite old and we have to assume that many of them are now genetically damaged or no longer stable , " said juergen hescheler , a stem cell expert at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists say they are behind the research curve due to restrictive laws he said that many german scientists are hoping for a change in the law to allow them to import newer cell lines of better quality . " now , scientists are significantly more careful about preparing and cultivating human embryonic cells , so it is internationally accepted that the newer cell lines are much better , " he said . in addition to the questionable quality of pre-2002 imported cells , joerg hacker , vice-president of the german research foundation , said there was another reason for the call in 2007 for a law reform . " there is a risk of punishment of german scientists who work on international projects using stem cells lines from after 2002 , " he explained . currently , scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use post-2002 embryonic cells .
if they do , they run the risk of criminal prosecution at home . stem cell versatility vs. ethical concerns embryonic stem cells can develop into any type of cell , which prompts scientists to believe they offer strong potential for finding cures for diseases such as diabetes , parkinson 's and heart maladies . formerly , the cells could only be extracted by destroying human embryos , which opponents say is equivalent to taking a human life .
germany 's history with nazi medical experiments on humans has also contributed to the national sensitivity with the issue . however , only stem cell lines from " additional " embryos which are not implanted but develop during in vitro fertility treatments come into question under the proposal ; importing lines from embryos generated exclusively for stem cell research remains forbidden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells in a petri dish but even the definition of an embryo itself is a gray area . " there is a clear distinction between pre-embryos and their implantation into the uterus , " said hescheler .
" these -lsb- embryonic cells -rsb- are human material which should be respected , but i do not see them as true embryos with functions and brain or organ development . " he added that " real -lsb- human -rsb- life begins after the acceptance of them by mothers following implantation . " ethics mediators also divided in an opinion piece published in 2007 by germany 's national ethics council , hermann barth argued that the 2002 stem cell law " resulted from a compromise in which both the advocates of comprehensive embryo protection and those in favor of a system oriented towards the freedom of research set aside their own , more far-reaching convictions . " within certain conditions , barth wrote , " this compromise would best be served by opening the door to stem cell research a little wider by means of a prudent amendment of the stem cell law . " the setting of a later cut-off date , albeit in the past , is the appropriate means : it is adequate , takes account of the normative principles of the embryo protection law and conforms to the spirit of the 2002 compromise , " he continued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching stem cells is miles away from applying them in treatments , scientists say other members of the ethics council wrote last year that " a change in the jan .
1 , 2002 cut-off date -lsb- stipulated by the stem cell law -rsb- would essentially mean to endorse the destruction of embryos abroad and to profit from procedures which are banned -lsb- in germany -rsb- by the embryo protection law . " a 1990 embryo protection law prohibits any utilization of embryos that does not serve their preservation .
a logical consequence , those members argued , would then have to include a reevaluation of germany 's embryo protection law . " in this case , it would have to be evaluated whether or not it would not be more consistent to use embryos ... and fertilized eggs , which can no longer be employed for reproduction purposes for research , rather than importing ... cells from abroad , " council members wrote . but until such a debate takes place " it is the import law which is currently under consideration and debate , " hacker stressed . a shift in the debate ironically , advances in science may help to take the heat off the ethical debate .
last november , teams of us and japanese researchers said they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells . on the surface , this could mean that scientists would no longer have to rely on embryonic stem cells . but , cautioned hacker , " these new , reprogrammed cells still have to be compared with real embryonic stem cell lines to see if they function they same way . " shortly after the november announcement of the scientific breakthrough , the german government announced it would double its funding for stem cell research from 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.4 million -rrb- to just under 10 million euros , albeit only for adult stem cells . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in republishing the cartoon , editors vowed to defend freedom of expression . the act was in response to news on tuesday that police had foiled a murder plot against the cartoonist . " we are doing this to document what is at stake in this case , and to unambiguously back and support the freedom of speech that we as a newspaper will always defend , " wrote the berlingske tidende , which reprinted the cartoon in its wednesday edition . police arrested a danish citizen of moroccan descent and two tunisians on tuesday , who were reportedly planning to murder 73-year-old kurt westergaard , the cartoonist at the danish paper jyllands-posten , which originally published all 12 drawings in september 2005 . mixed views among muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other muslims chose a less violent form of protest stomping on the danish flag two years ago but wednesday 's reprinting has prompted criticism among muslims . " we believe this is very foolish and does not help building the bridges we need , " imam mostafa chendid , a leading danish muslim cleric , told reuters news service . " it will make our young people feel more isolated , " he said .
" the printing of the cartoon is an insult to our intellectual capacity .
we are not against freedom of speech , but we are opposed to continued discrimination of the muslim minority in denmark . " chedid added that his group was considering holding a demonstration in front of the danish parliament , but emphasized that it would be of a peaceful nature . " no blood was ever shed in denmark because of this , and no blood will be shed , " chedid said in an interview with the associated press .
" we are trying to calm down people , but let 's see what happens .
let 's open a dialogue . " following the 12 drawings ' original publication in 2005 , rioting continued in some muslim countries through the beginning of 2006 . three danish embassies were attacked and at least 50 people were killed in protests in 2006 in the middle east , africa and asia . since then , several young muslims have been convicted in denmark of planning bomb attacks partly connected to protests against the cartoons . according to reuters , denmark 's security and intelligence service said tuesday 's arrests near aarhus in the western part of the country were made after lengthy surveillance .
the aim was to prevent a murder , which police said was in the early stages of planning . cartoonist still in hiding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoonist and his wife have been under heavy police protection for months danish media reported that the man of moroccan descent had been released but faced preliminary charges .
the two tunisians are to face deportation later this week . one editorialist in the danish paper politiken commented that the murder plot was an attack on denmark 's democratic culture . " regardless of whether jyllands-posten at the time used freedom of speech unwisely and with damaging consequences , the paper deserves unconditional solidarity when it is threatened with terror , " the editorialist wrote , as cited by reuters . " freedom of expression gives you the right to think , to speak and to draw what you like ... no matter how many terrorist plots there are , " an editorial in the berlingske tidende paper noted , as cited by the afp news agency . generally , the danish press has condemned the alleged murder plot against cartoonist westergaard , who has lived in hiding for the past three months . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just make it efficient , italian says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grillo , who goads politicians , has been called the michael moore of italy would italy really trade " la dolce vita " for a dose of teutonic efficiency ?
one outspoken italian comedian thinks the remedy for his country 's ills lies in a good , old-fashioned military takeover . " take my country - please ! " in a twist on henny youngman 's comic one-liner , a beloved italian comedian satirically appealed to germany to do something it has done repeatedly in the past : launch an invasion . " italy is appealing to the fraternal germans : please declare war on us ! " pleaded stand-up comic beppe grillo .
" we 'll be happy to surrender .
you 're our last hope . neapolitan garbage heads to bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash piled up on naples streets when dumps were full " we are already sending you garbage from campania -lsb- the naples region -rsb- .
please take away our politicians too .
we 'll pay you well to do so ! "
grillo said . the comedian was referring to a deal struck last year between italy and germany that has seen garbage from naples is being carted by train to bremen for incineration , as part of a one-off effort to ease weeks-old waste build-up in the italian city . and , of course , grillo - sometimes referred to as " italy 's michael moore " - he was putting a slight twist on his usual shtick , which is based on poking fun at chaos and corruption in italian life . sixty governments , and counting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elections are a snap if you own the media grillo made his comments - which played off the stereotypes of germans as being über-organized and militarily avaricious , as well as the italian penchant for toppling and building governments at the drop of a hat - in an interview with german newsweekly die zeit .
the interviewer had asked for his two cents on the latest collapse of the italian government and the resignation of prime minister romano prodi . grillo , who has been banned from italian tv but plays live to large audiences in big italian venues , reserved especially scathing remarks for opposition leader and former government head silvio berlusconi .
the media mogul , who owns three major television channels and italy 's biggest publishing group , is seeking a comeback in the april general election . the bliss of being berlusconi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could italians live with german cuisine ?
german chancellor angela merkel ought to think about becoming a media magnate herself , grillo said . " if merkel had three channels and 40 newspapers and magazines , she would not need to form a grand coalition , " grillo said .
" she would just get 80 percent of the votes at every election .
why do n't you suggest this to merkel ? " no word form grillo on whether the benefits of a possible teutonic takeover - ostensibly , a responsive democracy and efficient public service - would outweigh the culinary and lifestyle negatives . sauerkraut instead of spaghetti ? beer over barolo ? more pretzels than pancetta ?

unlike popular reference work wikipedia , it will be ad-sponsored and professionally edited . it 's the paper death of a classic .
the german publisher brockhaus has been printing its encyclopedias for nearly 200 years , and anyone who 's had the money has boasted a collection of the handsome works on their bookshelves for all the world to admire . but the internet has been a thorn in brockhaus ' side years now , forcing the company to reevaluate its strategy .
the german version of the democratic digital reference work wikipedia has been seen as cutting into brockhaus ' profits . " though official figures are not yet out for 2007 , we can expect losses of around several million euros , " a brockhaus spokesperson said earlier this week . consolidating online bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander bob brockhaus , head of the company the publisher 's management is reviewing ways to reduce costs , which could also include slashing around 50 jobs at the mannheim office .
brockhaus employs nearly 450 people nationwide , around 250 of whom are in mannheim . brockhaus is planning to launch its free encyclopedic portal in mid-april , with the publisher banking on its soundly researched information to set itself apart from wikipedia , which can be edited by all internet users . " brockhaus online will provide relevant , reviewed information from all fields of knowledge , " a press statement said . the brockhaus branch in leipzig , which includes about 60 employees , was transformed into a purely online editorial office last year . brockhaus said it would fund its new internet product through advertising .
the company also intends to create an online service for schools that will be free of advertising . the future is online " market analyses clearly show that customers will research specific information on the internet more and more in the future , " the brockhaus spokesperson said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will wikipedia users head to brockhaus ' ad-supported entries ?
the 21st edition of the brockhaus encyclopedia was likely the last in printed form .
" now , everything will happen online , " the spokesperson said . " but , we will clearly distinguish ourselves from providers like wikipedia , by banking on relevance , accuracy and reliability , " the spokesperson said .
" and , our information can not be manipulated . " the online reference work wikipedia was established in 2001 , with the aim of having internet users themselves create the encyclopedia 's content .
the web site 's democratic nature has made some of its entries on contested subjects prone to manipulation .
several studies have , however , shown that wikipedia 's error rates are on par with those of major encyclopedias . millions of people around the world use the service .
according to wikipedia , 10,000 people regularly write entries in germany alone . donations cover wikipedia 's annual worldwide costs of $ 5 million -lrb- 3.4 million euros -rrb- , most of which is spent on technological equipment and administration . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just make it efficient , italian says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grillo , who goads politicians , has been called the michael moore of italy would italy really trade " la dolce vita " for a dose of teutonic efficiency ?
one outspoken italian comedian thinks the remedy for his country 's ills lies in a good , old-fashioned military takeover . " take my country - please ! " in a twist on henny youngman 's comic one-liner , a beloved italian comedian satirically appealed to germany to do something it has done repeatedly in the past : launch an invasion . " italy is appealing to the fraternal germans : please declare war on us ! " pleaded stand-up comic beppe grillo .
" we 'll be happy to surrender .
you 're our last hope . neapolitan garbage heads to bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash piled up on naples streets when dumps were full " we are already sending you garbage from campania -lsb- the naples region -rsb- .
please take away our politicians too .
we 'll pay you well to do so ! "
grillo said . the comedian was referring to a deal struck last year between italy and germany that has seen garbage from naples is being carted by train to bremen for incineration , as part of a one-off effort to ease weeks-old waste build-up in the italian city . and , of course , grillo - sometimes referred to as " italy 's michael moore " - he was putting a slight twist on his usual shtick , which is based on poking fun at chaos and corruption in italian life . sixty governments , and counting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elections are a snap if you own the media grillo made his comments - which played off the stereotypes of germans as being über-organized and militarily avaricious , as well as the italian penchant for toppling and building governments at the drop of a hat - in an interview with german newsweekly die zeit .
the interviewer had asked for his two cents on the latest collapse of the italian government and the resignation of prime minister romano prodi . grillo , who has been banned from italian tv but plays live to large audiences in big italian venues , reserved especially scathing remarks for opposition leader and former government head silvio berlusconi .
the media mogul , who owns three major television channels and italy 's biggest publishing group , is seeking a comeback in the april general election . the bliss of being berlusconi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could italians live with german cuisine ?
german chancellor angela merkel ought to think about becoming a media magnate herself , grillo said . " if merkel had three channels and 40 newspapers and magazines , she would not need to form a grand coalition , " grillo said .
" she would just get 80 percent of the votes at every election .
why do n't you suggest this to merkel ? " no word form grillo on whether the benefits of a possible teutonic takeover - ostensibly , a responsive democracy and efficient public service - would outweigh the culinary and lifestyle negatives . sauerkraut instead of spaghetti ? beer over barolo ? more pretzels than pancetta ?

just make it efficient , italian says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grillo , who goads politicians , has been called the michael moore of italy would italy really trade " la dolce vita " for a dose of teutonic efficiency ?
one outspoken italian comedian thinks the remedy for his country 's ills lies in a good , old-fashioned military takeover . " take my country - please ! " in a twist on henny youngman 's comic one-liner , a beloved italian comedian satirically appealed to germany to do something it has done repeatedly in the past : launch an invasion . " italy is appealing to the fraternal germans : please declare war on us ! " pleaded stand-up comic beppe grillo .
" we 'll be happy to surrender .
you 're our last hope . neapolitan garbage heads to bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash piled up on naples streets when dumps were full " we are already sending you garbage from campania -lsb- the naples region -rsb- .
please take away our politicians too .
we 'll pay you well to do so ! "
grillo said . the comedian was referring to a deal struck last year between italy and germany that has seen garbage from naples is being carted by train to bremen for incineration , as part of a one-off effort to ease weeks-old waste build-up in the italian city . and , of course , grillo - sometimes referred to as " italy 's michael moore " - he was putting a slight twist on his usual shtick , which is based on poking fun at chaos and corruption in italian life . sixty governments , and counting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elections are a snap if you own the media grillo made his comments - which played off the stereotypes of germans as being über-organized and militarily avaricious , as well as the italian penchant for toppling and building governments at the drop of a hat - in an interview with german newsweekly die zeit .
the interviewer had asked for his two cents on the latest collapse of the italian government and the resignation of prime minister romano prodi . grillo , who has been banned from italian tv but plays live to large audiences in big italian venues , reserved especially scathing remarks for opposition leader and former government head silvio berlusconi .
the media mogul , who owns three major television channels and italy 's biggest publishing group , is seeking a comeback in the april general election . the bliss of being berlusconi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could italians live with german cuisine ?
german chancellor angela merkel ought to think about becoming a media magnate herself , grillo said . " if merkel had three channels and 40 newspapers and magazines , she would not need to form a grand coalition , " grillo said .
" she would just get 80 percent of the votes at every election .
why do n't you suggest this to merkel ? " no word form grillo on whether the benefits of a possible teutonic takeover - ostensibly , a responsive democracy and efficient public service - would outweigh the culinary and lifestyle negatives . sauerkraut instead of spaghetti ? beer over barolo ? more pretzels than pancetta ?
maybe he should think twice about his invitation to invade . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" brockhaus online will provide relevant , reviewed information from all fields of knowledge , " a press statement said . the brockhaus branch in leipzig , which includes about 60 employees , was transformed into a purely online editorial office last year . brockhaus said it would fund its new internet product through advertising .

the republication was to protest a plot to murder one of the cartoonists . five major daily danish newspapers , 10 smaller papers and a swedish daily reprinted on wednesday , feb .
13 , one of the 12 drawings of mohammed that a danish paper had published two years ago and which triggered global protests . the drawing was a caricature of the prophet , whose head was adorned with a turban that looked like a bomb with a lit fuse .
in republishing the cartoon , editors vowed to defend freedom of expression . the act was in response to news on tuesday that police had foiled a murder plot against the cartoonist . " we are doing this to document what is at stake in this case , and to unambiguously back and support the freedom of speech that we as a newspaper will always defend , " wrote the berlingske tidende , which reprinted the cartoon in its wednesday edition . police arrested a danish citizen of moroccan descent and two tunisians on tuesday , who were reportedly planning to murder 73-year-old kurt westergaard , the cartoonist at the danish paper jyllands-posten , which originally published all 12 drawings in september 2005 . mixed views among muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other muslims chose a less violent form of protest stomping on the danish flag two years ago but wednesday 's reprinting has prompted criticism among muslims . " we believe this is very foolish and does not help building the bridges we need , " imam mostafa chendid , a leading danish muslim cleric , told reuters news service . " it will make our young people feel more isolated , " he said .
" the printing of the cartoon is an insult to our intellectual capacity .
we are not against freedom of speech , but we are opposed to continued discrimination of the muslim minority in denmark . " chedid added that his group was considering holding a demonstration in front of the danish parliament , but emphasized that it would be of a peaceful nature . " no blood was ever shed in denmark because of this , and no blood will be shed , " chedid said in an interview with the associated press .
" we are trying to calm down people , but let 's see what happens .
let 's open a dialogue . " following the 12 drawings ' original publication in 2005 , rioting continued in some muslim countries through the beginning of 2006 . three danish embassies were attacked and at least 50 people were killed in protests in 2006 in the middle east , africa and asia . since then , several young muslims have been convicted in denmark of planning bomb attacks partly connected to protests against the cartoons . according to reuters , denmark 's security and intelligence service said tuesday 's arrests near aarhus in the western part of the country were made after lengthy surveillance .
the aim was to prevent a murder , which police said was in the early stages of planning . cartoonist still in hiding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoonist and his wife have been under heavy police protection for months danish media reported that the man of moroccan descent had been released but faced preliminary charges .
the two tunisians are to face deportation later this week . one editorialist in the danish paper politiken commented that the murder plot was an attack on denmark 's democratic culture . " regardless of whether jyllands-posten at the time used freedom of speech unwisely and with damaging consequences , the paper deserves unconditional solidarity when it is threatened with terror , " the editorialist wrote , as cited by reuters . " freedom of expression gives you the right to think , to speak and to draw what you like ... no matter how many terrorist plots there are , " an editorial in the berlingske tidende paper noted , as cited by the afp news agency . generally , the danish press has condemned the alleged murder plot against cartoonist westergaard , who has lived in hiding for the past three months . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 13.02.2008 german parliament to discuss reforming stem cell law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research grabs the spotlight again some scientists and politicians believe the 2002 law restricting the use of stem cells in german research is no longer in sync with modern medicine .
opponents to a change in the law fear abuse of human embryos . the german research foundation , which defines itself as a funding organization that promotes public scientific research , in 2007 called for a loosening of restrictions of germany 's stem cell law , which allows scientists to only work with imported cells created before the national stem cell act was adopted in 2002 .
since the request for altering the law , german politicians from all parties have been defining their various stances on the issue . from politicians who completely oppose the use of human embryonic stem cells to others who want german scientists to have unfettered access to these basic building blocks of life , divisions have n't been drawn according to party affiliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-celled human embryo from a fertility clinic the largest group of parliamentarians , which encompasses both social and christian democrats , including german education and research minister annette schavan and german chancellor angela merkel , suggest a one-time change to the jan .
1 , 2002 restriction .
the group proposes that stem lines from embryos created before 2007 should be allowed to be imported into germany . rene roespel , a social democrat and co-initiator of the proposal , said that the number of stem cell lines available to german scientists would then increase from 40 to 500 . behind the scientific curve emphasizing the chances stem cell research offers to combat disease , german scientists have said their research is impaired by the current law and have called on politicians to ease restrictions on embryonic stem cell research . " we are only able to import embryonic cells created before jan .
1 , 2002 , which makes them quite old and we have to assume that many of them are now genetically damaged or no longer stable , " said juergen hescheler , a stem cell expert at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists say they are behind the research curve due to restrictive laws he said that many german scientists are hoping for a change in the law to allow them to import newer cell lines of better quality . " now , scientists are significantly more careful about preparing and cultivating human embryonic cells , so it is internationally accepted that the newer cell lines are much better , " he said . in addition to the questionable quality of pre-2002 imported cells , joerg hacker , vice-president of the german research foundation , said there was another reason for the call in 2007 for a law reform . " there is a risk of punishment of german scientists who work on international projects using stem cells lines from after 2002 , " he explained . currently , scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use post-2002 embryonic cells .
if they do , they run the risk of criminal prosecution at home . stem cell versatility vs. ethical concerns embryonic stem cells can develop into any type of cell , which prompts scientists to believe they offer strong potential for finding cures for diseases such as diabetes , parkinson 's and heart maladies . formerly , the cells could only be extracted by destroying human embryos , which opponents say is equivalent to taking a human life .
germany 's history with nazi medical experiments on humans has also contributed to the national sensitivity with the issue . however , only stem cell lines from " additional " embryos which are not implanted but develop during in vitro fertility treatments come into question under the proposal ; importing lines from embryos generated exclusively for stem cell research remains forbidden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells in a petri dish but even the definition of an embryo itself is a gray area . " there is a clear distinction between pre-embryos and their implantation into the uterus , " said hescheler .
" these -lsb- embryonic cells -rsb- are human material which should be respected , but i do not see them as true embryos with functions and brain or organ development . " he added that " real -lsb- human -rsb- life begins after the acceptance of them by mothers following implantation . " ethics mediators also divided in an opinion piece published in 2007 by germany 's national ethics council , hermann barth argued that the 2002 stem cell law " resulted from a compromise in which both the advocates of comprehensive embryo protection and those in favor of a system oriented towards the freedom of research set aside their own , more far-reaching convictions . " within certain conditions , barth wrote , " this compromise would best be served by opening the door to stem cell research a little wider by means of a prudent amendment of the stem cell law . " the setting of a later cut-off date , albeit in the past , is the appropriate means : it is adequate , takes account of the normative principles of the embryo protection law and conforms to the spirit of the 2002 compromise , " he continued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching stem cells is miles away from applying them in treatments , scientists say other members of the ethics council wrote last year that " a change in the jan .
1 , 2002 cut-off date -lsb- stipulated by the stem cell law -rsb- would essentially mean to endorse the destruction of embryos abroad and to profit from procedures which are banned -lsb- in germany -rsb- by the embryo protection law . " a 1990 embryo protection law prohibits any utilization of embryos that does not serve their preservation .
a logical consequence , those members argued , would then have to include a reevaluation of germany 's embryo protection law . " in this case , it would have to be evaluated whether or not it would not be more consistent to use embryos ... and fertilized eggs , which can no longer be employed for reproduction purposes for research , rather than importing ... cells from abroad , " council members wrote . but until such a debate takes place " it is the import law which is currently under consideration and debate , " hacker stressed . a shift in the debate ironically , advances in science may help to take the heat off the ethical debate .
last november , teams of us and japanese researchers said they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells . on the surface , this could mean that scientists would no longer have to rely on embryonic stem cells . but , cautioned hacker , " these new , reprogrammed cells still have to be compared with real embryonic stem cell lines to see if they function they same way . " shortly after the november announcement of the scientific breakthrough , the german government announced it would double its funding for stem cell research from 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.4 million -rrb- to just under 10 million euros , albeit only for adult stem cells . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 13.02.2008 german parliament to discuss reforming stem cell law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research grabs the spotlight again some scientists and politicians believe the 2002 law restricting the use of stem cells in german research is no longer in sync with modern medicine .
opponents to a change in the law fear abuse of human embryos . the german research foundation , which defines itself as a funding organization that promotes public scientific research , in 2007 called for a loosening of restrictions of germany 's stem cell law , which allows scientists to only work with imported cells created before the national stem cell act was adopted in 2002 .
since the request for altering the law , german politicians from all parties have been defining their various stances on the issue . from politicians who completely oppose the use of human embryonic stem cells to others who want german scientists to have unfettered access to these basic building blocks of life , divisions have n't been drawn according to party affiliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-celled human embryo from a fertility clinic the largest group of parliamentarians , which encompasses both social and christian democrats , including german education and research minister annette schavan and german chancellor angela merkel , suggest a one-time change to the jan .
1 , 2002 restriction .
the group proposes that stem lines from embryos created before 2007 should be allowed to be imported into germany . rene roespel , a social democrat and co-initiator of the proposal , said that the number of stem cell lines available to german scientists would then increase from 40 to 500 . behind the scientific curve emphasizing the chances stem cell research offers to combat disease , german scientists have said their research is impaired by the current law and have called on politicians to ease restrictions on embryonic stem cell research . " we are only able to import embryonic cells created before jan .
1 , 2002 , which makes them quite old and we have to assume that many of them are now genetically damaged or no longer stable , " said juergen hescheler , a stem cell expert at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists say they are behind the research curve due to restrictive laws he said that many german scientists are hoping for a change in the law to allow them to import newer cell lines of better quality . " now , scientists are significantly more careful about preparing and cultivating human embryonic cells , so it is internationally accepted that the newer cell lines are much better , " he said . in addition to the questionable quality of pre-2002 imported cells , joerg hacker , vice-president of the german research foundation , said there was another reason for the call in 2007 for a law reform . " there is a risk of punishment of german scientists who work on international projects using stem cells lines from after 2002 , " he explained . currently , scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use post-2002 embryonic cells .
if they do , they run the risk of criminal prosecution at home . stem cell versatility vs. ethical concerns embryonic stem cells can develop into any type of cell , which prompts scientists to believe they offer strong potential for finding cures for diseases such as diabetes , parkinson 's and heart maladies . formerly , the cells could only be extracted by destroying human embryos , which opponents say is equivalent to taking a human life .
germany 's history with nazi medical experiments on humans has also contributed to the national sensitivity with the issue . however , only stem cell lines from " additional " embryos which are not implanted but develop during in vitro fertility treatments come into question under the proposal ; importing lines from embryos generated exclusively for stem cell research remains forbidden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells in a petri dish but even the definition of an embryo itself is a gray area . " there is a clear distinction between pre-embryos and their implantation into the uterus , " said hescheler .
" these -lsb- embryonic cells -rsb- are human material which should be respected , but i do not see them as true embryos with functions and brain or organ development . " he added that " real -lsb- human -rsb- life begins after the acceptance of them by mothers following implantation . " ethics mediators also divided in an opinion piece published in 2007 by germany 's national ethics council , hermann barth argued that the 2002 stem cell law " resulted from a compromise in which both the advocates of comprehensive embryo protection and those in favor of a system oriented towards the freedom of research set aside their own , more far-reaching convictions . " within certain conditions , barth wrote , " this compromise would best be served by opening the door to stem cell research a little wider by means of a prudent amendment of the stem cell law . " the setting of a later cut-off date , albeit in the past , is the appropriate means : it is adequate , takes account of the normative principles of the embryo protection law and conforms to the spirit of the 2002 compromise , " he continued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching stem cells is miles away from applying them in treatments , scientists say other members of the ethics council wrote last year that " a change in the jan .
1 , 2002 cut-off date -lsb- stipulated by the stem cell law -rsb- would essentially mean to endorse the destruction of embryos abroad and to profit from procedures which are banned -lsb- in germany -rsb- by the embryo protection law . " a 1990 embryo protection law prohibits any utilization of embryos that does not serve their preservation .
a logical consequence , those members argued , would then have to include a reevaluation of germany 's embryo protection law . " in this case , it would have to be evaluated whether or not it would not be more consistent to use embryos ... and fertilized eggs , which can no longer be employed for reproduction purposes for research , rather than importing ... cells from abroad , " council members wrote . but until such a debate takes place " it is the import law which is currently under consideration and debate , " hacker stressed . a shift in the debate ironically , advances in science may help to take the heat off the ethical debate .
last november , teams of us and japanese researchers said they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells . on the surface , this could mean that scientists would no longer have to rely on embryonic stem cells . but , cautioned hacker , " these new , reprogrammed cells still have to be compared with real embryonic stem cell lines to see if they function they same way . " shortly after the november announcement of the scientific breakthrough , the german government announced it would double its funding for stem cell research from 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.4 million -rrb- to just under 10 million euros , albeit only for adult stem cells . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 13.02.2008 german parliament to discuss reforming stem cell law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research grabs the spotlight again some scientists and politicians believe the 2002 law restricting the use of stem cells in german research is no longer in sync with modern medicine .
opponents to a change in the law fear abuse of human embryos . the german research foundation , which defines itself as a funding organization that promotes public scientific research , in 2007 called for a loosening of restrictions of germany 's stem cell law , which allows scientists to only work with imported cells created before the national stem cell act was adopted in 2002 .
since the request for altering the law , german politicians from all parties have been defining their various stances on the issue . from politicians who completely oppose the use of human embryonic stem cells to others who want german scientists to have unfettered access to these basic building blocks of life , divisions have n't been drawn according to party affiliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-celled human embryo from a fertility clinic the largest group of parliamentarians , which encompasses both social and christian democrats , including german education and research minister annette schavan and german chancellor angela merkel , suggest a one-time change to the jan .
1 , 2002 restriction .
the group proposes that stem lines from embryos created before 2007 should be allowed to be imported into germany . rene roespel , a social democrat and co-initiator of the proposal , said that the number of stem cell lines available to german scientists would then increase from 40 to 500 . behind the scientific curve emphasizing the chances stem cell research offers to combat disease , german scientists have said their research is impaired by the current law and have called on politicians to ease restrictions on embryonic stem cell research . " we are only able to import embryonic cells created before jan .
1 , 2002 , which makes them quite old and we have to assume that many of them are now genetically damaged or no longer stable , " said juergen hescheler , a stem cell expert at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists say they are behind the research curve due to restrictive laws he said that many german scientists are hoping for a change in the law to allow them to import newer cell lines of better quality . " now , scientists are significantly more careful about preparing and cultivating human embryonic cells , so it is internationally accepted that the newer cell lines are much better , " he said . in addition to the questionable quality of pre-2002 imported cells , joerg hacker , vice-president of the german research foundation , said there was another reason for the call in 2007 for a law reform . " there is a risk of punishment of german scientists who work on international projects using stem cells lines from after 2002 , " he explained . currently , scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use post-2002 embryonic cells .
if they do , they run the risk of criminal prosecution at home . stem cell versatility vs. ethical concerns embryonic stem cells can develop into any type of cell , which prompts scientists to believe they offer strong potential for finding cures for diseases such as diabetes , parkinson 's and heart maladies . formerly , the cells could only be extracted by destroying human embryos , which opponents say is equivalent to taking a human life .
germany 's history with nazi medical experiments on humans has also contributed to the national sensitivity with the issue . however , only stem cell lines from " additional " embryos which are not implanted but develop during in vitro fertility treatments come into question under the proposal ; importing lines from embryos generated exclusively for stem cell research remains forbidden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells in a petri dish but even the definition of an embryo itself is a gray area . " there is a clear distinction between pre-embryos and their implantation into the uterus , " said hescheler .
" these -lsb- embryonic cells -rsb- are human material which should be respected , but i do not see them as true embryos with functions and brain or organ development . " he added that " real -lsb- human -rsb- life begins after the acceptance of them by mothers following implantation . " ethics mediators also divided in an opinion piece published in 2007 by germany 's national ethics council , hermann barth argued that the 2002 stem cell law " resulted from a compromise in which both the advocates of comprehensive embryo protection and those in favor of a system oriented towards the freedom of research set aside their own , more far-reaching convictions . " within certain conditions , barth wrote , " this compromise would best be served by opening the door to stem cell research a little wider by means of a prudent amendment of the stem cell law . " the setting of a later cut-off date , albeit in the past , is the appropriate means : it is adequate , takes account of the normative principles of the embryo protection law and conforms to the spirit of the 2002 compromise , " he continued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching stem cells is miles away from applying them in treatments , scientists say other members of the ethics council wrote last year that " a change in the jan .
1 , 2002 cut-off date -lsb- stipulated by the stem cell law -rsb- would essentially mean to endorse the destruction of embryos abroad and to profit from procedures which are banned -lsb- in germany -rsb- by the embryo protection law . " a 1990 embryo protection law prohibits any utilization of embryos that does not serve their preservation .
a logical consequence , those members argued , would then have to include a reevaluation of germany 's embryo protection law . " in this case , it would have to be evaluated whether or not it would not be more consistent to use embryos ... and fertilized eggs , which can no longer be employed for reproduction purposes for research , rather than importing ... cells from abroad , " council members wrote . but until such a debate takes place " it is the import law which is currently under consideration and debate , " hacker stressed . a shift in the debate ironically , advances in science may help to take the heat off the ethical debate .
last november , teams of us and japanese researchers said they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells . on the surface , this could mean that scientists would no longer have to rely on embryonic stem cells . but , cautioned hacker , " these new , reprogrammed cells still have to be compared with real embryonic stem cell lines to see if they function they same way . " shortly after the november announcement of the scientific breakthrough , the german government announced it would double its funding for stem cell research from 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.4 million -rrb- to just under 10 million euros , albeit only for adult stem cells . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as fears of a recession circle the globe , dw-world.de asked people from seven european countries about their impressions of the cost of living .
the series continues in luxembourg . leonor was born in france and is currently living in luxembourg city where she works as a personal assistant .

here the salaries are good , so we have more possibilities and it 's easy to earn money . how easy is it for you to get by ? for the first time in my life i do n't have a problem at the end of the month , because here the salaries are higher than in other european countries .
of course , the rent and the everyday living are higher too , but still it 's easy to have a good lifestyle . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? in the last few months i 've felt europe is not as strong as it used to be .
when i talk with my friends in france they say it 's becoming harder each day because salaries are blocked but prices are growing . in luxembourg salaries are evaluated through indexation , so when the prices grow 0.5 percent the salaries also grow 0.5 percent .
this usually happens once a year .
however , the problem in luxembourg is that house prices are growing every month and so it becomes difficult to find a flat to rent or to buy on your own .
that 's why most people here share a house . between france and luxembourg the economic issues are different , but still these two small examples show us how difficult it will be for us to keep living in europe and how difficult it will be for foreigners to arrive and work here .
in luxembourg most workers in every sector come from another country . nb .

bank fees also . to what extent does inflation affect you ? according to the federal institute of statistics , the average inflation was 0.7 percent here in 2007 .
the forecast for 2008 is 1.5 percent because of the petroleum prices and again because banks will rise interest rates . how easy is it for you to get by ? easy because we are dinkies - double income no kids . would an increase in your wages be necessary to make it easier for you to meet you basic needs ? more money is always good , but , at the same time , the tax rate also increases because we have a progressive tax system , not a linear one . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? it 's good that we are not part of the eu .
our unemployment rate is much lower than in the rest of europe and a lot of people are immigrating to switzerland - especially germans - because the taxes are lower .
value-added tax is some 19 to 21 percent in the eu and 2.4 to 7.6 percent in switzerland .

just make it efficient , italian says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grillo , who goads politicians , has been called the michael moore of italy would italy really trade " la dolce vita " for a dose of teutonic efficiency ?
one outspoken italian comedian thinks the remedy for his country 's ills lies in a good , old-fashioned military takeover . " take my country - please ! " in a twist on henny youngman 's comic one-liner , a beloved italian comedian satirically appealed to germany to do something it has done repeatedly in the past : launch an invasion . " italy is appealing to the fraternal germans : please declare war on us ! " pleaded stand-up comic beppe grillo .
" we 'll be happy to surrender .
you 're our last hope . neapolitan garbage heads to bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash piled up on naples streets when dumps were full " we are already sending you garbage from campania -lsb- the naples region -rsb- .
please take away our politicians too .
we 'll pay you well to do so ! "
grillo said . the comedian was referring to a deal struck last year between italy and germany that has seen garbage from naples is being carted by train to bremen for incineration , as part of a one-off effort to ease weeks-old waste build-up in the italian city . and , of course , grillo - sometimes referred to as " italy 's michael moore " - he was putting a slight twist on his usual shtick , which is based on poking fun at chaos and corruption in italian life . sixty governments , and counting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elections are a snap if you own the media grillo made his comments - which played off the stereotypes of germans as being über-organized and militarily avaricious , as well as the italian penchant for toppling and building governments at the drop of a hat - in an interview with german newsweekly die zeit .
the interviewer had asked for his two cents on the latest collapse of the italian government and the resignation of prime minister romano prodi . grillo , who has been banned from italian tv but plays live to large audiences in big italian venues , reserved especially scathing remarks for opposition leader and former government head silvio berlusconi .
the media mogul , who owns three major television channels and italy 's biggest publishing group , is seeking a comeback in the april general election . the bliss of being berlusconi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could italians live with german cuisine ?
german chancellor angela merkel ought to think about becoming a media magnate herself , grillo said . " if merkel had three channels and 40 newspapers and magazines , she would not need to form a grand coalition , " grillo said .
" she would just get 80 percent of the votes at every election .
why do n't you suggest this to merkel ? " no word form grillo on whether the benefits of a possible teutonic takeover - ostensibly , a responsive democracy and efficient public service - would outweigh the culinary and lifestyle negatives . sauerkraut instead of spaghetti ? beer over barolo ? more pretzels than pancetta ?
maybe he should think twice about his invitation to invade . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the republication was to protest a plot to murder one of the cartoonists . five major daily danish newspapers , 10 smaller papers and a swedish daily reprinted on wednesday , feb .
13 , one of the 12 drawings of mohammed that a danish paper had published two years ago and which triggered global protests . the drawing was a caricature of the prophet , whose head was adorned with a turban that looked like a bomb with a lit fuse .
in republishing the cartoon , editors vowed to defend freedom of expression . the act was in response to news on tuesday that police had foiled a murder plot against the cartoonist . " we are doing this to document what is at stake in this case , and to unambiguously back and support the freedom of speech that we as a newspaper will always defend , " wrote the berlingske tidende , which reprinted the cartoon in its wednesday edition . police arrested a danish citizen of moroccan descent and two tunisians on tuesday , who were reportedly planning to murder 73-year-old kurt westergaard , the cartoonist at the danish paper jyllands-posten , which originally published all 12 drawings in september 2005 . mixed views among muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other muslims chose a less violent form of protest stomping on the danish flag two years ago but wednesday 's reprinting has prompted criticism among muslims . " we believe this is very foolish and does not help building the bridges we need , " imam mostafa chendid , a leading danish muslim cleric , told reuters news service . " it will make our young people feel more isolated , " he said .
" the printing of the cartoon is an insult to our intellectual capacity .
we are not against freedom of speech , but we are opposed to continued discrimination of the muslim minority in denmark . " chedid added that his group was considering holding a demonstration in front of the danish parliament , but emphasized that it would be of a peaceful nature . " no blood was ever shed in denmark because of this , and no blood will be shed , " chedid said in an interview with the associated press .
" we are trying to calm down people , but let 's see what happens .
let 's open a dialogue . " following the 12 drawings ' original publication in 2005 , rioting continued in some muslim countries through the beginning of 2006 . three danish embassies were attacked and at least 50 people were killed in protests in 2006 in the middle east , africa and asia . since then , several young muslims have been convicted in denmark of planning bomb attacks partly connected to protests against the cartoons . according to reuters , denmark 's security and intelligence service said tuesday 's arrests near aarhus in the western part of the country were made after lengthy surveillance .
the aim was to prevent a murder , which police said was in the early stages of planning . cartoonist still in hiding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoonist and his wife have been under heavy police protection for months danish media reported that the man of moroccan descent had been released but faced preliminary charges .
the two tunisians are to face deportation later this week . one editorialist in the danish paper politiken commented that the murder plot was an attack on denmark 's democratic culture . " regardless of whether jyllands-posten at the time used freedom of speech unwisely and with damaging consequences , the paper deserves unconditional solidarity when it is threatened with terror , " the editorialist wrote , as cited by reuters . " freedom of expression gives you the right to think , to speak and to draw what you like ... no matter how many terrorist plots there are , " an editorial in the berlingske tidende paper noted , as cited by the afp news agency . generally , the danish press has condemned the alleged murder plot against cartoonist westergaard , who has lived in hiding for the past three months . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the republication was to protest a plot to murder one of the cartoonists . five major daily danish newspapers , 10 smaller papers and a swedish daily reprinted on wednesday , feb .
13 , one of the 12 drawings of mohammed that a danish paper had published two years ago and which triggered global protests . the drawing was a caricature of the prophet , whose head was adorned with a turban that looked like a bomb with a lit fuse .
in republishing the cartoon , editors vowed to defend freedom of expression . the act was in response to news on tuesday that police had foiled a murder plot against the cartoonist . " we are doing this to document what is at stake in this case , and to unambiguously back and support the freedom of speech that we as a newspaper will always defend , " wrote the berlingske tidende , which reprinted the cartoon in its wednesday edition . police arrested a danish citizen of moroccan descent and two tunisians on tuesday , who were reportedly planning to murder 73-year-old kurt westergaard , the cartoonist at the danish paper jyllands-posten , which originally published all 12 drawings in september 2005 . mixed views among muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other muslims chose a less violent form of protest stomping on the danish flag two years ago but wednesday 's reprinting has prompted criticism among muslims . " we believe this is very foolish and does not help building the bridges we need , " imam mostafa chendid , a leading danish muslim cleric , told reuters news service . " it will make our young people feel more isolated , " he said .
" the printing of the cartoon is an insult to our intellectual capacity .
we are not against freedom of speech , but we are opposed to continued discrimination of the muslim minority in denmark . " chedid added that his group was considering holding a demonstration in front of the danish parliament , but emphasized that it would be of a peaceful nature . " no blood was ever shed in denmark because of this , and no blood will be shed , " chedid said in an interview with the associated press .
" we are trying to calm down people , but let 's see what happens .
let 's open a dialogue . " following the 12 drawings ' original publication in 2005 , rioting continued in some muslim countries through the beginning of 2006 . three danish embassies were attacked and at least 50 people were killed in protests in 2006 in the middle east , africa and asia . since then , several young muslims have been convicted in denmark of planning bomb attacks partly connected to protests against the cartoons . according to reuters , denmark 's security and intelligence service said tuesday 's arrests near aarhus in the western part of the country were made after lengthy surveillance .
the aim was to prevent a murder , which police said was in the early stages of planning . cartoonist still in hiding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoonist and his wife have been under heavy police protection for months danish media reported that the man of moroccan descent had been released but faced preliminary charges .
the two tunisians are to face deportation later this week . one editorialist in the danish paper politiken commented that the murder plot was an attack on denmark 's democratic culture . " regardless of whether jyllands-posten at the time used freedom of speech unwisely and with damaging consequences , the paper deserves unconditional solidarity when it is threatened with terror , " the editorialist wrote , as cited by reuters . " freedom of expression gives you the right to think , to speak and to draw what you like ... no matter how many terrorist plots there are , " an editorial in the berlingske tidende paper noted , as cited by the afp news agency . generally , the danish press has condemned the alleged murder plot against cartoonist westergaard , who has lived in hiding for the past three months . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just make it efficient , italian says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grillo , who goads politicians , has been called the michael moore of italy would italy really trade " la dolce vita " for a dose of teutonic efficiency ?
one outspoken italian comedian thinks the remedy for his country 's ills lies in a good , old-fashioned military takeover . " take my country - please ! " in a twist on henny youngman 's comic one-liner , a beloved italian comedian satirically appealed to germany to do something it has done repeatedly in the past : launch an invasion . " italy is appealing to the fraternal germans : please declare war on us ! " pleaded stand-up comic beppe grillo .
" we 'll be happy to surrender .
you 're our last hope . neapolitan garbage heads to bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash piled up on naples streets when dumps were full " we are already sending you garbage from campania -lsb- the naples region -rsb- .
please take away our politicians too .
we 'll pay you well to do so ! "
grillo said . the comedian was referring to a deal struck last year between italy and germany that has seen garbage from naples is being carted by train to bremen for incineration , as part of a one-off effort to ease weeks-old waste build-up in the italian city . and , of course , grillo - sometimes referred to as " italy 's michael moore " - he was putting a slight twist on his usual shtick , which is based on poking fun at chaos and corruption in italian life . sixty governments , and counting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elections are a snap if you own the media grillo made his comments - which played off the stereotypes of germans as being über-organized and militarily avaricious , as well as the italian penchant for toppling and building governments at the drop of a hat - in an interview with german newsweekly die zeit .
the interviewer had asked for his two cents on the latest collapse of the italian government and the resignation of prime minister romano prodi . grillo , who has been banned from italian tv but plays live to large audiences in big italian venues , reserved especially scathing remarks for opposition leader and former government head silvio berlusconi .
the media mogul , who owns three major television channels and italy 's biggest publishing group , is seeking a comeback in the april general election . the bliss of being berlusconi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could italians live with german cuisine ?
german chancellor angela merkel ought to think about becoming a media magnate herself , grillo said . " if merkel had three channels and 40 newspapers and magazines , she would not need to form a grand coalition , " grillo said .
" she would just get 80 percent of the votes at every election .
why do n't you suggest this to merkel ? " no word form grillo on whether the benefits of a possible teutonic takeover - ostensibly , a responsive democracy and efficient public service - would outweigh the culinary and lifestyle negatives . sauerkraut instead of spaghetti ? beer over barolo ? more pretzels than pancetta ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 13.02.2008 german parliament to discuss reforming stem cell law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research grabs the spotlight again some scientists and politicians believe the 2002 law restricting the use of stem cells in german research is no longer in sync with modern medicine .
opponents to a change in the law fear abuse of human embryos . the german research foundation , which defines itself as a funding organization that promotes public scientific research , in 2007 called for a loosening of restrictions of germany 's stem cell law , which allows scientists to only work with imported cells created before the national stem cell act was adopted in 2002 .
since the request for altering the law , german politicians from all parties have been defining their various stances on the issue . from politicians who completely oppose the use of human embryonic stem cells to others who want german scientists to have unfettered access to these basic building blocks of life , divisions have n't been drawn according to party affiliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-celled human embryo from a fertility clinic the largest group of parliamentarians , which encompasses both social and christian democrats , including german education and research minister annette schavan and german chancellor angela merkel , suggest a one-time change to the jan .
1 , 2002 restriction .
the group proposes that stem lines from embryos created before 2007 should be allowed to be imported into germany . rene roespel , a social democrat and co-initiator of the proposal , said that the number of stem cell lines available to german scientists would then increase from 40 to 500 . behind the scientific curve emphasizing the chances stem cell research offers to combat disease , german scientists have said their research is impaired by the current law and have called on politicians to ease restrictions on embryonic stem cell research . " we are only able to import embryonic cells created before jan .
1 , 2002 , which makes them quite old and we have to assume that many of them are now genetically damaged or no longer stable , " said juergen hescheler , a stem cell expert at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists say they are behind the research curve due to restrictive laws he said that many german scientists are hoping for a change in the law to allow them to import newer cell lines of better quality . " now , scientists are significantly more careful about preparing and cultivating human embryonic cells , so it is internationally accepted that the newer cell lines are much better , " he said . in addition to the questionable quality of pre-2002 imported cells , joerg hacker , vice-president of the german research foundation , said there was another reason for the call in 2007 for a law reform .

opponents to a change in the law fear abuse of human embryos . the german research foundation , which defines itself as a funding organization that promotes public scientific research , in 2007 called for a loosening of restrictions of germany 's stem cell law , which allows scientists to only work with imported cells created before the national stem cell act was adopted in 2002 .
since the request for altering the law , german politicians from all parties have been defining their various stances on the issue . from politicians who completely oppose the use of human embryonic stem cells to others who want german scientists to have unfettered access to these basic building blocks of life , divisions have n't been drawn according to party affiliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-celled human embryo from a fertility clinic the largest group of parliamentarians , which encompasses both social and christian democrats , including german education and research minister annette schavan and german chancellor angela merkel , suggest a one-time change to the jan .

" we are only able to import embryonic cells created before jan .

they are more than three times richer than the european union average , as measured by gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- per inhabitant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is rich in waterways - and money the poorest members of the eu were all found in parts of romania , bulgaria and poland , where wealth is less than a third of the bloc 's average .
all the figures were based on 2005 gdp data , adjusted to take national price levels into account .
the study was released by eurostat , the eu 's statistical office .
results confirmed studies carried out in previous years .
central london tops the list average gdp per head in central london is estimated at 67,798 euros -lrb- about $ 98,600 -rrb- , some 303 percent of the eu average of 22,400 euros .
by contrast , the eu 's poorest citizens , who live in northeast romania , have to make do with average gdp per head levels of just 7,542 euros - just 24 percent of the eu average .
following london in the regional ranks of gdp per inhabitant were luxembourg , where gdp is 264 percent of the eu average , and brussels , at 241 percent .
hamburg represented the fourth-richest area in the entire eu , at 202 percent of the average gdp .
overall in germany , average gdp was 115 percent above the eu average .
eight of the 42 regions that beat the 125 percent mark were found in germany , five each in the netherlands and the uk , and four each in italy and austria .
comparatively , a full quarter of the eu regions failed to make it over the 75 percent mark .

commuters play a role eurostat cautioned that gdp per inhabitant figures can be strongly influenced by commuter flows , and areas with a large number of commuters did better than regions without .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 13.02.2008 german parliament to discuss reforming stem cell law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research grabs the spotlight again some scientists and politicians believe the 2002 law restricting the use of stem cells in german research is no longer in sync with modern medicine .
opponents to a change in the law fear abuse of human embryos . the german research foundation , which defines itself as a funding organization that promotes public scientific research , in 2007 called for a loosening of restrictions of germany 's stem cell law , which allows scientists to only work with imported cells created before the national stem cell act was adopted in 2002 .
since the request for altering the law , german politicians from all parties have been defining their various stances on the issue . from politicians who completely oppose the use of human embryonic stem cells to others who want german scientists to have unfettered access to these basic building blocks of life , divisions have n't been drawn according to party affiliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-celled human embryo from a fertility clinic the largest group of parliamentarians , which encompasses both social and christian democrats , including german education and research minister annette schavan and german chancellor angela merkel , suggest a one-time change to the jan .
1 , 2002 restriction .
the group proposes that stem lines from embryos created before 2007 should be allowed to be imported into germany . rene roespel , a social democrat and co-initiator of the proposal , said that the number of stem cell lines available to german scientists would then increase from 40 to 500 . behind the scientific curve emphasizing the chances stem cell research offers to combat disease , german scientists have said their research is impaired by the current law and have called on politicians to ease restrictions on embryonic stem cell research . " we are only able to import embryonic cells created before jan .
1 , 2002 , which makes them quite old and we have to assume that many of them are now genetically damaged or no longer stable , " said juergen hescheler , a stem cell expert at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists say they are behind the research curve due to restrictive laws he said that many german scientists are hoping for a change in the law to allow them to import newer cell lines of better quality . " now , scientists are significantly more careful about preparing and cultivating human embryonic cells , so it is internationally accepted that the newer cell lines are much better , " he said . in addition to the questionable quality of pre-2002 imported cells , joerg hacker , vice-president of the german research foundation , said there was another reason for the call in 2007 for a law reform . " there is a risk of punishment of german scientists who work on international projects using stem cells lines from after 2002 , " he explained . currently , scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use post-2002 embryonic cells .
if they do , they run the risk of criminal prosecution at home . stem cell versatility vs. ethical concerns embryonic stem cells can develop into any type of cell , which prompts scientists to believe they offer strong potential for finding cures for diseases such as diabetes , parkinson 's and heart maladies . formerly , the cells could only be extracted by destroying human embryos , which opponents say is equivalent to taking a human life .
germany 's history with nazi medical experiments on humans has also contributed to the national sensitivity with the issue . however , only stem cell lines from " additional " embryos which are not implanted but develop during in vitro fertility treatments come into question under the proposal ; importing lines from embryos generated exclusively for stem cell research remains forbidden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells in a petri dish but even the definition of an embryo itself is a gray area . " there is a clear distinction between pre-embryos and their implantation into the uterus , " said hescheler .
" these -lsb- embryonic cells -rsb- are human material which should be respected , but i do not see them as true embryos with functions and brain or organ development . " he added that " real -lsb- human -rsb- life begins after the acceptance of them by mothers following implantation . " ethics mediators also divided in an opinion piece published in 2007 by germany 's national ethics council , hermann barth argued that the 2002 stem cell law " resulted from a compromise in which both the advocates of comprehensive embryo protection and those in favor of a system oriented towards the freedom of research set aside their own , more far-reaching convictions . " within certain conditions , barth wrote , " this compromise would best be served by opening the door to stem cell research a little wider by means of a prudent amendment of the stem cell law . " the setting of a later cut-off date , albeit in the past , is the appropriate means : it is adequate , takes account of the normative principles of the embryo protection law and conforms to the spirit of the 2002 compromise , " he continued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching stem cells is miles away from applying them in treatments , scientists say other members of the ethics council wrote last year that " a change in the jan .
1 , 2002 cut-off date -lsb- stipulated by the stem cell law -rsb- would essentially mean to endorse the destruction of embryos abroad and to profit from procedures which are banned -lsb- in germany -rsb- by the embryo protection law . " a 1990 embryo protection law prohibits any utilization of embryos that does not serve their preservation .
a logical consequence , those members argued , would then have to include a reevaluation of germany 's embryo protection law . " in this case , it would have to be evaluated whether or not it would not be more consistent to use embryos ... and fertilized eggs , which can no longer be employed for reproduction purposes for research , rather than importing ... cells from abroad , " council members wrote . but until such a debate takes place " it is the import law which is currently under consideration and debate , " hacker stressed . a shift in the debate ironically , advances in science may help to take the heat off the ethical debate .
last november , teams of us and japanese researchers said they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells . on the surface , this could mean that scientists would no longer have to rely on embryonic stem cells . but , cautioned hacker , " these new , reprogrammed cells still have to be compared with real embryonic stem cell lines to see if they function they same way . " shortly after the november announcement of the scientific breakthrough , the german government announced it would double its funding for stem cell research from 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.4 million -rrb- to just under 10 million euros , albeit only for adult stem cells . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 13.02.2008 german parliament to discuss reforming stem cell law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research grabs the spotlight again some scientists and politicians believe the 2002 law restricting the use of stem cells in german research is no longer in sync with modern medicine .
opponents to a change in the law fear abuse of human embryos . the german research foundation , which defines itself as a funding organization that promotes public scientific research , in 2007 called for a loosening of restrictions of germany 's stem cell law , which allows scientists to only work with imported cells created before the national stem cell act was adopted in 2002 .
since the request for altering the law , german politicians from all parties have been defining their various stances on the issue . from politicians who completely oppose the use of human embryonic stem cells to others who want german scientists to have unfettered access to these basic building blocks of life , divisions have n't been drawn according to party affiliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-celled human embryo from a fertility clinic the largest group of parliamentarians , which encompasses both social and christian democrats , including german education and research minister annette schavan and german chancellor angela merkel , suggest a one-time change to the jan .
1 , 2002 restriction .
the group proposes that stem lines from embryos created before 2007 should be allowed to be imported into germany . rene roespel , a social democrat and co-initiator of the proposal , said that the number of stem cell lines available to german scientists would then increase from 40 to 500 . behind the scientific curve emphasizing the chances stem cell research offers to combat disease , german scientists have said their research is impaired by the current law and have called on politicians to ease restrictions on embryonic stem cell research . " we are only able to import embryonic cells created before jan .
1 , 2002 , which makes them quite old and we have to assume that many of them are now genetically damaged or no longer stable , " said juergen hescheler , a stem cell expert at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists say they are behind the research curve due to restrictive laws he said that many german scientists are hoping for a change in the law to allow them to import newer cell lines of better quality . " now , scientists are significantly more careful about preparing and cultivating human embryonic cells , so it is internationally accepted that the newer cell lines are much better , " he said . in addition to the questionable quality of pre-2002 imported cells , joerg hacker , vice-president of the german research foundation , said there was another reason for the call in 2007 for a law reform . " there is a risk of punishment of german scientists who work on international projects using stem cells lines from after 2002 , " he explained . currently , scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use post-2002 embryonic cells .
if they do , they run the risk of criminal prosecution at home . stem cell versatility vs. ethical concerns embryonic stem cells can develop into any type of cell , which prompts scientists to believe they offer strong potential for finding cures for diseases such as diabetes , parkinson 's and heart maladies . formerly , the cells could only be extracted by destroying human embryos , which opponents say is equivalent to taking a human life .
germany 's history with nazi medical experiments on humans has also contributed to the national sensitivity with the issue . however , only stem cell lines from " additional " embryos which are not implanted but develop during in vitro fertility treatments come into question under the proposal ; importing lines from embryos generated exclusively for stem cell research remains forbidden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells in a petri dish but even the definition of an embryo itself is a gray area . " there is a clear distinction between pre-embryos and their implantation into the uterus , " said hescheler .
" these -lsb- embryonic cells -rsb- are human material which should be respected , but i do not see them as true embryos with functions and brain or organ development . " he added that " real -lsb- human -rsb- life begins after the acceptance of them by mothers following implantation . " ethics mediators also divided in an opinion piece published in 2007 by germany 's national ethics council , hermann barth argued that the 2002 stem cell law " resulted from a compromise in which both the advocates of comprehensive embryo protection and those in favor of a system oriented towards the freedom of research set aside their own , more far-reaching convictions . " within certain conditions , barth wrote , " this compromise would best be served by opening the door to stem cell research a little wider by means of a prudent amendment of the stem cell law . " the setting of a later cut-off date , albeit in the past , is the appropriate means : it is adequate , takes account of the normative principles of the embryo protection law and conforms to the spirit of the 2002 compromise , " he continued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching stem cells is miles away from applying them in treatments , scientists say other members of the ethics council wrote last year that " a change in the jan .
1 , 2002 cut-off date -lsb- stipulated by the stem cell law -rsb- would essentially mean to endorse the destruction of embryos abroad and to profit from procedures which are banned -lsb- in germany -rsb- by the embryo protection law . " a 1990 embryo protection law prohibits any utilization of embryos that does not serve their preservation .
a logical consequence , those members argued , would then have to include a reevaluation of germany 's embryo protection law . " in this case , it would have to be evaluated whether or not it would not be more consistent to use embryos ... and fertilized eggs , which can no longer be employed for reproduction purposes for research , rather than importing ... cells from abroad , " council members wrote . but until such a debate takes place " it is the import law which is currently under consideration and debate , " hacker stressed . a shift in the debate ironically , advances in science may help to take the heat off the ethical debate .
last november , teams of us and japanese researchers said they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells . on the surface , this could mean that scientists would no longer have to rely on embryonic stem cells . but , cautioned hacker , " these new , reprogrammed cells still have to be compared with real embryonic stem cell lines to see if they function they same way . " shortly after the november announcement of the scientific breakthrough , the german government announced it would double its funding for stem cell research from 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.4 million -rrb- to just under 10 million euros , albeit only for adult stem cells . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brussels said the steps are needed to guarantee the free movement of europeans inside the schengen no-borders area . the plan , which was presented on wednesday , feb .
13 , could see eu funds used to develop surveillance equipment like cameras , sensors and pilot-less drones .
civil libertarians argue that the controversial measures infringe on people 's privacy and wo n't fight crime . " secure travel through collective responsibility " but proponents of the plan called the proposals " further building blocks in the often stated aim of the european union to build a space of free and secure travel through collective responsibility and solidarity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opportunities for visa-free travel inside the eu increased in december 2007 the plan would help eu customs , police and justice authorities better manage the estimated 300 million external border crossings each year at europe 's 1,792 designated frontier check points . moreover , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said , the measures would target the biggest category of illegal immigrants in europe : people who over-stay their visas . if the 27 eu nations approve the plans , which the italian commissioner hopes will enter force between 2010 and 2015 , people traveling to europe would be screened for security risks at several levels . to get a short-term visa , they would have to provide biometric and other details to the consulate concerned in their country of residence , which would be entered into the visa information system database . system would troll for expired visas on arrival , this data would be checked with a new entry-exit register that would note the time and place of entry of any non-eu national .
it would then send an alert once their visas expire and no exit has been recorded . the extra security measures could be compensated by accelerated , automated check-in procedures for registered travelers considered safe by consular authorities . " the citizens of the eu have earned our attention , " frattini wrote on his web site .
" we have to keep their daily subway or bus ride from turning into a death zone . " all eu states except britain , ireland , cyprus , romania and bulgaria are part of the borderless area , to which non-eu members norway and iceland also belong . similar to us ports of entry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several of frattini 's security proposals have met with stiff opposition frattini said the register would be similar to the electronic scanning of fingerprints and eyes at us ports of entry and would " make better use of technology . "
biometric security checks are already in place in airports in frankfurt , london and stockholm . the initiative would only come into force upon approval by the european parliament and by member states .
frattini has not said how much he expects the security measures to cost . on top of addressing a potential terrorist threat , officials in brussels said the plan is also geared toward cracking down on the thousands of foreigners who enter the eu on a valid visa but then become illegal immigrants by overstaying their visit . " these people are a main factor behind illegal immigration , " frattini said last month at an informal meeting of eu interior ministers . part of series of new security checks the new system , however , would only record the identities of people who enter the 27-member bloc legally , not the hundreds of thousands estimated to immigrate to the eu illegally each year . frattini 's proposals have come under fire from civil liberties advocates , who say they pose a formidable threat to people 's privacy . " more and more surveillance measures are called for , decided and put in place , but actual security benefits are seen less and less , " wolfgang kreissl-doerfler , a german member of the european parliament , said in a statement .

he 's better received in germany than anywhere else right now and no one shows as much understanding for israel and its security needs than berlin . but angela merkel 's demonstrative friendship , which differentiates her from her predecessor gerhard schröder , could harm israel more than help it .
she 's supporting israel in the wrong way - a way that wo n't bring peace to the jewish state . " we advocate the two-state solution together with israel , " said merkel before her meeting with olmert .
but , unfortunately , that 's not exactly true .

the series continues in switzerland . marcel lives in zurich and works as a senior claims handler .
he lives with his partner in an 80-square-meter -lrb- 860-square-feet -rrb- apartment 10 minutes by tram from the center of the city . monthly income : 12,000 swiss francs -lrb- 7,428 euros , $ 10,980 -rrb- rent : 1,550 swiss francs per month -lrb- 959 euros , $ 1,418 -rrb- monthly utilities : 180 swiss francs -lrb- 111.37 euros , $ 164.65 -rrb- bus / metro ticket : 2.50 swiss francs -lrb- 1.55 euros , $ 2.29 -rrb- one liter milk : 1.50 swiss francs -lrb- 0.92 euros , $ 1.97 -rrb- loaf of bread : 1.30 swiss francs -lrb- 0.80 euros , $ 1.88 -rrb- domestic stamp : 0.85 swiss francs -lrb- 0.52 euros , $ .077 -rrb- movie ticket : 18 swiss francs -lrb- 11.13 euros , $ 16.46 -rrb- have you noticed that things have become more expensive recently ? yes , gas , but we use the car very rarely .
bank fees also . to what extent does inflation affect you ? according to the federal institute of statistics , the average inflation was 0.7 percent here in 2007 .
the forecast for 2008 is 1.5 percent because of the petroleum prices and again because banks will rise interest rates . how easy is it for you to get by ? easy because we are dinkies - double income no kids . would an increase in your wages be necessary to make it easier for you to meet you basic needs ? more money is always good , but , at the same time , the tax rate also increases because we have a progressive tax system , not a linear one . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? it 's good that we are not part of the eu .
our unemployment rate is much lower than in the rest of europe and a lot of people are immigrating to switzerland - especially germans - because the taxes are lower .

bank fees also . to what extent does inflation affect you ? according to the federal institute of statistics , the average inflation was 0.7 percent here in 2007 .
the forecast for 2008 is 1.5 percent because of the petroleum prices and again because banks will rise interest rates . how easy is it for you to get by ? easy because we are dinkies - double income no kids . would an increase in your wages be necessary to make it easier for you to meet you basic needs ? more money is always good , but , at the same time , the tax rate also increases because we have a progressive tax system , not a linear one . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? it 's good that we are not part of the eu .
our unemployment rate is much lower than in the rest of europe and a lot of people are immigrating to switzerland - especially germans - because the taxes are lower .

as fears of a recession circle the globe , dw-world.de asked people from seven european countries about their impressions of the cost of living .
the series continues in luxembourg . leonor was born in france and is currently living in luxembourg city where she works as a personal assistant .
she shares a house in the center of the city with five others . monthly income : 2,300 euros -lrb- $ 3,400 -rrb- rent : 550 euros per month -lrb- $ 813 -rrb- monthly utilities : 50 euros -lrb- $ 73.90 -rrb- bus / metro ticket : 1.30 euros -lrb- $ 1.90 -rrb- one liter milk : 1 euro -lrb- $ 1.48 -rrb- loaf of bread : 0.80 euros -lrb- $ 1.18 -rrb- domestic stamp : 0.50 euros -lrb- $ 0.74 -rrb- movie ticket : 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 12.55 -rrb- to what extent does inflation affect you ? in luxembourg we do n't " feel " inflation like my parents who live in france do for example .
here the salaries are good , so we have more possibilities and it 's easy to earn money . how easy is it for you to get by ? for the first time in my life i do n't have a problem at the end of the month , because here the salaries are higher than in other european countries .
of course , the rent and the everyday living are higher too , but still it 's easy to have a good lifestyle . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? in the last few months i 've felt europe is not as strong as it used to be .
when i talk with my friends in france they say it 's becoming harder each day because salaries are blocked but prices are growing . in luxembourg salaries are evaluated through indexation , so when the prices grow 0.5 percent the salaries also grow 0.5 percent .
this usually happens once a year .
however , the problem in luxembourg is that house prices are growing every month and so it becomes difficult to find a flat to rent or to buy on your own .
that 's why most people here share a house . between france and luxembourg the economic issues are different , but still these two small examples show us how difficult it will be for us to keep living in europe and how difficult it will be for foreigners to arrive and work here .
in luxembourg most workers in every sector come from another country . nb .

she shares a house in the center of the city with five others . monthly income : 2,300 euros -lrb- $ 3,400 -rrb- rent : 550 euros per month -lrb- $ 813 -rrb- monthly utilities : 50 euros -lrb- $ 73.90 -rrb- bus / metro ticket : 1.30 euros -lrb- $ 1.90 -rrb- one liter milk : 1 euro -lrb- $ 1.48 -rrb- loaf of bread : 0.80 euros -lrb- $ 1.18 -rrb- domestic stamp : 0.50 euros -lrb- $ 0.74 -rrb- movie ticket : 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 12.55 -rrb- to what extent does inflation affect you ? in luxembourg we do n't " feel " inflation like my parents who live in france do for example .
here the salaries are good , so we have more possibilities and it 's easy to earn money . how easy is it for you to get by ? for the first time in my life i do n't have a problem at the end of the month , because here the salaries are higher than in other european countries .
of course , the rent and the everyday living are higher too , but still it 's easy to have a good lifestyle . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? in the last few months i 've felt europe is not as strong as it used to be .
when i talk with my friends in france they say it 's becoming harder each day because salaries are blocked but prices are growing . in luxembourg salaries are evaluated through indexation , so when the prices grow 0.5 percent the salaries also grow 0.5 percent .
this usually happens once a year .
however , the problem in luxembourg is that house prices are growing every month and so it becomes difficult to find a flat to rent or to buy on your own .
that 's why most people here share a house . between france and luxembourg the economic issues are different , but still these two small examples show us how difficult it will be for us to keep living in europe and how difficult it will be for foreigners to arrive and work here .
in luxembourg most workers in every sector come from another country . nb .

as fears of a recession circle the globe , dw-world.de asked people from seven european countries about their impressions of the cost of living .
the series continues in luxembourg . leonor was born in france and is currently living in luxembourg city where she works as a personal assistant .
she shares a house in the center of the city with five others . monthly income : 2,300 euros -lrb- $ 3,400 -rrb- rent : 550 euros per month -lrb- $ 813 -rrb- monthly utilities : 50 euros -lrb- $ 73.90 -rrb- bus / metro ticket : 1.30 euros -lrb- $ 1.90 -rrb- one liter milk : 1 euro -lrb- $ 1.48 -rrb- loaf of bread : 0.80 euros -lrb- $ 1.18 -rrb- domestic stamp : 0.50 euros -lrb- $ 0.74 -rrb- movie ticket : 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 12.55 -rrb- to what extent does inflation affect you ? in luxembourg we do n't " feel " inflation like my parents who live in france do for example .

of course , the rent and the everyday living are higher too , but still it 's easy to have a good lifestyle . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? in the last few months i 've felt europe is not as strong as it used to be .
when i talk with my friends in france they say it 's becoming harder each day because salaries are blocked but prices are growing . in luxembourg salaries are evaluated through indexation , so when the prices grow 0.5 percent the salaries also grow 0.5 percent .
this usually happens once a year .
however , the problem in luxembourg is that house prices are growing every month and so it becomes difficult to find a flat to rent or to buy on your own .
that 's why most people here share a house . between france and luxembourg the economic issues are different , but still these two small examples show us how difficult it will be for us to keep living in europe and how difficult it will be for foreigners to arrive and work here .
in luxembourg most workers in every sector come from another country . nb .

bank fees also . to what extent does inflation affect you ? according to the federal institute of statistics , the average inflation was 0.7 percent here in 2007 .
the forecast for 2008 is 1.5 percent because of the petroleum prices and again because banks will rise interest rates . how easy is it for you to get by ? easy because we are dinkies - double income no kids . would an increase in your wages be necessary to make it easier for you to meet you basic needs ? more money is always good , but , at the same time , the tax rate also increases because we have a progressive tax system , not a linear one . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? it 's good that we are not part of the eu .
our unemployment rate is much lower than in the rest of europe and a lot of people are immigrating to switzerland - especially germans - because the taxes are lower .
value-added tax is some 19 to 21 percent in the eu and 2.4 to 7.6 percent in switzerland .

as fears of a recession circle the globe , dw-world.de asked people from seven european countries about their impressions of the cost of living .

she shares a house in the center of the city with five others . monthly income : 2,300 euros -lrb- $ 3,400 -rrb- rent : 550 euros per month -lrb- $ 813 -rrb- monthly utilities : 50 euros -lrb- $ 73.90 -rrb- bus / metro ticket : 1.30 euros -lrb- $ 1.90 -rrb- one liter milk : 1 euro -lrb- $ 1.48 -rrb- loaf of bread : 0.80 euros -lrb- $ 1.18 -rrb- domestic stamp : 0.50 euros -lrb- $ 0.74 -rrb- movie ticket : 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 12.55 -rrb- to what extent does inflation affect you ? in luxembourg we do n't " feel " inflation like my parents who live in france do for example .
here the salaries are good , so we have more possibilities and it 's easy to earn money . how easy is it for you to get by ? for the first time in my life i do n't have a problem at the end of the month , because here the salaries are higher than in other european countries .
of course , the rent and the everyday living are higher too , but still it 's easy to have a good lifestyle . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? in the last few months i 've felt europe is not as strong as it used to be .
when i talk with my friends in france they say it 's becoming harder each day because salaries are blocked but prices are growing . in luxembourg salaries are evaluated through indexation , so when the prices grow 0.5 percent the salaries also grow 0.5 percent .
this usually happens once a year .
however , the problem in luxembourg is that house prices are growing every month and so it becomes difficult to find a flat to rent or to buy on your own .
that 's why most people here share a house . between france and luxembourg the economic issues are different , but still these two small examples show us how difficult it will be for us to keep living in europe and how difficult it will be for foreigners to arrive and work here .
in luxembourg most workers in every sector come from another country . nb .

they are more than three times richer than the european union average , as measured by gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- per inhabitant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is rich in waterways - and money the poorest members of the eu were all found in parts of romania , bulgaria and poland , where wealth is less than a third of the bloc 's average .
all the figures were based on 2005 gdp data , adjusted to take national price levels into account .
the study was released by eurostat , the eu 's statistical office .
results confirmed studies carried out in previous years .
central london tops the list average gdp per head in central london is estimated at 67,798 euros -lrb- about $ 98,600 -rrb- , some 303 percent of the eu average of 22,400 euros .
by contrast , the eu 's poorest citizens , who live in northeast romania , have to make do with average gdp per head levels of just 7,542 euros - just 24 percent of the eu average .
following london in the regional ranks of gdp per inhabitant were luxembourg , where gdp is 264 percent of the eu average , and brussels , at 241 percent .
hamburg represented the fourth-richest area in the entire eu , at 202 percent of the average gdp .
overall in germany , average gdp was 115 percent above the eu average .
eight of the 42 regions that beat the 125 percent mark were found in germany , five each in the netherlands and the uk , and four each in italy and austria .
comparatively , a full quarter of the eu regions failed to make it over the 75 percent mark .
the poorest were in bulgaria , romania and poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poorest part of the eu is in romania within germany , the wealthiest regions after hamburg were upper bavaria -lrb- 166 percent -rrb- , darmstadt -lrb- 158 percent -rrb- and bremen -lrb- 157 -rrb- .
but germany 's poorest region , northeastern brandenburg , managed only 74 percent of the eu average .
commuters play a role eurostat cautioned that gdp per inhabitant figures can be strongly influenced by commuter flows , and areas with a large number of commuters did better than regions without .
net commuter inflows in areas like central london " push up production to a level that could not be achieved by the resident active population on its own , " eurostat said in a statement .
" the result is that gdp per inhabitant appears to be overestimated in these regions and underestimated in regions with commuter outflows . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 13.02.2008 german parliament to discuss reforming stem cell law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research grabs the spotlight again some scientists and politicians believe the 2002 law restricting the use of stem cells in german research is no longer in sync with modern medicine .
opponents to a change in the law fear abuse of human embryos . the german research foundation , which defines itself as a funding organization that promotes public scientific research , in 2007 called for a loosening of restrictions of germany 's stem cell law , which allows scientists to only work with imported cells created before the national stem cell act was adopted in 2002 .
since the request for altering the law , german politicians from all parties have been defining their various stances on the issue . from politicians who completely oppose the use of human embryonic stem cells to others who want german scientists to have unfettered access to these basic building blocks of life , divisions have n't been drawn according to party affiliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-celled human embryo from a fertility clinic the largest group of parliamentarians , which encompasses both social and christian democrats , including german education and research minister annette schavan and german chancellor angela merkel , suggest a one-time change to the jan .
1 , 2002 restriction .
the group proposes that stem lines from embryos created before 2007 should be allowed to be imported into germany . rene roespel , a social democrat and co-initiator of the proposal , said that the number of stem cell lines available to german scientists would then increase from 40 to 500 . behind the scientific curve emphasizing the chances stem cell research offers to combat disease , german scientists have said their research is impaired by the current law and have called on politicians to ease restrictions on embryonic stem cell research . " we are only able to import embryonic cells created before jan .
1 , 2002 , which makes them quite old and we have to assume that many of them are now genetically damaged or no longer stable , " said juergen hescheler , a stem cell expert at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists say they are behind the research curve due to restrictive laws he said that many german scientists are hoping for a change in the law to allow them to import newer cell lines of better quality . " now , scientists are significantly more careful about preparing and cultivating human embryonic cells , so it is internationally accepted that the newer cell lines are much better , " he said . in addition to the questionable quality of pre-2002 imported cells , joerg hacker , vice-president of the german research foundation , said there was another reason for the call in 2007 for a law reform .

opponents to a change in the law fear abuse of human embryos . the german research foundation , which defines itself as a funding organization that promotes public scientific research , in 2007 called for a loosening of restrictions of germany 's stem cell law , which allows scientists to only work with imported cells created before the national stem cell act was adopted in 2002 .
since the request for altering the law , german politicians from all parties have been defining their various stances on the issue . from politicians who completely oppose the use of human embryonic stem cells to others who want german scientists to have unfettered access to these basic building blocks of life , divisions have n't been drawn according to party affiliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-celled human embryo from a fertility clinic the largest group of parliamentarians , which encompasses both social and christian democrats , including german education and research minister annette schavan and german chancellor angela merkel , suggest a one-time change to the jan .

opponents to a change in the law fear abuse of human embryos . the german research foundation , which defines itself as a funding organization that promotes public scientific research , in 2007 called for a loosening of restrictions of germany 's stem cell law , which allows scientists to only work with imported cells created before the national stem cell act was adopted in 2002 .
since the request for altering the law , german politicians from all parties have been defining their various stances on the issue . from politicians who completely oppose the use of human embryonic stem cells to others who want german scientists to have unfettered access to these basic building blocks of life , divisions have n't been drawn according to party affiliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-celled human embryo from a fertility clinic the largest group of parliamentarians , which encompasses both social and christian democrats , including german education and research minister annette schavan and german chancellor angela merkel , suggest a one-time change to the jan .
1 , 2002 restriction .
the group proposes that stem lines from embryos created before 2007 should be allowed to be imported into germany . rene roespel , a social democrat and co-initiator of the proposal , said that the number of stem cell lines available to german scientists would then increase from 40 to 500 . behind the scientific curve emphasizing the chances stem cell research offers to combat disease , german scientists have said their research is impaired by the current law and have called on politicians to ease restrictions on embryonic stem cell research . " we are only able to import embryonic cells created before jan .
1 , 2002 , which makes them quite old and we have to assume that many of them are now genetically damaged or no longer stable , " said juergen hescheler , a stem cell expert at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists say they are behind the research curve due to restrictive laws he said that many german scientists are hoping for a change in the law to allow them to import newer cell lines of better quality . " now , scientists are significantly more careful about preparing and cultivating human embryonic cells , so it is internationally accepted that the newer cell lines are much better , " he said . in addition to the questionable quality of pre-2002 imported cells , joerg hacker , vice-president of the german research foundation , said there was another reason for the call in 2007 for a law reform . " there is a risk of punishment of german scientists who work on international projects using stem cells lines from after 2002 , " he explained . currently , scientists are n't allowed to participate in international research projects that use post-2002 embryonic cells .
if they do , they run the risk of criminal prosecution at home . stem cell versatility vs. ethical concerns embryonic stem cells can develop into any type of cell , which prompts scientists to believe they offer strong potential for finding cures for diseases such as diabetes , parkinson 's and heart maladies . formerly , the cells could only be extracted by destroying human embryos , which opponents say is equivalent to taking a human life .
germany 's history with nazi medical experiments on humans has also contributed to the national sensitivity with the issue . however , only stem cell lines from " additional " embryos which are not implanted but develop during in vitro fertility treatments come into question under the proposal ; importing lines from embryos generated exclusively for stem cell research remains forbidden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells in a petri dish but even the definition of an embryo itself is a gray area . " there is a clear distinction between pre-embryos and their implantation into the uterus , " said hescheler .
" these -lsb- embryonic cells -rsb- are human material which should be respected , but i do not see them as true embryos with functions and brain or organ development . " he added that " real -lsb- human -rsb- life begins after the acceptance of them by mothers following implantation . " ethics mediators also divided in an opinion piece published in 2007 by germany 's national ethics council , hermann barth argued that the 2002 stem cell law " resulted from a compromise in which both the advocates of comprehensive embryo protection and those in favor of a system oriented towards the freedom of research set aside their own , more far-reaching convictions . " within certain conditions , barth wrote , " this compromise would best be served by opening the door to stem cell research a little wider by means of a prudent amendment of the stem cell law . " the setting of a later cut-off date , albeit in the past , is the appropriate means : it is adequate , takes account of the normative principles of the embryo protection law and conforms to the spirit of the 2002 compromise , " he continued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researching stem cells is miles away from applying them in treatments , scientists say other members of the ethics council wrote last year that " a change in the jan .
1 , 2002 cut-off date -lsb- stipulated by the stem cell law -rsb- would essentially mean to endorse the destruction of embryos abroad and to profit from procedures which are banned -lsb- in germany -rsb- by the embryo protection law . " a 1990 embryo protection law prohibits any utilization of embryos that does not serve their preservation .
a logical consequence , those members argued , would then have to include a reevaluation of germany 's embryo protection law . " in this case , it would have to be evaluated whether or not it would not be more consistent to use embryos ... and fertilized eggs , which can no longer be employed for reproduction purposes for research , rather than importing ... cells from abroad , " council members wrote . but until such a debate takes place " it is the import law which is currently under consideration and debate , " hacker stressed . a shift in the debate ironically , advances in science may help to take the heat off the ethical debate .
last november , teams of us and japanese researchers said they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells . on the surface , this could mean that scientists would no longer have to rely on embryonic stem cells . but , cautioned hacker , " these new , reprogrammed cells still have to be compared with real embryonic stem cell lines to see if they function they same way . " shortly after the november announcement of the scientific breakthrough , the german government announced it would double its funding for stem cell research from 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.4 million -rrb- to just under 10 million euros , albeit only for adult stem cells . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are more than three times richer than the european union average , as measured by gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- per inhabitant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is rich in waterways - and money the poorest members of the eu were all found in parts of romania , bulgaria and poland , where wealth is less than a third of the bloc 's average .
all the figures were based on 2005 gdp data , adjusted to take national price levels into account .
the study was released by eurostat , the eu 's statistical office .
results confirmed studies carried out in previous years .
central london tops the list average gdp per head in central london is estimated at 67,798 euros -lrb- about $ 98,600 -rrb- , some 303 percent of the eu average of 22,400 euros .
by contrast , the eu 's poorest citizens , who live in northeast romania , have to make do with average gdp per head levels of just 7,542 euros - just 24 percent of the eu average .
following london in the regional ranks of gdp per inhabitant were luxembourg , where gdp is 264 percent of the eu average , and brussels , at 241 percent .
hamburg represented the fourth-richest area in the entire eu , at 202 percent of the average gdp .
overall in germany , average gdp was 115 percent above the eu average .
eight of the 42 regions that beat the 125 percent mark were found in germany , five each in the netherlands and the uk , and four each in italy and austria .
comparatively , a full quarter of the eu regions failed to make it over the 75 percent mark .
the poorest were in bulgaria , romania and poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poorest part of the eu is in romania within germany , the wealthiest regions after hamburg were upper bavaria -lrb- 166 percent -rrb- , darmstadt -lrb- 158 percent -rrb- and bremen -lrb- 157 -rrb- .
but germany 's poorest region , northeastern brandenburg , managed only 74 percent of the eu average .
commuters play a role eurostat cautioned that gdp per inhabitant figures can be strongly influenced by commuter flows , and areas with a large number of commuters did better than regions without .
net commuter inflows in areas like central london " push up production to a level that could not be achieved by the resident active population on its own , " eurostat said in a statement .
" the result is that gdp per inhabitant appears to be overestimated in these regions and underestimated in regions with commuter outflows . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just make it efficient , italian says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grillo , who goads politicians , has been called the michael moore of italy would italy really trade " la dolce vita " for a dose of teutonic efficiency ?
one outspoken italian comedian thinks the remedy for his country 's ills lies in a good , old-fashioned military takeover . " take my country - please ! " in a twist on henny youngman 's comic one-liner , a beloved italian comedian satirically appealed to germany to do something it has done repeatedly in the past : launch an invasion . " italy is appealing to the fraternal germans : please declare war on us ! " pleaded stand-up comic beppe grillo .
" we 'll be happy to surrender .
you 're our last hope . neapolitan garbage heads to bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash piled up on naples streets when dumps were full " we are already sending you garbage from campania -lsb- the naples region -rsb- .
please take away our politicians too .
we 'll pay you well to do so ! "
grillo said . the comedian was referring to a deal struck last year between italy and germany that has seen garbage from naples is being carted by train to bremen for incineration , as part of a one-off effort to ease weeks-old waste build-up in the italian city . and , of course , grillo - sometimes referred to as " italy 's michael moore " - he was putting a slight twist on his usual shtick , which is based on poking fun at chaos and corruption in italian life . sixty governments , and counting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elections are a snap if you own the media grillo made his comments - which played off the stereotypes of germans as being über-organized and militarily avaricious , as well as the italian penchant for toppling and building governments at the drop of a hat - in an interview with german newsweekly die zeit .
the interviewer had asked for his two cents on the latest collapse of the italian government and the resignation of prime minister romano prodi . grillo , who has been banned from italian tv but plays live to large audiences in big italian venues , reserved especially scathing remarks for opposition leader and former government head silvio berlusconi .
the media mogul , who owns three major television channels and italy 's biggest publishing group , is seeking a comeback in the april general election . the bliss of being berlusconi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could italians live with german cuisine ?
german chancellor angela merkel ought to think about becoming a media magnate herself , grillo said . " if merkel had three channels and 40 newspapers and magazines , she would not need to form a grand coalition , " grillo said .
" she would just get 80 percent of the votes at every election .
why do n't you suggest this to merkel ? " no word form grillo on whether the benefits of a possible teutonic takeover - ostensibly , a responsive democracy and efficient public service - would outweigh the culinary and lifestyle negatives . sauerkraut instead of spaghetti ? beer over barolo ? more pretzels than pancetta ?

" though official figures are not yet out for 2007 , we can expect losses of around several million euros , " a brockhaus spokesperson said earlier this week . consolidating online bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander bob brockhaus , head of the company the publisher 's management is reviewing ways to reduce costs , which could also include slashing around 50 jobs at the mannheim office .
brockhaus employs nearly 450 people nationwide , around 250 of whom are in mannheim . brockhaus is planning to launch its free encyclopedic portal in mid-april , with the publisher banking on its soundly researched information to set itself apart from wikipedia , which can be edited by all internet users . " brockhaus online will provide relevant , reviewed information from all fields of knowledge , " a press statement said . the brockhaus branch in leipzig , which includes about 60 employees , was transformed into a purely online editorial office last year . brockhaus said it would fund its new internet product through advertising .
the company also intends to create an online service for schools that will be free of advertising . the future is online " market analyses clearly show that customers will research specific information on the internet more and more in the future , " the brockhaus spokesperson said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will wikipedia users head to brockhaus ' ad-supported entries ?
the 21st edition of the brockhaus encyclopedia was likely the last in printed form .
" now , everything will happen online , " the spokesperson said . " but , we will clearly distinguish ourselves from providers like wikipedia , by banking on relevance , accuracy and reliability , " the spokesperson said .
" and , our information can not be manipulated . " the online reference work wikipedia was established in 2001 , with the aim of having internet users themselves create the encyclopedia 's content .
the web site 's democratic nature has made some of its entries on contested subjects prone to manipulation .
several studies have , however , shown that wikipedia 's error rates are on par with those of major encyclopedias . millions of people around the world use the service .

italians even staged a pasta boycott last year to show their anger at rising food prices and weakened purchasing power due to stagnant salaries . in december , poland 's annual inflation rate accelerated by 4 percent , the highest in years .
poland has had strong economic growth since joining the eu , helped by a surge in foreign investment creating new jobs . across the euro zone the eu reported a rise in inflation , to 3.2 percent in january - a six-and-a-half-year high . still , the eu was quick to point out that european inflation , post-euro , is lower than it was in the 1970s , when " average inflation in the euro-area members ... reached over 9 percent following the two oil price shocks .

as fears of a recession circle the globe , dw-world.de asked people from seven european countries about their impressions of the cost of living .

of course , the rent and the everyday living are higher too , but still it 's easy to have a good lifestyle . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? in the last few months i 've felt europe is not as strong as it used to be .
when i talk with my friends in france they say it 's becoming harder each day because salaries are blocked but prices are growing . in luxembourg salaries are evaluated through indexation , so when the prices grow 0.5 percent the salaries also grow 0.5 percent .
this usually happens once a year .
however , the problem in luxembourg is that house prices are growing every month and so it becomes difficult to find a flat to rent or to buy on your own .
that 's why most people here share a house . between france and luxembourg the economic issues are different , but still these two small examples show us how difficult it will be for us to keep living in europe and how difficult it will be for foreigners to arrive and work here .

she shares an apartment with two others and describes her bedroom as " the size of shoebox . "
on the plus side she said it is in a " desirable area , " primrose hill - only 15 minutes on the metro to the west end .
the location is " quiet with wide streets and trees and parks , lots of cafes and delis and restaurants and feels very european .

these figures become a part of every day life and it becomes the norm . to what extent does inflation affect you ? i do n't really look at inflation and how it affects me on a day to day basis .
i get on with things and tend to accept it as it is as i have no control over it . how easy is it for you to get by ? i struggle every month , the hardest being january , with five weeks until pay day and you have christmas and new years to get through . would an increase in your wages be necessary to make it easier for you to meet you basic needs ? the more i earn the more i spend .
i think i cover basic needs , but some months i have to buy food on credit . nb .

as fears of a recession circle the globe , dw-world.de asked people from seven european countries about their impressions of the cost of living .
the series continues in luxembourg . leonor was born in france and is currently living in luxembourg city where she works as a personal assistant .

of course , the rent and the everyday living are higher too , but still it 's easy to have a good lifestyle . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? in the last few months i 've felt europe is not as strong as it used to be .
when i talk with my friends in france they say it 's becoming harder each day because salaries are blocked but prices are growing . in luxembourg salaries are evaluated through indexation , so when the prices grow 0.5 percent the salaries also grow 0.5 percent .
this usually happens once a year .
however , the problem in luxembourg is that house prices are growing every month and so it becomes difficult to find a flat to rent or to buy on your own .
that 's why most people here share a house . between france and luxembourg the economic issues are different , but still these two small examples show us how difficult it will be for us to keep living in europe and how difficult it will be for foreigners to arrive and work here .

the increasingly endangered animals ' numbers have fallen to 1,411 , down from 3,642 in the last major survey in 2002 .
wildlife activists blame poaching and urbanisation for the decline and say the authorities must do more .
last year , federal authorities announced the creation of a special force to protect tigers .
but it is unclear whether it has worked .
the latest census , released on tuesday , said that there had been a decline in tiger population all over india .
the only exception was the southern state of tamil nadu where the animals ' numbers had gone up to 76 from 60 five years ago .
' time to act ' counting could not be carried out in the states of chhattisgarh and jharkhand due to law and order problems , the report said .
and the exercise was still going on in sundarbans in the eastern state of west bengal , the report added .
rajesh gopal of india 's project tiger said the census showed that " though the tiger has suffered due to direct poaching , loss of quality habitat and loss of its prey , there is still hope " .
wildlife experts say urgent efforts should be made to save the animals .
" it is now time to act and save tigers from human beings .
we have to create inviolate areas for tigers and provide modern weapons to forest guards , " conservationist valmik thapar told hindustan times newspaper .
experts blame the government for failing to crack down on poachers and the illegal trade in tiger skins .
tigers are poached for their body parts - skins are prized for fashion and tiger bones are used for oriental medicines .
tiger pelts can fetch up to $ 12,500 in china .
according to reports , there were 40,000 tigers in india a century ago .
the country is home to 40 % of the world 's tigers , with 23 tiger reserves in 17 states .

the estuary has been earmarked as a special area of conservation -lrb- sac -rrb- by the uk government .
but there are concerns that its new status could mean a restriction on the movement of airbus wings which are transported along it .
flintshire 's environment scrutiny committee is to discuss the matter .
the council executive has already backed the proposal to make the estuary a sac but some councillors want to further ensure the needs of industry are taken into account .
we believe the dee estuary should be a conservation area but we 're trying to find a way of getting the best of both worlds councillor peter curtis at a meeting on wednesday , members of the environment scrutiny committee are expected to push the case for striking a balance between protecting the estuary and protecting jobs .
councillor peter curtis said : " the big concern is whether it will affect the industry around the area .
if anything was to hamper mostyn docks it would have a devastating effect on airbus .
" we believe the dee estuary should be a conservation area but we 're trying to find a way of getting the best of both worlds . "
a spokesperson for airbus uk said the company was aware of the proposal for the estuary .
she said : " environmental considerations are top of our agenda and part of our business .
we monitor our activities to make sure we have as little impact on the environment as possible . "
the assembly government and the uk government have backed the plan , which has been forwarded to the european commission .
the estuary is already a special protection area under the ec bird directive , due to its importance offering conservation areas to rare and migratory birds .
the dee estuary is the sixth largest estuary in the uk , featuring extensive areas of salt marsh , and providing a habitat for migratory fish .
on low spring tides , most of the estuary dries out , exposing mudflats and sand flats which provide a rich source of food for birds and fish .
the estuary is one of three being considered as a sac , along with the severn and humber .

members of the writers guild of america were balloted in new york and los angeles on whether to accept a new contract with the hollywood studios .
it means the entertainment industry will begin to get back to normal following a costly period of inactivity - the most damaging period of industrial action to hit hollywood in 20 years .
it has been estimated that the strike cost the los angeles economy in excess of $ 1.5bn -lrb- £ 766m -rrb- .
" i 'm very happy about it , " said peter bellwood , a british writer based in california .
" i feel very relieved that the strike is over , particularly for a lot of young people who are really working from pay cheque to pay cheque - not to mention all the below the line people , everybody that is part of this industry .
" the loss of money is huge .
everybody can get back to work and the industry can slowly gear up again . "
' hardship ' the new contract ensures that writers will receive a share of the profits from movies and tv shows when they are distributed over the internet .
but the union also gave up some of its demands , including one that writers working on reality shows should be represented by the guild .
" i feel good , " said marc zicree , a veteran tv writer .
" it definitely was worth the hardship because the writers guild will have jurisdiction over the internet .
" we got residuals , we got a number of the things we were fighting for so it was time well spent . "
mr zicree directed and co-wrote the new star trek episode , star trek new voyages : world enough and time , which was released exclusively via the internet .
" millions of people have seen it around the world , there 's no broadcast media , no studio , no network involved and yet it 's getting an audience equivalent to a television series , " he said .
" there 's a great possibility with the internet and with cell phones and all of these wonderful new media , so i think it 's an exciting future . "
while much of hollywood ground to a standstill during the strike , the city rallied around the writers .
the actors union was particularly supportive .
" one of the things that touched me deeply was the solidarity of writers all over the world - it was heartening , " said mr bellwood .
" i think there was a feeling of all of us in it together and recognising that it was a very important issue , " added mr zicree .
oscars even through the writers are poised to return to work , it will take several months for hollywood to resume full-scale production of tv shows .
most primetime dramas and sitcoms are expected to return in april .
the first visible sign that the entertainment world is putting aside all the bitterness and upheaval of the past 3 months will be an academy awards show , with all the usual red carpet glitz and star-power .
the writers had been threatening to picket the oscars on february 24 , but now it will be business as usual .
" i think everybody 's going to be very happy that the oscars get to go on and i think it will be an enormous celebration , " said mr bellwood .

members of the writers guild of america were balloted in new york and los angeles on whether to accept a new contract with the hollywood studios .
it means the entertainment industry will begin to get back to normal following a costly period of inactivity - the most damaging period of industrial action to hit hollywood in 20 years .
it has been estimated that the strike cost the los angeles economy in excess of $ 1.5bn -lrb- £ 766m -rrb- .
british writer peter bellwood joined the picket lines in los angeles " i 'm very happy about it , " said peter bellwood , a british writer based in california .
" i feel very relieved that the strike is over , particularly for a lot of young people who are really working from pay cheque to pay cheque - not to mention all the below the line people , everybody that is part of this industry .
" the loss of money is huge .
everybody can get back to work and the industry can slowly gear up again . "
' hardship ' the new contract ensures that writers will receive a share of the profits from movies and tv shows when they are distributed over the internet .
but the union also gave up some of its demands , including one that writers working on reality shows should be represented by the guild .
" i feel good , " said marc zicree , a veteran tv writer .
" it definitely was worth the hardship because the writers guild will have jurisdiction over the internet .
production on shows like ugly betty ground to a halt " we got residuals , we got a number of the things we were fighting for so it was time well spent . "
mr zicree directed and co-wrote the new star trek episode , star trek new voyages : world enough and time , which was released exclusively via the internet .
" millions of people have seen it around the world , there 's no broadcast media , no studio , no network involved and yet it 's getting an audience equivalent to a television series , " he said .
" there 's a great possibility with the internet and with cell phones and all of these wonderful new media , so i think it 's an exciting future . "
while much of hollywood ground to a standstill during the strike , the city rallied around the writers .
the actors union was particularly supportive .
" one of the things that touched me deeply was the solidarity of writers all over the world - it was heartening , " said mr bellwood .
" i think there was a feeling of all of us in it together and recognising that it was a very important issue , " added mr zicree .
oscars the oscars ceremony could have been cancelled amid the strike even through the writers are poised to return to work , it will take several months for hollywood to resume full-scale production of tv shows .
most primetime dramas and sitcoms are expected to return in april .
the first visible sign that the entertainment world is putting aside all the bitterness and upheaval of the past 3 months will be an academy awards show , with all the usual red carpet glitz and star-power .
the writers had been threatening to picket the oscars on february 24 , but now it will be business as usual .

the firm had predicted robust global steel markets would boost its results .
chief executive lakshmi mittal said the company was " focused on leading the transformation of our industry towards a sustainable future " .
late last year arcelor mittal agreed a deal with controlling shareholders in china oriental to allow it to eventually raise its stake in the chinese firm to 73.13 % .
arcelor mittal is eager to increase its exposure to china , the world 's biggest producer and consumer of steel .
mittal bought arcelor in 2006 , creating a firm with 10 % of the world 's steel market .
the global market for steel has been growing , with especially strong demand from developing countries such as china as they embark on large industrial and building works .

the back-to-work order was approved by 92.5 % of the 3,775 writers guild of america members who voted after a deal was struck by leaders at the weekend .
industrial action was sparked by a dispute over additional pay for work sold on dvd or over the internet .
the strike has crippled tv and film production and led to the cancellation of the golden globe awards ceremony .
" the strike is over .
our members have voted .
writers can go back to work , " wga president patric verrone said following the ballots held in new york and los angeles .
union leaders agreed a deal on sunday giving writers an increased share of the profits from tv shows and films offered over the internet and other new media .
" at the end of the day , everybody won , " said the head of the cbs television network , leslie moonves .
our writers are going to be writing very fast oscars producer gil cates " it was a fair deal ... and it recognises the large contribution that writers have made to the industry . "
the deal means the academy awards ceremony will take place as planned .
oscars organisers had discussed a " plan b " that would see the glittering event become a star-free show filled with clips and film packages .
but , addressing his team at the kodak theatre on tuesday , producer gil cates announced : " we 're doing the a show ! "
" this is a festive event , " cates told the crew of script co-ordinators , segment producers , security guards and seat-filler supervisors .
" we 're all so pleased .
-lsb- after -rsb- three months of striking , we 're happy to be here now . "
the show 's team of seven or eight scriptwriters will burn the midnight oil to make sure the requisite quips and links are ready for host jon stewart on 24 february .
" our writers are going to be writing very fast , " cates admitted .
comebacks the strike , which lasted 14 weeks , was the most damaging period of industrial action to hit hollywood in 20 years .
fox 's house starring hugh laurie is expected to return quickly some 10,500 writers stopped work on 5 november , a few days after their old contract with studios ended .
if writers return to work on wednesday , the thousands of production staff who were put of out of work as scripts dried up will take weeks to mobilise while new material is prepared .
the strike is said to have cost los angeles ' film and tv industry around $ 733m -lrb- £ 374m -rrb- , with the wider economy losing around $ 1.3bn -lrb- £ 663m -rrb- .
studio executives say it will take about two months for new tv programmes to emerge .
studios will have to decide which of the 65 affected series will come back , with hits house , csi , grey 's anatomy and desperate housewives likely to get priority .
iconic sketch show saturday night live has already announced it plans to return on 23 february .
films have not been been as severely affected because they have longer production times .

if writers return to work on wednesday , the thousands of production staff who were put of out of work as scripts dried up will take weeks to mobilise while new material is prepared .
the strike is said to have cost los angeles ' film and tv industry around $ 733m -lrb- £ 374m -rrb- , with the wider economy losing around $ 1.3bn -lrb- £ 663m -rrb- .
studio executives say it will take about two months for new tv programmes to emerge .
studios will have to decide which of the 65 affected series will come back , with hits house , csi , grey 's anatomy and desperate housewives likely to get priority .
iconic sketch show saturday night live has already announced it plans to return on 23 february .
films have not been been as severely affected because they have longer production times .

pasta foods , in great yarmouth , imports durum wheat from canada , italy and france , which it mills into semolina flour to make pasta shapes and meals .
the company said in april 2007 the price for a tonne of grain cost £ 140 , but that the price has now risen to more than £ 420 .
managing director peter barry said none of the firms 130 jobs were at risk .
' customer pays ' the company was founded in the 1960s and took over the waveney mill on the bank of the river yare in great yarmouth and built a factory nearby to make pasta products .
the company now supplies numerous food manufacturers with semolina for snack foods as well as making ready meals and dried pasta shapes which is sells at home and abroad .
mr barry put the increases down to a combination of factors including poor harvests in europe and australia , land being given over for growing bio-fuel crops and falling subsidies from the eu .
mr barry said : " a year ago canadian or french durum wheat was about £ 140 a tonne , and the current market for canadian durum wheat for a march delivery is about £ 420 to £ 445 a tonne .
" that 's getting on for nearly a triple material cost and that means we have to try to recover that from the market place .
" although we try to absorb what we can , and the retailers try to absorb a proportion of it , i think about 75 % of the costs will end up getting through to the consumer . "

" we do not discuss the cases of individual prisoners , " he added .
