program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 26.03.2008 physics could soothe migraine pain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migraines are sometimes preceded by auras , or visual disturbances migraine headaches are a widespread illness , but doctors are often at a loss in how to offer relief to patients .
now , physicists have started tackling the problem - and may have discovered the cause of the illness . the intense , throbbing pain of a migraine often feels like an attack on the senses .
in germany , some 12 percent to 16 percent of the population suffers from migraines , which can affect one or both sides of the head .
but some sufferers experience a kind of warning , known as an " aura , " before the full-blown attack . scientists , however , remain at odds over whether an aura is the cause of migraine pain , or an accompanying symptom since migraines can occur with or without auras .
the auras themselves also do not necessarily develop into migraines . an aura is a kind of psychological or neurological " churning " lasting from five minutes to 30 minutes and which can result in vertigo , confusion , or numbness , and can also affect vision in various ways .
visual disturbances , such as vision loss , or hallucinations may result , including flashing lights , distortion of objects or the emergence of complex color patterns . malfunction in visual cortex bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some migraines can last for days , forcing sufferers to stay in bed auras involving visual disturbances often intrigue doctors because they are so mysterious . scientists have known for the past few years that such auras are linked with a so-called stimulation wave .
this involves increased activity of brain cells that occurs in the visual cortex and which moves at the rate of three millimeters -lrb- 0.118 inches -rrb- per minute .
a malfunction in the visual cortex , however , makes aura sufferers see something in their line of vision which does not really exist . a 30-minute-aura could prove fatal since someone suffering from one behind the wheel could perceive an empty street when in fact a cyclist is passing by . faulty feedback mechanisms using computer simulations , physicists are now trying to figure out what triggers an aura . the simulations do not try to replicate the entire brain in a computer , but instead , some of its decisive mechanisms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migraines cause pain beyond words for many sufferers " those include the neurons grouped in the visual cortex which are connected to one another in multiple ways , " said eckehard schoell , managing director of the institute for theoretical physics in berlin .
" when electrical pulses move along these connections , we have what we call a stimulation wave . " particularly important here is the ability of brain cells to both send and receive signals .
cells can thus communicate with other cells and send back or pass on the information they have just received . the physicists in berlin have tracked precisely these signals in their computer simulations . " let 's assume that this feedback mechanism is occurring and our model is currently in an area where no waves can develop - that would be the model of a healthy patient , " schoell said .
" if we were to now suppress this feedback mechanism from occurring , then we suddenly move into an area where waves can occur . " one could then assume that a lack of feedback mechanisms is what causes the stimulation waves and thus migraine auras . glasses may solve problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pair of special glasses might help some scientists are now speculating that artificial means could help trigger the missing feedback processes , with experts at the juelich research center in western germany placing their bets on an unusual pair of glasses . special sensors attached to the glasses at the back of the head can measure brain activity .
their signals can control diodes which are located on the front of the glasses and which produce bright , flashing lights that influence the activity of neurons in the brain . the goal is that the flashing lights from the glasses would hinder the stimulation waves , thereby suppressing auras and hopefully the migraines as well . while the glasses have so far only been tested on healthy patients , scientists are optimistic about the results .
but whether they can actually help suppress auras and even migraines in sufferers remains to be seen . frank grotelueschen -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" france has proposed to its allies in the atlantic alliance a coherent and comprehensive strategy to allow the afghan people and their legitimate government to build peace , " sarkozy said .
" if these proposals are accepted , france will propose at the bucharest summit strengthening its military presence . " although he gave no figure , diplomatic sources said the french troop contingent in afghanistan was expected to be increased by more than 1,000 from the 1,600 currently stationed there . the french move would come as nato members with troops in southern afghanistan call on berlin to increase the number of soldiers deployed to the country and remove restrictions that keep the bundeswehr in afghanistan 's relatively safer northern region . paris-berlin axis not sufficient for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu needs more than merkel and sarkozy 's partnership can offer some political analysts have said the french president is reaching out to brown because he does not get on well with german chancellor angela merkel .
berlin and paris traditionally dominate the european union . in an interview with the bbc before the trip , sarkozy , who is scheduled to take over the european council presidency in three months , said france 's european policies would no longer be " reduced to friendship with germany . "
he added that " the paris-berlin axis is fundamental but not sufficient . " brown for his part told parliament that paris and london were pursuing a " joint agenda for the future . "
his talks with sarkozy scheduled for thursday would include increased cooperation in the energy , security , environmental protection and economic sectors . replying to questions from the lower house , brown also stressed that while france a key ally , the united states remained " britain 's closest ally " and " most important partner . " knightly honors for sarkozy prince charles and wife camilla welcomed sarkozy and his wife , carla , at london 's heathrow airport before a banquet with queen elizabeth and prince philip at windsor castle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's wife , carla , was praised for her elegance and taste by the british press sarkozy was made an honorary knight grand cross of the order of the bath , the highest rank of one of the oldest orders of british chivalry whose previous recipients include world leaders , including his predecessor francois mitterand . the french leader - on what is the first by a french head of state in 12 years - had already called for britain and france to work " hand in glove " on issues like illegal immigration and terrorism , and to forge " a new franco-british brotherhood . " ahead of the visit , sarkozy called for closer franco-british ties , telling british broadcaster bbc that both countries should perhaps " move from being cordial to being friendly . " french-british ties under sarkozy and brown 's predecessors , jacques chirac and tony blair , were fraught as a result of the iraq war . " it has been long enough now that we have not been at war , that we are not wrangling , " sarkozy said . old acquaintances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and brown began working as their countries ' finance ministers sarkozy said the friendship between britain and france " should n't simply be a matter of principle , " but one that is " fleshed out by concrete projects on the economy , immigration , security , defense . " brown said in an interview published wednesday in the french daily le monde that britain and france will work " hand in hand " to reform international institutions such as the united nations . brown said that he and sarkozy had worked together for years , when they were both finance ministers , " and we have the same vision of a globalized world . " " france and britain can therefore work hand in hand with common interests and shared values , " brown said .
" this is the case , and you will see it in the coming weeks , of the reform of international institutions created in 1945 : the un , the world bank and the international monetary fund .

" sarkozy also called for closer cooperation between britain and france in the nuclear technology and military fields , including afghanistan , where france intended to increase its support . french pledge added military support to afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french pledges to boost troop numbers in afghanistan could put pressure germany declaring that " we can not afford to lose afghanistan , that the taliban and al qaeda return to kabul , " sarkozy said france would announce at the forthcoming nato summit in bucharest its intention to increase its troop strength . " france has proposed to its allies in the atlantic alliance a coherent and comprehensive strategy to allow the afghan people and their legitimate government to build peace , " sarkozy said .
" if these proposals are accepted , france will propose at the bucharest summit strengthening its military presence . " although he gave no figure , diplomatic sources said the french troop contingent in afghanistan was expected to be increased by more than 1,000 from the 1,600 currently stationed there . the french move would come as nato members with troops in southern afghanistan call on berlin to increase the number of soldiers deployed to the country and remove restrictions that keep the bundeswehr in afghanistan 's relatively safer northern region . paris-berlin axis not sufficient for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu needs more than merkel and sarkozy 's partnership can offer some political analysts have said the french president is reaching out to brown because he does not get on well with german chancellor angela merkel .
berlin and paris traditionally dominate the european union . in an interview with the bbc before the trip , sarkozy , who is scheduled to take over the european council presidency in three months , said france 's european policies would no longer be " reduced to friendship with germany . "
he added that " the paris-berlin axis is fundamental but not sufficient . " brown for his part told parliament that paris and london were pursuing a " joint agenda for the future . "
his talks with sarkozy scheduled for thursday would include increased cooperation in the energy , security , environmental protection and economic sectors . replying to questions from the lower house , brown also stressed that while france a key ally , the united states remained " britain 's closest ally " and " most important partner . " knightly honors for sarkozy prince charles and wife camilla welcomed sarkozy and his wife , carla , at london 's heathrow airport before a banquet with queen elizabeth and prince philip at windsor castle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's wife , carla , was praised for her elegance and taste by the british press sarkozy was made an honorary knight grand cross of the order of the bath , the highest rank of one of the oldest orders of british chivalry whose previous recipients include world leaders , including his predecessor francois mitterand . the french leader - on what is the first by a french head of state in 12 years - had already called for britain and france to work " hand in glove " on issues like illegal immigration and terrorism , and to forge " a new franco-british brotherhood . " ahead of the visit , sarkozy called for closer franco-british ties , telling british broadcaster bbc that both countries should perhaps " move from being cordial to being friendly . " french-british ties under sarkozy and brown 's predecessors , jacques chirac and tony blair , were fraught as a result of the iraq war . " it has been long enough now that we have not been at war , that we are not wrangling , " sarkozy said . old acquaintances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and brown began working as their countries ' finance ministers sarkozy said the friendship between britain and france " should n't simply be a matter of principle , " but one that is " fleshed out by concrete projects on the economy , immigration , security , defense . " brown said in an interview published wednesday in the french daily le monde that britain and france will work " hand in hand " to reform international institutions such as the united nations . brown said that he and sarkozy had worked together for years , when they were both finance ministers , " and we have the same vision of a globalized world . " " france and britain can therefore work hand in hand with common interests and shared values , " brown said .
" this is the case , and you will see it in the coming weeks , of the reform of international institutions created in 1945 : the un , the world bank and the international monetary fund . " these organizations , brown said , " no longer correspond to the challenges of 2008 .

" the economic damage will increase in all federal states , " diw 's claudia kemfert said at the 3rd extreme weather congress in hamburg on wednesday , march 26 .
" what differs greatly is the burden they will carry . " while wealthier states such as baden-wuerttemberg and bavaria in the south might face the highest costs at 129 billion euros and 113 billion euros respectively , they 'll be less hard hit than poorer regions such as the city state of bremen in the north or brandenburg in the east , according to a diw study released wednesday . more swimming , less skiing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will southern europeans flock to germany 's beaches in the future ?
the impact of climate change will also differ greatly , if the report 's finding prove accurate .
germany 's northern states will mainly face rising temperatures , which could actually help the area as it would make beaches along the north and baltic seas more attractive for tourists . extreme precipitation in fall and winter will mainly hit central and southwestern germany , while southern and eastern germany are likely to struggle with extended periods of drought .
the south will also suffer as a result of rising temperatures : by 2100 , there probably wo n't be any snow in germany 's alpine regions , bringing an end to winter sports tourism . rising temperatures could also lead to problems with energy supply as nuclear power plants , for example , might run out of cooling water , the report said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 26.03.2008 nato , un and serbia engage in high stakes game over kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un and nato accuse the serbian government of inciting the violence in mitrovica tensions continue on the streets of mitrovica a week after rioting serbs clashed with police and nato troops in the town on kosovo 's northern border .
dw-world.de talked to a balkans expert about the latest developments . the violence in the ethnically divided town of mitrovica last week was the worst since kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority declared independence on feb .
17 .
hundreds of united nations peacekeepers and nato soldiers pulled out of the frontier region that abuts serbia after coming under fire from automatic weapons and hand grenades .
a ukrainian police officer was killed during the unrest . three days after the withdrawal , the un and nato mounted an operation to retake a courthouse taken over by ethnic serb protesters and restore military control over the northern border region around mitrovica .
the town is now once again under un control . in the days since the violence , the rhetoric coming from belgrade has increased in its bellicosity as accusations of armed provocation fly between the serbian government and the western powers in kosovo . dw-world.de spoke to professor stefan wolff , a political scientist and director of the center for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university , about the latest developments . dw-world.de : who is behind the current unrest in northern kosovo ?
is it public anger or do you think this violence is orchestrated by organized powers with an agenda ? stefan wolff : the violence in northern kosovo over the past several weeks is both an expression of public anger by local serbs and something that is at least encouraged by belgrade .
similar to the violence that happened in the immediate aftermath of kosovo 's declaration of independence when the american and other western embassies were targeted , the government in belgrade is not doing enough to send a strong message to the rioters , nor does , for that matter , the serb orthodox church .
quite clearly , the resulting instability serves serbia 's , and to some extent russia 's , agenda well , offering , as it were , proof for the claim that kosovo 's independence is the source of unrest and insecurity . what is the goal of those who are behind or are carrying out these violent protests ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the northern region was soon reclaimed by un forces many of those participating in the violence undoubtedly feel very strongly about kosovo and the fact that kosovo 's independence has no basis in international law and is a violation of serbia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
having said that , those people are also deluding themselves somewhat in believing that any other " solution " would have brought any more stability or that their violence will affect any change for the better . attacks on the un in northern kosovo , or on western embassies in belgrade , merely confirm to kosovo albanians and many others beyond kosovo - and in my opinion wrongly - that peaceful coexistence with serbs and serbia is very difficult to achieve .
making things difficult for the un , the eu , nato and other international organizations in kosovo and the region is ultimately a futile strategy that may pay off for some politicians in the short term but will harm serbs and serbia as a whole in the long term .
thus was the case with -lsb- former yugoslav president slobodan -rsb- milosevic , who built a reputation on " standing up " against the west .
the sooner serbs realize that kosovo was lost some 20 years ago when its autonomy was revoked and milosevic and his allies brutally asserted their control , the sooner they can move on with building a viable , democratic , european state . are we watching the beginnings of a new conflict in the balkans ? it is unlikely that the situation in kosovo itself will escalate into a new conflict in the balkans , but in combination with the instability that macedonia is experiencing in the wake of the fall of its government and the increasing belligerence of serbs in bosnia , it is difficult to see how the region would achieve greater stability in the near future .
the strong international presence in the region will hopefully prevent anything on the scale of the wars of the 1990s , but similar to the events then , we must be realistic about the limitations of organizations like the eu and nato to resolve the self-determination conflicts that have persisted since the break-up of yugoslavia .
the best we can hope for , at the moment at least , is effective containment . the un has put parts of northern kosovo back under military control .
how can kosovo hope to be an independent state when its government can be so easily over-ridden ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and un troops came under attack from armed serbs the problem with northern kosovo is that this region has never been under any kind of control from pristina since the late 1980s .
after the end of nato 's humanitarian intervention in 1999 the area around mitrovica became a military sector of its own , and gradually belgrade established its own control through its links with local serbs , paying , for example , all local administrators a salary from belgrade in addition to what they received from the united nations mission in kosovo -lsb- unmik -rsb- .
belgrade also discouraged local serbs from participating in elections in kosovo and from taking up their reserved seats in the kosovo assembly . this has created a situation in which we have almost complete segregation of serbs in the north from albanians .
while close links between belgrade and mitrovica exist , these are links that belgrade can now exploit in its strategy to effectively partition kosovo .
this has , so far , been resisted strongly by the international community , and it is difficult to see that this position will change any time soon . so who is actually in control in kosovo ? formally , the un remains in charge , but as we have seen recently , it depends heavily on nato 's military muscle to assert its control .
this gives more and more weight to nato in kosovo , and through nato 's member states to the eu , which has formally committed to playing a major role in supervising and facilitating kosovo 's transition to full independent statehood . nato has threatened to come down hard in kosovo .
what could this mean ?
where could nato 's power be directed and against whom ?
what would it achieve and what could be the consequences ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato will crack down in response to further attacks if there is more violence of the kind recently experienced in mitrovica , nato is clearly able to respond swiftly and decisively in restoring law and order .
more importantly , nato needs to assert full control of kosovo 's borders to prevent an influx of radical extremists from serbia bent on destabilizing the situation further . at the same time , nato will need to make sure that any unrest in kosovo does not spread to other volatile areas of the region , such as bosnia and macedonia .
it is highly unlikely that there will be prolonged and open hostilities with serbian forces , but there is always a chance that localized violence might occur especially in border areas .
the worst case scenario would be that , following parliamentary elections in serbia in may , a new government deliberately provokes such incidents .
this would be a vey dangerous scenario , and an unwise strategy for any government to follow . what effect is the current unrest likely to have in the wider balkan region ?
is there any chance that the unrest will spread beyond the region 's borders ? we have already seen the negative effects of kosovo 's independence in the region : bosnian serbs have , unsurprisingly , become more assertive about their own aspirations of eventual unification with serbia , and even though the serbian government itself has kept relatively quiet in this respect , it is an open secret that many politicians and ordinary people in serbia would welcome any developments that brought bosnian serbs closer to them . the collapse of the coalition government in macedonia has once again raised the specter of further separatist violence there as well .
if anything positive has come from the recent unrest , it is nato 's obvious determination not to tolerate any kind of violence that would put into question the borders that exist now or undermine the constitutional frameworks that were put in place in bosnia in 1995 and in macedonia after 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : separatists in the caucasus apply pressure on russia on the other hand , international effects are more difficult to gauge .
while several separatist movements - for example in the caucasus and in moldova - have intensified their rhetoric in the wake of kosovo 's declaration , and its subsequent recognition by so far over 30 states , it is important not to overestimate the " kosovo effect " - separatist movements existed in these areas before , and they are unlikely to receive any greater degree of international recognition now than they did before . could kosovo 's declaration of independence be linked to the pro-independence protests in tibet ?
where could this lead ?
could there be a knock-on effect all around the world where separatist organizations and oppressed minorities rise up , emboldened by the kosovo declaration ? what goes for the south caucasus and moldova , equally applies to tibet and other separatist conflicts .
the unrest in tibet is much more closely related to the international attention that china receives now in light of it hosting the olympic games this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest in tibet is unlikely to be linked to kosovo this is not to say that protesters in tibet may not have good reason to protest against china , but it is equally a reality - and a sad one - that international media attention increases with the level of violence present .
this was the case with kosovo in the late 1990s , with darfur since 2003 , and with both of the palestinian intifadas . in this sense , it would be wrong to blame any other violence and unrest merely on kosovo .
we must not forget that it still takes political leaders to decide on a path of violence and their supporters to follow them before we can see the kind of violence that tibet has experienced again of late - and this is true for separatists and the states they challenge alike . if this is the start of a wave of empowered separatist uprisings , who could be next to demand their independence ? everyone who wants independence probably has demanded it already , and several times over .
there have been almost 80 separatist movements worldwide since the 1950s which pursued their goals with violence .
at the moment , we have about 25 active armed movements and another 50 or so who pursue their aims by peaceful means .
what matters is not whether they declare or demand their independence , but rather how the international community reacts to this . short of consensual separation , as was the case with czechoslovakia , for example , it is unlikely that any declarations of independence would be met with widespread recognition .
turkey is the only state to have recognized northern cyprus , and not even armenia has so far recognized nagorno-karabakh even though it fought a long and bloody war with azerbaijan over this area . thus , kosovo is unique in that its declaration of independence has been followed by significant international recognition .
this is unlikely to be the case in relation to almost every other separatist movement .
as a consequence , states challenged by separatists , as well as the international community , need to continue looking for other ways to resolve the conflicts that result from these demands .
this demands vision , skill , and determination on the part of local political leaders and the international community , yet these qualities are all too often missing when personal agendas turn legitimate political struggles into a tug-of-war over personal power , status and wealth . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 26.03.2008 nato , un and serbia engage in high stakes game over kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un and nato accuse the serbian government of inciting the violence in mitrovica tensions continue on the streets of mitrovica a week after rioting serbs clashed with police and nato troops in the town on kosovo 's northern border .
dw-world.de talked to a balkans expert about the latest developments . the violence in the ethnically divided town of mitrovica last week was the worst since kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority declared independence on feb .
17 .
hundreds of united nations peacekeepers and nato soldiers pulled out of the frontier region that abuts serbia after coming under fire from automatic weapons and hand grenades .
a ukrainian police officer was killed during the unrest . three days after the withdrawal , the un and nato mounted an operation to retake a courthouse taken over by ethnic serb protesters and restore military control over the northern border region around mitrovica .
the town is now once again under un control . in the days since the violence , the rhetoric coming from belgrade has increased in its bellicosity as accusations of armed provocation fly between the serbian government and the western powers in kosovo . dw-world.de spoke to professor stefan wolff , a political scientist and director of the center for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university , about the latest developments . dw-world.de : who is behind the current unrest in northern kosovo ?
is it public anger or do you think this violence is orchestrated by organized powers with an agenda ? stefan wolff : the violence in northern kosovo over the past several weeks is both an expression of public anger by local serbs and something that is at least encouraged by belgrade .
similar to the violence that happened in the immediate aftermath of kosovo 's declaration of independence when the american and other western embassies were targeted , the government in belgrade is not doing enough to send a strong message to the rioters , nor does , for that matter , the serb orthodox church .
quite clearly , the resulting instability serves serbia 's , and to some extent russia 's , agenda well , offering , as it were , proof for the claim that kosovo 's independence is the source of unrest and insecurity . what is the goal of those who are behind or are carrying out these violent protests ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the northern region was soon reclaimed by un forces many of those participating in the violence undoubtedly feel very strongly about kosovo and the fact that kosovo 's independence has no basis in international law and is a violation of serbia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
having said that , those people are also deluding themselves somewhat in believing that any other " solution " would have brought any more stability or that their violence will affect any change for the better . attacks on the un in northern kosovo , or on western embassies in belgrade , merely confirm to kosovo albanians and many others beyond kosovo - and in my opinion wrongly - that peaceful coexistence with serbs and serbia is very difficult to achieve .
making things difficult for the un , the eu , nato and other international organizations in kosovo and the region is ultimately a futile strategy that may pay off for some politicians in the short term but will harm serbs and serbia as a whole in the long term .
thus was the case with -lsb- former yugoslav president slobodan -rsb- milosevic , who built a reputation on " standing up " against the west .
the sooner serbs realize that kosovo was lost some 20 years ago when its autonomy was revoked and milosevic and his allies brutally asserted their control , the sooner they can move on with building a viable , democratic , european state . are we watching the beginnings of a new conflict in the balkans ? it is unlikely that the situation in kosovo itself will escalate into a new conflict in the balkans , but in combination with the instability that macedonia is experiencing in the wake of the fall of its government and the increasing belligerence of serbs in bosnia , it is difficult to see how the region would achieve greater stability in the near future .
the strong international presence in the region will hopefully prevent anything on the scale of the wars of the 1990s , but similar to the events then , we must be realistic about the limitations of organizations like the eu and nato to resolve the self-determination conflicts that have persisted since the break-up of yugoslavia .
the best we can hope for , at the moment at least , is effective containment . the un has put parts of northern kosovo back under military control .
how can kosovo hope to be an independent state when its government can be so easily over-ridden ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and un troops came under attack from armed serbs the problem with northern kosovo is that this region has never been under any kind of control from pristina since the late 1980s .
after the end of nato 's humanitarian intervention in 1999 the area around mitrovica became a military sector of its own , and gradually belgrade established its own control through its links with local serbs , paying , for example , all local administrators a salary from belgrade in addition to what they received from the united nations mission in kosovo -lsb- unmik -rsb- .
belgrade also discouraged local serbs from participating in elections in kosovo and from taking up their reserved seats in the kosovo assembly . this has created a situation in which we have almost complete segregation of serbs in the north from albanians .
while close links between belgrade and mitrovica exist , these are links that belgrade can now exploit in its strategy to effectively partition kosovo .
this has , so far , been resisted strongly by the international community , and it is difficult to see that this position will change any time soon . so who is actually in control in kosovo ? formally , the un remains in charge , but as we have seen recently , it depends heavily on nato 's military muscle to assert its control .
this gives more and more weight to nato in kosovo , and through nato 's member states to the eu , which has formally committed to playing a major role in supervising and facilitating kosovo 's transition to full independent statehood . nato has threatened to come down hard in kosovo .
what could this mean ?
where could nato 's power be directed and against whom ?
what would it achieve and what could be the consequences ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato will crack down in response to further attacks if there is more violence of the kind recently experienced in mitrovica , nato is clearly able to respond swiftly and decisively in restoring law and order .
more importantly , nato needs to assert full control of kosovo 's borders to prevent an influx of radical extremists from serbia bent on destabilizing the situation further . at the same time , nato will need to make sure that any unrest in kosovo does not spread to other volatile areas of the region , such as bosnia and macedonia .
it is highly unlikely that there will be prolonged and open hostilities with serbian forces , but there is always a chance that localized violence might occur especially in border areas .
the worst case scenario would be that , following parliamentary elections in serbia in may , a new government deliberately provokes such incidents .
this would be a vey dangerous scenario , and an unwise strategy for any government to follow . what effect is the current unrest likely to have in the wider balkan region ?
is there any chance that the unrest will spread beyond the region 's borders ? we have already seen the negative effects of kosovo 's independence in the region : bosnian serbs have , unsurprisingly , become more assertive about their own aspirations of eventual unification with serbia , and even though the serbian government itself has kept relatively quiet in this respect , it is an open secret that many politicians and ordinary people in serbia would welcome any developments that brought bosnian serbs closer to them . the collapse of the coalition government in macedonia has once again raised the specter of further separatist violence there as well .
if anything positive has come from the recent unrest , it is nato 's obvious determination not to tolerate any kind of violence that would put into question the borders that exist now or undermine the constitutional frameworks that were put in place in bosnia in 1995 and in macedonia after 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : separatists in the caucasus apply pressure on russia on the other hand , international effects are more difficult to gauge .
while several separatist movements - for example in the caucasus and in moldova - have intensified their rhetoric in the wake of kosovo 's declaration , and its subsequent recognition by so far over 30 states , it is important not to overestimate the " kosovo effect " - separatist movements existed in these areas before , and they are unlikely to receive any greater degree of international recognition now than they did before . could kosovo 's declaration of independence be linked to the pro-independence protests in tibet ?
where could this lead ?
could there be a knock-on effect all around the world where separatist organizations and oppressed minorities rise up , emboldened by the kosovo declaration ? what goes for the south caucasus and moldova , equally applies to tibet and other separatist conflicts .
the unrest in tibet is much more closely related to the international attention that china receives now in light of it hosting the olympic games this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest in tibet is unlikely to be linked to kosovo this is not to say that protesters in tibet may not have good reason to protest against china , but it is equally a reality - and a sad one - that international media attention increases with the level of violence present .
this was the case with kosovo in the late 1990s , with darfur since 2003 , and with both of the palestinian intifadas . in this sense , it would be wrong to blame any other violence and unrest merely on kosovo .
we must not forget that it still takes political leaders to decide on a path of violence and their supporters to follow them before we can see the kind of violence that tibet has experienced again of late - and this is true for separatists and the states they challenge alike . if this is the start of a wave of empowered separatist uprisings , who could be next to demand their independence ? everyone who wants independence probably has demanded it already , and several times over .
there have been almost 80 separatist movements worldwide since the 1950s which pursued their goals with violence .
at the moment , we have about 25 active armed movements and another 50 or so who pursue their aims by peaceful means .
what matters is not whether they declare or demand their independence , but rather how the international community reacts to this . short of consensual separation , as was the case with czechoslovakia , for example , it is unlikely that any declarations of independence would be met with widespread recognition .
turkey is the only state to have recognized northern cyprus , and not even armenia has so far recognized nagorno-karabakh even though it fought a long and bloody war with azerbaijan over this area . thus , kosovo is unique in that its declaration of independence has been followed by significant international recognition .
this is unlikely to be the case in relation to almost every other separatist movement .
as a consequence , states challenged by separatists , as well as the international community , need to continue looking for other ways to resolve the conflicts that result from these demands .
this demands vision , skill , and determination on the part of local political leaders and the international community , yet these qualities are all too often missing when personal agendas turn legitimate political struggles into a tug-of-war over personal power , status and wealth . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the sooner serbs realize that kosovo was lost some 20 years ago when its autonomy was revoked and milosevic and his allies brutally asserted their control , the sooner they can move on with building a viable , democratic , european state . are we watching the beginnings of a new conflict in the balkans ? it is unlikely that the situation in kosovo itself will escalate into a new conflict in the balkans , but in combination with the instability that macedonia is experiencing in the wake of the fall of its government and the increasing belligerence of serbs in bosnia , it is difficult to see how the region would achieve greater stability in the near future .
the strong international presence in the region will hopefully prevent anything on the scale of the wars of the 1990s , but similar to the events then , we must be realistic about the limitations of organizations like the eu and nato to resolve the self-determination conflicts that have persisted since the break-up of yugoslavia .
the best we can hope for , at the moment at least , is effective containment . the un has put parts of northern kosovo back under military control .
how can kosovo hope to be an independent state when its government can be so easily over-ridden ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and un troops came under attack from armed serbs the problem with northern kosovo is that this region has never been under any kind of control from pristina since the late 1980s .
after the end of nato 's humanitarian intervention in 1999 the area around mitrovica became a military sector of its own , and gradually belgrade established its own control through its links with local serbs , paying , for example , all local administrators a salary from belgrade in addition to what they received from the united nations mission in kosovo -lsb- unmik -rsb- .
belgrade also discouraged local serbs from participating in elections in kosovo and from taking up their reserved seats in the kosovo assembly . this has created a situation in which we have almost complete segregation of serbs in the north from albanians .
while close links between belgrade and mitrovica exist , these are links that belgrade can now exploit in its strategy to effectively partition kosovo .
this has , so far , been resisted strongly by the international community , and it is difficult to see that this position will change any time soon . so who is actually in control in kosovo ? formally , the un remains in charge , but as we have seen recently , it depends heavily on nato 's military muscle to assert its control .
this gives more and more weight to nato in kosovo , and through nato 's member states to the eu , which has formally committed to playing a major role in supervising and facilitating kosovo 's transition to full independent statehood . nato has threatened to come down hard in kosovo .
what could this mean ?
where could nato 's power be directed and against whom ?
what would it achieve and what could be the consequences ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato will crack down in response to further attacks if there is more violence of the kind recently experienced in mitrovica , nato is clearly able to respond swiftly and decisively in restoring law and order .
more importantly , nato needs to assert full control of kosovo 's borders to prevent an influx of radical extremists from serbia bent on destabilizing the situation further . at the same time , nato will need to make sure that any unrest in kosovo does not spread to other volatile areas of the region , such as bosnia and macedonia .
it is highly unlikely that there will be prolonged and open hostilities with serbian forces , but there is always a chance that localized violence might occur especially in border areas .
the worst case scenario would be that , following parliamentary elections in serbia in may , a new government deliberately provokes such incidents .
this would be a vey dangerous scenario , and an unwise strategy for any government to follow . what effect is the current unrest likely to have in the wider balkan region ?
is there any chance that the unrest will spread beyond the region 's borders ? we have already seen the negative effects of kosovo 's independence in the region : bosnian serbs have , unsurprisingly , become more assertive about their own aspirations of eventual unification with serbia , and even though the serbian government itself has kept relatively quiet in this respect , it is an open secret that many politicians and ordinary people in serbia would welcome any developments that brought bosnian serbs closer to them . the collapse of the coalition government in macedonia has once again raised the specter of further separatist violence there as well .
if anything positive has come from the recent unrest , it is nato 's obvious determination not to tolerate any kind of violence that would put into question the borders that exist now or undermine the constitutional frameworks that were put in place in bosnia in 1995 and in macedonia after 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : separatists in the caucasus apply pressure on russia on the other hand , international effects are more difficult to gauge .
while several separatist movements - for example in the caucasus and in moldova - have intensified their rhetoric in the wake of kosovo 's declaration , and its subsequent recognition by so far over 30 states , it is important not to overestimate the " kosovo effect " - separatist movements existed in these areas before , and they are unlikely to receive any greater degree of international recognition now than they did before . could kosovo 's declaration of independence be linked to the pro-independence protests in tibet ?
where could this lead ?
could there be a knock-on effect all around the world where separatist organizations and oppressed minorities rise up , emboldened by the kosovo declaration ? what goes for the south caucasus and moldova , equally applies to tibet and other separatist conflicts .
the unrest in tibet is much more closely related to the international attention that china receives now in light of it hosting the olympic games this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest in tibet is unlikely to be linked to kosovo this is not to say that protesters in tibet may not have good reason to protest against china , but it is equally a reality - and a sad one - that international media attention increases with the level of violence present .
this was the case with kosovo in the late 1990s , with darfur since 2003 , and with both of the palestinian intifadas . in this sense , it would be wrong to blame any other violence and unrest merely on kosovo .
we must not forget that it still takes political leaders to decide on a path of violence and their supporters to follow them before we can see the kind of violence that tibet has experienced again of late - and this is true for separatists and the states they challenge alike . if this is the start of a wave of empowered separatist uprisings , who could be next to demand their independence ? everyone who wants independence probably has demanded it already , and several times over .
there have been almost 80 separatist movements worldwide since the 1950s which pursued their goals with violence .
at the moment , we have about 25 active armed movements and another 50 or so who pursue their aims by peaceful means .
what matters is not whether they declare or demand their independence , but rather how the international community reacts to this . short of consensual separation , as was the case with czechoslovakia , for example , it is unlikely that any declarations of independence would be met with widespread recognition .
turkey is the only state to have recognized northern cyprus , and not even armenia has so far recognized nagorno-karabakh even though it fought a long and bloody war with azerbaijan over this area . thus , kosovo is unique in that its declaration of independence has been followed by significant international recognition .
this is unlikely to be the case in relation to almost every other separatist movement .
as a consequence , states challenged by separatists , as well as the international community , need to continue looking for other ways to resolve the conflicts that result from these demands .
this demands vision , skill , and determination on the part of local political leaders and the international community , yet these qualities are all too often missing when personal agendas turn legitimate political struggles into a tug-of-war over personal power , status and wealth . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 26.03.2008 nato , un and serbia engage in high stakes game over kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un and nato accuse the serbian government of inciting the violence in mitrovica tensions continue on the streets of mitrovica a week after rioting serbs clashed with police and nato troops in the town on kosovo 's northern border .
dw-world.de talked to a balkans expert about the latest developments . the violence in the ethnically divided town of mitrovica last week was the worst since kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority declared independence on feb .
17 .
hundreds of united nations peacekeepers and nato soldiers pulled out of the frontier region that abuts serbia after coming under fire from automatic weapons and hand grenades .
a ukrainian police officer was killed during the unrest . three days after the withdrawal , the un and nato mounted an operation to retake a courthouse taken over by ethnic serb protesters and restore military control over the northern border region around mitrovica .
the town is now once again under un control . in the days since the violence , the rhetoric coming from belgrade has increased in its bellicosity as accusations of armed provocation fly between the serbian government and the western powers in kosovo . dw-world.de spoke to professor stefan wolff , a political scientist and director of the center for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university , about the latest developments . dw-world.de : who is behind the current unrest in northern kosovo ?
is it public anger or do you think this violence is orchestrated by organized powers with an agenda ? stefan wolff : the violence in northern kosovo over the past several weeks is both an expression of public anger by local serbs and something that is at least encouraged by belgrade .
similar to the violence that happened in the immediate aftermath of kosovo 's declaration of independence when the american and other western embassies were targeted , the government in belgrade is not doing enough to send a strong message to the rioters , nor does , for that matter , the serb orthodox church .
quite clearly , the resulting instability serves serbia 's , and to some extent russia 's , agenda well , offering , as it were , proof for the claim that kosovo 's independence is the source of unrest and insecurity . what is the goal of those who are behind or are carrying out these violent protests ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the northern region was soon reclaimed by un forces many of those participating in the violence undoubtedly feel very strongly about kosovo and the fact that kosovo 's independence has no basis in international law and is a violation of serbia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
having said that , those people are also deluding themselves somewhat in believing that any other " solution " would have brought any more stability or that their violence will affect any change for the better . attacks on the un in northern kosovo , or on western embassies in belgrade , merely confirm to kosovo albanians and many others beyond kosovo - and in my opinion wrongly - that peaceful coexistence with serbs and serbia is very difficult to achieve .
making things difficult for the un , the eu , nato and other international organizations in kosovo and the region is ultimately a futile strategy that may pay off for some politicians in the short term but will harm serbs and serbia as a whole in the long term .
thus was the case with -lsb- former yugoslav president slobodan -rsb- milosevic , who built a reputation on " standing up " against the west .

most do n't feel supported by society - only one-sixth said that children and career could be easily combined these days . " if companies do n't offer women an acceptable balance between work and life , they 'll soon be lacking important personnel resources , " said allmendinger . rethinking priorities despite their career ambitions , the women surveyed also placed a strong emphasis on relationships .
three-quarters said they wanted a steady partner .
ninety-one percent said friends were important to them , while 87 percent said the same of parents and siblings . the women rated good looks -lrb- 59 percent -rrb- and good sex -lrb- 54 percent -rrb- as less significant .
only one-fourth said being thin was important . if 90 percent of this generation of women chooses a different path than their mothers , this will change society , said allmendinger .
" society is going to have to get used to a new type of woman . " bildunterschrift : a steady partner and children are also important to young women dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

afghanistan and the olympics in beijing will be on the agenda , but some say the trip is also an attempt to spiff up the president 's image . after months of french president nicolas sarkozy 's private life being in the limelight , more politics and some pomp will be on the agenda once the leader arrives in britain . ahead of the visit , sarzoky called for closer french-british ties .
the two countries should " move from being cordial to being friendly , " sarkozy said in an interview with british broadcaster bbc . sarkozy said the friendship " should n't simply be a matter of principle , " but one that is " fleshed out by concrete projects on the economy , immigration , security , defense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's queen elizabeth ii at the house of lords the french president will be accompanied by his wife carla bruni-sarkozy for the two-day visit , during which the couple will meet with queen elizabeth ii and prime minister gordon brown .
it will be the highest profile international engagement since sarzoky 's and bruni 's wedding in february . pomp and politics the couple is to spend the night at windsor castle , the queen 's treasured home west of london , in a rare honor for a foreign leader . the visit will also include a procession through windsor 's streets in a horse-drawn carriage and a state banquet . sarkozy is also to address both houses of the british parliament on wednesday - an honor bestowed to just 31 foreign leaders since 1939 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serious issues to discuss with brown include afghanistan on thursday , sarkozy is to meet with prime minister brown for a summit during which the two are expected to announce a deal for france to help britain build a new generation of nuclear power plants . the two are also expected to discuss the option of france sending an additional 1,000 troops to afghanistan to aid in the international fight against the taliban .
britain has nearly 8,000 troops in the country . talks may also focus on the need for greater transparency of financial markets , including full disclosure of write-offs by banks , in light of ongoing market turbulence and the near-collapse of us investment bank bear stearns . sarkozy could likely repeat a threat he made on tuesday that france can not rule out a boycott of the opening ceremony of the beijing olympics due to china 's crackdown in tibet . mending franco-british ties in an editorial , the british newspaper the independent called sarkozy 's visit " not just a potentially significant staging post in britain 's erratic european journey . " " a stronger anglo-french relationship could have wider consequences .
it is better for britain , france and for the rest of the world if the two countries are working closely together rather than damaging themselves by feuding from a distance , " the paper wrote . under the leadership of predecessors jacques chirac and tony blair , the two countries clashed over france 's opposition to the us-led , british-backed invasion of iraq in march 2003 , and relations have been strained ever since . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollsters say the love affair between carla bruni and sarkozy has distracted the president french media have portrayed the trip as an opportunity for sarkozy to boost his ratings with a more statesmanlike image to stop his personal life from being the focus of attention . a recent survey by france 's journal du dimanche newspaper put the french people 's satisfaction rating with sarkozy at 37 percent , and his right-wing ump party suffered heavy losses in local elections earlier this month . analysts blame the president 's tangled personal life for the dip in his popularity .
sarkozy 's divorce from his second wife , cecilia ciganier-albeniz , and his recent marriage to model-turned-singer carla bruni made headlines for months . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but more choices and cheaper fares for travelers may be a little ways off , analysts say . the agreement between the united states and the european union is to take effect on sunday , march 31 , and will end most restrictions on us and eu airlines ' ability to fly between the two continents .
different air carriers will be allowed to depart or land at various locations on both continents . the concept of the open market dictating flight routes between the europe and the us originally held the promise of cheaper airfares and more choices for travelers , but analysts say the turmoil in the us economy and the airline industry may prevent immediate benefits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competition could cause a cut in fares air carriers are hurting from record-high fuel costs and increased economic uncertainty , industry observers pointed out . " i think -lsb- the agreement -rsb- would mean a lot more if the industry were not in the dire straits they are in now , " terry trippler , an aviation consultant and founder of tripplertravel.com , told afp news agency . " the industry is more concerned about cutting flights than expanding , " he said .
" eventually this will be fantastic when this industry shakes itself out .
right now , the celebration is muted . " mixed views george hamlin , managing director of the consulting firm aca associates , told afp that , on the contrary , some new flights were being scheduled , with air france offering service from london to los angeles and us carriers getting some coveted slots at london 's heathrow airport . " in the longer term there may be some overexpansion , followed by some contraction , " hamlin said . hamlin said airlines would have to plan ahead for good times and bad by ordering aircraft and securing landing rights even if conditions were not ideal . " we do n't even begin to get a glimmer of the possibilities of open-market competition yet , " jerry chandler , cheapflights.com 's travel blogger , told the new york times .

" sarkozy also called for closer cooperation between britain and france in the nuclear technology and military fields , including afghanistan , where france intended to increase its support . french pledge added military support to afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french pledges to boost troop numbers in afghanistan could put pressure germany declaring that " we can not afford to lose afghanistan , that the taliban and al qaeda return to kabul , " sarkozy said france would announce at the forthcoming nato summit in bucharest its intention to increase its troop strength . " france has proposed to its allies in the atlantic alliance a coherent and comprehensive strategy to allow the afghan people and their legitimate government to build peace , " sarkozy said .
" if these proposals are accepted , france will propose at the bucharest summit strengthening its military presence . " although he gave no figure , diplomatic sources said the french troop contingent in afghanistan was expected to be increased by more than 1,000 from the 1,600 currently stationed there . the french move would come as nato members with troops in southern afghanistan call on berlin to increase the number of soldiers deployed to the country and remove restrictions that keep the bundeswehr in afghanistan 's relatively safer northern region . paris-berlin axis not sufficient for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu needs more than merkel and sarkozy 's partnership can offer some political analysts have said the french president is reaching out to brown because he does not get on well with german chancellor angela merkel .
berlin and paris traditionally dominate the european union . in an interview with the bbc before the trip , sarkozy , who is scheduled to take over the european council presidency in three months , said france 's european policies would no longer be " reduced to friendship with germany . "
he added that " the paris-berlin axis is fundamental but not sufficient . " brown for his part told parliament that paris and london were pursuing a " joint agenda for the future . "
his talks with sarkozy scheduled for thursday would include increased cooperation in the energy , security , environmental protection and economic sectors . replying to questions from the lower house , brown also stressed that while france a key ally , the united states remained " britain 's closest ally " and " most important partner . " knightly honors for sarkozy prince charles and wife camilla welcomed sarkozy and his wife , carla , at london 's heathrow airport before a banquet with queen elizabeth and prince philip at windsor castle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's wife , carla , was praised for her elegance and taste by the british press sarkozy was made an honorary knight grand cross of the order of the bath , the highest rank of one of the oldest orders of british chivalry whose previous recipients include world leaders , including his predecessor francois mitterand . the french leader - on what is the first by a french head of state in 12 years - had already called for britain and france to work " hand in glove " on issues like illegal immigration and terrorism , and to forge " a new franco-british brotherhood . " ahead of the visit , sarkozy called for closer franco-british ties , telling british broadcaster bbc that both countries should perhaps " move from being cordial to being friendly . " french-british ties under sarkozy and brown 's predecessors , jacques chirac and tony blair , were fraught as a result of the iraq war . " it has been long enough now that we have not been at war , that we are not wrangling , " sarkozy said . old acquaintances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and brown began working as their countries ' finance ministers sarkozy said the friendship between britain and france " should n't simply be a matter of principle , " but one that is " fleshed out by concrete projects on the economy , immigration , security , defense . " brown said in an interview published wednesday in the french daily le monde that britain and france will work " hand in hand " to reform international institutions such as the united nations . brown said that he and sarkozy had worked together for years , when they were both finance ministers , " and we have the same vision of a globalized world . " " france and britain can therefore work hand in hand with common interests and shared values , " brown said .
" this is the case , and you will see it in the coming weeks , of the reform of international institutions created in 1945 : the un , the world bank and the international monetary fund . " these organizations , brown said , " no longer correspond to the challenges of 2008 .

" the economic damage will increase in all federal states , " diw 's claudia kemfert said at the 3rd extreme weather congress in hamburg on wednesday , march 26 .
" what differs greatly is the burden they will carry . " while wealthier states such as baden-wuerttemberg and bavaria in the south might face the highest costs at 129 billion euros and 113 billion euros respectively , they 'll be less hard hit than poorer regions such as the city state of bremen in the north or brandenburg in the east , according to a diw study released wednesday . more swimming , less skiing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will southern europeans flock to germany 's beaches in the future ?
the impact of climate change will also differ greatly , if the report 's finding prove accurate .
germany 's northern states will mainly face rising temperatures , which could actually help the area as it would make beaches along the north and baltic seas more attractive for tourists . extreme precipitation in fall and winter will mainly hit central and southwestern germany , while southern and eastern germany are likely to struggle with extended periods of drought .
the south will also suffer as a result of rising temperatures : by 2100 , there probably wo n't be any snow in germany 's alpine regions , bringing an end to winter sports tourism . rising temperatures could also lead to problems with energy supply as nuclear power plants , for example , might run out of cooling water , the report said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" anyone who is out until the early hours of the morning is n't taking their job seriously , " bierhoff added . team officials are hoping that this kind of teutonic dedication that will help german succeed in the quest to claim their fourth european championship title this summer . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 26.03.2008 nato , un and serbia engage in high stakes game over kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un and nato accuse the serbian government of inciting the violence in mitrovica tensions continue on the streets of mitrovica a week after rioting serbs clashed with police and nato troops in the town on kosovo 's northern border .
dw-world.de talked to a balkans expert about the latest developments . the violence in the ethnically divided town of mitrovica last week was the worst since kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority declared independence on feb .
17 .
hundreds of united nations peacekeepers and nato soldiers pulled out of the frontier region that abuts serbia after coming under fire from automatic weapons and hand grenades .
a ukrainian police officer was killed during the unrest . three days after the withdrawal , the un and nato mounted an operation to retake a courthouse taken over by ethnic serb protesters and restore military control over the northern border region around mitrovica .
the town is now once again under un control . in the days since the violence , the rhetoric coming from belgrade has increased in its bellicosity as accusations of armed provocation fly between the serbian government and the western powers in kosovo . dw-world.de spoke to professor stefan wolff , a political scientist and director of the center for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university , about the latest developments . dw-world.de : who is behind the current unrest in northern kosovo ?
is it public anger or do you think this violence is orchestrated by organized powers with an agenda ? stefan wolff : the violence in northern kosovo over the past several weeks is both an expression of public anger by local serbs and something that is at least encouraged by belgrade .
similar to the violence that happened in the immediate aftermath of kosovo 's declaration of independence when the american and other western embassies were targeted , the government in belgrade is not doing enough to send a strong message to the rioters , nor does , for that matter , the serb orthodox church .
quite clearly , the resulting instability serves serbia 's , and to some extent russia 's , agenda well , offering , as it were , proof for the claim that kosovo 's independence is the source of unrest and insecurity . what is the goal of those who are behind or are carrying out these violent protests ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the northern region was soon reclaimed by un forces many of those participating in the violence undoubtedly feel very strongly about kosovo and the fact that kosovo 's independence has no basis in international law and is a violation of serbia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
having said that , those people are also deluding themselves somewhat in believing that any other " solution " would have brought any more stability or that their violence will affect any change for the better . attacks on the un in northern kosovo , or on western embassies in belgrade , merely confirm to kosovo albanians and many others beyond kosovo - and in my opinion wrongly - that peaceful coexistence with serbs and serbia is very difficult to achieve .
making things difficult for the un , the eu , nato and other international organizations in kosovo and the region is ultimately a futile strategy that may pay off for some politicians in the short term but will harm serbs and serbia as a whole in the long term .
thus was the case with -lsb- former yugoslav president slobodan -rsb- milosevic , who built a reputation on " standing up " against the west .
the sooner serbs realize that kosovo was lost some 20 years ago when its autonomy was revoked and milosevic and his allies brutally asserted their control , the sooner they can move on with building a viable , democratic , european state . are we watching the beginnings of a new conflict in the balkans ? it is unlikely that the situation in kosovo itself will escalate into a new conflict in the balkans , but in combination with the instability that macedonia is experiencing in the wake of the fall of its government and the increasing belligerence of serbs in bosnia , it is difficult to see how the region would achieve greater stability in the near future .
the strong international presence in the region will hopefully prevent anything on the scale of the wars of the 1990s , but similar to the events then , we must be realistic about the limitations of organizations like the eu and nato to resolve the self-determination conflicts that have persisted since the break-up of yugoslavia .
the best we can hope for , at the moment at least , is effective containment . the un has put parts of northern kosovo back under military control .
how can kosovo hope to be an independent state when its government can be so easily over-ridden ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and un troops came under attack from armed serbs the problem with northern kosovo is that this region has never been under any kind of control from pristina since the late 1980s .
after the end of nato 's humanitarian intervention in 1999 the area around mitrovica became a military sector of its own , and gradually belgrade established its own control through its links with local serbs , paying , for example , all local administrators a salary from belgrade in addition to what they received from the united nations mission in kosovo -lsb- unmik -rsb- .
belgrade also discouraged local serbs from participating in elections in kosovo and from taking up their reserved seats in the kosovo assembly . this has created a situation in which we have almost complete segregation of serbs in the north from albanians .
while close links between belgrade and mitrovica exist , these are links that belgrade can now exploit in its strategy to effectively partition kosovo .
this has , so far , been resisted strongly by the international community , and it is difficult to see that this position will change any time soon . so who is actually in control in kosovo ? formally , the un remains in charge , but as we have seen recently , it depends heavily on nato 's military muscle to assert its control .
this gives more and more weight to nato in kosovo , and through nato 's member states to the eu , which has formally committed to playing a major role in supervising and facilitating kosovo 's transition to full independent statehood . nato has threatened to come down hard in kosovo .
what could this mean ?
where could nato 's power be directed and against whom ?
what would it achieve and what could be the consequences ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato will crack down in response to further attacks if there is more violence of the kind recently experienced in mitrovica , nato is clearly able to respond swiftly and decisively in restoring law and order .
more importantly , nato needs to assert full control of kosovo 's borders to prevent an influx of radical extremists from serbia bent on destabilizing the situation further . at the same time , nato will need to make sure that any unrest in kosovo does not spread to other volatile areas of the region , such as bosnia and macedonia .
it is highly unlikely that there will be prolonged and open hostilities with serbian forces , but there is always a chance that localized violence might occur especially in border areas .
the worst case scenario would be that , following parliamentary elections in serbia in may , a new government deliberately provokes such incidents .
this would be a vey dangerous scenario , and an unwise strategy for any government to follow . what effect is the current unrest likely to have in the wider balkan region ?
is there any chance that the unrest will spread beyond the region 's borders ? we have already seen the negative effects of kosovo 's independence in the region : bosnian serbs have , unsurprisingly , become more assertive about their own aspirations of eventual unification with serbia , and even though the serbian government itself has kept relatively quiet in this respect , it is an open secret that many politicians and ordinary people in serbia would welcome any developments that brought bosnian serbs closer to them . the collapse of the coalition government in macedonia has once again raised the specter of further separatist violence there as well .
if anything positive has come from the recent unrest , it is nato 's obvious determination not to tolerate any kind of violence that would put into question the borders that exist now or undermine the constitutional frameworks that were put in place in bosnia in 1995 and in macedonia after 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : separatists in the caucasus apply pressure on russia on the other hand , international effects are more difficult to gauge .
while several separatist movements - for example in the caucasus and in moldova - have intensified their rhetoric in the wake of kosovo 's declaration , and its subsequent recognition by so far over 30 states , it is important not to overestimate the " kosovo effect " - separatist movements existed in these areas before , and they are unlikely to receive any greater degree of international recognition now than they did before . could kosovo 's declaration of independence be linked to the pro-independence protests in tibet ?
where could this lead ?
could there be a knock-on effect all around the world where separatist organizations and oppressed minorities rise up , emboldened by the kosovo declaration ? what goes for the south caucasus and moldova , equally applies to tibet and other separatist conflicts .
the unrest in tibet is much more closely related to the international attention that china receives now in light of it hosting the olympic games this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest in tibet is unlikely to be linked to kosovo this is not to say that protesters in tibet may not have good reason to protest against china , but it is equally a reality - and a sad one - that international media attention increases with the level of violence present .
this was the case with kosovo in the late 1990s , with darfur since 2003 , and with both of the palestinian intifadas . in this sense , it would be wrong to blame any other violence and unrest merely on kosovo .
we must not forget that it still takes political leaders to decide on a path of violence and their supporters to follow them before we can see the kind of violence that tibet has experienced again of late - and this is true for separatists and the states they challenge alike . if this is the start of a wave of empowered separatist uprisings , who could be next to demand their independence ? everyone who wants independence probably has demanded it already , and several times over .
there have been almost 80 separatist movements worldwide since the 1950s which pursued their goals with violence .
at the moment , we have about 25 active armed movements and another 50 or so who pursue their aims by peaceful means .
what matters is not whether they declare or demand their independence , but rather how the international community reacts to this . short of consensual separation , as was the case with czechoslovakia , for example , it is unlikely that any declarations of independence would be met with widespread recognition .
turkey is the only state to have recognized northern cyprus , and not even armenia has so far recognized nagorno-karabakh even though it fought a long and bloody war with azerbaijan over this area . thus , kosovo is unique in that its declaration of independence has been followed by significant international recognition .
this is unlikely to be the case in relation to almost every other separatist movement .
as a consequence , states challenged by separatists , as well as the international community , need to continue looking for other ways to resolve the conflicts that result from these demands .
this demands vision , skill , and determination on the part of local political leaders and the international community , yet these qualities are all too often missing when personal agendas turn legitimate political struggles into a tug-of-war over personal power , status and wealth . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the strong international presence in the region will hopefully prevent anything on the scale of the wars of the 1990s , but similar to the events then , we must be realistic about the limitations of organizations like the eu and nato to resolve the self-determination conflicts that have persisted since the break-up of yugoslavia .
the best we can hope for , at the moment at least , is effective containment . the un has put parts of northern kosovo back under military control .
how can kosovo hope to be an independent state when its government can be so easily over-ridden ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and un troops came under attack from armed serbs the problem with northern kosovo is that this region has never been under any kind of control from pristina since the late 1980s .
after the end of nato 's humanitarian intervention in 1999 the area around mitrovica became a military sector of its own , and gradually belgrade established its own control through its links with local serbs , paying , for example , all local administrators a salary from belgrade in addition to what they received from the united nations mission in kosovo -lsb- unmik -rsb- .
belgrade also discouraged local serbs from participating in elections in kosovo and from taking up their reserved seats in the kosovo assembly . this has created a situation in which we have almost complete segregation of serbs in the north from albanians .
while close links between belgrade and mitrovica exist , these are links that belgrade can now exploit in its strategy to effectively partition kosovo .
this has , so far , been resisted strongly by the international community , and it is difficult to see that this position will change any time soon . so who is actually in control in kosovo ? formally , the un remains in charge , but as we have seen recently , it depends heavily on nato 's military muscle to assert its control .
this gives more and more weight to nato in kosovo , and through nato 's member states to the eu , which has formally committed to playing a major role in supervising and facilitating kosovo 's transition to full independent statehood . nato has threatened to come down hard in kosovo .
what could this mean ?
where could nato 's power be directed and against whom ?
what would it achieve and what could be the consequences ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato will crack down in response to further attacks if there is more violence of the kind recently experienced in mitrovica , nato is clearly able to respond swiftly and decisively in restoring law and order .
more importantly , nato needs to assert full control of kosovo 's borders to prevent an influx of radical extremists from serbia bent on destabilizing the situation further . at the same time , nato will need to make sure that any unrest in kosovo does not spread to other volatile areas of the region , such as bosnia and macedonia .
it is highly unlikely that there will be prolonged and open hostilities with serbian forces , but there is always a chance that localized violence might occur especially in border areas .
the worst case scenario would be that , following parliamentary elections in serbia in may , a new government deliberately provokes such incidents .
this would be a vey dangerous scenario , and an unwise strategy for any government to follow . what effect is the current unrest likely to have in the wider balkan region ?
is there any chance that the unrest will spread beyond the region 's borders ? we have already seen the negative effects of kosovo 's independence in the region : bosnian serbs have , unsurprisingly , become more assertive about their own aspirations of eventual unification with serbia , and even though the serbian government itself has kept relatively quiet in this respect , it is an open secret that many politicians and ordinary people in serbia would welcome any developments that brought bosnian serbs closer to them . the collapse of the coalition government in macedonia has once again raised the specter of further separatist violence there as well .
if anything positive has come from the recent unrest , it is nato 's obvious determination not to tolerate any kind of violence that would put into question the borders that exist now or undermine the constitutional frameworks that were put in place in bosnia in 1995 and in macedonia after 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : separatists in the caucasus apply pressure on russia on the other hand , international effects are more difficult to gauge .
while several separatist movements - for example in the caucasus and in moldova - have intensified their rhetoric in the wake of kosovo 's declaration , and its subsequent recognition by so far over 30 states , it is important not to overestimate the " kosovo effect " - separatist movements existed in these areas before , and they are unlikely to receive any greater degree of international recognition now than they did before . could kosovo 's declaration of independence be linked to the pro-independence protests in tibet ?
where could this lead ?
could there be a knock-on effect all around the world where separatist organizations and oppressed minorities rise up , emboldened by the kosovo declaration ? what goes for the south caucasus and moldova , equally applies to tibet and other separatist conflicts .
the unrest in tibet is much more closely related to the international attention that china receives now in light of it hosting the olympic games this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest in tibet is unlikely to be linked to kosovo this is not to say that protesters in tibet may not have good reason to protest against china , but it is equally a reality - and a sad one - that international media attention increases with the level of violence present .
this was the case with kosovo in the late 1990s , with darfur since 2003 , and with both of the palestinian intifadas . in this sense , it would be wrong to blame any other violence and unrest merely on kosovo .
we must not forget that it still takes political leaders to decide on a path of violence and their supporters to follow them before we can see the kind of violence that tibet has experienced again of late - and this is true for separatists and the states they challenge alike . if this is the start of a wave of empowered separatist uprisings , who could be next to demand their independence ? everyone who wants independence probably has demanded it already , and several times over .
there have been almost 80 separatist movements worldwide since the 1950s which pursued their goals with violence .
at the moment , we have about 25 active armed movements and another 50 or so who pursue their aims by peaceful means .
what matters is not whether they declare or demand their independence , but rather how the international community reacts to this . short of consensual separation , as was the case with czechoslovakia , for example , it is unlikely that any declarations of independence would be met with widespread recognition .
turkey is the only state to have recognized northern cyprus , and not even armenia has so far recognized nagorno-karabakh even though it fought a long and bloody war with azerbaijan over this area . thus , kosovo is unique in that its declaration of independence has been followed by significant international recognition .
this is unlikely to be the case in relation to almost every other separatist movement .
as a consequence , states challenged by separatists , as well as the international community , need to continue looking for other ways to resolve the conflicts that result from these demands .
this demands vision , skill , and determination on the part of local political leaders and the international community , yet these qualities are all too often missing when personal agendas turn legitimate political struggles into a tug-of-war over personal power , status and wealth . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a news report has now uncovered the latest scandal at the chain . according to german newsmagazine stern , lidl officials last year ordered detectives to install hidden cameras in several stores in germany to observe their employees at work and during breaks . the magazine received several hundred pages of reports on lidl employees that included information on when they left work to use the restroom , personal phone conversations employees made and comments on their appearance . lidl officials acknowledged that the company had used cameras and detectives but not to watch its workers . " the idea that we would ' spy ' on our employees does not at all comply with our leadership principles and the fair treatment of our workers , " said company director juergen kissebert in a statement . he added that lidl was putting an immediate stop to the practice . stasi techniques ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee 's tatoo did not make detectives happy the style of the reports recalled the detailed surveillance records of east germany 's secret police , the stasi .
in one case , a detective commented on the " self-made " tattoos visible on an employee 's forearms and suggested that she should be asked to cover them up as especially elderly customers might think she got them in prison . in another case , the report quoted a conversation between two employees , with one telling the other she hoped her wages had been transferred to her account since she desperately needed money that night .
" for what ? " asked the detective in his report . work vs. privacy many other surveillance notes , which can be read on stern 's web site , focus on the employees ' work habits , mentioning things such as a candy bar left lying atop female hygiene products rather than being returned to its correct place and employees talking to each other in polish in front of customers . lidl officials , who did not deny the existence of the reports , have said that they were simply intended to uncover " possible misconduct " by employees .
they distanced themselves from the idea of spying on people 's privacy , saying that the reports were not in line with the company 's " way of dealing with each other . " calls for investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaar said that the latest allegations should be investigated germany 's data protection officer , peter schaar , meanwhile told stern that the reports were a grave infringement on the country 's data protection laws .
he said he expected data protection agencies to investigate the matter . state officials in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg , where lidl is headquartered , said that they would check into the matter , according to german news service dpa . a european giant lidl has stores in 23 european countries , according to the company 's web site .
the chain came under pressure from german services sector trade union verdi in 2004 , when the union published a black book on the company 's practices in dealing with employees . apart from germany 's no.1 discounter aldi , lidl remains the country 's most popular store for cheap food and other low-price products , according to a study published this month . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" what differs greatly is the burden they will carry . " while wealthier states such as baden-wuerttemberg and bavaria in the south might face the highest costs at 129 billion euros and 113 billion euros respectively , they 'll be less hard hit than poorer regions such as the city state of bremen in the north or brandenburg in the east , according to a diw study released wednesday . more swimming , less skiing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will southern europeans flock to germany 's beaches in the future ?
the impact of climate change will also differ greatly , if the report 's finding prove accurate .
germany 's northern states will mainly face rising temperatures , which could actually help the area as it would make beaches along the north and baltic seas more attractive for tourists . extreme precipitation in fall and winter will mainly hit central and southwestern germany , while southern and eastern germany are likely to struggle with extended periods of drought .
the south will also suffer as a result of rising temperatures : by 2100 , there probably wo n't be any snow in germany 's alpine regions , bringing an end to winter sports tourism . rising temperatures could also lead to problems with energy supply as nuclear power plants , for example , might run out of cooling water , the report said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sarkozy also called for closer cooperation between britain and france in the nuclear technology and military fields , including afghanistan , where france intended to increase its support . french pledge added military support to afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french pledges to boost troop numbers in afghanistan could put pressure germany declaring that " we can not afford to lose afghanistan , that the taliban and al qaeda return to kabul , " sarkozy said france would announce at the forthcoming nato summit in bucharest its intention to increase its troop strength . " france has proposed to its allies in the atlantic alliance a coherent and comprehensive strategy to allow the afghan people and their legitimate government to build peace , " sarkozy said .
" if these proposals are accepted , france will propose at the bucharest summit strengthening its military presence . " although he gave no figure , diplomatic sources said the french troop contingent in afghanistan was expected to be increased by more than 1,000 from the 1,600 currently stationed there . the french move would come as nato members with troops in southern afghanistan call on berlin to increase the number of soldiers deployed to the country and remove restrictions that keep the bundeswehr in afghanistan 's relatively safer northern region . paris-berlin axis not sufficient for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu needs more than merkel and sarkozy 's partnership can offer some political analysts have said the french president is reaching out to brown because he does not get on well with german chancellor angela merkel .

" although he gave no figure , diplomatic sources said the french troop contingent in afghanistan was expected to be increased by more than 1,000 from the 1,600 currently stationed there . the french move would come as nato members with troops in southern afghanistan call on berlin to increase the number of soldiers deployed to the country and remove restrictions that keep the bundeswehr in afghanistan 's relatively safer northern region . paris-berlin axis not sufficient for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu needs more than merkel and sarkozy 's partnership can offer some political analysts have said the french president is reaching out to brown because he does not get on well with german chancellor angela merkel .

" the economic damage will increase in all federal states , " diw 's claudia kemfert said at the 3rd extreme weather congress in hamburg on wednesday , march 26 .
" what differs greatly is the burden they will carry . " while wealthier states such as baden-wuerttemberg and bavaria in the south might face the highest costs at 129 billion euros and 113 billion euros respectively , they 'll be less hard hit than poorer regions such as the city state of bremen in the north or brandenburg in the east , according to a diw study released wednesday . more swimming , less skiing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will southern europeans flock to germany 's beaches in the future ?
the impact of climate change will also differ greatly , if the report 's finding prove accurate .
germany 's northern states will mainly face rising temperatures , which could actually help the area as it would make beaches along the north and baltic seas more attractive for tourists . extreme precipitation in fall and winter will mainly hit central and southwestern germany , while southern and eastern germany are likely to struggle with extended periods of drought .
the south will also suffer as a result of rising temperatures : by 2100 , there probably wo n't be any snow in germany 's alpine regions , bringing an end to winter sports tourism . rising temperatures could also lead to problems with energy supply as nuclear power plants , for example , might run out of cooling water , the report said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" career , partner , children , and social involvement - today 's women want everything , according to the study . eighty-five percent said it was important to them to have their own income and be independent , even with children .
slightly more , 90 percent , said they wanted to have children . " the time of either-or is over , " said jutta allmendinger , who directed the study , entitled " women on the move . "
over 1,000 young women in germany , aged 17-19 and 27-29 , were questioned for the study , which contrasts sharply with a similar survey conducted by brigitte in 1982 . what 's more , today 's young women are willing to do what it takes to attain their wishes - 96 percent said they did n't think one could get anywhere in life without goals , and 79 percent said they were working hard toward theirs . allmendinger said it was surprising that this trend of self-confidence and ambition was found among women in all social groups . women less willing to compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young women have cast off the burden of perfectionism in the household the number of women who want to work has increased , the study found .
" in -lsb- the former -rsb- west germany , it used to be just 20 to 30 percent , the rest was rhetoric , " allmendinger said . education plays a strong role in young women 's lives , with three to four times as many girls completing their abitur , the high school exam that allows students to carry on to university . on the job , women are less willing than their male counterparts to give everything and always be available , according to the study .
most do n't feel supported by society - only one-sixth said that children and career could be easily combined these days . " if companies do n't offer women an acceptable balance between work and life , they 'll soon be lacking important personnel resources , " said allmendinger . rethinking priorities despite their career ambitions , the women surveyed also placed a strong emphasis on relationships .
three-quarters said they wanted a steady partner .
ninety-one percent said friends were important to them , while 87 percent said the same of parents and siblings . the women rated good looks -lrb- 59 percent -rrb- and good sex -lrb- 54 percent -rrb- as less significant .
only one-fourth said being thin was important . if 90 percent of this generation of women chooses a different path than their mothers , this will change society , said allmendinger .
" society is going to have to get used to a new type of woman . " bildunterschrift : a steady partner and children are also important to young women dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
high inflation in the euro zone will continue for longer than expected , he said , as a result of " increases in food and energy prices . " " we 're concerned about the excessive exchange rate fluctuations , " said trichet , calling for a " significant change of culture " and greater transparency in the financial system . on wednesday , the euro rose once again against the dollar , opening at $ 1.5729 , over one cent more than the previous day . a pleasant surprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet said not raising interest rates would help stabilize prices experts were all the more surprised when the monthly ifo index , released on wednesday , revealed an increase in the country 's economic confidence for the third time in a row . the index , considered germany 's most significant barometer of market climate , surveys 7,000 companies about their current economic situation and their expectations for the next six months . in the march report , the index rose in both of these areas , for a total score of 104.8 points over 104.1 in february .

afghanistan and the olympics in beijing will be on the agenda , but some say the trip is also an attempt to spiff up the president 's image . after months of french president nicolas sarkozy 's private life being in the limelight , more politics and some pomp will be on the agenda once the leader arrives in britain . ahead of the visit , sarzoky called for closer french-british ties .
the two countries should " move from being cordial to being friendly , " sarkozy said in an interview with british broadcaster bbc . sarkozy said the friendship " should n't simply be a matter of principle , " but one that is " fleshed out by concrete projects on the economy , immigration , security , defense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's queen elizabeth ii at the house of lords the french president will be accompanied by his wife carla bruni-sarkozy for the two-day visit , during which the couple will meet with queen elizabeth ii and prime minister gordon brown .
it will be the highest profile international engagement since sarzoky 's and bruni 's wedding in february . pomp and politics the couple is to spend the night at windsor castle , the queen 's treasured home west of london , in a rare honor for a foreign leader . the visit will also include a procession through windsor 's streets in a horse-drawn carriage and a state banquet . sarkozy is also to address both houses of the british parliament on wednesday - an honor bestowed to just 31 foreign leaders since 1939 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serious issues to discuss with brown include afghanistan on thursday , sarkozy is to meet with prime minister brown for a summit during which the two are expected to announce a deal for france to help britain build a new generation of nuclear power plants . the two are also expected to discuss the option of france sending an additional 1,000 troops to afghanistan to aid in the international fight against the taliban .
britain has nearly 8,000 troops in the country . talks may also focus on the need for greater transparency of financial markets , including full disclosure of write-offs by banks , in light of ongoing market turbulence and the near-collapse of us investment bank bear stearns . sarkozy could likely repeat a threat he made on tuesday that france can not rule out a boycott of the opening ceremony of the beijing olympics due to china 's crackdown in tibet . mending franco-british ties in an editorial , the british newspaper the independent called sarkozy 's visit " not just a potentially significant staging post in britain 's erratic european journey . " " a stronger anglo-french relationship could have wider consequences .
it is better for britain , france and for the rest of the world if the two countries are working closely together rather than damaging themselves by feuding from a distance , " the paper wrote . under the leadership of predecessors jacques chirac and tony blair , the two countries clashed over france 's opposition to the us-led , british-backed invasion of iraq in march 2003 , and relations have been strained ever since . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollsters say the love affair between carla bruni and sarkozy has distracted the president french media have portrayed the trip as an opportunity for sarkozy to boost his ratings with a more statesmanlike image to stop his personal life from being the focus of attention . a recent survey by france 's journal du dimanche newspaper put the french people 's satisfaction rating with sarkozy at 37 percent , and his right-wing ump party suffered heavy losses in local elections earlier this month . analysts blame the president 's tangled personal life for the dip in his popularity .
sarkozy 's divorce from his second wife , cecilia ciganier-albeniz , and his recent marriage to model-turned-singer carla bruni made headlines for months . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sarkozy also called for closer cooperation between britain and france in the nuclear technology and military fields , including afghanistan , where france intended to increase its support . french pledge added military support to afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french pledges to boost troop numbers in afghanistan could put pressure germany declaring that " we can not afford to lose afghanistan , that the taliban and al qaeda return to kabul , " sarkozy said france would announce at the forthcoming nato summit in bucharest its intention to increase its troop strength . " france has proposed to its allies in the atlantic alliance a coherent and comprehensive strategy to allow the afghan people and their legitimate government to build peace , " sarkozy said .
" if these proposals are accepted , france will propose at the bucharest summit strengthening its military presence . " although he gave no figure , diplomatic sources said the french troop contingent in afghanistan was expected to be increased by more than 1,000 from the 1,600 currently stationed there . the french move would come as nato members with troops in southern afghanistan call on berlin to increase the number of soldiers deployed to the country and remove restrictions that keep the bundeswehr in afghanistan 's relatively safer northern region . paris-berlin axis not sufficient for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu needs more than merkel and sarkozy 's partnership can offer some political analysts have said the french president is reaching out to brown because he does not get on well with german chancellor angela merkel .
berlin and paris traditionally dominate the european union . in an interview with the bbc before the trip , sarkozy , who is scheduled to take over the european council presidency in three months , said france 's european policies would no longer be " reduced to friendship with germany . "
he added that " the paris-berlin axis is fundamental but not sufficient . " brown for his part told parliament that paris and london were pursuing a " joint agenda for the future . "
his talks with sarkozy scheduled for thursday would include increased cooperation in the energy , security , environmental protection and economic sectors . replying to questions from the lower house , brown also stressed that while france a key ally , the united states remained " britain 's closest ally " and " most important partner . " knightly honors for sarkozy prince charles and wife camilla welcomed sarkozy and his wife , carla , at london 's heathrow airport before a banquet with queen elizabeth and prince philip at windsor castle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's wife , carla , was praised for her elegance and taste by the british press sarkozy was made an honorary knight grand cross of the order of the bath , the highest rank of one of the oldest orders of british chivalry whose previous recipients include world leaders , including his predecessor francois mitterand . the french leader - on what is the first by a french head of state in 12 years - had already called for britain and france to work " hand in glove " on issues like illegal immigration and terrorism , and to forge " a new franco-british brotherhood . " ahead of the visit , sarkozy called for closer franco-british ties , telling british broadcaster bbc that both countries should perhaps " move from being cordial to being friendly . " french-british ties under sarkozy and brown 's predecessors , jacques chirac and tony blair , were fraught as a result of the iraq war . " it has been long enough now that we have not been at war , that we are not wrangling , " sarkozy said . old acquaintances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and brown began working as their countries ' finance ministers sarkozy said the friendship between britain and france " should n't simply be a matter of principle , " but one that is " fleshed out by concrete projects on the economy , immigration , security , defense . " brown said in an interview published wednesday in the french daily le monde that britain and france will work " hand in hand " to reform international institutions such as the united nations . brown said that he and sarkozy had worked together for years , when they were both finance ministers , " and we have the same vision of a globalized world . " " france and britain can therefore work hand in hand with common interests and shared values , " brown said .
" this is the case , and you will see it in the coming weeks , of the reform of international institutions created in 1945 : the un , the world bank and the international monetary fund .

" the economic damage will increase in all federal states , " diw 's claudia kemfert said at the 3rd extreme weather congress in hamburg on wednesday , march 26 .
" what differs greatly is the burden they will carry . " while wealthier states such as baden-wuerttemberg and bavaria in the south might face the highest costs at 129 billion euros and 113 billion euros respectively , they 'll be less hard hit than poorer regions such as the city state of bremen in the north or brandenburg in the east , according to a diw study released wednesday . more swimming , less skiing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will southern europeans flock to germany 's beaches in the future ?
the impact of climate change will also differ greatly , if the report 's finding prove accurate .
germany 's northern states will mainly face rising temperatures , which could actually help the area as it would make beaches along the north and baltic seas more attractive for tourists . extreme precipitation in fall and winter will mainly hit central and southwestern germany , while southern and eastern germany are likely to struggle with extended periods of drought .
the south will also suffer as a result of rising temperatures : by 2100 , there probably wo n't be any snow in germany 's alpine regions , bringing an end to winter sports tourism . rising temperatures could also lead to problems with energy supply as nuclear power plants , for example , might run out of cooling water , the report said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a news report has now uncovered the latest scandal at the chain . according to german newsmagazine stern , lidl officials last year ordered detectives to install hidden cameras in several stores in germany to observe their employees at work and during breaks . the magazine received several hundred pages of reports on lidl employees that included information on when they left work to use the restroom , personal phone conversations employees made and comments on their appearance . lidl officials acknowledged that the company had used cameras and detectives but not to watch its workers . " the idea that we would ' spy ' on our employees does not at all comply with our leadership principles and the fair treatment of our workers , " said company director juergen kissebert in a statement . he added that lidl was putting an immediate stop to the practice . stasi techniques ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee 's tatoo did not make detectives happy the style of the reports recalled the detailed surveillance records of east germany 's secret police , the stasi .
in one case , a detective commented on the " self-made " tattoos visible on an employee 's forearms and suggested that she should be asked to cover them up as especially elderly customers might think she got them in prison . in another case , the report quoted a conversation between two employees , with one telling the other she hoped her wages had been transferred to her account since she desperately needed money that night .
" for what ? " asked the detective in his report . work vs. privacy many other surveillance notes , which can be read on stern 's web site , focus on the employees ' work habits , mentioning things such as a candy bar left lying atop female hygiene products rather than being returned to its correct place and employees talking to each other in polish in front of customers . lidl officials , who did not deny the existence of the reports , have said that they were simply intended to uncover " possible misconduct " by employees .
they distanced themselves from the idea of spying on people 's privacy , saying that the reports were not in line with the company 's " way of dealing with each other . " calls for investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaar said that the latest allegations should be investigated germany 's data protection officer , peter schaar , meanwhile told stern that the reports were a grave infringement on the country 's data protection laws .
he said he expected data protection agencies to investigate the matter . state officials in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg , where lidl is headquartered , said that they would check into the matter , according to german news service dpa . a european giant lidl has stores in 23 european countries , according to the company 's web site .
the chain came under pressure from german services sector trade union verdi in 2004 , when the union published a black book on the company 's practices in dealing with employees . apart from germany 's no.1 discounter aldi , lidl remains the country 's most popular store for cheap food and other low-price products , according to a study published this month . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a news report has now uncovered the latest scandal at the chain . according to german newsmagazine stern , lidl officials last year ordered detectives to install hidden cameras in several stores in germany to observe their employees at work and during breaks . the magazine received several hundred pages of reports on lidl employees that included information on when they left work to use the restroom , personal phone conversations employees made and comments on their appearance . lidl officials acknowledged that the company had used cameras and detectives but not to watch its workers . " the idea that we would ' spy ' on our employees does not at all comply with our leadership principles and the fair treatment of our workers , " said company director juergen kissebert in a statement . he added that lidl was putting an immediate stop to the practice . stasi techniques ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee 's tatoo did not make detectives happy the style of the reports recalled the detailed surveillance records of east germany 's secret police , the stasi .
in one case , a detective commented on the " self-made " tattoos visible on an employee 's forearms and suggested that she should be asked to cover them up as especially elderly customers might think she got them in prison . in another case , the report quoted a conversation between two employees , with one telling the other she hoped her wages had been transferred to her account since she desperately needed money that night .
" for what ? " asked the detective in his report . work vs. privacy many other surveillance notes , which can be read on stern 's web site , focus on the employees ' work habits , mentioning things such as a candy bar left lying atop female hygiene products rather than being returned to its correct place and employees talking to each other in polish in front of customers . lidl officials , who did not deny the existence of the reports , have said that they were simply intended to uncover " possible misconduct " by employees .
they distanced themselves from the idea of spying on people 's privacy , saying that the reports were not in line with the company 's " way of dealing with each other . " calls for investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaar said that the latest allegations should be investigated germany 's data protection officer , peter schaar , meanwhile told stern that the reports were a grave infringement on the country 's data protection laws .
he said he expected data protection agencies to investigate the matter . state officials in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg , where lidl is headquartered , said that they would check into the matter , according to german news service dpa . a european giant lidl has stores in 23 european countries , according to the company 's web site .
the chain came under pressure from german services sector trade union verdi in 2004 , when the union published a black book on the company 's practices in dealing with employees . apart from germany 's no.1 discounter aldi , lidl remains the country 's most popular store for cheap food and other low-price products , according to a study published this month . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

afghanistan and the olympics in beijing will be on the agenda , but some say the trip is also an attempt to spiff up the president 's image . after months of french president nicolas sarkozy 's private life being in the limelight , more politics and some pomp will be on the agenda once the leader arrives in britain . ahead of the visit , sarzoky called for closer french-british ties .
the two countries should " move from being cordial to being friendly , " sarkozy said in an interview with british broadcaster bbc . sarkozy said the friendship " should n't simply be a matter of principle , " but one that is " fleshed out by concrete projects on the economy , immigration , security , defense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's queen elizabeth ii at the house of lords the french president will be accompanied by his wife carla bruni-sarkozy for the two-day visit , during which the couple will meet with queen elizabeth ii and prime minister gordon brown .
it will be the highest profile international engagement since sarzoky 's and bruni 's wedding in february . pomp and politics the couple is to spend the night at windsor castle , the queen 's treasured home west of london , in a rare honor for a foreign leader . the visit will also include a procession through windsor 's streets in a horse-drawn carriage and a state banquet . sarkozy is also to address both houses of the british parliament on wednesday - an honor bestowed to just 31 foreign leaders since 1939 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serious issues to discuss with brown include afghanistan on thursday , sarkozy is to meet with prime minister brown for a summit during which the two are expected to announce a deal for france to help britain build a new generation of nuclear power plants . the two are also expected to discuss the option of france sending an additional 1,000 troops to afghanistan to aid in the international fight against the taliban .
britain has nearly 8,000 troops in the country . talks may also focus on the need for greater transparency of financial markets , including full disclosure of write-offs by banks , in light of ongoing market turbulence and the near-collapse of us investment bank bear stearns . sarkozy could likely repeat a threat he made on tuesday that france can not rule out a boycott of the opening ceremony of the beijing olympics due to china 's crackdown in tibet . mending franco-british ties in an editorial , the british newspaper the independent called sarkozy 's visit " not just a potentially significant staging post in britain 's erratic european journey . " " a stronger anglo-french relationship could have wider consequences .
it is better for britain , france and for the rest of the world if the two countries are working closely together rather than damaging themselves by feuding from a distance , " the paper wrote . under the leadership of predecessors jacques chirac and tony blair , the two countries clashed over france 's opposition to the us-led , british-backed invasion of iraq in march 2003 , and relations have been strained ever since . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollsters say the love affair between carla bruni and sarkozy has distracted the president french media have portrayed the trip as an opportunity for sarkozy to boost his ratings with a more statesmanlike image to stop his personal life from being the focus of attention . a recent survey by france 's journal du dimanche newspaper put the french people 's satisfaction rating with sarkozy at 37 percent , and his right-wing ump party suffered heavy losses in local elections earlier this month . analysts blame the president 's tangled personal life for the dip in his popularity .
sarkozy 's divorce from his second wife , cecilia ciganier-albeniz , and his recent marriage to model-turned-singer carla bruni made headlines for months . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a news report has now uncovered the latest scandal at the chain . according to german newsmagazine stern , lidl officials last year ordered detectives to install hidden cameras in several stores in germany to observe their employees at work and during breaks . the magazine received several hundred pages of reports on lidl employees that included information on when they left work to use the restroom , personal phone conversations employees made and comments on their appearance . lidl officials acknowledged that the company had used cameras and detectives but not to watch its workers . " the idea that we would ' spy ' on our employees does not at all comply with our leadership principles and the fair treatment of our workers , " said company director juergen kissebert in a statement . he added that lidl was putting an immediate stop to the practice . stasi techniques ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee 's tatoo did not make detectives happy the style of the reports recalled the detailed surveillance records of east germany 's secret police , the stasi .

" for what ? " asked the detective in his report . work vs. privacy many other surveillance notes , which can be read on stern 's web site , focus on the employees ' work habits , mentioning things such as a candy bar left lying atop female hygiene products rather than being returned to its correct place and employees talking to each other in polish in front of customers . lidl officials , who did not deny the existence of the reports , have said that they were simply intended to uncover " possible misconduct " by employees .

no beer , no dancing and absolutely no room service ; national soccer team coach joachim loew has pulled the plug on his players ' fun ahead of this summer 's 2008 european championships . you are what you eat : loew , it seems , has taken the old adage seriously and put his players on a strict diet to keep them in shape for the european championships in austria and switzerland this june . the service teams at the germans ' training camp in mallorca and their hotel in ascona , switzerland , have reportedly been instructed not to provide the national players with room service under any circumstances , lest the players sneakily attempt to order a beer or - gasp ! - chips .

" anyone who is out until the early hours of the morning is n't taking their job seriously , " bierhoff added . team officials are hoping that this kind of teutonic dedication that will help german succeed in the quest to claim their fourth european championship title this summer . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

afghanistan and the olympics in beijing will be on the agenda , but some say the trip is also an attempt to spiff up the president 's image . after months of french president nicolas sarkozy 's private life being in the limelight , more politics and some pomp will be on the agenda once the leader arrives in britain . ahead of the visit , sarzoky called for closer french-british ties .
the two countries should " move from being cordial to being friendly , " sarkozy said in an interview with british broadcaster bbc . sarkozy said the friendship " should n't simply be a matter of principle , " but one that is " fleshed out by concrete projects on the economy , immigration , security , defense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's queen elizabeth ii at the house of lords the french president will be accompanied by his wife carla bruni-sarkozy for the two-day visit , during which the couple will meet with queen elizabeth ii and prime minister gordon brown .
it will be the highest profile international engagement since sarzoky 's and bruni 's wedding in february . pomp and politics the couple is to spend the night at windsor castle , the queen 's treasured home west of london , in a rare honor for a foreign leader . the visit will also include a procession through windsor 's streets in a horse-drawn carriage and a state banquet . sarkozy is also to address both houses of the british parliament on wednesday - an honor bestowed to just 31 foreign leaders since 1939 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serious issues to discuss with brown include afghanistan on thursday , sarkozy is to meet with prime minister brown for a summit during which the two are expected to announce a deal for france to help britain build a new generation of nuclear power plants . the two are also expected to discuss the option of france sending an additional 1,000 troops to afghanistan to aid in the international fight against the taliban .
britain has nearly 8,000 troops in the country . talks may also focus on the need for greater transparency of financial markets , including full disclosure of write-offs by banks , in light of ongoing market turbulence and the near-collapse of us investment bank bear stearns . sarkozy could likely repeat a threat he made on tuesday that france can not rule out a boycott of the opening ceremony of the beijing olympics due to china 's crackdown in tibet . mending franco-british ties in an editorial , the british newspaper the independent called sarkozy 's visit " not just a potentially significant staging post in britain 's erratic european journey . " " a stronger anglo-french relationship could have wider consequences .
it is better for britain , france and for the rest of the world if the two countries are working closely together rather than damaging themselves by feuding from a distance , " the paper wrote . under the leadership of predecessors jacques chirac and tony blair , the two countries clashed over france 's opposition to the us-led , british-backed invasion of iraq in march 2003 , and relations have been strained ever since . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollsters say the love affair between carla bruni and sarkozy has distracted the president french media have portrayed the trip as an opportunity for sarkozy to boost his ratings with a more statesmanlike image to stop his personal life from being the focus of attention . a recent survey by france 's journal du dimanche newspaper put the french people 's satisfaction rating with sarkozy at 37 percent , and his right-wing ump party suffered heavy losses in local elections earlier this month . analysts blame the president 's tangled personal life for the dip in his popularity .
sarkozy 's divorce from his second wife , cecilia ciganier-albeniz , and his recent marriage to model-turned-singer carla bruni made headlines for months . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de talked to a balkans expert about the latest developments . the violence in the ethnically divided town of mitrovica last week was the worst since kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority declared independence on feb .
17 .
hundreds of united nations peacekeepers and nato soldiers pulled out of the frontier region that abuts serbia after coming under fire from automatic weapons and hand grenades .
a ukrainian police officer was killed during the unrest . three days after the withdrawal , the un and nato mounted an operation to retake a courthouse taken over by ethnic serb protesters and restore military control over the northern border region around mitrovica .
the town is now once again under un control . in the days since the violence , the rhetoric coming from belgrade has increased in its bellicosity as accusations of armed provocation fly between the serbian government and the western powers in kosovo . dw-world.de spoke to professor stefan wolff , a political scientist and director of the center for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university , about the latest developments . dw-world.de : who is behind the current unrest in northern kosovo ?
is it public anger or do you think this violence is orchestrated by organized powers with an agenda ? stefan wolff : the violence in northern kosovo over the past several weeks is both an expression of public anger by local serbs and something that is at least encouraged by belgrade .
similar to the violence that happened in the immediate aftermath of kosovo 's declaration of independence when the american and other western embassies were targeted , the government in belgrade is not doing enough to send a strong message to the rioters , nor does , for that matter , the serb orthodox church .
quite clearly , the resulting instability serves serbia 's , and to some extent russia 's , agenda well , offering , as it were , proof for the claim that kosovo 's independence is the source of unrest and insecurity . what is the goal of those who are behind or are carrying out these violent protests ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the northern region was soon reclaimed by un forces many of those participating in the violence undoubtedly feel very strongly about kosovo and the fact that kosovo 's independence has no basis in international law and is a violation of serbia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
having said that , those people are also deluding themselves somewhat in believing that any other " solution " would have brought any more stability or that their violence will affect any change for the better . attacks on the un in northern kosovo , or on western embassies in belgrade , merely confirm to kosovo albanians and many others beyond kosovo - and in my opinion wrongly - that peaceful coexistence with serbs and serbia is very difficult to achieve .
making things difficult for the un , the eu , nato and other international organizations in kosovo and the region is ultimately a futile strategy that may pay off for some politicians in the short term but will harm serbs and serbia as a whole in the long term .
thus was the case with -lsb- former yugoslav president slobodan -rsb- milosevic , who built a reputation on " standing up " against the west .
the sooner serbs realize that kosovo was lost some 20 years ago when its autonomy was revoked and milosevic and his allies brutally asserted their control , the sooner they can move on with building a viable , democratic , european state . are we watching the beginnings of a new conflict in the balkans ? it is unlikely that the situation in kosovo itself will escalate into a new conflict in the balkans , but in combination with the instability that macedonia is experiencing in the wake of the fall of its government and the increasing belligerence of serbs in bosnia , it is difficult to see how the region would achieve greater stability in the near future .
the strong international presence in the region will hopefully prevent anything on the scale of the wars of the 1990s , but similar to the events then , we must be realistic about the limitations of organizations like the eu and nato to resolve the self-determination conflicts that have persisted since the break-up of yugoslavia .
the best we can hope for , at the moment at least , is effective containment . the un has put parts of northern kosovo back under military control .
how can kosovo hope to be an independent state when its government can be so easily over-ridden ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and un troops came under attack from armed serbs the problem with northern kosovo is that this region has never been under any kind of control from pristina since the late 1980s .
after the end of nato 's humanitarian intervention in 1999 the area around mitrovica became a military sector of its own , and gradually belgrade established its own control through its links with local serbs , paying , for example , all local administrators a salary from belgrade in addition to what they received from the united nations mission in kosovo -lsb- unmik -rsb- .
belgrade also discouraged local serbs from participating in elections in kosovo and from taking up their reserved seats in the kosovo assembly . this has created a situation in which we have almost complete segregation of serbs in the north from albanians .
while close links between belgrade and mitrovica exist , these are links that belgrade can now exploit in its strategy to effectively partition kosovo .
this has , so far , been resisted strongly by the international community , and it is difficult to see that this position will change any time soon . so who is actually in control in kosovo ? formally , the un remains in charge , but as we have seen recently , it depends heavily on nato 's military muscle to assert its control .
this gives more and more weight to nato in kosovo , and through nato 's member states to the eu , which has formally committed to playing a major role in supervising and facilitating kosovo 's transition to full independent statehood . nato has threatened to come down hard in kosovo .
what could this mean ?
where could nato 's power be directed and against whom ?
what would it achieve and what could be the consequences ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato will crack down in response to further attacks if there is more violence of the kind recently experienced in mitrovica , nato is clearly able to respond swiftly and decisively in restoring law and order .
more importantly , nato needs to assert full control of kosovo 's borders to prevent an influx of radical extremists from serbia bent on destabilizing the situation further . at the same time , nato will need to make sure that any unrest in kosovo does not spread to other volatile areas of the region , such as bosnia and macedonia .
it is highly unlikely that there will be prolonged and open hostilities with serbian forces , but there is always a chance that localized violence might occur especially in border areas .
the worst case scenario would be that , following parliamentary elections in serbia in may , a new government deliberately provokes such incidents .
this would be a vey dangerous scenario , and an unwise strategy for any government to follow . what effect is the current unrest likely to have in the wider balkan region ?
is there any chance that the unrest will spread beyond the region 's borders ? we have already seen the negative effects of kosovo 's independence in the region : bosnian serbs have , unsurprisingly , become more assertive about their own aspirations of eventual unification with serbia , and even though the serbian government itself has kept relatively quiet in this respect , it is an open secret that many politicians and ordinary people in serbia would welcome any developments that brought bosnian serbs closer to them . the collapse of the coalition government in macedonia has once again raised the specter of further separatist violence there as well .
if anything positive has come from the recent unrest , it is nato 's obvious determination not to tolerate any kind of violence that would put into question the borders that exist now or undermine the constitutional frameworks that were put in place in bosnia in 1995 and in macedonia after 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : separatists in the caucasus apply pressure on russia on the other hand , international effects are more difficult to gauge .
while several separatist movements - for example in the caucasus and in moldova - have intensified their rhetoric in the wake of kosovo 's declaration , and its subsequent recognition by so far over 30 states , it is important not to overestimate the " kosovo effect " - separatist movements existed in these areas before , and they are unlikely to receive any greater degree of international recognition now than they did before . could kosovo 's declaration of independence be linked to the pro-independence protests in tibet ?
where could this lead ?
could there be a knock-on effect all around the world where separatist organizations and oppressed minorities rise up , emboldened by the kosovo declaration ? what goes for the south caucasus and moldova , equally applies to tibet and other separatist conflicts .
the unrest in tibet is much more closely related to the international attention that china receives now in light of it hosting the olympic games this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest in tibet is unlikely to be linked to kosovo this is not to say that protesters in tibet may not have good reason to protest against china , but it is equally a reality - and a sad one - that international media attention increases with the level of violence present .
this was the case with kosovo in the late 1990s , with darfur since 2003 , and with both of the palestinian intifadas . in this sense , it would be wrong to blame any other violence and unrest merely on kosovo .
we must not forget that it still takes political leaders to decide on a path of violence and their supporters to follow them before we can see the kind of violence that tibet has experienced again of late - and this is true for separatists and the states they challenge alike . if this is the start of a wave of empowered separatist uprisings , who could be next to demand their independence ? everyone who wants independence probably has demanded it already , and several times over .
there have been almost 80 separatist movements worldwide since the 1950s which pursued their goals with violence .
at the moment , we have about 25 active armed movements and another 50 or so who pursue their aims by peaceful means .
what matters is not whether they declare or demand their independence , but rather how the international community reacts to this . short of consensual separation , as was the case with czechoslovakia , for example , it is unlikely that any declarations of independence would be met with widespread recognition .
turkey is the only state to have recognized northern cyprus , and not even armenia has so far recognized nagorno-karabakh even though it fought a long and bloody war with azerbaijan over this area . thus , kosovo is unique in that its declaration of independence has been followed by significant international recognition .
this is unlikely to be the case in relation to almost every other separatist movement .
as a consequence , states challenged by separatists , as well as the international community , need to continue looking for other ways to resolve the conflicts that result from these demands .
this demands vision , skill , and determination on the part of local political leaders and the international community , yet these qualities are all too often missing when personal agendas turn legitimate political struggles into a tug-of-war over personal power , status and wealth . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

similar to the violence that happened in the immediate aftermath of kosovo 's declaration of independence when the american and other western embassies were targeted , the government in belgrade is not doing enough to send a strong message to the rioters , nor does , for that matter , the serb orthodox church .
quite clearly , the resulting instability serves serbia 's , and to some extent russia 's , agenda well , offering , as it were , proof for the claim that kosovo 's independence is the source of unrest and insecurity . what is the goal of those who are behind or are carrying out these violent protests ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the northern region was soon reclaimed by un forces many of those participating in the violence undoubtedly feel very strongly about kosovo and the fact that kosovo 's independence has no basis in international law and is a violation of serbia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
having said that , those people are also deluding themselves somewhat in believing that any other " solution " would have brought any more stability or that their violence will affect any change for the better . attacks on the un in northern kosovo , or on western embassies in belgrade , merely confirm to kosovo albanians and many others beyond kosovo - and in my opinion wrongly - that peaceful coexistence with serbs and serbia is very difficult to achieve .
making things difficult for the un , the eu , nato and other international organizations in kosovo and the region is ultimately a futile strategy that may pay off for some politicians in the short term but will harm serbs and serbia as a whole in the long term .
thus was the case with -lsb- former yugoslav president slobodan -rsb- milosevic , who built a reputation on " standing up " against the west .
the sooner serbs realize that kosovo was lost some 20 years ago when its autonomy was revoked and milosevic and his allies brutally asserted their control , the sooner they can move on with building a viable , democratic , european state . are we watching the beginnings of a new conflict in the balkans ? it is unlikely that the situation in kosovo itself will escalate into a new conflict in the balkans , but in combination with the instability that macedonia is experiencing in the wake of the fall of its government and the increasing belligerence of serbs in bosnia , it is difficult to see how the region would achieve greater stability in the near future .
the strong international presence in the region will hopefully prevent anything on the scale of the wars of the 1990s , but similar to the events then , we must be realistic about the limitations of organizations like the eu and nato to resolve the self-determination conflicts that have persisted since the break-up of yugoslavia .
the best we can hope for , at the moment at least , is effective containment . the un has put parts of northern kosovo back under military control .
how can kosovo hope to be an independent state when its government can be so easily over-ridden ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and un troops came under attack from armed serbs the problem with northern kosovo is that this region has never been under any kind of control from pristina since the late 1980s .
after the end of nato 's humanitarian intervention in 1999 the area around mitrovica became a military sector of its own , and gradually belgrade established its own control through its links with local serbs , paying , for example , all local administrators a salary from belgrade in addition to what they received from the united nations mission in kosovo -lsb- unmik -rsb- .
belgrade also discouraged local serbs from participating in elections in kosovo and from taking up their reserved seats in the kosovo assembly . this has created a situation in which we have almost complete segregation of serbs in the north from albanians .
while close links between belgrade and mitrovica exist , these are links that belgrade can now exploit in its strategy to effectively partition kosovo .
this has , so far , been resisted strongly by the international community , and it is difficult to see that this position will change any time soon . so who is actually in control in kosovo ? formally , the un remains in charge , but as we have seen recently , it depends heavily on nato 's military muscle to assert its control .
this gives more and more weight to nato in kosovo , and through nato 's member states to the eu , which has formally committed to playing a major role in supervising and facilitating kosovo 's transition to full independent statehood . nato has threatened to come down hard in kosovo .
what could this mean ?
where could nato 's power be directed and against whom ?
what would it achieve and what could be the consequences ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato will crack down in response to further attacks if there is more violence of the kind recently experienced in mitrovica , nato is clearly able to respond swiftly and decisively in restoring law and order .
more importantly , nato needs to assert full control of kosovo 's borders to prevent an influx of radical extremists from serbia bent on destabilizing the situation further . at the same time , nato will need to make sure that any unrest in kosovo does not spread to other volatile areas of the region , such as bosnia and macedonia .
it is highly unlikely that there will be prolonged and open hostilities with serbian forces , but there is always a chance that localized violence might occur especially in border areas .
the worst case scenario would be that , following parliamentary elections in serbia in may , a new government deliberately provokes such incidents .
this would be a vey dangerous scenario , and an unwise strategy for any government to follow . what effect is the current unrest likely to have in the wider balkan region ?
is there any chance that the unrest will spread beyond the region 's borders ? we have already seen the negative effects of kosovo 's independence in the region : bosnian serbs have , unsurprisingly , become more assertive about their own aspirations of eventual unification with serbia , and even though the serbian government itself has kept relatively quiet in this respect , it is an open secret that many politicians and ordinary people in serbia would welcome any developments that brought bosnian serbs closer to them . the collapse of the coalition government in macedonia has once again raised the specter of further separatist violence there as well .
if anything positive has come from the recent unrest , it is nato 's obvious determination not to tolerate any kind of violence that would put into question the borders that exist now or undermine the constitutional frameworks that were put in place in bosnia in 1995 and in macedonia after 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : separatists in the caucasus apply pressure on russia on the other hand , international effects are more difficult to gauge .
while several separatist movements - for example in the caucasus and in moldova - have intensified their rhetoric in the wake of kosovo 's declaration , and its subsequent recognition by so far over 30 states , it is important not to overestimate the " kosovo effect " - separatist movements existed in these areas before , and they are unlikely to receive any greater degree of international recognition now than they did before . could kosovo 's declaration of independence be linked to the pro-independence protests in tibet ?
where could this lead ?
could there be a knock-on effect all around the world where separatist organizations and oppressed minorities rise up , emboldened by the kosovo declaration ? what goes for the south caucasus and moldova , equally applies to tibet and other separatist conflicts .
the unrest in tibet is much more closely related to the international attention that china receives now in light of it hosting the olympic games this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest in tibet is unlikely to be linked to kosovo this is not to say that protesters in tibet may not have good reason to protest against china , but it is equally a reality - and a sad one - that international media attention increases with the level of violence present .
this was the case with kosovo in the late 1990s , with darfur since 2003 , and with both of the palestinian intifadas . in this sense , it would be wrong to blame any other violence and unrest merely on kosovo .
we must not forget that it still takes political leaders to decide on a path of violence and their supporters to follow them before we can see the kind of violence that tibet has experienced again of late - and this is true for separatists and the states they challenge alike . if this is the start of a wave of empowered separatist uprisings , who could be next to demand their independence ? everyone who wants independence probably has demanded it already , and several times over .
there have been almost 80 separatist movements worldwide since the 1950s which pursued their goals with violence .
at the moment , we have about 25 active armed movements and another 50 or so who pursue their aims by peaceful means .
what matters is not whether they declare or demand their independence , but rather how the international community reacts to this . short of consensual separation , as was the case with czechoslovakia , for example , it is unlikely that any declarations of independence would be met with widespread recognition .
turkey is the only state to have recognized northern cyprus , and not even armenia has so far recognized nagorno-karabakh even though it fought a long and bloody war with azerbaijan over this area . thus , kosovo is unique in that its declaration of independence has been followed by significant international recognition .
this is unlikely to be the case in relation to almost every other separatist movement .
as a consequence , states challenged by separatists , as well as the international community , need to continue looking for other ways to resolve the conflicts that result from these demands .
this demands vision , skill , and determination on the part of local political leaders and the international community , yet these qualities are all too often missing when personal agendas turn legitimate political struggles into a tug-of-war over personal power , status and wealth . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de talked to a balkans expert about the latest developments . the violence in the ethnically divided town of mitrovica last week was the worst since kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority declared independence on feb .
17 .
hundreds of united nations peacekeepers and nato soldiers pulled out of the frontier region that abuts serbia after coming under fire from automatic weapons and hand grenades .
a ukrainian police officer was killed during the unrest . three days after the withdrawal , the un and nato mounted an operation to retake a courthouse taken over by ethnic serb protesters and restore military control over the northern border region around mitrovica .
the town is now once again under un control . in the days since the violence , the rhetoric coming from belgrade has increased in its bellicosity as accusations of armed provocation fly between the serbian government and the western powers in kosovo . dw-world.de spoke to professor stefan wolff , a political scientist and director of the center for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university , about the latest developments . dw-world.de : who is behind the current unrest in northern kosovo ?

" the economic damage will increase in all federal states , " diw 's claudia kemfert said at the 3rd extreme weather congress in hamburg on wednesday , march 26 .
" what differs greatly is the burden they will carry . " while wealthier states such as baden-wuerttemberg and bavaria in the south might face the highest costs at 129 billion euros and 113 billion euros respectively , they 'll be less hard hit than poorer regions such as the city state of bremen in the north or brandenburg in the east , according to a diw study released wednesday . more swimming , less skiing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will southern europeans flock to germany 's beaches in the future ?
the impact of climate change will also differ greatly , if the report 's finding prove accurate .
germany 's northern states will mainly face rising temperatures , which could actually help the area as it would make beaches along the north and baltic seas more attractive for tourists . extreme precipitation in fall and winter will mainly hit central and southwestern germany , while southern and eastern germany are likely to struggle with extended periods of drought .
the south will also suffer as a result of rising temperatures : by 2100 , there probably wo n't be any snow in germany 's alpine regions , bringing an end to winter sports tourism . rising temperatures could also lead to problems with energy supply as nuclear power plants , for example , might run out of cooling water , the report said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" career , partner , children , and social involvement - today 's women want everything , according to the study . eighty-five percent said it was important to them to have their own income and be independent , even with children .
slightly more , 90 percent , said they wanted to have children . " the time of either-or is over , " said jutta allmendinger , who directed the study , entitled " women on the move . "
over 1,000 young women in germany , aged 17-19 and 27-29 , were questioned for the study , which contrasts sharply with a similar survey conducted by brigitte in 1982 . what 's more , today 's young women are willing to do what it takes to attain their wishes - 96 percent said they did n't think one could get anywhere in life without goals , and 79 percent said they were working hard toward theirs . allmendinger said it was surprising that this trend of self-confidence and ambition was found among women in all social groups . women less willing to compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young women have cast off the burden of perfectionism in the household the number of women who want to work has increased , the study found .
" in -lsb- the former -rsb- west germany , it used to be just 20 to 30 percent , the rest was rhetoric , " allmendinger said . education plays a strong role in young women 's lives , with three to four times as many girls completing their abitur , the high school exam that allows students to carry on to university . on the job , women are less willing than their male counterparts to give everything and always be available , according to the study .
most do n't feel supported by society - only one-sixth said that children and career could be easily combined these days . " if companies do n't offer women an acceptable balance between work and life , they 'll soon be lacking important personnel resources , " said allmendinger . rethinking priorities despite their career ambitions , the women surveyed also placed a strong emphasis on relationships .
three-quarters said they wanted a steady partner .
ninety-one percent said friends were important to them , while 87 percent said the same of parents and siblings . the women rated good looks -lrb- 59 percent -rrb- and good sex -lrb- 54 percent -rrb- as less significant .
only one-fourth said being thin was important . if 90 percent of this generation of women chooses a different path than their mothers , this will change society , said allmendinger .
" society is going to have to get used to a new type of woman . " bildunterschrift : a steady partner and children are also important to young women dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

afghanistan and the olympics in beijing will be on the agenda , but some say the trip is also an attempt to spiff up the president 's image . after months of french president nicolas sarkozy 's private life being in the limelight , more politics and some pomp will be on the agenda once the leader arrives in britain . ahead of the visit , sarzoky called for closer french-british ties .
the two countries should " move from being cordial to being friendly , " sarkozy said in an interview with british broadcaster bbc . sarkozy said the friendship " should n't simply be a matter of principle , " but one that is " fleshed out by concrete projects on the economy , immigration , security , defense .

britain has nearly 8,000 troops in the country . talks may also focus on the need for greater transparency of financial markets , including full disclosure of write-offs by banks , in light of ongoing market turbulence and the near-collapse of us investment bank bear stearns . sarkozy could likely repeat a threat he made on tuesday that france can not rule out a boycott of the opening ceremony of the beijing olympics due to china 's crackdown in tibet . mending franco-british ties in an editorial , the british newspaper the independent called sarkozy 's visit " not just a potentially significant staging post in britain 's erratic european journey . " " a stronger anglo-french relationship could have wider consequences .
it is better for britain , france and for the rest of the world if the two countries are working closely together rather than damaging themselves by feuding from a distance , " the paper wrote . under the leadership of predecessors jacques chirac and tony blair , the two countries clashed over france 's opposition to the us-led , british-backed invasion of iraq in march 2003 , and relations have been strained ever since . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollsters say the love affair between carla bruni and sarkozy has distracted the president french media have portrayed the trip as an opportunity for sarkozy to boost his ratings with a more statesmanlike image to stop his personal life from being the focus of attention . a recent survey by france 's journal du dimanche newspaper put the french people 's satisfaction rating with sarkozy at 37 percent , and his right-wing ump party suffered heavy losses in local elections earlier this month . analysts blame the president 's tangled personal life for the dip in his popularity .

britain has nearly 8,000 troops in the country . talks may also focus on the need for greater transparency of financial markets , including full disclosure of write-offs by banks , in light of ongoing market turbulence and the near-collapse of us investment bank bear stearns . sarkozy could likely repeat a threat he made on tuesday that france can not rule out a boycott of the opening ceremony of the beijing olympics due to china 's crackdown in tibet . mending franco-british ties in an editorial , the british newspaper the independent called sarkozy 's visit " not just a potentially significant staging post in britain 's erratic european journey . " " a stronger anglo-french relationship could have wider consequences .
it is better for britain , france and for the rest of the world if the two countries are working closely together rather than damaging themselves by feuding from a distance , " the paper wrote . under the leadership of predecessors jacques chirac and tony blair , the two countries clashed over france 's opposition to the us-led , british-backed invasion of iraq in march 2003 , and relations have been strained ever since . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollsters say the love affair between carla bruni and sarkozy has distracted the president french media have portrayed the trip as an opportunity for sarkozy to boost his ratings with a more statesmanlike image to stop his personal life from being the focus of attention . a recent survey by france 's journal du dimanche newspaper put the french people 's satisfaction rating with sarkozy at 37 percent , and his right-wing ump party suffered heavy losses in local elections earlier this month . analysts blame the president 's tangled personal life for the dip in his popularity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 26.03.2008 nato , un and serbia engage in high stakes game over kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un and nato accuse the serbian government of inciting the violence in mitrovica tensions continue on the streets of mitrovica a week after rioting serbs clashed with police and nato troops in the town on kosovo 's northern border .
dw-world.de talked to a balkans expert about the latest developments . the violence in the ethnically divided town of mitrovica last week was the worst since kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority declared independence on feb .
17 .
hundreds of united nations peacekeepers and nato soldiers pulled out of the frontier region that abuts serbia after coming under fire from automatic weapons and hand grenades .
a ukrainian police officer was killed during the unrest . three days after the withdrawal , the un and nato mounted an operation to retake a courthouse taken over by ethnic serb protesters and restore military control over the northern border region around mitrovica .
the town is now once again under un control . in the days since the violence , the rhetoric coming from belgrade has increased in its bellicosity as accusations of armed provocation fly between the serbian government and the western powers in kosovo . dw-world.de spoke to professor stefan wolff , a political scientist and director of the center for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university , about the latest developments . dw-world.de : who is behind the current unrest in northern kosovo ?
is it public anger or do you think this violence is orchestrated by organized powers with an agenda ? stefan wolff : the violence in northern kosovo over the past several weeks is both an expression of public anger by local serbs and something that is at least encouraged by belgrade .
similar to the violence that happened in the immediate aftermath of kosovo 's declaration of independence when the american and other western embassies were targeted , the government in belgrade is not doing enough to send a strong message to the rioters , nor does , for that matter , the serb orthodox church .
quite clearly , the resulting instability serves serbia 's , and to some extent russia 's , agenda well , offering , as it were , proof for the claim that kosovo 's independence is the source of unrest and insecurity . what is the goal of those who are behind or are carrying out these violent protests ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the northern region was soon reclaimed by un forces many of those participating in the violence undoubtedly feel very strongly about kosovo and the fact that kosovo 's independence has no basis in international law and is a violation of serbia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
having said that , those people are also deluding themselves somewhat in believing that any other " solution " would have brought any more stability or that their violence will affect any change for the better . attacks on the un in northern kosovo , or on western embassies in belgrade , merely confirm to kosovo albanians and many others beyond kosovo - and in my opinion wrongly - that peaceful coexistence with serbs and serbia is very difficult to achieve .
making things difficult for the un , the eu , nato and other international organizations in kosovo and the region is ultimately a futile strategy that may pay off for some politicians in the short term but will harm serbs and serbia as a whole in the long term .
thus was the case with -lsb- former yugoslav president slobodan -rsb- milosevic , who built a reputation on " standing up " against the west .
the sooner serbs realize that kosovo was lost some 20 years ago when its autonomy was revoked and milosevic and his allies brutally asserted their control , the sooner they can move on with building a viable , democratic , european state . are we watching the beginnings of a new conflict in the balkans ? it is unlikely that the situation in kosovo itself will escalate into a new conflict in the balkans , but in combination with the instability that macedonia is experiencing in the wake of the fall of its government and the increasing belligerence of serbs in bosnia , it is difficult to see how the region would achieve greater stability in the near future .
the strong international presence in the region will hopefully prevent anything on the scale of the wars of the 1990s , but similar to the events then , we must be realistic about the limitations of organizations like the eu and nato to resolve the self-determination conflicts that have persisted since the break-up of yugoslavia .
the best we can hope for , at the moment at least , is effective containment . the un has put parts of northern kosovo back under military control .
how can kosovo hope to be an independent state when its government can be so easily over-ridden ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and un troops came under attack from armed serbs the problem with northern kosovo is that this region has never been under any kind of control from pristina since the late 1980s .
after the end of nato 's humanitarian intervention in 1999 the area around mitrovica became a military sector of its own , and gradually belgrade established its own control through its links with local serbs , paying , for example , all local administrators a salary from belgrade in addition to what they received from the united nations mission in kosovo -lsb- unmik -rsb- .
belgrade also discouraged local serbs from participating in elections in kosovo and from taking up their reserved seats in the kosovo assembly . this has created a situation in which we have almost complete segregation of serbs in the north from albanians .
while close links between belgrade and mitrovica exist , these are links that belgrade can now exploit in its strategy to effectively partition kosovo .
this has , so far , been resisted strongly by the international community , and it is difficult to see that this position will change any time soon . so who is actually in control in kosovo ? formally , the un remains in charge , but as we have seen recently , it depends heavily on nato 's military muscle to assert its control .
this gives more and more weight to nato in kosovo , and through nato 's member states to the eu , which has formally committed to playing a major role in supervising and facilitating kosovo 's transition to full independent statehood . nato has threatened to come down hard in kosovo .
what could this mean ?
where could nato 's power be directed and against whom ?
what would it achieve and what could be the consequences ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato will crack down in response to further attacks if there is more violence of the kind recently experienced in mitrovica , nato is clearly able to respond swiftly and decisively in restoring law and order .
more importantly , nato needs to assert full control of kosovo 's borders to prevent an influx of radical extremists from serbia bent on destabilizing the situation further . at the same time , nato will need to make sure that any unrest in kosovo does not spread to other volatile areas of the region , such as bosnia and macedonia .
it is highly unlikely that there will be prolonged and open hostilities with serbian forces , but there is always a chance that localized violence might occur especially in border areas .
the worst case scenario would be that , following parliamentary elections in serbia in may , a new government deliberately provokes such incidents .
this would be a vey dangerous scenario , and an unwise strategy for any government to follow . what effect is the current unrest likely to have in the wider balkan region ?
is there any chance that the unrest will spread beyond the region 's borders ? we have already seen the negative effects of kosovo 's independence in the region : bosnian serbs have , unsurprisingly , become more assertive about their own aspirations of eventual unification with serbia , and even though the serbian government itself has kept relatively quiet in this respect , it is an open secret that many politicians and ordinary people in serbia would welcome any developments that brought bosnian serbs closer to them . the collapse of the coalition government in macedonia has once again raised the specter of further separatist violence there as well .
if anything positive has come from the recent unrest , it is nato 's obvious determination not to tolerate any kind of violence that would put into question the borders that exist now or undermine the constitutional frameworks that were put in place in bosnia in 1995 and in macedonia after 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : separatists in the caucasus apply pressure on russia on the other hand , international effects are more difficult to gauge .
while several separatist movements - for example in the caucasus and in moldova - have intensified their rhetoric in the wake of kosovo 's declaration , and its subsequent recognition by so far over 30 states , it is important not to overestimate the " kosovo effect " - separatist movements existed in these areas before , and they are unlikely to receive any greater degree of international recognition now than they did before . could kosovo 's declaration of independence be linked to the pro-independence protests in tibet ?
where could this lead ?
could there be a knock-on effect all around the world where separatist organizations and oppressed minorities rise up , emboldened by the kosovo declaration ? what goes for the south caucasus and moldova , equally applies to tibet and other separatist conflicts .
the unrest in tibet is much more closely related to the international attention that china receives now in light of it hosting the olympic games this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest in tibet is unlikely to be linked to kosovo this is not to say that protesters in tibet may not have good reason to protest against china , but it is equally a reality - and a sad one - that international media attention increases with the level of violence present .
this was the case with kosovo in the late 1990s , with darfur since 2003 , and with both of the palestinian intifadas . in this sense , it would be wrong to blame any other violence and unrest merely on kosovo .
we must not forget that it still takes political leaders to decide on a path of violence and their supporters to follow them before we can see the kind of violence that tibet has experienced again of late - and this is true for separatists and the states they challenge alike . if this is the start of a wave of empowered separatist uprisings , who could be next to demand their independence ? everyone who wants independence probably has demanded it already , and several times over .
there have been almost 80 separatist movements worldwide since the 1950s which pursued their goals with violence .
at the moment , we have about 25 active armed movements and another 50 or so who pursue their aims by peaceful means .
what matters is not whether they declare or demand their independence , but rather how the international community reacts to this . short of consensual separation , as was the case with czechoslovakia , for example , it is unlikely that any declarations of independence would be met with widespread recognition .
turkey is the only state to have recognized northern cyprus , and not even armenia has so far recognized nagorno-karabakh even though it fought a long and bloody war with azerbaijan over this area . thus , kosovo is unique in that its declaration of independence has been followed by significant international recognition .
this is unlikely to be the case in relation to almost every other separatist movement .
as a consequence , states challenged by separatists , as well as the international community , need to continue looking for other ways to resolve the conflicts that result from these demands .
this demands vision , skill , and determination on the part of local political leaders and the international community , yet these qualities are all too often missing when personal agendas turn legitimate political struggles into a tug-of-war over personal power , status and wealth . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 26.03.2008 nato , un and serbia engage in high stakes game over kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un and nato accuse the serbian government of inciting the violence in mitrovica tensions continue on the streets of mitrovica a week after rioting serbs clashed with police and nato troops in the town on kosovo 's northern border .
dw-world.de talked to a balkans expert about the latest developments . the violence in the ethnically divided town of mitrovica last week was the worst since kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority declared independence on feb .
17 .
hundreds of united nations peacekeepers and nato soldiers pulled out of the frontier region that abuts serbia after coming under fire from automatic weapons and hand grenades .
a ukrainian police officer was killed during the unrest . three days after the withdrawal , the un and nato mounted an operation to retake a courthouse taken over by ethnic serb protesters and restore military control over the northern border region around mitrovica .
the town is now once again under un control . in the days since the violence , the rhetoric coming from belgrade has increased in its bellicosity as accusations of armed provocation fly between the serbian government and the western powers in kosovo . dw-world.de spoke to professor stefan wolff , a political scientist and director of the center for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university , about the latest developments . dw-world.de : who is behind the current unrest in northern kosovo ?
is it public anger or do you think this violence is orchestrated by organized powers with an agenda ? stefan wolff : the violence in northern kosovo over the past several weeks is both an expression of public anger by local serbs and something that is at least encouraged by belgrade .
similar to the violence that happened in the immediate aftermath of kosovo 's declaration of independence when the american and other western embassies were targeted , the government in belgrade is not doing enough to send a strong message to the rioters , nor does , for that matter , the serb orthodox church .
quite clearly , the resulting instability serves serbia 's , and to some extent russia 's , agenda well , offering , as it were , proof for the claim that kosovo 's independence is the source of unrest and insecurity . what is the goal of those who are behind or are carrying out these violent protests ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the northern region was soon reclaimed by un forces many of those participating in the violence undoubtedly feel very strongly about kosovo and the fact that kosovo 's independence has no basis in international law and is a violation of serbia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
having said that , those people are also deluding themselves somewhat in believing that any other " solution " would have brought any more stability or that their violence will affect any change for the better . attacks on the un in northern kosovo , or on western embassies in belgrade , merely confirm to kosovo albanians and many others beyond kosovo - and in my opinion wrongly - that peaceful coexistence with serbs and serbia is very difficult to achieve .
making things difficult for the un , the eu , nato and other international organizations in kosovo and the region is ultimately a futile strategy that may pay off for some politicians in the short term but will harm serbs and serbia as a whole in the long term .
thus was the case with -lsb- former yugoslav president slobodan -rsb- milosevic , who built a reputation on " standing up " against the west .
the sooner serbs realize that kosovo was lost some 20 years ago when its autonomy was revoked and milosevic and his allies brutally asserted their control , the sooner they can move on with building a viable , democratic , european state . are we watching the beginnings of a new conflict in the balkans ? it is unlikely that the situation in kosovo itself will escalate into a new conflict in the balkans , but in combination with the instability that macedonia is experiencing in the wake of the fall of its government and the increasing belligerence of serbs in bosnia , it is difficult to see how the region would achieve greater stability in the near future .
the strong international presence in the region will hopefully prevent anything on the scale of the wars of the 1990s , but similar to the events then , we must be realistic about the limitations of organizations like the eu and nato to resolve the self-determination conflicts that have persisted since the break-up of yugoslavia .
the best we can hope for , at the moment at least , is effective containment . the un has put parts of northern kosovo back under military control .
how can kosovo hope to be an independent state when its government can be so easily over-ridden ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and un troops came under attack from armed serbs the problem with northern kosovo is that this region has never been under any kind of control from pristina since the late 1980s .
after the end of nato 's humanitarian intervention in 1999 the area around mitrovica became a military sector of its own , and gradually belgrade established its own control through its links with local serbs , paying , for example , all local administrators a salary from belgrade in addition to what they received from the united nations mission in kosovo -lsb- unmik -rsb- .
belgrade also discouraged local serbs from participating in elections in kosovo and from taking up their reserved seats in the kosovo assembly . this has created a situation in which we have almost complete segregation of serbs in the north from albanians .
while close links between belgrade and mitrovica exist , these are links that belgrade can now exploit in its strategy to effectively partition kosovo .
this has , so far , been resisted strongly by the international community , and it is difficult to see that this position will change any time soon . so who is actually in control in kosovo ? formally , the un remains in charge , but as we have seen recently , it depends heavily on nato 's military muscle to assert its control .
this gives more and more weight to nato in kosovo , and through nato 's member states to the eu , which has formally committed to playing a major role in supervising and facilitating kosovo 's transition to full independent statehood . nato has threatened to come down hard in kosovo .
what could this mean ?
where could nato 's power be directed and against whom ?
what would it achieve and what could be the consequences ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato will crack down in response to further attacks if there is more violence of the kind recently experienced in mitrovica , nato is clearly able to respond swiftly and decisively in restoring law and order .
more importantly , nato needs to assert full control of kosovo 's borders to prevent an influx of radical extremists from serbia bent on destabilizing the situation further . at the same time , nato will need to make sure that any unrest in kosovo does not spread to other volatile areas of the region , such as bosnia and macedonia .
it is highly unlikely that there will be prolonged and open hostilities with serbian forces , but there is always a chance that localized violence might occur especially in border areas .
the worst case scenario would be that , following parliamentary elections in serbia in may , a new government deliberately provokes such incidents .
this would be a vey dangerous scenario , and an unwise strategy for any government to follow . what effect is the current unrest likely to have in the wider balkan region ?
is there any chance that the unrest will spread beyond the region 's borders ? we have already seen the negative effects of kosovo 's independence in the region : bosnian serbs have , unsurprisingly , become more assertive about their own aspirations of eventual unification with serbia , and even though the serbian government itself has kept relatively quiet in this respect , it is an open secret that many politicians and ordinary people in serbia would welcome any developments that brought bosnian serbs closer to them . the collapse of the coalition government in macedonia has once again raised the specter of further separatist violence there as well .
if anything positive has come from the recent unrest , it is nato 's obvious determination not to tolerate any kind of violence that would put into question the borders that exist now or undermine the constitutional frameworks that were put in place in bosnia in 1995 and in macedonia after 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : separatists in the caucasus apply pressure on russia on the other hand , international effects are more difficult to gauge .
while several separatist movements - for example in the caucasus and in moldova - have intensified their rhetoric in the wake of kosovo 's declaration , and its subsequent recognition by so far over 30 states , it is important not to overestimate the " kosovo effect " - separatist movements existed in these areas before , and they are unlikely to receive any greater degree of international recognition now than they did before . could kosovo 's declaration of independence be linked to the pro-independence protests in tibet ?
where could this lead ?
could there be a knock-on effect all around the world where separatist organizations and oppressed minorities rise up , emboldened by the kosovo declaration ? what goes for the south caucasus and moldova , equally applies to tibet and other separatist conflicts .
the unrest in tibet is much more closely related to the international attention that china receives now in light of it hosting the olympic games this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest in tibet is unlikely to be linked to kosovo this is not to say that protesters in tibet may not have good reason to protest against china , but it is equally a reality - and a sad one - that international media attention increases with the level of violence present .
this was the case with kosovo in the late 1990s , with darfur since 2003 , and with both of the palestinian intifadas . in this sense , it would be wrong to blame any other violence and unrest merely on kosovo .
we must not forget that it still takes political leaders to decide on a path of violence and their supporters to follow them before we can see the kind of violence that tibet has experienced again of late - and this is true for separatists and the states they challenge alike . if this is the start of a wave of empowered separatist uprisings , who could be next to demand their independence ? everyone who wants independence probably has demanded it already , and several times over .
there have been almost 80 separatist movements worldwide since the 1950s which pursued their goals with violence .
at the moment , we have about 25 active armed movements and another 50 or so who pursue their aims by peaceful means .
what matters is not whether they declare or demand their independence , but rather how the international community reacts to this . short of consensual separation , as was the case with czechoslovakia , for example , it is unlikely that any declarations of independence would be met with widespread recognition .
turkey is the only state to have recognized northern cyprus , and not even armenia has so far recognized nagorno-karabakh even though it fought a long and bloody war with azerbaijan over this area . thus , kosovo is unique in that its declaration of independence has been followed by significant international recognition .
this is unlikely to be the case in relation to almost every other separatist movement .
as a consequence , states challenged by separatists , as well as the international community , need to continue looking for other ways to resolve the conflicts that result from these demands .
this demands vision , skill , and determination on the part of local political leaders and the international community , yet these qualities are all too often missing when personal agendas turn legitimate political struggles into a tug-of-war over personal power , status and wealth . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thus was the case with -lsb- former yugoslav president slobodan -rsb- milosevic , who built a reputation on " standing up " against the west .
the sooner serbs realize that kosovo was lost some 20 years ago when its autonomy was revoked and milosevic and his allies brutally asserted their control , the sooner they can move on with building a viable , democratic , european state . are we watching the beginnings of a new conflict in the balkans ? it is unlikely that the situation in kosovo itself will escalate into a new conflict in the balkans , but in combination with the instability that macedonia is experiencing in the wake of the fall of its government and the increasing belligerence of serbs in bosnia , it is difficult to see how the region would achieve greater stability in the near future .
the strong international presence in the region will hopefully prevent anything on the scale of the wars of the 1990s , but similar to the events then , we must be realistic about the limitations of organizations like the eu and nato to resolve the self-determination conflicts that have persisted since the break-up of yugoslavia .
the best we can hope for , at the moment at least , is effective containment . the un has put parts of northern kosovo back under military control .
how can kosovo hope to be an independent state when its government can be so easily over-ridden ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and un troops came under attack from armed serbs the problem with northern kosovo is that this region has never been under any kind of control from pristina since the late 1980s .
after the end of nato 's humanitarian intervention in 1999 the area around mitrovica became a military sector of its own , and gradually belgrade established its own control through its links with local serbs , paying , for example , all local administrators a salary from belgrade in addition to what they received from the united nations mission in kosovo -lsb- unmik -rsb- .
belgrade also discouraged local serbs from participating in elections in kosovo and from taking up their reserved seats in the kosovo assembly . this has created a situation in which we have almost complete segregation of serbs in the north from albanians .
while close links between belgrade and mitrovica exist , these are links that belgrade can now exploit in its strategy to effectively partition kosovo .
this has , so far , been resisted strongly by the international community , and it is difficult to see that this position will change any time soon . so who is actually in control in kosovo ? formally , the un remains in charge , but as we have seen recently , it depends heavily on nato 's military muscle to assert its control .
this gives more and more weight to nato in kosovo , and through nato 's member states to the eu , which has formally committed to playing a major role in supervising and facilitating kosovo 's transition to full independent statehood . nato has threatened to come down hard in kosovo .
what could this mean ?
where could nato 's power be directed and against whom ?
what would it achieve and what could be the consequences ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato will crack down in response to further attacks if there is more violence of the kind recently experienced in mitrovica , nato is clearly able to respond swiftly and decisively in restoring law and order .
more importantly , nato needs to assert full control of kosovo 's borders to prevent an influx of radical extremists from serbia bent on destabilizing the situation further . at the same time , nato will need to make sure that any unrest in kosovo does not spread to other volatile areas of the region , such as bosnia and macedonia .
it is highly unlikely that there will be prolonged and open hostilities with serbian forces , but there is always a chance that localized violence might occur especially in border areas .
the worst case scenario would be that , following parliamentary elections in serbia in may , a new government deliberately provokes such incidents .
this would be a vey dangerous scenario , and an unwise strategy for any government to follow . what effect is the current unrest likely to have in the wider balkan region ?
is there any chance that the unrest will spread beyond the region 's borders ? we have already seen the negative effects of kosovo 's independence in the region : bosnian serbs have , unsurprisingly , become more assertive about their own aspirations of eventual unification with serbia , and even though the serbian government itself has kept relatively quiet in this respect , it is an open secret that many politicians and ordinary people in serbia would welcome any developments that brought bosnian serbs closer to them . the collapse of the coalition government in macedonia has once again raised the specter of further separatist violence there as well .
if anything positive has come from the recent unrest , it is nato 's obvious determination not to tolerate any kind of violence that would put into question the borders that exist now or undermine the constitutional frameworks that were put in place in bosnia in 1995 and in macedonia after 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : separatists in the caucasus apply pressure on russia on the other hand , international effects are more difficult to gauge .
while several separatist movements - for example in the caucasus and in moldova - have intensified their rhetoric in the wake of kosovo 's declaration , and its subsequent recognition by so far over 30 states , it is important not to overestimate the " kosovo effect " - separatist movements existed in these areas before , and they are unlikely to receive any greater degree of international recognition now than they did before . could kosovo 's declaration of independence be linked to the pro-independence protests in tibet ?
where could this lead ?
could there be a knock-on effect all around the world where separatist organizations and oppressed minorities rise up , emboldened by the kosovo declaration ? what goes for the south caucasus and moldova , equally applies to tibet and other separatist conflicts .
the unrest in tibet is much more closely related to the international attention that china receives now in light of it hosting the olympic games this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest in tibet is unlikely to be linked to kosovo this is not to say that protesters in tibet may not have good reason to protest against china , but it is equally a reality - and a sad one - that international media attention increases with the level of violence present .
this was the case with kosovo in the late 1990s , with darfur since 2003 , and with both of the palestinian intifadas . in this sense , it would be wrong to blame any other violence and unrest merely on kosovo .
we must not forget that it still takes political leaders to decide on a path of violence and their supporters to follow them before we can see the kind of violence that tibet has experienced again of late - and this is true for separatists and the states they challenge alike . if this is the start of a wave of empowered separatist uprisings , who could be next to demand their independence ? everyone who wants independence probably has demanded it already , and several times over .
there have been almost 80 separatist movements worldwide since the 1950s which pursued their goals with violence .
at the moment , we have about 25 active armed movements and another 50 or so who pursue their aims by peaceful means .
what matters is not whether they declare or demand their independence , but rather how the international community reacts to this . short of consensual separation , as was the case with czechoslovakia , for example , it is unlikely that any declarations of independence would be met with widespread recognition .
turkey is the only state to have recognized northern cyprus , and not even armenia has so far recognized nagorno-karabakh even though it fought a long and bloody war with azerbaijan over this area . thus , kosovo is unique in that its declaration of independence has been followed by significant international recognition .
this is unlikely to be the case in relation to almost every other separatist movement .
as a consequence , states challenged by separatists , as well as the international community , need to continue looking for other ways to resolve the conflicts that result from these demands .
this demands vision , skill , and determination on the part of local political leaders and the international community , yet these qualities are all too often missing when personal agendas turn legitimate political struggles into a tug-of-war over personal power , status and wealth . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but more choices and cheaper fares for travelers may be a little ways off , analysts say . the agreement between the united states and the european union is to take effect on sunday , march 31 , and will end most restrictions on us and eu airlines ' ability to fly between the two continents .
different air carriers will be allowed to depart or land at various locations on both continents . the concept of the open market dictating flight routes between the europe and the us originally held the promise of cheaper airfares and more choices for travelers , but analysts say the turmoil in the us economy and the airline industry may prevent immediate benefits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competition could cause a cut in fares air carriers are hurting from record-high fuel costs and increased economic uncertainty , industry observers pointed out .

the weak dollar , high oil prices and the concerns of the european central bank were expected to bring confidence down . european central bank president jean-claude trichet on wednesday , march 26 , defended the ecb 's refusal to cut interest rates , as the uk and the us have done , saying this was " necessary to ensure middle-term price stability . "
high inflation in the euro zone will continue for longer than expected , he said , as a result of " increases in food and energy prices .

a news report has now uncovered the latest scandal at the chain . according to german newsmagazine stern , lidl officials last year ordered detectives to install hidden cameras in several stores in germany to observe their employees at work and during breaks . the magazine received several hundred pages of reports on lidl employees that included information on when they left work to use the restroom , personal phone conversations employees made and comments on their appearance . lidl officials acknowledged that the company had used cameras and detectives but not to watch its workers . " the idea that we would ' spy ' on our employees does not at all comply with our leadership principles and the fair treatment of our workers , " said company director juergen kissebert in a statement . he added that lidl was putting an immediate stop to the practice . stasi techniques ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee 's tatoo did not make detectives happy the style of the reports recalled the detailed surveillance records of east germany 's secret police , the stasi .
in one case , a detective commented on the " self-made " tattoos visible on an employee 's forearms and suggested that she should be asked to cover them up as especially elderly customers might think she got them in prison . in another case , the report quoted a conversation between two employees , with one telling the other she hoped her wages had been transferred to her account since she desperately needed money that night .
" for what ? " asked the detective in his report . work vs. privacy many other surveillance notes , which can be read on stern 's web site , focus on the employees ' work habits , mentioning things such as a candy bar left lying atop female hygiene products rather than being returned to its correct place and employees talking to each other in polish in front of customers . lidl officials , who did not deny the existence of the reports , have said that they were simply intended to uncover " possible misconduct " by employees .
they distanced themselves from the idea of spying on people 's privacy , saying that the reports were not in line with the company 's " way of dealing with each other . " calls for investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaar said that the latest allegations should be investigated germany 's data protection officer , peter schaar , meanwhile told stern that the reports were a grave infringement on the country 's data protection laws .

a news report has now uncovered the latest scandal at the chain . according to german newsmagazine stern , lidl officials last year ordered detectives to install hidden cameras in several stores in germany to observe their employees at work and during breaks . the magazine received several hundred pages of reports on lidl employees that included information on when they left work to use the restroom , personal phone conversations employees made and comments on their appearance . lidl officials acknowledged that the company had used cameras and detectives but not to watch its workers . " the idea that we would ' spy ' on our employees does not at all comply with our leadership principles and the fair treatment of our workers , " said company director juergen kissebert in a statement . he added that lidl was putting an immediate stop to the practice . stasi techniques ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee 's tatoo did not make detectives happy the style of the reports recalled the detailed surveillance records of east germany 's secret police , the stasi .
in one case , a detective commented on the " self-made " tattoos visible on an employee 's forearms and suggested that she should be asked to cover them up as especially elderly customers might think she got them in prison . in another case , the report quoted a conversation between two employees , with one telling the other she hoped her wages had been transferred to her account since she desperately needed money that night .
" for what ? " asked the detective in his report . work vs. privacy many other surveillance notes , which can be read on stern 's web site , focus on the employees ' work habits , mentioning things such as a candy bar left lying atop female hygiene products rather than being returned to its correct place and employees talking to each other in polish in front of customers . lidl officials , who did not deny the existence of the reports , have said that they were simply intended to uncover " possible misconduct " by employees .
they distanced themselves from the idea of spying on people 's privacy , saying that the reports were not in line with the company 's " way of dealing with each other . " calls for investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaar said that the latest allegations should be investigated germany 's data protection officer , peter schaar , meanwhile told stern that the reports were a grave infringement on the country 's data protection laws .
he said he expected data protection agencies to investigate the matter . state officials in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg , where lidl is headquartered , said that they would check into the matter , according to german news service dpa . a european giant lidl has stores in 23 european countries , according to the company 's web site .
the chain came under pressure from german services sector trade union verdi in 2004 , when the union published a black book on the company 's practices in dealing with employees . apart from germany 's no.1 discounter aldi , lidl remains the country 's most popular store for cheap food and other low-price products , according to a study published this month . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the economic damage will increase in all federal states , " diw 's claudia kemfert said at the 3rd extreme weather congress in hamburg on wednesday , march 26 .
" what differs greatly is the burden they will carry . " while wealthier states such as baden-wuerttemberg and bavaria in the south might face the highest costs at 129 billion euros and 113 billion euros respectively , they 'll be less hard hit than poorer regions such as the city state of bremen in the north or brandenburg in the east , according to a diw study released wednesday . more swimming , less skiing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will southern europeans flock to germany 's beaches in the future ?
the impact of climate change will also differ greatly , if the report 's finding prove accurate .
germany 's northern states will mainly face rising temperatures , which could actually help the area as it would make beaches along the north and baltic seas more attractive for tourists . extreme precipitation in fall and winter will mainly hit central and southwestern germany , while southern and eastern germany are likely to struggle with extended periods of drought .
the south will also suffer as a result of rising temperatures : by 2100 , there probably wo n't be any snow in germany 's alpine regions , bringing an end to winter sports tourism . rising temperatures could also lead to problems with energy supply as nuclear power plants , for example , might run out of cooling water , the report said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a news report has now uncovered the latest scandal at the chain . according to german newsmagazine stern , lidl officials last year ordered detectives to install hidden cameras in several stores in germany to observe their employees at work and during breaks . the magazine received several hundred pages of reports on lidl employees that included information on when they left work to use the restroom , personal phone conversations employees made and comments on their appearance . lidl officials acknowledged that the company had used cameras and detectives but not to watch its workers . " the idea that we would ' spy ' on our employees does not at all comply with our leadership principles and the fair treatment of our workers , " said company director juergen kissebert in a statement . he added that lidl was putting an immediate stop to the practice . stasi techniques ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee 's tatoo did not make detectives happy the style of the reports recalled the detailed surveillance records of east germany 's secret police , the stasi .
in one case , a detective commented on the " self-made " tattoos visible on an employee 's forearms and suggested that she should be asked to cover them up as especially elderly customers might think she got them in prison . in another case , the report quoted a conversation between two employees , with one telling the other she hoped her wages had been transferred to her account since she desperately needed money that night .
" for what ? " asked the detective in his report . work vs. privacy many other surveillance notes , which can be read on stern 's web site , focus on the employees ' work habits , mentioning things such as a candy bar left lying atop female hygiene products rather than being returned to its correct place and employees talking to each other in polish in front of customers . lidl officials , who did not deny the existence of the reports , have said that they were simply intended to uncover " possible misconduct " by employees .
they distanced themselves from the idea of spying on people 's privacy , saying that the reports were not in line with the company 's " way of dealing with each other . " calls for investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaar said that the latest allegations should be investigated germany 's data protection officer , peter schaar , meanwhile told stern that the reports were a grave infringement on the country 's data protection laws .
he said he expected data protection agencies to investigate the matter . state officials in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg , where lidl is headquartered , said that they would check into the matter , according to german news service dpa . a european giant lidl has stores in 23 european countries , according to the company 's web site .
the chain came under pressure from german services sector trade union verdi in 2004 , when the union published a black book on the company 's practices in dealing with employees . apart from germany 's no.1 discounter aldi , lidl remains the country 's most popular store for cheap food and other low-price products , according to a study published this month . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

afghanistan and the olympics in beijing will be on the agenda , but some say the trip is also an attempt to spiff up the president 's image . after months of french president nicolas sarkozy 's private life being in the limelight , more politics and some pomp will be on the agenda once the leader arrives in britain . ahead of the visit , sarzoky called for closer french-british ties .
the two countries should " move from being cordial to being friendly , " sarkozy said in an interview with british broadcaster bbc . sarkozy said the friendship " should n't simply be a matter of principle , " but one that is " fleshed out by concrete projects on the economy , immigration , security , defense .

britain has nearly 8,000 troops in the country . talks may also focus on the need for greater transparency of financial markets , including full disclosure of write-offs by banks , in light of ongoing market turbulence and the near-collapse of us investment bank bear stearns . sarkozy could likely repeat a threat he made on tuesday that france can not rule out a boycott of the opening ceremony of the beijing olympics due to china 's crackdown in tibet . mending franco-british ties in an editorial , the british newspaper the independent called sarkozy 's visit " not just a potentially significant staging post in britain 's erratic european journey .

it is better for britain , france and for the rest of the world if the two countries are working closely together rather than damaging themselves by feuding from a distance , " the paper wrote . under the leadership of predecessors jacques chirac and tony blair , the two countries clashed over france 's opposition to the us-led , british-backed invasion of iraq in march 2003 , and relations have been strained ever since . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollsters say the love affair between carla bruni and sarkozy has distracted the president french media have portrayed the trip as an opportunity for sarkozy to boost his ratings with a more statesmanlike image to stop his personal life from being the focus of attention . a recent survey by france 's journal du dimanche newspaper put the french people 's satisfaction rating with sarkozy at 37 percent , and his right-wing ump party suffered heavy losses in local elections earlier this month . analysts blame the president 's tangled personal life for the dip in his popularity .

" sarkozy also called for closer cooperation between britain and france in the nuclear technology and military fields , including afghanistan , where france intended to increase its support . french pledge added military support to afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french pledges to boost troop numbers in afghanistan could put pressure germany declaring that " we can not afford to lose afghanistan , that the taliban and al qaeda return to kabul , " sarkozy said france would announce at the forthcoming nato summit in bucharest its intention to increase its troop strength . " france has proposed to its allies in the atlantic alliance a coherent and comprehensive strategy to allow the afghan people and their legitimate government to build peace , " sarkozy said .
" if these proposals are accepted , france will propose at the bucharest summit strengthening its military presence . " although he gave no figure , diplomatic sources said the french troop contingent in afghanistan was expected to be increased by more than 1,000 from the 1,600 currently stationed there . the french move would come as nato members with troops in southern afghanistan call on berlin to increase the number of soldiers deployed to the country and remove restrictions that keep the bundeswehr in afghanistan 's relatively safer northern region . paris-berlin axis not sufficient for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu needs more than merkel and sarkozy 's partnership can offer some political analysts have said the french president is reaching out to brown because he does not get on well with german chancellor angela merkel .
berlin and paris traditionally dominate the european union . in an interview with the bbc before the trip , sarkozy , who is scheduled to take over the european council presidency in three months , said france 's european policies would no longer be " reduced to friendship with germany . "
he added that " the paris-berlin axis is fundamental but not sufficient . " brown for his part told parliament that paris and london were pursuing a " joint agenda for the future . "
his talks with sarkozy scheduled for thursday would include increased cooperation in the energy , security , environmental protection and economic sectors . replying to questions from the lower house , brown also stressed that while france a key ally , the united states remained " britain 's closest ally " and " most important partner . " knightly honors for sarkozy prince charles and wife camilla welcomed sarkozy and his wife , carla , at london 's heathrow airport before a banquet with queen elizabeth and prince philip at windsor castle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's wife , carla , was praised for her elegance and taste by the british press sarkozy was made an honorary knight grand cross of the order of the bath , the highest rank of one of the oldest orders of british chivalry whose previous recipients include world leaders , including his predecessor francois mitterand . the french leader - on what is the first by a french head of state in 12 years - had already called for britain and france to work " hand in glove " on issues like illegal immigration and terrorism , and to forge " a new franco-british brotherhood . " ahead of the visit , sarkozy called for closer franco-british ties , telling british broadcaster bbc that both countries should perhaps " move from being cordial to being friendly . " french-british ties under sarkozy and brown 's predecessors , jacques chirac and tony blair , were fraught as a result of the iraq war . " it has been long enough now that we have not been at war , that we are not wrangling , " sarkozy said . old acquaintances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and brown began working as their countries ' finance ministers sarkozy said the friendship between britain and france " should n't simply be a matter of principle , " but one that is " fleshed out by concrete projects on the economy , immigration , security , defense . " brown said in an interview published wednesday in the french daily le monde that britain and france will work " hand in hand " to reform international institutions such as the united nations . brown said that he and sarkozy had worked together for years , when they were both finance ministers , " and we have the same vision of a globalized world . " " france and britain can therefore work hand in hand with common interests and shared values , " brown said .
" this is the case , and you will see it in the coming weeks , of the reform of international institutions created in 1945 : the un , the world bank and the international monetary fund . " these organizations , brown said , " no longer correspond to the challenges of 2008 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 26.03.2008 physics could soothe migraine pain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migraines are sometimes preceded by auras , or visual disturbances migraine headaches are a widespread illness , but doctors are often at a loss in how to offer relief to patients .
now , physicists have started tackling the problem - and may have discovered the cause of the illness . the intense , throbbing pain of a migraine often feels like an attack on the senses .
in germany , some 12 percent to 16 percent of the population suffers from migraines , which can affect one or both sides of the head .
but some sufferers experience a kind of warning , known as an " aura , " before the full-blown attack . scientists , however , remain at odds over whether an aura is the cause of migraine pain , or an accompanying symptom since migraines can occur with or without auras .
the auras themselves also do not necessarily develop into migraines . an aura is a kind of psychological or neurological " churning " lasting from five minutes to 30 minutes and which can result in vertigo , confusion , or numbness , and can also affect vision in various ways .
visual disturbances , such as vision loss , or hallucinations may result , including flashing lights , distortion of objects or the emergence of complex color patterns . malfunction in visual cortex bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some migraines can last for days , forcing sufferers to stay in bed auras involving visual disturbances often intrigue doctors because they are so mysterious . scientists have known for the past few years that such auras are linked with a so-called stimulation wave .
this involves increased activity of brain cells that occurs in the visual cortex and which moves at the rate of three millimeters -lrb- 0.118 inches -rrb- per minute .
a malfunction in the visual cortex , however , makes aura sufferers see something in their line of vision which does not really exist . a 30-minute-aura could prove fatal since someone suffering from one behind the wheel could perceive an empty street when in fact a cyclist is passing by . faulty feedback mechanisms using computer simulations , physicists are now trying to figure out what triggers an aura . the simulations do not try to replicate the entire brain in a computer , but instead , some of its decisive mechanisms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migraines cause pain beyond words for many sufferers " those include the neurons grouped in the visual cortex which are connected to one another in multiple ways , " said eckehard schoell , managing director of the institute for theoretical physics in berlin .
" when electrical pulses move along these connections , we have what we call a stimulation wave . " particularly important here is the ability of brain cells to both send and receive signals .
cells can thus communicate with other cells and send back or pass on the information they have just received . the physicists in berlin have tracked precisely these signals in their computer simulations . " let 's assume that this feedback mechanism is occurring and our model is currently in an area where no waves can develop - that would be the model of a healthy patient , " schoell said .
" if we were to now suppress this feedback mechanism from occurring , then we suddenly move into an area where waves can occur . " one could then assume that a lack of feedback mechanisms is what causes the stimulation waves and thus migraine auras . glasses may solve problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pair of special glasses might help some scientists are now speculating that artificial means could help trigger the missing feedback processes , with experts at the juelich research center in western germany placing their bets on an unusual pair of glasses . special sensors attached to the glasses at the back of the head can measure brain activity .
their signals can control diodes which are located on the front of the glasses and which produce bright , flashing lights that influence the activity of neurons in the brain . the goal is that the flashing lights from the glasses would hinder the stimulation waves , thereby suppressing auras and hopefully the migraines as well . while the glasses have so far only been tested on healthy patients , scientists are optimistic about the results .
but whether they can actually help suppress auras and even migraines in sufferers remains to be seen . frank grotelueschen -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the economic damage will increase in all federal states , " diw 's claudia kemfert said at the 3rd extreme weather congress in hamburg on wednesday , march 26 .
" what differs greatly is the burden they will carry . " while wealthier states such as baden-wuerttemberg and bavaria in the south might face the highest costs at 129 billion euros and 113 billion euros respectively , they 'll be less hard hit than poorer regions such as the city state of bremen in the north or brandenburg in the east , according to a diw study released wednesday . more swimming , less skiing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will southern europeans flock to germany 's beaches in the future ?
the impact of climate change will also differ greatly , if the report 's finding prove accurate .
germany 's northern states will mainly face rising temperatures , which could actually help the area as it would make beaches along the north and baltic seas more attractive for tourists . extreme precipitation in fall and winter will mainly hit central and southwestern germany , while southern and eastern germany are likely to struggle with extended periods of drought .
the south will also suffer as a result of rising temperatures : by 2100 , there probably wo n't be any snow in germany 's alpine regions , bringing an end to winter sports tourism . rising temperatures could also lead to problems with energy supply as nuclear power plants , for example , might run out of cooling water , the report said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but more choices and cheaper fares for travelers may be a little ways off , analysts say . the agreement between the united states and the european union is to take effect on sunday , march 31 , and will end most restrictions on us and eu airlines ' ability to fly between the two continents .
different air carriers will be allowed to depart or land at various locations on both continents . the concept of the open market dictating flight routes between the europe and the us originally held the promise of cheaper airfares and more choices for travelers , but analysts say the turmoil in the us economy and the airline industry may prevent immediate benefits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competition could cause a cut in fares air carriers are hurting from record-high fuel costs and increased economic uncertainty , industry observers pointed out . " i think -lsb- the agreement -rsb- would mean a lot more if the industry were not in the dire straits they are in now , " terry trippler , an aviation consultant and founder of tripplertravel.com , told afp news agency .

" in the longer term there may be some overexpansion , followed by some contraction , " hamlin said . hamlin said airlines would have to plan ahead for good times and bad by ordering aircraft and securing landing rights even if conditions were not ideal . " we do n't even begin to get a glimmer of the possibilities of open-market competition yet , " jerry chandler , cheapflights.com 's travel blogger , told the new york times .

" i think in the next 18 months you will be able to travel at a steep discount to europe , " he told afp , and predicted more low-cost , business-class options and other carriers serving an expanded trans-atlantic route network . klaskin agreed that airlines must prepare for the changes , despite their worries concerning the economic climate and soaring fuel costs . given the circumstances , " -lsb- the airlines -rsb- ca n't afford to make a mistake , " he told afp . pact opens up options the pact allows airlines more freedom .
formerly , individual european countries and the us maintained separate agreements for trans-atlantic flight .
airlines had to depart from or land in their native countries and were limited in which airports they could serve .
british airways flights , for instance , had to take off from britain .
only american airlines and united airlines were permitted to land at heathrow airport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa could broaden its network of hubs and not just rely on frankfurt as of next week , northwest , delta and continental will be able to serve heathrow or other european airports for the first time . european carriers may also begin to compete more aggressively with one another .

but more choices and cheaper fares for travelers may be a little ways off , analysts say . the agreement between the united states and the european union is to take effect on sunday , march 31 , and will end most restrictions on us and eu airlines ' ability to fly between the two continents .
different air carriers will be allowed to depart or land at various locations on both continents . the concept of the open market dictating flight routes between the europe and the us originally held the promise of cheaper airfares and more choices for travelers , but analysts say the turmoil in the us economy and the airline industry may prevent immediate benefits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competition could cause a cut in fares air carriers are hurting from record-high fuel costs and increased economic uncertainty , industry observers pointed out . " i think -lsb- the agreement -rsb- would mean a lot more if the industry were not in the dire straits they are in now , " terry trippler , an aviation consultant and founder of tripplertravel.com , told afp news agency . " the industry is more concerned about cutting flights than expanding , " he said .
" eventually this will be fantastic when this industry shakes itself out .

" we do n't even begin to get a glimmer of the possibilities of open-market competition yet , " jerry chandler , cheapflights.com 's travel blogger , told the new york times .
" there could be a lot of flourishing of routes in markets that currently do n't exist , especially from smaller us cities to european hubs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such comforts may be out of reach for travelers , but cheaper fares could be on the horizon stuart klaskin of the aviation consultancy kkc agreed , pointing out that the gradually opening up market will lead to competition that will benefit smaller cities on both sides of the atlantic . " i think in the next 18 months you will be able to travel at a steep discount to europe , " he told afp , and predicted more low-cost , business-class options and other carriers serving an expanded trans-atlantic route network . klaskin agreed that airlines must prepare for the changes , despite their worries concerning the economic climate and soaring fuel costs . given the circumstances , " -lsb- the airlines -rsb- ca n't afford to make a mistake , " he told afp . pact opens up options the pact allows airlines more freedom .

" the economic damage will increase in all federal states , " diw 's claudia kemfert said at the 3rd extreme weather congress in hamburg on wednesday , march 26 .
" what differs greatly is the burden they will carry . " while wealthier states such as baden-wuerttemberg and bavaria in the south might face the highest costs at 129 billion euros and 113 billion euros respectively , they 'll be less hard hit than poorer regions such as the city state of bremen in the north or brandenburg in the east , according to a diw study released wednesday . more swimming , less skiing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will southern europeans flock to germany 's beaches in the future ?
the impact of climate change will also differ greatly , if the report 's finding prove accurate .
germany 's northern states will mainly face rising temperatures , which could actually help the area as it would make beaches along the north and baltic seas more attractive for tourists . extreme precipitation in fall and winter will mainly hit central and southwestern germany , while southern and eastern germany are likely to struggle with extended periods of drought .
the south will also suffer as a result of rising temperatures : by 2100 , there probably wo n't be any snow in germany 's alpine regions , bringing an end to winter sports tourism . rising temperatures could also lead to problems with energy supply as nuclear power plants , for example , might run out of cooling water , the report said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the weak dollar , high oil prices and the concerns of the european central bank were expected to bring confidence down . european central bank president jean-claude trichet on wednesday , march 26 , defended the ecb 's refusal to cut interest rates , as the uk and the us have done , saying this was " necessary to ensure middle-term price stability . "
high inflation in the euro zone will continue for longer than expected , he said , as a result of " increases in food and energy prices .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 26.03.2008 nato , un and serbia engage in high stakes game over kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un and nato accuse the serbian government of inciting the violence in mitrovica tensions continue on the streets of mitrovica a week after rioting serbs clashed with police and nato troops in the town on kosovo 's northern border .
dw-world.de talked to a balkans expert about the latest developments . the violence in the ethnically divided town of mitrovica last week was the worst since kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority declared independence on feb .
17 .
hundreds of united nations peacekeepers and nato soldiers pulled out of the frontier region that abuts serbia after coming under fire from automatic weapons and hand grenades .
a ukrainian police officer was killed during the unrest . three days after the withdrawal , the un and nato mounted an operation to retake a courthouse taken over by ethnic serb protesters and restore military control over the northern border region around mitrovica .
the town is now once again under un control . in the days since the violence , the rhetoric coming from belgrade has increased in its bellicosity as accusations of armed provocation fly between the serbian government and the western powers in kosovo . dw-world.de spoke to professor stefan wolff , a political scientist and director of the center for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university , about the latest developments . dw-world.de : who is behind the current unrest in northern kosovo ?
is it public anger or do you think this violence is orchestrated by organized powers with an agenda ? stefan wolff : the violence in northern kosovo over the past several weeks is both an expression of public anger by local serbs and something that is at least encouraged by belgrade .
similar to the violence that happened in the immediate aftermath of kosovo 's declaration of independence when the american and other western embassies were targeted , the government in belgrade is not doing enough to send a strong message to the rioters , nor does , for that matter , the serb orthodox church .
quite clearly , the resulting instability serves serbia 's , and to some extent russia 's , agenda well , offering , as it were , proof for the claim that kosovo 's independence is the source of unrest and insecurity . what is the goal of those who are behind or are carrying out these violent protests ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the northern region was soon reclaimed by un forces many of those participating in the violence undoubtedly feel very strongly about kosovo and the fact that kosovo 's independence has no basis in international law and is a violation of serbia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
having said that , those people are also deluding themselves somewhat in believing that any other " solution " would have brought any more stability or that their violence will affect any change for the better . attacks on the un in northern kosovo , or on western embassies in belgrade , merely confirm to kosovo albanians and many others beyond kosovo - and in my opinion wrongly - that peaceful coexistence with serbs and serbia is very difficult to achieve .
making things difficult for the un , the eu , nato and other international organizations in kosovo and the region is ultimately a futile strategy that may pay off for some politicians in the short term but will harm serbs and serbia as a whole in the long term .
thus was the case with -lsb- former yugoslav president slobodan -rsb- milosevic , who built a reputation on " standing up " against the west .
the sooner serbs realize that kosovo was lost some 20 years ago when its autonomy was revoked and milosevic and his allies brutally asserted their control , the sooner they can move on with building a viable , democratic , european state . are we watching the beginnings of a new conflict in the balkans ? it is unlikely that the situation in kosovo itself will escalate into a new conflict in the balkans , but in combination with the instability that macedonia is experiencing in the wake of the fall of its government and the increasing belligerence of serbs in bosnia , it is difficult to see how the region would achieve greater stability in the near future .
the strong international presence in the region will hopefully prevent anything on the scale of the wars of the 1990s , but similar to the events then , we must be realistic about the limitations of organizations like the eu and nato to resolve the self-determination conflicts that have persisted since the break-up of yugoslavia .
the best we can hope for , at the moment at least , is effective containment . the un has put parts of northern kosovo back under military control .
how can kosovo hope to be an independent state when its government can be so easily over-ridden ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and un troops came under attack from armed serbs the problem with northern kosovo is that this region has never been under any kind of control from pristina since the late 1980s .
after the end of nato 's humanitarian intervention in 1999 the area around mitrovica became a military sector of its own , and gradually belgrade established its own control through its links with local serbs , paying , for example , all local administrators a salary from belgrade in addition to what they received from the united nations mission in kosovo -lsb- unmik -rsb- .
belgrade also discouraged local serbs from participating in elections in kosovo and from taking up their reserved seats in the kosovo assembly . this has created a situation in which we have almost complete segregation of serbs in the north from albanians .
while close links between belgrade and mitrovica exist , these are links that belgrade can now exploit in its strategy to effectively partition kosovo .
this has , so far , been resisted strongly by the international community , and it is difficult to see that this position will change any time soon . so who is actually in control in kosovo ? formally , the un remains in charge , but as we have seen recently , it depends heavily on nato 's military muscle to assert its control .
this gives more and more weight to nato in kosovo , and through nato 's member states to the eu , which has formally committed to playing a major role in supervising and facilitating kosovo 's transition to full independent statehood . nato has threatened to come down hard in kosovo .
what could this mean ?
where could nato 's power be directed and against whom ?
what would it achieve and what could be the consequences ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato will crack down in response to further attacks if there is more violence of the kind recently experienced in mitrovica , nato is clearly able to respond swiftly and decisively in restoring law and order .
more importantly , nato needs to assert full control of kosovo 's borders to prevent an influx of radical extremists from serbia bent on destabilizing the situation further . at the same time , nato will need to make sure that any unrest in kosovo does not spread to other volatile areas of the region , such as bosnia and macedonia .
it is highly unlikely that there will be prolonged and open hostilities with serbian forces , but there is always a chance that localized violence might occur especially in border areas .
the worst case scenario would be that , following parliamentary elections in serbia in may , a new government deliberately provokes such incidents .
this would be a vey dangerous scenario , and an unwise strategy for any government to follow . what effect is the current unrest likely to have in the wider balkan region ?
is there any chance that the unrest will spread beyond the region 's borders ? we have already seen the negative effects of kosovo 's independence in the region : bosnian serbs have , unsurprisingly , become more assertive about their own aspirations of eventual unification with serbia , and even though the serbian government itself has kept relatively quiet in this respect , it is an open secret that many politicians and ordinary people in serbia would welcome any developments that brought bosnian serbs closer to them . the collapse of the coalition government in macedonia has once again raised the specter of further separatist violence there as well .
if anything positive has come from the recent unrest , it is nato 's obvious determination not to tolerate any kind of violence that would put into question the borders that exist now or undermine the constitutional frameworks that were put in place in bosnia in 1995 and in macedonia after 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : separatists in the caucasus apply pressure on russia on the other hand , international effects are more difficult to gauge .
while several separatist movements - for example in the caucasus and in moldova - have intensified their rhetoric in the wake of kosovo 's declaration , and its subsequent recognition by so far over 30 states , it is important not to overestimate the " kosovo effect " - separatist movements existed in these areas before , and they are unlikely to receive any greater degree of international recognition now than they did before . could kosovo 's declaration of independence be linked to the pro-independence protests in tibet ?
where could this lead ?
could there be a knock-on effect all around the world where separatist organizations and oppressed minorities rise up , emboldened by the kosovo declaration ? what goes for the south caucasus and moldova , equally applies to tibet and other separatist conflicts .
the unrest in tibet is much more closely related to the international attention that china receives now in light of it hosting the olympic games this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest in tibet is unlikely to be linked to kosovo this is not to say that protesters in tibet may not have good reason to protest against china , but it is equally a reality - and a sad one - that international media attention increases with the level of violence present .
this was the case with kosovo in the late 1990s , with darfur since 2003 , and with both of the palestinian intifadas . in this sense , it would be wrong to blame any other violence and unrest merely on kosovo .
we must not forget that it still takes political leaders to decide on a path of violence and their supporters to follow them before we can see the kind of violence that tibet has experienced again of late - and this is true for separatists and the states they challenge alike . if this is the start of a wave of empowered separatist uprisings , who could be next to demand their independence ? everyone who wants independence probably has demanded it already , and several times over .
there have been almost 80 separatist movements worldwide since the 1950s which pursued their goals with violence .
at the moment , we have about 25 active armed movements and another 50 or so who pursue their aims by peaceful means .
what matters is not whether they declare or demand their independence , but rather how the international community reacts to this . short of consensual separation , as was the case with czechoslovakia , for example , it is unlikely that any declarations of independence would be met with widespread recognition .
turkey is the only state to have recognized northern cyprus , and not even armenia has so far recognized nagorno-karabakh even though it fought a long and bloody war with azerbaijan over this area . thus , kosovo is unique in that its declaration of independence has been followed by significant international recognition .
this is unlikely to be the case in relation to almost every other separatist movement .
as a consequence , states challenged by separatists , as well as the international community , need to continue looking for other ways to resolve the conflicts that result from these demands .
this demands vision , skill , and determination on the part of local political leaders and the international community , yet these qualities are all too often missing when personal agendas turn legitimate political struggles into a tug-of-war over personal power , status and wealth . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

quite clearly , the resulting instability serves serbia 's , and to some extent russia 's , agenda well , offering , as it were , proof for the claim that kosovo 's independence is the source of unrest and insecurity . what is the goal of those who are behind or are carrying out these violent protests ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the northern region was soon reclaimed by un forces many of those participating in the violence undoubtedly feel very strongly about kosovo and the fact that kosovo 's independence has no basis in international law and is a violation of serbia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
having said that , those people are also deluding themselves somewhat in believing that any other " solution " would have brought any more stability or that their violence will affect any change for the better . attacks on the un in northern kosovo , or on western embassies in belgrade , merely confirm to kosovo albanians and many others beyond kosovo - and in my opinion wrongly - that peaceful coexistence with serbs and serbia is very difficult to achieve .
making things difficult for the un , the eu , nato and other international organizations in kosovo and the region is ultimately a futile strategy that may pay off for some politicians in the short term but will harm serbs and serbia as a whole in the long term .
thus was the case with -lsb- former yugoslav president slobodan -rsb- milosevic , who built a reputation on " standing up " against the west .
the sooner serbs realize that kosovo was lost some 20 years ago when its autonomy was revoked and milosevic and his allies brutally asserted their control , the sooner they can move on with building a viable , democratic , european state . are we watching the beginnings of a new conflict in the balkans ? it is unlikely that the situation in kosovo itself will escalate into a new conflict in the balkans , but in combination with the instability that macedonia is experiencing in the wake of the fall of its government and the increasing belligerence of serbs in bosnia , it is difficult to see how the region would achieve greater stability in the near future .
the strong international presence in the region will hopefully prevent anything on the scale of the wars of the 1990s , but similar to the events then , we must be realistic about the limitations of organizations like the eu and nato to resolve the self-determination conflicts that have persisted since the break-up of yugoslavia .
the best we can hope for , at the moment at least , is effective containment . the un has put parts of northern kosovo back under military control .
how can kosovo hope to be an independent state when its government can be so easily over-ridden ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and un troops came under attack from armed serbs the problem with northern kosovo is that this region has never been under any kind of control from pristina since the late 1980s .
after the end of nato 's humanitarian intervention in 1999 the area around mitrovica became a military sector of its own , and gradually belgrade established its own control through its links with local serbs , paying , for example , all local administrators a salary from belgrade in addition to what they received from the united nations mission in kosovo -lsb- unmik -rsb- .
belgrade also discouraged local serbs from participating in elections in kosovo and from taking up their reserved seats in the kosovo assembly . this has created a situation in which we have almost complete segregation of serbs in the north from albanians .
while close links between belgrade and mitrovica exist , these are links that belgrade can now exploit in its strategy to effectively partition kosovo .
this has , so far , been resisted strongly by the international community , and it is difficult to see that this position will change any time soon . so who is actually in control in kosovo ? formally , the un remains in charge , but as we have seen recently , it depends heavily on nato 's military muscle to assert its control .
this gives more and more weight to nato in kosovo , and through nato 's member states to the eu , which has formally committed to playing a major role in supervising and facilitating kosovo 's transition to full independent statehood . nato has threatened to come down hard in kosovo .
what could this mean ?
where could nato 's power be directed and against whom ?
what would it achieve and what could be the consequences ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato will crack down in response to further attacks if there is more violence of the kind recently experienced in mitrovica , nato is clearly able to respond swiftly and decisively in restoring law and order .
more importantly , nato needs to assert full control of kosovo 's borders to prevent an influx of radical extremists from serbia bent on destabilizing the situation further . at the same time , nato will need to make sure that any unrest in kosovo does not spread to other volatile areas of the region , such as bosnia and macedonia .
it is highly unlikely that there will be prolonged and open hostilities with serbian forces , but there is always a chance that localized violence might occur especially in border areas .
the worst case scenario would be that , following parliamentary elections in serbia in may , a new government deliberately provokes such incidents .
this would be a vey dangerous scenario , and an unwise strategy for any government to follow . what effect is the current unrest likely to have in the wider balkan region ?
is there any chance that the unrest will spread beyond the region 's borders ? we have already seen the negative effects of kosovo 's independence in the region : bosnian serbs have , unsurprisingly , become more assertive about their own aspirations of eventual unification with serbia , and even though the serbian government itself has kept relatively quiet in this respect , it is an open secret that many politicians and ordinary people in serbia would welcome any developments that brought bosnian serbs closer to them . the collapse of the coalition government in macedonia has once again raised the specter of further separatist violence there as well .
if anything positive has come from the recent unrest , it is nato 's obvious determination not to tolerate any kind of violence that would put into question the borders that exist now or undermine the constitutional frameworks that were put in place in bosnia in 1995 and in macedonia after 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : separatists in the caucasus apply pressure on russia on the other hand , international effects are more difficult to gauge .
while several separatist movements - for example in the caucasus and in moldova - have intensified their rhetoric in the wake of kosovo 's declaration , and its subsequent recognition by so far over 30 states , it is important not to overestimate the " kosovo effect " - separatist movements existed in these areas before , and they are unlikely to receive any greater degree of international recognition now than they did before . could kosovo 's declaration of independence be linked to the pro-independence protests in tibet ?
where could this lead ?
could there be a knock-on effect all around the world where separatist organizations and oppressed minorities rise up , emboldened by the kosovo declaration ? what goes for the south caucasus and moldova , equally applies to tibet and other separatist conflicts .
the unrest in tibet is much more closely related to the international attention that china receives now in light of it hosting the olympic games this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest in tibet is unlikely to be linked to kosovo this is not to say that protesters in tibet may not have good reason to protest against china , but it is equally a reality - and a sad one - that international media attention increases with the level of violence present .
this was the case with kosovo in the late 1990s , with darfur since 2003 , and with both of the palestinian intifadas . in this sense , it would be wrong to blame any other violence and unrest merely on kosovo .
we must not forget that it still takes political leaders to decide on a path of violence and their supporters to follow them before we can see the kind of violence that tibet has experienced again of late - and this is true for separatists and the states they challenge alike . if this is the start of a wave of empowered separatist uprisings , who could be next to demand their independence ? everyone who wants independence probably has demanded it already , and several times over .
there have been almost 80 separatist movements worldwide since the 1950s which pursued their goals with violence .
at the moment , we have about 25 active armed movements and another 50 or so who pursue their aims by peaceful means .
what matters is not whether they declare or demand their independence , but rather how the international community reacts to this . short of consensual separation , as was the case with czechoslovakia , for example , it is unlikely that any declarations of independence would be met with widespread recognition .
turkey is the only state to have recognized northern cyprus , and not even armenia has so far recognized nagorno-karabakh even though it fought a long and bloody war with azerbaijan over this area . thus , kosovo is unique in that its declaration of independence has been followed by significant international recognition .
this is unlikely to be the case in relation to almost every other separatist movement .
as a consequence , states challenged by separatists , as well as the international community , need to continue looking for other ways to resolve the conflicts that result from these demands .
this demands vision , skill , and determination on the part of local political leaders and the international community , yet these qualities are all too often missing when personal agendas turn legitimate political struggles into a tug-of-war over personal power , status and wealth . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de talked to a balkans expert about the latest developments . the violence in the ethnically divided town of mitrovica last week was the worst since kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority declared independence on feb .
17 .
hundreds of united nations peacekeepers and nato soldiers pulled out of the frontier region that abuts serbia after coming under fire from automatic weapons and hand grenades .
a ukrainian police officer was killed during the unrest . three days after the withdrawal , the un and nato mounted an operation to retake a courthouse taken over by ethnic serb protesters and restore military control over the northern border region around mitrovica .
the town is now once again under un control . in the days since the violence , the rhetoric coming from belgrade has increased in its bellicosity as accusations of armed provocation fly between the serbian government and the western powers in kosovo . dw-world.de spoke to professor stefan wolff , a political scientist and director of the center for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university , about the latest developments . dw-world.de : who is behind the current unrest in northern kosovo ?

more importantly , nato needs to assert full control of kosovo 's borders to prevent an influx of radical extremists from serbia bent on destabilizing the situation further . at the same time , nato will need to make sure that any unrest in kosovo does not spread to other volatile areas of the region , such as bosnia and macedonia .
it is highly unlikely that there will be prolonged and open hostilities with serbian forces , but there is always a chance that localized violence might occur especially in border areas .
the worst case scenario would be that , following parliamentary elections in serbia in may , a new government deliberately provokes such incidents .
this would be a vey dangerous scenario , and an unwise strategy for any government to follow . what effect is the current unrest likely to have in the wider balkan region ?
is there any chance that the unrest will spread beyond the region 's borders ? we have already seen the negative effects of kosovo 's independence in the region : bosnian serbs have , unsurprisingly , become more assertive about their own aspirations of eventual unification with serbia , and even though the serbian government itself has kept relatively quiet in this respect , it is an open secret that many politicians and ordinary people in serbia would welcome any developments that brought bosnian serbs closer to them . the collapse of the coalition government in macedonia has once again raised the specter of further separatist violence there as well .
if anything positive has come from the recent unrest , it is nato 's obvious determination not to tolerate any kind of violence that would put into question the borders that exist now or undermine the constitutional frameworks that were put in place in bosnia in 1995 and in macedonia after 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : separatists in the caucasus apply pressure on russia on the other hand , international effects are more difficult to gauge .
while several separatist movements - for example in the caucasus and in moldova - have intensified their rhetoric in the wake of kosovo 's declaration , and its subsequent recognition by so far over 30 states , it is important not to overestimate the " kosovo effect " - separatist movements existed in these areas before , and they are unlikely to receive any greater degree of international recognition now than they did before . could kosovo 's declaration of independence be linked to the pro-independence protests in tibet ?
where could this lead ?
could there be a knock-on effect all around the world where separatist organizations and oppressed minorities rise up , emboldened by the kosovo declaration ? what goes for the south caucasus and moldova , equally applies to tibet and other separatist conflicts .
the unrest in tibet is much more closely related to the international attention that china receives now in light of it hosting the olympic games this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest in tibet is unlikely to be linked to kosovo this is not to say that protesters in tibet may not have good reason to protest against china , but it is equally a reality - and a sad one - that international media attention increases with the level of violence present .
this was the case with kosovo in the late 1990s , with darfur since 2003 , and with both of the palestinian intifadas . in this sense , it would be wrong to blame any other violence and unrest merely on kosovo .
we must not forget that it still takes political leaders to decide on a path of violence and their supporters to follow them before we can see the kind of violence that tibet has experienced again of late - and this is true for separatists and the states they challenge alike . if this is the start of a wave of empowered separatist uprisings , who could be next to demand their independence ? everyone who wants independence probably has demanded it already , and several times over .
there have been almost 80 separatist movements worldwide since the 1950s which pursued their goals with violence .
at the moment , we have about 25 active armed movements and another 50 or so who pursue their aims by peaceful means .
what matters is not whether they declare or demand their independence , but rather how the international community reacts to this . short of consensual separation , as was the case with czechoslovakia , for example , it is unlikely that any declarations of independence would be met with widespread recognition .
turkey is the only state to have recognized northern cyprus , and not even armenia has so far recognized nagorno-karabakh even though it fought a long and bloody war with azerbaijan over this area . thus , kosovo is unique in that its declaration of independence has been followed by significant international recognition .
this is unlikely to be the case in relation to almost every other separatist movement .
as a consequence , states challenged by separatists , as well as the international community , need to continue looking for other ways to resolve the conflicts that result from these demands .
this demands vision , skill , and determination on the part of local political leaders and the international community , yet these qualities are all too often missing when personal agendas turn legitimate political struggles into a tug-of-war over personal power , status and wealth . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" career , partner , children , and social involvement - today 's women want everything , according to the study . eighty-five percent said it was important to them to have their own income and be independent , even with children .
slightly more , 90 percent , said they wanted to have children . " the time of either-or is over , " said jutta allmendinger , who directed the study , entitled " women on the move . "
over 1,000 young women in germany , aged 17-19 and 27-29 , were questioned for the study , which contrasts sharply with a similar survey conducted by brigitte in 1982 . what 's more , today 's young women are willing to do what it takes to attain their wishes - 96 percent said they did n't think one could get anywhere in life without goals , and 79 percent said they were working hard toward theirs . allmendinger said it was surprising that this trend of self-confidence and ambition was found among women in all social groups . women less willing to compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young women have cast off the burden of perfectionism in the household the number of women who want to work has increased , the study found .
" in -lsb- the former -rsb- west germany , it used to be just 20 to 30 percent , the rest was rhetoric , " allmendinger said . education plays a strong role in young women 's lives , with three to four times as many girls completing their abitur , the high school exam that allows students to carry on to university . on the job , women are less willing than their male counterparts to give everything and always be available , according to the study .
most do n't feel supported by society - only one-sixth said that children and career could be easily combined these days . " if companies do n't offer women an acceptable balance between work and life , they 'll soon be lacking important personnel resources , " said allmendinger . rethinking priorities despite their career ambitions , the women surveyed also placed a strong emphasis on relationships .
three-quarters said they wanted a steady partner .
ninety-one percent said friends were important to them , while 87 percent said the same of parents and siblings . the women rated good looks -lrb- 59 percent -rrb- and good sex -lrb- 54 percent -rrb- as less significant .
only one-fourth said being thin was important . if 90 percent of this generation of women chooses a different path than their mothers , this will change society , said allmendinger .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 26.03.2008 nato , un and serbia engage in high stakes game over kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un and nato accuse the serbian government of inciting the violence in mitrovica tensions continue on the streets of mitrovica a week after rioting serbs clashed with police and nato troops in the town on kosovo 's northern border .
dw-world.de talked to a balkans expert about the latest developments . the violence in the ethnically divided town of mitrovica last week was the worst since kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority declared independence on feb .
17 .
hundreds of united nations peacekeepers and nato soldiers pulled out of the frontier region that abuts serbia after coming under fire from automatic weapons and hand grenades .
a ukrainian police officer was killed during the unrest . three days after the withdrawal , the un and nato mounted an operation to retake a courthouse taken over by ethnic serb protesters and restore military control over the northern border region around mitrovica .
the town is now once again under un control . in the days since the violence , the rhetoric coming from belgrade has increased in its bellicosity as accusations of armed provocation fly between the serbian government and the western powers in kosovo . dw-world.de spoke to professor stefan wolff , a political scientist and director of the center for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university , about the latest developments . dw-world.de : who is behind the current unrest in northern kosovo ?
is it public anger or do you think this violence is orchestrated by organized powers with an agenda ? stefan wolff : the violence in northern kosovo over the past several weeks is both an expression of public anger by local serbs and something that is at least encouraged by belgrade .
similar to the violence that happened in the immediate aftermath of kosovo 's declaration of independence when the american and other western embassies were targeted , the government in belgrade is not doing enough to send a strong message to the rioters , nor does , for that matter , the serb orthodox church .
quite clearly , the resulting instability serves serbia 's , and to some extent russia 's , agenda well , offering , as it were , proof for the claim that kosovo 's independence is the source of unrest and insecurity . what is the goal of those who are behind or are carrying out these violent protests ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the northern region was soon reclaimed by un forces many of those participating in the violence undoubtedly feel very strongly about kosovo and the fact that kosovo 's independence has no basis in international law and is a violation of serbia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
having said that , those people are also deluding themselves somewhat in believing that any other " solution " would have brought any more stability or that their violence will affect any change for the better . attacks on the un in northern kosovo , or on western embassies in belgrade , merely confirm to kosovo albanians and many others beyond kosovo - and in my opinion wrongly - that peaceful coexistence with serbs and serbia is very difficult to achieve .
making things difficult for the un , the eu , nato and other international organizations in kosovo and the region is ultimately a futile strategy that may pay off for some politicians in the short term but will harm serbs and serbia as a whole in the long term .
thus was the case with -lsb- former yugoslav president slobodan -rsb- milosevic , who built a reputation on " standing up " against the west .
the sooner serbs realize that kosovo was lost some 20 years ago when its autonomy was revoked and milosevic and his allies brutally asserted their control , the sooner they can move on with building a viable , democratic , european state . are we watching the beginnings of a new conflict in the balkans ? it is unlikely that the situation in kosovo itself will escalate into a new conflict in the balkans , but in combination with the instability that macedonia is experiencing in the wake of the fall of its government and the increasing belligerence of serbs in bosnia , it is difficult to see how the region would achieve greater stability in the near future .
the strong international presence in the region will hopefully prevent anything on the scale of the wars of the 1990s , but similar to the events then , we must be realistic about the limitations of organizations like the eu and nato to resolve the self-determination conflicts that have persisted since the break-up of yugoslavia .
the best we can hope for , at the moment at least , is effective containment . the un has put parts of northern kosovo back under military control .
how can kosovo hope to be an independent state when its government can be so easily over-ridden ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and un troops came under attack from armed serbs the problem with northern kosovo is that this region has never been under any kind of control from pristina since the late 1980s .
after the end of nato 's humanitarian intervention in 1999 the area around mitrovica became a military sector of its own , and gradually belgrade established its own control through its links with local serbs , paying , for example , all local administrators a salary from belgrade in addition to what they received from the united nations mission in kosovo -lsb- unmik -rsb- .
belgrade also discouraged local serbs from participating in elections in kosovo and from taking up their reserved seats in the kosovo assembly . this has created a situation in which we have almost complete segregation of serbs in the north from albanians .
while close links between belgrade and mitrovica exist , these are links that belgrade can now exploit in its strategy to effectively partition kosovo .
this has , so far , been resisted strongly by the international community , and it is difficult to see that this position will change any time soon . so who is actually in control in kosovo ? formally , the un remains in charge , but as we have seen recently , it depends heavily on nato 's military muscle to assert its control .
this gives more and more weight to nato in kosovo , and through nato 's member states to the eu , which has formally committed to playing a major role in supervising and facilitating kosovo 's transition to full independent statehood . nato has threatened to come down hard in kosovo .
what could this mean ?
where could nato 's power be directed and against whom ?
what would it achieve and what could be the consequences ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato will crack down in response to further attacks if there is more violence of the kind recently experienced in mitrovica , nato is clearly able to respond swiftly and decisively in restoring law and order .
more importantly , nato needs to assert full control of kosovo 's borders to prevent an influx of radical extremists from serbia bent on destabilizing the situation further . at the same time , nato will need to make sure that any unrest in kosovo does not spread to other volatile areas of the region , such as bosnia and macedonia .
it is highly unlikely that there will be prolonged and open hostilities with serbian forces , but there is always a chance that localized violence might occur especially in border areas .
the worst case scenario would be that , following parliamentary elections in serbia in may , a new government deliberately provokes such incidents .
this would be a vey dangerous scenario , and an unwise strategy for any government to follow . what effect is the current unrest likely to have in the wider balkan region ?
is there any chance that the unrest will spread beyond the region 's borders ? we have already seen the negative effects of kosovo 's independence in the region : bosnian serbs have , unsurprisingly , become more assertive about their own aspirations of eventual unification with serbia , and even though the serbian government itself has kept relatively quiet in this respect , it is an open secret that many politicians and ordinary people in serbia would welcome any developments that brought bosnian serbs closer to them . the collapse of the coalition government in macedonia has once again raised the specter of further separatist violence there as well .
if anything positive has come from the recent unrest , it is nato 's obvious determination not to tolerate any kind of violence that would put into question the borders that exist now or undermine the constitutional frameworks that were put in place in bosnia in 1995 and in macedonia after 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : separatists in the caucasus apply pressure on russia on the other hand , international effects are more difficult to gauge .
while several separatist movements - for example in the caucasus and in moldova - have intensified their rhetoric in the wake of kosovo 's declaration , and its subsequent recognition by so far over 30 states , it is important not to overestimate the " kosovo effect " - separatist movements existed in these areas before , and they are unlikely to receive any greater degree of international recognition now than they did before . could kosovo 's declaration of independence be linked to the pro-independence protests in tibet ?
where could this lead ?
could there be a knock-on effect all around the world where separatist organizations and oppressed minorities rise up , emboldened by the kosovo declaration ? what goes for the south caucasus and moldova , equally applies to tibet and other separatist conflicts .
the unrest in tibet is much more closely related to the international attention that china receives now in light of it hosting the olympic games this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest in tibet is unlikely to be linked to kosovo this is not to say that protesters in tibet may not have good reason to protest against china , but it is equally a reality - and a sad one - that international media attention increases with the level of violence present .
this was the case with kosovo in the late 1990s , with darfur since 2003 , and with both of the palestinian intifadas . in this sense , it would be wrong to blame any other violence and unrest merely on kosovo .
we must not forget that it still takes political leaders to decide on a path of violence and their supporters to follow them before we can see the kind of violence that tibet has experienced again of late - and this is true for separatists and the states they challenge alike . if this is the start of a wave of empowered separatist uprisings , who could be next to demand their independence ? everyone who wants independence probably has demanded it already , and several times over .
there have been almost 80 separatist movements worldwide since the 1950s which pursued their goals with violence .
at the moment , we have about 25 active armed movements and another 50 or so who pursue their aims by peaceful means .
what matters is not whether they declare or demand their independence , but rather how the international community reacts to this . short of consensual separation , as was the case with czechoslovakia , for example , it is unlikely that any declarations of independence would be met with widespread recognition .
turkey is the only state to have recognized northern cyprus , and not even armenia has so far recognized nagorno-karabakh even though it fought a long and bloody war with azerbaijan over this area . thus , kosovo is unique in that its declaration of independence has been followed by significant international recognition .
this is unlikely to be the case in relation to almost every other separatist movement .
as a consequence , states challenged by separatists , as well as the international community , need to continue looking for other ways to resolve the conflicts that result from these demands .
this demands vision , skill , and determination on the part of local political leaders and the international community , yet these qualities are all too often missing when personal agendas turn legitimate political struggles into a tug-of-war over personal power , status and wealth . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

similar to the violence that happened in the immediate aftermath of kosovo 's declaration of independence when the american and other western embassies were targeted , the government in belgrade is not doing enough to send a strong message to the rioters , nor does , for that matter , the serb orthodox church .
quite clearly , the resulting instability serves serbia 's , and to some extent russia 's , agenda well , offering , as it were , proof for the claim that kosovo 's independence is the source of unrest and insecurity . what is the goal of those who are behind or are carrying out these violent protests ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the northern region was soon reclaimed by un forces many of those participating in the violence undoubtedly feel very strongly about kosovo and the fact that kosovo 's independence has no basis in international law and is a violation of serbia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
having said that , those people are also deluding themselves somewhat in believing that any other " solution " would have brought any more stability or that their violence will affect any change for the better . attacks on the un in northern kosovo , or on western embassies in belgrade , merely confirm to kosovo albanians and many others beyond kosovo - and in my opinion wrongly - that peaceful coexistence with serbs and serbia is very difficult to achieve .
making things difficult for the un , the eu , nato and other international organizations in kosovo and the region is ultimately a futile strategy that may pay off for some politicians in the short term but will harm serbs and serbia as a whole in the long term .
thus was the case with -lsb- former yugoslav president slobodan -rsb- milosevic , who built a reputation on " standing up " against the west .
the sooner serbs realize that kosovo was lost some 20 years ago when its autonomy was revoked and milosevic and his allies brutally asserted their control , the sooner they can move on with building a viable , democratic , european state . are we watching the beginnings of a new conflict in the balkans ? it is unlikely that the situation in kosovo itself will escalate into a new conflict in the balkans , but in combination with the instability that macedonia is experiencing in the wake of the fall of its government and the increasing belligerence of serbs in bosnia , it is difficult to see how the region would achieve greater stability in the near future .
the strong international presence in the region will hopefully prevent anything on the scale of the wars of the 1990s , but similar to the events then , we must be realistic about the limitations of organizations like the eu and nato to resolve the self-determination conflicts that have persisted since the break-up of yugoslavia .
the best we can hope for , at the moment at least , is effective containment . the un has put parts of northern kosovo back under military control .
how can kosovo hope to be an independent state when its government can be so easily over-ridden ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and un troops came under attack from armed serbs the problem with northern kosovo is that this region has never been under any kind of control from pristina since the late 1980s .
after the end of nato 's humanitarian intervention in 1999 the area around mitrovica became a military sector of its own , and gradually belgrade established its own control through its links with local serbs , paying , for example , all local administrators a salary from belgrade in addition to what they received from the united nations mission in kosovo -lsb- unmik -rsb- .
belgrade also discouraged local serbs from participating in elections in kosovo and from taking up their reserved seats in the kosovo assembly . this has created a situation in which we have almost complete segregation of serbs in the north from albanians .
while close links between belgrade and mitrovica exist , these are links that belgrade can now exploit in its strategy to effectively partition kosovo .
this has , so far , been resisted strongly by the international community , and it is difficult to see that this position will change any time soon . so who is actually in control in kosovo ? formally , the un remains in charge , but as we have seen recently , it depends heavily on nato 's military muscle to assert its control .
this gives more and more weight to nato in kosovo , and through nato 's member states to the eu , which has formally committed to playing a major role in supervising and facilitating kosovo 's transition to full independent statehood . nato has threatened to come down hard in kosovo .
what could this mean ?
where could nato 's power be directed and against whom ?
what would it achieve and what could be the consequences ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato will crack down in response to further attacks if there is more violence of the kind recently experienced in mitrovica , nato is clearly able to respond swiftly and decisively in restoring law and order .
more importantly , nato needs to assert full control of kosovo 's borders to prevent an influx of radical extremists from serbia bent on destabilizing the situation further . at the same time , nato will need to make sure that any unrest in kosovo does not spread to other volatile areas of the region , such as bosnia and macedonia .
it is highly unlikely that there will be prolonged and open hostilities with serbian forces , but there is always a chance that localized violence might occur especially in border areas .
the worst case scenario would be that , following parliamentary elections in serbia in may , a new government deliberately provokes such incidents .
this would be a vey dangerous scenario , and an unwise strategy for any government to follow . what effect is the current unrest likely to have in the wider balkan region ?
is there any chance that the unrest will spread beyond the region 's borders ? we have already seen the negative effects of kosovo 's independence in the region : bosnian serbs have , unsurprisingly , become more assertive about their own aspirations of eventual unification with serbia , and even though the serbian government itself has kept relatively quiet in this respect , it is an open secret that many politicians and ordinary people in serbia would welcome any developments that brought bosnian serbs closer to them . the collapse of the coalition government in macedonia has once again raised the specter of further separatist violence there as well .
if anything positive has come from the recent unrest , it is nato 's obvious determination not to tolerate any kind of violence that would put into question the borders that exist now or undermine the constitutional frameworks that were put in place in bosnia in 1995 and in macedonia after 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : separatists in the caucasus apply pressure on russia on the other hand , international effects are more difficult to gauge .
while several separatist movements - for example in the caucasus and in moldova - have intensified their rhetoric in the wake of kosovo 's declaration , and its subsequent recognition by so far over 30 states , it is important not to overestimate the " kosovo effect " - separatist movements existed in these areas before , and they are unlikely to receive any greater degree of international recognition now than they did before . could kosovo 's declaration of independence be linked to the pro-independence protests in tibet ?
where could this lead ?
could there be a knock-on effect all around the world where separatist organizations and oppressed minorities rise up , emboldened by the kosovo declaration ? what goes for the south caucasus and moldova , equally applies to tibet and other separatist conflicts .
the unrest in tibet is much more closely related to the international attention that china receives now in light of it hosting the olympic games this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest in tibet is unlikely to be linked to kosovo this is not to say that protesters in tibet may not have good reason to protest against china , but it is equally a reality - and a sad one - that international media attention increases with the level of violence present .
this was the case with kosovo in the late 1990s , with darfur since 2003 , and with both of the palestinian intifadas . in this sense , it would be wrong to blame any other violence and unrest merely on kosovo .
we must not forget that it still takes political leaders to decide on a path of violence and their supporters to follow them before we can see the kind of violence that tibet has experienced again of late - and this is true for separatists and the states they challenge alike . if this is the start of a wave of empowered separatist uprisings , who could be next to demand their independence ? everyone who wants independence probably has demanded it already , and several times over .
there have been almost 80 separatist movements worldwide since the 1950s which pursued their goals with violence .
at the moment , we have about 25 active armed movements and another 50 or so who pursue their aims by peaceful means .
what matters is not whether they declare or demand their independence , but rather how the international community reacts to this . short of consensual separation , as was the case with czechoslovakia , for example , it is unlikely that any declarations of independence would be met with widespread recognition .
turkey is the only state to have recognized northern cyprus , and not even armenia has so far recognized nagorno-karabakh even though it fought a long and bloody war with azerbaijan over this area . thus , kosovo is unique in that its declaration of independence has been followed by significant international recognition .
this is unlikely to be the case in relation to almost every other separatist movement .
as a consequence , states challenged by separatists , as well as the international community , need to continue looking for other ways to resolve the conflicts that result from these demands .
this demands vision , skill , and determination on the part of local political leaders and the international community , yet these qualities are all too often missing when personal agendas turn legitimate political struggles into a tug-of-war over personal power , status and wealth . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

where could nato 's power be directed and against whom ?
what would it achieve and what could be the consequences ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato will crack down in response to further attacks if there is more violence of the kind recently experienced in mitrovica , nato is clearly able to respond swiftly and decisively in restoring law and order .
more importantly , nato needs to assert full control of kosovo 's borders to prevent an influx of radical extremists from serbia bent on destabilizing the situation further . at the same time , nato will need to make sure that any unrest in kosovo does not spread to other volatile areas of the region , such as bosnia and macedonia .
it is highly unlikely that there will be prolonged and open hostilities with serbian forces , but there is always a chance that localized violence might occur especially in border areas .
the worst case scenario would be that , following parliamentary elections in serbia in may , a new government deliberately provokes such incidents .
this would be a vey dangerous scenario , and an unwise strategy for any government to follow . what effect is the current unrest likely to have in the wider balkan region ?
is there any chance that the unrest will spread beyond the region 's borders ? we have already seen the negative effects of kosovo 's independence in the region : bosnian serbs have , unsurprisingly , become more assertive about their own aspirations of eventual unification with serbia , and even though the serbian government itself has kept relatively quiet in this respect , it is an open secret that many politicians and ordinary people in serbia would welcome any developments that brought bosnian serbs closer to them . the collapse of the coalition government in macedonia has once again raised the specter of further separatist violence there as well .
if anything positive has come from the recent unrest , it is nato 's obvious determination not to tolerate any kind of violence that would put into question the borders that exist now or undermine the constitutional frameworks that were put in place in bosnia in 1995 and in macedonia after 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : separatists in the caucasus apply pressure on russia on the other hand , international effects are more difficult to gauge .
while several separatist movements - for example in the caucasus and in moldova - have intensified their rhetoric in the wake of kosovo 's declaration , and its subsequent recognition by so far over 30 states , it is important not to overestimate the " kosovo effect " - separatist movements existed in these areas before , and they are unlikely to receive any greater degree of international recognition now than they did before . could kosovo 's declaration of independence be linked to the pro-independence protests in tibet ?
where could this lead ?
could there be a knock-on effect all around the world where separatist organizations and oppressed minorities rise up , emboldened by the kosovo declaration ? what goes for the south caucasus and moldova , equally applies to tibet and other separatist conflicts .
the unrest in tibet is much more closely related to the international attention that china receives now in light of it hosting the olympic games this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest in tibet is unlikely to be linked to kosovo this is not to say that protesters in tibet may not have good reason to protest against china , but it is equally a reality - and a sad one - that international media attention increases with the level of violence present .
this was the case with kosovo in the late 1990s , with darfur since 2003 , and with both of the palestinian intifadas . in this sense , it would be wrong to blame any other violence and unrest merely on kosovo .
we must not forget that it still takes political leaders to decide on a path of violence and their supporters to follow them before we can see the kind of violence that tibet has experienced again of late - and this is true for separatists and the states they challenge alike . if this is the start of a wave of empowered separatist uprisings , who could be next to demand their independence ? everyone who wants independence probably has demanded it already , and several times over .
there have been almost 80 separatist movements worldwide since the 1950s which pursued their goals with violence .
at the moment , we have about 25 active armed movements and another 50 or so who pursue their aims by peaceful means .
what matters is not whether they declare or demand their independence , but rather how the international community reacts to this . short of consensual separation , as was the case with czechoslovakia , for example , it is unlikely that any declarations of independence would be met with widespread recognition .
turkey is the only state to have recognized northern cyprus , and not even armenia has so far recognized nagorno-karabakh even though it fought a long and bloody war with azerbaijan over this area . thus , kosovo is unique in that its declaration of independence has been followed by significant international recognition .
this is unlikely to be the case in relation to almost every other separatist movement .
as a consequence , states challenged by separatists , as well as the international community , need to continue looking for other ways to resolve the conflicts that result from these demands .
this demands vision , skill , and determination on the part of local political leaders and the international community , yet these qualities are all too often missing when personal agendas turn legitimate political struggles into a tug-of-war over personal power , status and wealth . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 26.03.2008 nato , un and serbia engage in high stakes game over kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un and nato accuse the serbian government of inciting the violence in mitrovica tensions continue on the streets of mitrovica a week after rioting serbs clashed with police and nato troops in the town on kosovo 's northern border .
dw-world.de talked to a balkans expert about the latest developments . the violence in the ethnically divided town of mitrovica last week was the worst since kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority declared independence on feb .
17 .
hundreds of united nations peacekeepers and nato soldiers pulled out of the frontier region that abuts serbia after coming under fire from automatic weapons and hand grenades .
a ukrainian police officer was killed during the unrest . three days after the withdrawal , the un and nato mounted an operation to retake a courthouse taken over by ethnic serb protesters and restore military control over the northern border region around mitrovica .
the town is now once again under un control . in the days since the violence , the rhetoric coming from belgrade has increased in its bellicosity as accusations of armed provocation fly between the serbian government and the western powers in kosovo . dw-world.de spoke to professor stefan wolff , a political scientist and director of the center for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university , about the latest developments . dw-world.de : who is behind the current unrest in northern kosovo ?
is it public anger or do you think this violence is orchestrated by organized powers with an agenda ? stefan wolff : the violence in northern kosovo over the past several weeks is both an expression of public anger by local serbs and something that is at least encouraged by belgrade .
similar to the violence that happened in the immediate aftermath of kosovo 's declaration of independence when the american and other western embassies were targeted , the government in belgrade is not doing enough to send a strong message to the rioters , nor does , for that matter , the serb orthodox church .
quite clearly , the resulting instability serves serbia 's , and to some extent russia 's , agenda well , offering , as it were , proof for the claim that kosovo 's independence is the source of unrest and insecurity . what is the goal of those who are behind or are carrying out these violent protests ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the northern region was soon reclaimed by un forces many of those participating in the violence undoubtedly feel very strongly about kosovo and the fact that kosovo 's independence has no basis in international law and is a violation of serbia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
having said that , those people are also deluding themselves somewhat in believing that any other " solution " would have brought any more stability or that their violence will affect any change for the better . attacks on the un in northern kosovo , or on western embassies in belgrade , merely confirm to kosovo albanians and many others beyond kosovo - and in my opinion wrongly - that peaceful coexistence with serbs and serbia is very difficult to achieve .
making things difficult for the un , the eu , nato and other international organizations in kosovo and the region is ultimately a futile strategy that may pay off for some politicians in the short term but will harm serbs and serbia as a whole in the long term .
thus was the case with -lsb- former yugoslav president slobodan -rsb- milosevic , who built a reputation on " standing up " against the west .
the sooner serbs realize that kosovo was lost some 20 years ago when its autonomy was revoked and milosevic and his allies brutally asserted their control , the sooner they can move on with building a viable , democratic , european state . are we watching the beginnings of a new conflict in the balkans ? it is unlikely that the situation in kosovo itself will escalate into a new conflict in the balkans , but in combination with the instability that macedonia is experiencing in the wake of the fall of its government and the increasing belligerence of serbs in bosnia , it is difficult to see how the region would achieve greater stability in the near future .
the strong international presence in the region will hopefully prevent anything on the scale of the wars of the 1990s , but similar to the events then , we must be realistic about the limitations of organizations like the eu and nato to resolve the self-determination conflicts that have persisted since the break-up of yugoslavia .
the best we can hope for , at the moment at least , is effective containment . the un has put parts of northern kosovo back under military control .
how can kosovo hope to be an independent state when its government can be so easily over-ridden ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and un troops came under attack from armed serbs the problem with northern kosovo is that this region has never been under any kind of control from pristina since the late 1980s .
after the end of nato 's humanitarian intervention in 1999 the area around mitrovica became a military sector of its own , and gradually belgrade established its own control through its links with local serbs , paying , for example , all local administrators a salary from belgrade in addition to what they received from the united nations mission in kosovo -lsb- unmik -rsb- .
belgrade also discouraged local serbs from participating in elections in kosovo and from taking up their reserved seats in the kosovo assembly . this has created a situation in which we have almost complete segregation of serbs in the north from albanians .
while close links between belgrade and mitrovica exist , these are links that belgrade can now exploit in its strategy to effectively partition kosovo .
this has , so far , been resisted strongly by the international community , and it is difficult to see that this position will change any time soon . so who is actually in control in kosovo ? formally , the un remains in charge , but as we have seen recently , it depends heavily on nato 's military muscle to assert its control .
this gives more and more weight to nato in kosovo , and through nato 's member states to the eu , which has formally committed to playing a major role in supervising and facilitating kosovo 's transition to full independent statehood . nato has threatened to come down hard in kosovo .
what could this mean ?
where could nato 's power be directed and against whom ?
what would it achieve and what could be the consequences ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato will crack down in response to further attacks if there is more violence of the kind recently experienced in mitrovica , nato is clearly able to respond swiftly and decisively in restoring law and order .
more importantly , nato needs to assert full control of kosovo 's borders to prevent an influx of radical extremists from serbia bent on destabilizing the situation further . at the same time , nato will need to make sure that any unrest in kosovo does not spread to other volatile areas of the region , such as bosnia and macedonia .
it is highly unlikely that there will be prolonged and open hostilities with serbian forces , but there is always a chance that localized violence might occur especially in border areas .
the worst case scenario would be that , following parliamentary elections in serbia in may , a new government deliberately provokes such incidents .
this would be a vey dangerous scenario , and an unwise strategy for any government to follow . what effect is the current unrest likely to have in the wider balkan region ?
is there any chance that the unrest will spread beyond the region 's borders ? we have already seen the negative effects of kosovo 's independence in the region : bosnian serbs have , unsurprisingly , become more assertive about their own aspirations of eventual unification with serbia , and even though the serbian government itself has kept relatively quiet in this respect , it is an open secret that many politicians and ordinary people in serbia would welcome any developments that brought bosnian serbs closer to them . the collapse of the coalition government in macedonia has once again raised the specter of further separatist violence there as well .
if anything positive has come from the recent unrest , it is nato 's obvious determination not to tolerate any kind of violence that would put into question the borders that exist now or undermine the constitutional frameworks that were put in place in bosnia in 1995 and in macedonia after 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : separatists in the caucasus apply pressure on russia on the other hand , international effects are more difficult to gauge .
while several separatist movements - for example in the caucasus and in moldova - have intensified their rhetoric in the wake of kosovo 's declaration , and its subsequent recognition by so far over 30 states , it is important not to overestimate the " kosovo effect " - separatist movements existed in these areas before , and they are unlikely to receive any greater degree of international recognition now than they did before . could kosovo 's declaration of independence be linked to the pro-independence protests in tibet ?
where could this lead ?
could there be a knock-on effect all around the world where separatist organizations and oppressed minorities rise up , emboldened by the kosovo declaration ? what goes for the south caucasus and moldova , equally applies to tibet and other separatist conflicts .
the unrest in tibet is much more closely related to the international attention that china receives now in light of it hosting the olympic games this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest in tibet is unlikely to be linked to kosovo this is not to say that protesters in tibet may not have good reason to protest against china , but it is equally a reality - and a sad one - that international media attention increases with the level of violence present .
this was the case with kosovo in the late 1990s , with darfur since 2003 , and with both of the palestinian intifadas . in this sense , it would be wrong to blame any other violence and unrest merely on kosovo .
we must not forget that it still takes political leaders to decide on a path of violence and their supporters to follow them before we can see the kind of violence that tibet has experienced again of late - and this is true for separatists and the states they challenge alike . if this is the start of a wave of empowered separatist uprisings , who could be next to demand their independence ? everyone who wants independence probably has demanded it already , and several times over .
there have been almost 80 separatist movements worldwide since the 1950s which pursued their goals with violence .
at the moment , we have about 25 active armed movements and another 50 or so who pursue their aims by peaceful means .
what matters is not whether they declare or demand their independence , but rather how the international community reacts to this . short of consensual separation , as was the case with czechoslovakia , for example , it is unlikely that any declarations of independence would be met with widespread recognition .
turkey is the only state to have recognized northern cyprus , and not even armenia has so far recognized nagorno-karabakh even though it fought a long and bloody war with azerbaijan over this area . thus , kosovo is unique in that its declaration of independence has been followed by significant international recognition .
this is unlikely to be the case in relation to almost every other separatist movement .
as a consequence , states challenged by separatists , as well as the international community , need to continue looking for other ways to resolve the conflicts that result from these demands .
this demands vision , skill , and determination on the part of local political leaders and the international community , yet these qualities are all too often missing when personal agendas turn legitimate political struggles into a tug-of-war over personal power , status and wealth . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
no beer , no dancing and absolutely no room service ; national soccer team coach joachim loew has pulled the plug on his players ' fun ahead of this summer 's 2008 european championships . you are what you eat : loew , it seems , has taken the old adage seriously and put his players on a strict diet to keep them in shape for the european championships in austria and switzerland this june . the service teams at the germans ' training camp in mallorca and their hotel in ascona , switzerland , have reportedly been instructed not to provide the national players with room service under any circumstances , lest the players sneakily attempt to order a beer or - gasp ! - chips . " of course we trust the players , " team manager oliver bierhoff said , according to the afp news agency .
" the mini bar is filled with fruit juices and water . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how many times do i have to tell you ?

but more choices and cheaper fares for travelers may be a little ways off , analysts say . the agreement between the united states and the european union is to take effect on sunday , march 31 , and will end most restrictions on us and eu airlines ' ability to fly between the two continents .
different air carriers will be allowed to depart or land at various locations on both continents . the concept of the open market dictating flight routes between the europe and the us originally held the promise of cheaper airfares and more choices for travelers , but analysts say the turmoil in the us economy and the airline industry may prevent immediate benefits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competition could cause a cut in fares air carriers are hurting from record-high fuel costs and increased economic uncertainty , industry observers pointed out .

formerly , individual european countries and the us maintained separate agreements for trans-atlantic flight .

but more choices and cheaper fares for travelers may be a little ways off , analysts say . the agreement between the united states and the european union is to take effect on sunday , march 31 , and will end most restrictions on us and eu airlines ' ability to fly between the two continents .
different air carriers will be allowed to depart or land at various locations on both continents . the concept of the open market dictating flight routes between the europe and the us originally held the promise of cheaper airfares and more choices for travelers , but analysts say the turmoil in the us economy and the airline industry may prevent immediate benefits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competition could cause a cut in fares air carriers are hurting from record-high fuel costs and increased economic uncertainty , industry observers pointed out . " i think -lsb- the agreement -rsb- would mean a lot more if the industry were not in the dire straits they are in now , " terry trippler , an aviation consultant and founder of tripplertravel.com , told afp news agency . " the industry is more concerned about cutting flights than expanding , " he said .
" eventually this will be fantastic when this industry shakes itself out .
right now , the celebration is muted . " mixed views george hamlin , managing director of the consulting firm aca associates , told afp that , on the contrary , some new flights were being scheduled , with air france offering service from london to los angeles and us carriers getting some coveted slots at london 's heathrow airport . " in the longer term there may be some overexpansion , followed by some contraction , " hamlin said . hamlin said airlines would have to plan ahead for good times and bad by ordering aircraft and securing landing rights even if conditions were not ideal . " we do n't even begin to get a glimmer of the possibilities of open-market competition yet , " jerry chandler , cheapflights.com 's travel blogger , told the new york times .
" there could be a lot of flourishing of routes in markets that currently do n't exist , especially from smaller us cities to european hubs .

the two countries should " move from being cordial to being friendly , " sarkozy said in an interview with british broadcaster bbc . sarkozy said the friendship " should n't simply be a matter of principle , " but one that is " fleshed out by concrete projects on the economy , immigration , security , defense .

britain has nearly 8,000 troops in the country . talks may also focus on the need for greater transparency of financial markets , including full disclosure of write-offs by banks , in light of ongoing market turbulence and the near-collapse of us investment bank bear stearns . sarkozy could likely repeat a threat he made on tuesday that france can not rule out a boycott of the opening ceremony of the beijing olympics due to china 's crackdown in tibet . mending franco-british ties in an editorial , the british newspaper the independent called sarkozy 's visit " not just a potentially significant staging post in britain 's erratic european journey .

" career , partner , children , and social involvement - today 's women want everything , according to the study . eighty-five percent said it was important to them to have their own income and be independent , even with children .
slightly more , 90 percent , said they wanted to have children . " the time of either-or is over , " said jutta allmendinger , who directed the study , entitled " women on the move . "
over 1,000 young women in germany , aged 17-19 and 27-29 , were questioned for the study , which contrasts sharply with a similar survey conducted by brigitte in 1982 . what 's more , today 's young women are willing to do what it takes to attain their wishes - 96 percent said they did n't think one could get anywhere in life without goals , and 79 percent said they were working hard toward theirs . allmendinger said it was surprising that this trend of self-confidence and ambition was found among women in all social groups . women less willing to compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young women have cast off the burden of perfectionism in the household the number of women who want to work has increased , the study found .
" in -lsb- the former -rsb- west germany , it used to be just 20 to 30 percent , the rest was rhetoric , " allmendinger said . education plays a strong role in young women 's lives , with three to four times as many girls completing their abitur , the high school exam that allows students to carry on to university . on the job , women are less willing than their male counterparts to give everything and always be available , according to the study .
most do n't feel supported by society - only one-sixth said that children and career could be easily combined these days . " if companies do n't offer women an acceptable balance between work and life , they 'll soon be lacking important personnel resources , " said allmendinger . rethinking priorities despite their career ambitions , the women surveyed also placed a strong emphasis on relationships .
three-quarters said they wanted a steady partner .
ninety-one percent said friends were important to them , while 87 percent said the same of parents and siblings . the women rated good looks -lrb- 59 percent -rrb- and good sex -lrb- 54 percent -rrb- as less significant .
only one-fourth said being thin was important . if 90 percent of this generation of women chooses a different path than their mothers , this will change society , said allmendinger .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 26.03.2008 young german women more ambitious than ever , says study großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 99 percent of those surveyed said yes to the statement " i know that i 'm good " increasingly , women from all social groups in germany want both family and career and are confident they can reach their goals , according to a recent study by the popular women 's magazine brigitte . " career , partner , children , and social involvement - today 's women want everything , according to the study . eighty-five percent said it was important to them to have their own income and be independent , even with children .
slightly more , 90 percent , said they wanted to have children . " the time of either-or is over , " said jutta allmendinger , who directed the study , entitled " women on the move . "
over 1,000 young women in germany , aged 17-19 and 27-29 , were questioned for the study , which contrasts sharply with a similar survey conducted by brigitte in 1982 . what 's more , today 's young women are willing to do what it takes to attain their wishes - 96 percent said they did n't think one could get anywhere in life without goals , and 79 percent said they were working hard toward theirs . allmendinger said it was surprising that this trend of self-confidence and ambition was found among women in all social groups . women less willing to compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young women have cast off the burden of perfectionism in the household the number of women who want to work has increased , the study found .
" in -lsb- the former -rsb- west germany , it used to be just 20 to 30 percent , the rest was rhetoric , " allmendinger said . education plays a strong role in young women 's lives , with three to four times as many girls completing their abitur , the high school exam that allows students to carry on to university . on the job , women are less willing than their male counterparts to give everything and always be available , according to the study .
most do n't feel supported by society - only one-sixth said that children and career could be easily combined these days . " if companies do n't offer women an acceptable balance between work and life , they 'll soon be lacking important personnel resources , " said allmendinger . rethinking priorities despite their career ambitions , the women surveyed also placed a strong emphasis on relationships .
three-quarters said they wanted a steady partner .
ninety-one percent said friends were important to them , while 87 percent said the same of parents and siblings . the women rated good looks -lrb- 59 percent -rrb- and good sex -lrb- 54 percent -rrb- as less significant .
only one-fourth said being thin was important . if 90 percent of this generation of women chooses a different path than their mothers , this will change society , said allmendinger .

but more choices and cheaper fares for travelers may be a little ways off , analysts say . the agreement between the united states and the european union is to take effect on sunday , march 31 , and will end most restrictions on us and eu airlines ' ability to fly between the two continents .
different air carriers will be allowed to depart or land at various locations on both continents . the concept of the open market dictating flight routes between the europe and the us originally held the promise of cheaper airfares and more choices for travelers , but analysts say the turmoil in the us economy and the airline industry may prevent immediate benefits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competition could cause a cut in fares air carriers are hurting from record-high fuel costs and increased economic uncertainty , industry observers pointed out . " i think -lsb- the agreement -rsb- would mean a lot more if the industry were not in the dire straits they are in now , " terry trippler , an aviation consultant and founder of tripplertravel.com , told afp news agency . " the industry is more concerned about cutting flights than expanding , " he said .
" eventually this will be fantastic when this industry shakes itself out .
right now , the celebration is muted . " mixed views george hamlin , managing director of the consulting firm aca associates , told afp that , on the contrary , some new flights were being scheduled , with air france offering service from london to los angeles and us carriers getting some coveted slots at london 's heathrow airport . " in the longer term there may be some overexpansion , followed by some contraction , " hamlin said . hamlin said airlines would have to plan ahead for good times and bad by ordering aircraft and securing landing rights even if conditions were not ideal . " we do n't even begin to get a glimmer of the possibilities of open-market competition yet , " jerry chandler , cheapflights.com 's travel blogger , told the new york times .
" there could be a lot of flourishing of routes in markets that currently do n't exist , especially from smaller us cities to european hubs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such comforts may be out of reach for travelers , but cheaper fares could be on the horizon stuart klaskin of the aviation consultancy kkc agreed , pointing out that the gradually opening up market will lead to competition that will benefit smaller cities on both sides of the atlantic . " i think in the next 18 months you will be able to travel at a steep discount to europe , " he told afp , and predicted more low-cost , business-class options and other carriers serving an expanded trans-atlantic route network . klaskin agreed that airlines must prepare for the changes , despite their worries concerning the economic climate and soaring fuel costs . given the circumstances , " -lsb- the airlines -rsb- ca n't afford to make a mistake , " he told afp . pact opens up options the pact allows airlines more freedom .
formerly , individual european countries and the us maintained separate agreements for trans-atlantic flight .
airlines had to depart from or land in their native countries and were limited in which airports they could serve .
british airways flights , for instance , had to take off from britain .
only american airlines and united airlines were permitted to land at heathrow airport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa could broaden its network of hubs and not just rely on frankfurt as of next week , northwest , delta and continental will be able to serve heathrow or other european airports for the first time . european carriers may also begin to compete more aggressively with one another .
german airline company lufthansa could feasibly install a hub in paris , or air france could make frankfurt a hub . despite the new open skies agreement , the us and europe are gearing up for a second round of negotiations in september on opening airline companies to foreign investors .
it 's a contentious issue in the us , which bans foreigners from owning more than 25 percent of a domestic airline . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 26.03.2008 physics could soothe migraine pain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migraines are sometimes preceded by auras , or visual disturbances migraine headaches are a widespread illness , but doctors are often at a loss in how to offer relief to patients .
now , physicists have started tackling the problem - and may have discovered the cause of the illness . the intense , throbbing pain of a migraine often feels like an attack on the senses .
in germany , some 12 percent to 16 percent of the population suffers from migraines , which can affect one or both sides of the head .
but some sufferers experience a kind of warning , known as an " aura , " before the full-blown attack . scientists , however , remain at odds over whether an aura is the cause of migraine pain , or an accompanying symptom since migraines can occur with or without auras .
the auras themselves also do not necessarily develop into migraines . an aura is a kind of psychological or neurological " churning " lasting from five minutes to 30 minutes and which can result in vertigo , confusion , or numbness , and can also affect vision in various ways .
visual disturbances , such as vision loss , or hallucinations may result , including flashing lights , distortion of objects or the emergence of complex color patterns . malfunction in visual cortex bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some migraines can last for days , forcing sufferers to stay in bed auras involving visual disturbances often intrigue doctors because they are so mysterious . scientists have known for the past few years that such auras are linked with a so-called stimulation wave .
this involves increased activity of brain cells that occurs in the visual cortex and which moves at the rate of three millimeters -lrb- 0.118 inches -rrb- per minute .
a malfunction in the visual cortex , however , makes aura sufferers see something in their line of vision which does not really exist . a 30-minute-aura could prove fatal since someone suffering from one behind the wheel could perceive an empty street when in fact a cyclist is passing by . faulty feedback mechanisms using computer simulations , physicists are now trying to figure out what triggers an aura . the simulations do not try to replicate the entire brain in a computer , but instead , some of its decisive mechanisms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migraines cause pain beyond words for many sufferers " those include the neurons grouped in the visual cortex which are connected to one another in multiple ways , " said eckehard schoell , managing director of the institute for theoretical physics in berlin .
" when electrical pulses move along these connections , we have what we call a stimulation wave . " particularly important here is the ability of brain cells to both send and receive signals .
cells can thus communicate with other cells and send back or pass on the information they have just received . the physicists in berlin have tracked precisely these signals in their computer simulations . " let 's assume that this feedback mechanism is occurring and our model is currently in an area where no waves can develop - that would be the model of a healthy patient , " schoell said .
" if we were to now suppress this feedback mechanism from occurring , then we suddenly move into an area where waves can occur . " one could then assume that a lack of feedback mechanisms is what causes the stimulation waves and thus migraine auras . glasses may solve problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pair of special glasses might help some scientists are now speculating that artificial means could help trigger the missing feedback processes , with experts at the juelich research center in western germany placing their bets on an unusual pair of glasses . special sensors attached to the glasses at the back of the head can measure brain activity .
their signals can control diodes which are located on the front of the glasses and which produce bright , flashing lights that influence the activity of neurons in the brain . the goal is that the flashing lights from the glasses would hinder the stimulation waves , thereby suppressing auras and hopefully the migraines as well . while the glasses have so far only been tested on healthy patients , scientists are optimistic about the results .
but whether they can actually help suppress auras and even migraines in sufferers remains to be seen . frank grotelueschen -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a news report has now uncovered the latest scandal at the chain . according to german newsmagazine stern , lidl officials last year ordered detectives to install hidden cameras in several stores in germany to observe their employees at work and during breaks . the magazine received several hundred pages of reports on lidl employees that included information on when they left work to use the restroom , personal phone conversations employees made and comments on their appearance . lidl officials acknowledged that the company had used cameras and detectives but not to watch its workers . " the idea that we would ' spy ' on our employees does not at all comply with our leadership principles and the fair treatment of our workers , " said company director juergen kissebert in a statement . he added that lidl was putting an immediate stop to the practice . stasi techniques ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee 's tatoo did not make detectives happy the style of the reports recalled the detailed surveillance records of east germany 's secret police , the stasi .
in one case , a detective commented on the " self-made " tattoos visible on an employee 's forearms and suggested that she should be asked to cover them up as especially elderly customers might think she got them in prison . in another case , the report quoted a conversation between two employees , with one telling the other she hoped her wages had been transferred to her account since she desperately needed money that night .
" for what ? " asked the detective in his report . work vs. privacy many other surveillance notes , which can be read on stern 's web site , focus on the employees ' work habits , mentioning things such as a candy bar left lying atop female hygiene products rather than being returned to its correct place and employees talking to each other in polish in front of customers . lidl officials , who did not deny the existence of the reports , have said that they were simply intended to uncover " possible misconduct " by employees .
they distanced themselves from the idea of spying on people 's privacy , saying that the reports were not in line with the company 's " way of dealing with each other . " calls for investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaar said that the latest allegations should be investigated germany 's data protection officer , peter schaar , meanwhile told stern that the reports were a grave infringement on the country 's data protection laws .
he said he expected data protection agencies to investigate the matter . state officials in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg , where lidl is headquartered , said that they would check into the matter , according to german news service dpa . a european giant lidl has stores in 23 european countries , according to the company 's web site .
the chain came under pressure from german services sector trade union verdi in 2004 , when the union published a black book on the company 's practices in dealing with employees . apart from germany 's no.1 discounter aldi , lidl remains the country 's most popular store for cheap food and other low-price products , according to a study published this month . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no beer , no dancing and absolutely no room service ; national soccer team coach joachim loew has pulled the plug on his players ' fun ahead of this summer 's 2008 european championships . you are what you eat : loew , it seems , has taken the old adage seriously and put his players on a strict diet to keep them in shape for the european championships in austria and switzerland this june . the service teams at the germans ' training camp in mallorca and their hotel in ascona , switzerland , have reportedly been instructed not to provide the national players with room service under any circumstances , lest the players sneakily attempt to order a beer or - gasp ! - chips . " of course we trust the players , " team manager oliver bierhoff said , according to the afp news agency .

" anyone who is out until the early hours of the morning is n't taking their job seriously , " bierhoff added . team officials are hoping that this kind of teutonic dedication that will help german succeed in the quest to claim their fourth european championship title this summer . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a wet breeding season in 2007 led to a fall in blue tit numbers , while house sparrows also continued to decline .
rain washing caterpillars off leaves is likely to have caused food shortages , said a spokesman for the charity .
the figures were compiled nationwide on 26 and 27 january by almost 400,000 people during the big garden birdwatch .
blue tits , which normally have only one brood per year , experienced their worst ever breeding season in 2007 , with just over half of young blue tits fledging .
david hirst of the rspb northern england region said : " the survey findings help us to understand more about the population trends of garden birds .
but goldfinch sightings are becoming increasingly common " we predicted that last year 's terrible weather would be reflected by the big garden birdwatch , and this seems to be the case , especially for blue tits .
" a snapshot in winter only gives part of the picture , but this year 's results also suggest a further fall in sparrow numbers in some areas . "
however , the survey showed that four colourful species of finches were increasingly visiting the region 's gardens .
siskins , bramblings , redpolls and goldfinches are all becoming more common .
goldfinches are now the 4th most recorded species of garden bird across tyne and wear , and the 5th most spotted in the tees valley .

a wet breeding season in 2007 led to a fall in blue tit numbers , while house sparrows also continued to decline .
rain washing caterpillars off leaves is likely to have caused food shortages , said a spokesman for the charity .
the figures were compiled nationwide on 26 and 27 january by almost 400,000 people during the big garden birdwatch .
blue tits , which normally have only one brood per year , experienced their worst ever breeding season in 2007 , with just over half of young blue tits fledging .
david hirst of the rspb northern england region said : " the survey findings help us to understand more about the population trends of garden birds .
but goldfinch sightings are becoming increasingly common " we predicted that last year 's terrible weather would be reflected by the big garden birdwatch , and this seems to be the case , especially for blue tits .
" a snapshot in winter only gives part of the picture , but this year 's results also suggest a further fall in sparrow numbers in some areas . "
however , the survey showed that four colourful species of finches were increasingly visiting the region 's gardens .
siskins , bramblings , redpolls and goldfinches are all becoming more common .
goldfinches are now the 4th most recorded species of garden bird across tyne and wear , and the 5th most spotted in the tees valley .

the 18-strong team of medical students are trying to determine whether individuals who are at risk of the condition can be spotted in advance .
their project will use mri scans and check for physical characteristics which could affect individuals .
between 15-25 % of britons exposed to moderate altitudes become affected .
jon bailey , one of the students organising the project , told bbc wales ' news website : " at present there is no way of being able to look at someone and say if they 'll get acute mountain sickness -lrb- ams -rrb- .
" so what we 're hoping to do is use the mri scan to look at the size of someone 's brain to see if they 're at risk of mountain sickness . "
risks the first part of the project will see the group scanned at the university of glamorgan and cardiff university brain research imaging centre -lrb- cubric -rrb- and be assessed for physiological factors which could predispose a person to ams .
this will be followed by a trip to climb mount elbrus in southern russia where the students will be assessed by questionnaire .
the final stage will see the students return to cubric for a second mri scan to investigate any changes to the brain structure .
mr bailey said mountain sickness cost insurance companies and health services tens of thousands of pounds as well as creating " a significant burden of illness " .
" as future doctors , we have a responsibility to educate individuals to the risks of altitude illness , as well as treat those acutely affected , " he added .

risks the first part of the project will see the group scanned at the university of glamorgan and cardiff university brain research imaging centre -lrb- cubric -rrb- and be assessed for physiological factors which could predispose a person to ams .
this will be followed by a trip to climb mount elbrus in southern russia where the students will be assessed by questionnaire .
the final stage will see the students return to cubric for a second mri scan to investigate any changes to the brain structure .
mr bailey said mountain sickness cost insurance companies and health services tens of thousands of pounds as well as creating " a significant burden of illness " .
" as future doctors , we have a responsibility to educate individuals to the risks of altitude illness , as well as treat those acutely affected , " he added .

the department of health is holding a consultation on deregulating some types of non-surgical treatment by removing the need for clinics to register .
the british association of aesthetic plastic surgeons called this " absurd " .
but the government argues that a balance needed to be struck between risk and regulation .
it is currently holding a 12 week consultation on the partial deregulation of what are known as class 3b or class 4 laser products and intense pulsed light -lrb- ipl -rrb- treatments .
these are most often used for the removal of large patches of hair , reducing lines and wrinkles , and improving the appearance of scars and damaged skin .
there are currently around 850 private sector and voluntary clinics providing these services which are registered with the healthcare commission , which monitors standards in independent and nhs organisations .
under the proposals , these would no longer be regulated by this body - potentially paving the way for more clinics to start offering the service .
" the levels of risk involved in the use of lasers / ipl equipment for non-surgical purposes leads us to believe that the current regulatory regime is not proportionate to the risk of harm to patients , " the consultation document reads .
' private choice ' but baaps said while lasers and ipl could be safe if administered in an " appropriate environment " and by a " properly trained clinician " , the public should be aware that these procedures posed risks ranging from irritated skin to burns . "

" sooner or later patients will suffer as a result of these political moves and the government will have to take responsibility for their actions . "
a spokesperson for the department of health said that people opting for services such as hair removal did so of their own volition , and privately .
" a balance will always need to be struck between the risk presented by a particular non-surgical cosmetic treatment and the cost to the publicly-funded regulatory body .
" the use of lasers in surgery would continue to be subject to healthcare commission regulation , as would laser eye surgery . "

heads bowed , voices hushed , the trio converse animatedly until sir alan leans back and announces : " butterkist .
that 's what it was called . "
presumably , the multi-millionaire is n't planning a hostile takeover of the esteemed popcorn manufacturer - he just wants something to eat while he watches his hit reality show , the apprentice .
he studies the programme intently , his head cocked to one side , legs crossed and hands clasped firmly around one knee .
this year 's batch of candidates enlarge image his body language gives little away but , in conversation later , the entrepreneur professes to be proud of the programme .
" it has certainly increased an awareness of enterprise in young people , which is quite satisfying , " he says .
" do i think the ceo of tesco learns anything from it ?
no , but most people would see a few scenarios in there which will wake them up to reality . "
fish fiasco in the opening episode of this year 's series , it is the 16 eager young candidates who get a rude awakening , as they are sent out on their first task before introductions have even been made .
i do what i want in the board room and if they do n't like it , they can clear off sir alan sugar the boys square off against the girls , with each team given two van loads of fresh fish and ordered to shift the lot by the end of the day .
fans of the series will instantly recognise the patented apprentice mix of over-privileged city boys , steely-eyed lawyers and plucky wannabes who " work in sales " .
as usual , they all seem to have been trained in giving moronically self-aggrandising sound bytes .
" i rate myself as the best salesperson in europe , " squawks 27-year-old marketing consultant jennifer maguire .
" there are two types of people in the world , " declares ian stringer , a software sales manager from bedfordshire .
" winners and ...
" i do n't know how to say the word .
i ca n't say it . "
all of the candidates promise to give " 110 % " , oblivious to the fact that this leaves them 10 % in debt - hardly an auspicious start for a budding entrepreneur .
while the contestant 's insane rantings make perfect shouting-at-your-telly entertainment , the harsh reality is that one of them will have to take on a serious , responsible job in one of sir alan 's companies .
he has been critical of the calibre of the candidates in the past , accusing them of chasing celebrity over a career .
katie hopkins became the first candidate to step down last year among those who have drawn his ire , one suspects , is katie hopkins .
the mother-of-two famously walked off last year 's show - and turned up on i 'm a celebrity get me out of here nine months later .
" the fact of the matter is that within a week or so , newspapers paid her the amount of money she would make working with me for a year , " sir alan admits .
" but now , " he adds , " nobody will touch her with a bargepole . "
the businessman says he now warns applicants not to be seduced by " seeing themselves on the big screen " in his endearingly gruff style .
" i say to them at a very early stage : " if you 're here for the wrong reasons , stick your hand up and clear off . " '
children 's show however , the amstrad boss is no stranger to the spotlight himself these days .
" the public reaction is much better than it was when i was chairman of a football club , " he grins .
it is mainly children who approach him on the street , he adds , prompting the idea of a special edition of the apprentice for teenagers .
sir alan is offering a six-figure salary for his new apprentice " i think it would be an absolute one-off blockbuster .
" i 've even gone to the extent of saying you do n't fire anyone .
god knows what they would call me if i fired an 11-year-old child ! "
but the acne apprentice , as it could be called , may never hit tv screens .
in what may be a first for sir alan , he put the idea forward " and nobody noticed " .
one area where the bbc and the businessman do agree , however , is on how to continue the success of their reality show .
" in america , this programme was a tremendous hit and the mistake they made was that they ran three series back-to-back .
" people got sick and tired of it , the standards started to slip , and you ended up with a pile of rubbish . "
" you have to take your hats off to the bbc because they 've made this programme an annual event . "
sir alan is currently signed up for just one more series , but insists that the apprentice format has " longevity " .
but the golden question is whether it really delivers the top-flight employees his business needs .
last year 's winner , the fresh-faced simon ambrose , is " doing okay " working in real estate .
" he 's had a rude awakening , " says sir alan , " he 's amongst some sharks out there . "
" he 's got to learn , but he 's an apprentice .
" he has n't sold canary wharf yet , but he 'll get there . "
the apprentice begins on wednesday , 26 march at 2100gmt on bbc one .

it said milder winters meant the goldfinch in particular was spending winters here in larger numbers .
however , the overall number of birds counted in the survey - held in january - has dropped by 20 % since 2004 .
milder winters mean food is not as scarce and birds do not have to search in gardens , while some species are in long-term decline , the rspb says .
the national big garden birdwatch survey took place on 26 and 27 january this year and is aimed at providing a snapshot of the uk 's bird population .
sparrows and starlings nearly 400,000 people counted more than six million birds in gardens or parks .
an average of 28.4 birds were counted per garden in this year 's study , compared with an average of 34.8 per garden in 2004 - a trend partly attributed by the rspb to declines in key species .
it said numbers of some of the most common bird species , such as the house sparrow and starling , had dropped dramatically over the 29 years the survey has been running . "
for the foreseeable future we 're in a period when we 've got much milder winters " andre farrar , rspb the 2008 survey showed sightings of the yellow and black siskin have increased by almost two-thirds over the last four years and it was sighted in three times as many gardens as last year .
the bird , a member of the finch family , has become one of the study 's top 20 most commonly spotted birds for the first time , with large numbers driven from scandinavia where conifer seed crops have been poor in recent months .
furthermore , the goldfinch - encouraged by warmer temperatures in the uk - made it into the top 10 for the first time .

he said : " many of them are here because of food supplies .
" along with siskin increases , numbers of redpolls seen in gardens have skyrocketed . "
he said warmer temperatures mean the national survey is now almost a " spring " event rather than a winter one .
dr farrar said the lower number of sightings in recent years were in part due to the absence of the kind of harsh weather once seen during the birdwatch weekend .
woodpigeon success he added : " these are very profound changes to our climate we are seeing .
" for the foreseeable future we 're in a period when we 've got much milder winters . "
sparrow numbers have dropped 64 % since the first garden birdwatch in 1979 and starling numbers have fallen by 77 % in that time , while the blackbird and chaffinch have seen numbers fall by 39 % and 28 % respectively .
in stark contrast , the woodpigeon and collared dove have seen numbers rise by 665 % and 411 % .

it said milder winters meant the goldfinch in particular was spending winters here in larger numbers .
however , the overall number of birds counted in the survey - held in january - has dropped by 20 % since 2004 .
milder winters mean food is not as scarce and birds do not have to search in gardens , while some species are in long-term decline , the rspb says .
the national big garden birdwatch survey took place on 26 and 27 january this year and is aimed at providing a snapshot of the uk 's bird population .
sparrows and starlings nearly 400,000 people counted more than six million birds in gardens or parks .
an average of 28.4 birds were counted per garden in this year 's study , compared with an average of 34.8 per garden in 2004 - a trend partly attributed by the rspb to declines in key species .
it said numbers of some of the most common bird species , such as the house sparrow and starling , had dropped dramatically over the 29 years the survey has been running .
for the foreseeable future we 're in a period when we 've got much milder winters andre farrar , rspb the 2008 survey showed sightings of the yellow and black siskin have increased by almost two-thirds over the last four years and it was sighted in three times as many gardens as last year .
the bird , a member of the finch family , has become one of the study 's top 20 most commonly spotted birds for the first time , with large numbers driven from scandinavia where conifer seed crops have been poor in recent months .
furthermore , the goldfinch - encouraged by warmer temperatures in the uk - made it into the top 10 for the first time .

he said : " many of them are here because of food supplies .
" along with siskin increases , numbers of redpolls seen in gardens have skyrocketed . "
he said warmer temperatures mean the national survey is now almost a " spring " event rather than a winter one .
dr farrar said the lower number of sightings in recent years were in part due to the absence of the kind of harsh weather once seen during the birdwatch weekend .
woodpigeon success he added : " these are very profound changes to our climate we are seeing .
" for the foreseeable future we 're in a period when we 've got much milder winters . "
sparrow numbers have dropped 64 % since the first garden birdwatch in 1979 and starling numbers have fallen by 77 % in that time , while the blackbird and chaffinch have seen numbers fall by 39 % and 28 % respectively .
in stark contrast , the woodpigeon and collared dove have seen numbers rise by 665 % and 411 % .

it said milder winters meant the goldfinch in particular was spending winters here in larger numbers .
however , the overall number of birds counted in the survey - held in january - has dropped by 20 % since 2004 .
milder winters mean food is not as scarce and birds do not have to search in gardens , while some species are in long-term decline , the rspb says .
the national big garden birdwatch survey took place on 26 and 27 january this year and is aimed at providing a snapshot of the uk 's bird population .
sparrows and starlings nearly 400,000 people counted more than six million birds in gardens or parks .
an average of 28.4 birds were counted per garden in this year 's study , compared with an average of 34.8 per garden in 2004 - a trend partly attributed by the rspb to declines in key species .
it said numbers of some of the most common bird species , such as the house sparrow and starling , had dropped dramatically over the 29 years the survey has been running .
for the foreseeable future we 're in a period when we 've got much milder winters andre farrar , rspb the 2008 survey showed sightings of the yellow and black siskin have increased by almost two-thirds over the last four years and it was sighted in three times as many gardens as last year .
the bird , a member of the finch family , has become one of the study 's top 20 most commonly spotted birds for the first time , with large numbers driven from scandinavia where conifer seed crops have been poor in recent months .
furthermore , the goldfinch - encouraged by warmer temperatures in the uk - made it into the top 10 for the first time .

it said milder winters meant the goldfinch in particular was spending winters here in larger numbers .
however , the overall number of birds counted in the survey - held in january - has dropped by 20 % since 2004 .
milder winters mean food is not as scarce and birds do not have to search in gardens , while some species are in long-term decline , the rspb says .
the national big garden birdwatch survey took place on 26 and 27 january this year and is aimed at providing a snapshot of the uk 's bird population .
sparrows and starlings nearly 400,000 people counted more than six million birds in gardens or parks .
an average of 28.4 birds were counted per garden in this year 's study , compared with an average of 34.8 per garden in 2004 - a trend partly attributed by the rspb to declines in key species .
it said numbers of some of the most common bird species , such as the house sparrow and starling , had dropped dramatically over the 29 years the survey has been running .
for the foreseeable future we 're in a period when we 've got much milder winters andre farrar , rspb the 2008 survey showed sightings of the yellow and black siskin have increased by almost two-thirds over the last four years and it was sighted in three times as many gardens as last year .
the bird , a member of the finch family , has become one of the study 's top 20 most commonly spotted birds for the first time , with large numbers driven from scandinavia where conifer seed crops have been poor in recent months .
furthermore , the goldfinch - encouraged by warmer temperatures in the uk - made it into the top 10 for the first time .

he said : " many of them are here because of food supplies .
" along with siskin increases , numbers of redpolls seen in gardens have skyrocketed . "
he said warmer temperatures mean the national survey is now almost a " spring " event rather than a winter one .
dr farrar said the lower number of sightings in recent years were in part due to the absence of the kind of harsh weather once seen during the birdwatch weekend .

construction of the parkway station , near junction 24 of the m1 and east midlands airport , began in december .

now east midlands trains has said it will get four trains an hour at peak times , with more improvements in 2009 .
parkway has been on the drawing board for 10 years .
subsidised services leicestershire county council 's deputy leader , nicholas rushton , said just two trains an hour could make the station almost redundant .
" it is key to the airport to get the people coming in and out by other means than car .
" but the airport is saying that at the moment they subsidise bus routes to loughborough and derby and they are concerned sufficient people will not use the parkway because the infrequency of stops there .
" so at the moment they are unwilling to subsidise a park-and-ride scheme from the station , so you could have an open station and no one using it . "
new lines david horne , commercial director of east midlands trains , insisted the station would start with a good service which would then improve .
he said : " what we are hoping to do after 2009 is improve the spread of services in the off-peak period .
" the infrastructure around the station is a bit limited ; we ca n't use two lines which are reserved for freight .
" when network rail do their resignalling work at the end of 2009 those freight lines will be available for passenger services , so we will be able to change the services . "

by paul reynolds world affairs correspondent , bbc news website the french president nicolas sarkozy seems to be ushering in one of those periods of franco-british harmony which never quite develop into a settled relationship .
tony blair and jacques chirac went through a similar process in st malo in 1998 .
on that occasion they agreed on steps towards greater military cooperation .
but that newly rediscovered sentiment eventually fell down over iraq and the two antagonists , like an old married couple , soon resumed their sparring .
president sarkozy , on his state visit to britain this week , is trying to reinvigorate cross-channel relations once more .
he said in a bbc interview in advance that he wanted france and britain to " move from being cordial to being friendly " , and that they should agree " concrete " steps to show this .
defence is again a key issue .
the french president is offering to put france back into nato 's integrated military structure , from which gen de gaulle withdrew it in 1966 .
but in return , he wants senior command posts for french officers and what he called in the new york times last september " american acceptance of an independent european defence capability ... "
to get american acceptance , he needs to beat a path to and maybe through the british first .
and this is where the new mood of franco-british chumminess might fall down .
different visions the british prime minister gordon brown is an atlanticist who shares the concerns of the british military that a dash for a european defence " capability " , which is in fact allowed for in the lisbon eu treaty , might fatally undermine nato .
president sarkozy says that nato and a european force can go hand in hand .
it would be a double whammy for him - france properly back in nato with some plum posts and , perhaps even more importantly , the prospect of a real european defence policy .
he would be engaging in another kind of integration - between the atlantic and european visions of defence .
france is expected to use its six-month presidency of the eu starting in july to press the case .
the political background for a rapprochement with the us and uk is favourable .
iraq is no longer so divisive .
mr sarkozy is much more pro-american than mr chirac was .
he shares suspicion of the new russia .
he is also currently not getting on that well with the german chancellor angela merkel .
when franco-german relations get rusty , the british and french seem to get on better .
practical focus but what chance of a fundamental shift in the relationship between britain and france ? "
many eyes will be on the new wife but the president himself has something to prove ...
this visit will give him the chance of appearing more " presidential " " not much has to be the answer .
the fact remains that france and britain still have very different ideas , not only about defence , but about the future of the european union .
prime minister gordon brown remains a fan of globalisation and opposes protectionism within the eu .
he is cautious about developing a purely european defence capability that might upset nato and the link with the americans .
president sarkozy on the other hand openly talks about the need to protect french economic interests .
because of these divisions over visions , summits like this tend to focus on practical steps .
this time , for example , there is the prospect of an agreement to co-operate on nuclear power , in which the french have taken the lead since they decided a generation ago to go 80 % nuclear in their power generation -lrb- compared with about 20 % by the british -rrb- .
there are also likely to be agreements to help each other on illegal immigration and terrorism .
with a new wife and an old mother in tow -lrb- update : the mother is indisposed and will not come ; however , madame sarkozy 's mother is in the party -rrb- , the french leader will also make a personal splash .
indeed much of the attention will be on the style of this visit .
many eyes will be on the new wife but the president himself has something to prove .
he is under scrutiny in the french media for having been , perhaps , a bit too flash in the first part of his presidency .
this visit will give him the chance of appearing more " presidential " .
the british monarch will help set the scene for this , with well-practised ceremony at windsor castle .

to get american acceptance , he needs to beat a path to and maybe through the british first .
and this is where the new mood of franco-british chumminess might fall down .
different visions the british prime minister gordon brown is an atlanticist who shares the concerns of the british military that a dash for a european defence " capability " , which is in fact allowed for in the lisbon eu treaty , might fatally undermine nato .
mr brown and mr sarkozy have very different visions of europe president sarkozy says that nato and a european force can go hand in hand .
it would be a double whammy for him - france properly back in nato with some plum posts and , perhaps even more importantly , the prospect of a real european defence policy .

the political background for a rapprochement with the us and uk is favourable .

mr sarkozy is much more pro-american than mr chirac was .

the fact remains that france and britain still have very different ideas , not only about defence , but about the future of the european union .
prime minister gordon brown remains a fan of globalisation and opposes protectionism within the eu .

there are also likely to be agreements to help each other on illegal immigration and terrorism .

by paul reynolds world affairs correspondent , bbc news website preparations for mr sarkozy 's two-day visit to the uk the french president nicolas sarkozy seems to be ushering in one of those periods of franco-british harmony which never quite develop into a settled relationship .
tony blair and jacques chirac went through a similar process in st malo in 1998 .
on that occasion they agreed on steps towards greater military cooperation .
but that newly rediscovered sentiment eventually fell down over iraq and the two antagonists , like an old married couple , soon resumed their sparring .
president sarkozy , on his state visit to britain this week , is trying to reinvigorate cross-channel relations once more .
he said in a bbc interview in advance that he wanted france and britain to " move from being cordial to being friendly " , and that they should agree " concrete " steps to show this .

about 600 people complained about two pre-watershed episodes in which max branning was put into a coffin by his wife and her lover .
the bbc said it regretted that some people " did not enjoy " the episodes but stopped short of a full apology .
it said the burial was not " glorified " and " great care " had been taken to flag up the nature of the scenes in advance .
a bbc spokesman said the corporation had received around 600 complaints since the episodes were broadcast on good friday and easter monday .
powerful friday 's episode , which was broadcast at 2030 gmt , saw scorned wife tanya -lrb- jo joyner -rrb- enact her revenge on errant husband max -lrb- jake wood -rrb- for his affair with stacey -lrb- lacey turner -rrb- , by drugging him and attempting to bury him alive .
the bbc said the images were " implicit rather than explicit " and that the burial was " in no way glamorised " .
it added that the audience would have expected a dramatic culmination to the affair storyline and that max made it out alive after tanya realised she could not go through with her plan .
in a statement on its complaints website , the bbc said : " when pushed to the edge , tanya 's behaviour becomes out of character , and indeed that it 's tanya herself who ultimately suffers because of her actions . "
the bbc added : " we took great care to signal the nature of the content to the audience through pre-programme announcements , billings and programme publicity in order to prepare viewers for what to expect . "
