nine years after they again lost control over kosovo in war , serbs are now also losing even the formal hold over it . serbs first lost kosovo when their declining empire suffered a huge defeat to ottoman turks in a 1389 battle .
they waited five centuries , until 1912 to return the land to serbian rule . here are some of the key dates in kosovo 's history : 1945 - kosovo becomes a province of serbia , the largest republic of the new , communist yugoslav federation . 1975 - with yugoslavia 's new constitution , kosovo acquires wide-ranging autonomy and a self-governing authority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic said serbia would never give up control of kosovo 1989 - with slobodan milosevic rising to power on a surge of national awakening in serbia , belgrade scraps the autonomy of the increasingly restive kosovo . 1990 - on july 2 , legislators of the dissolved provincial parliament declare independence from serbia , an act which the international community ignores .
belgrade then dissolves kosovo 's autonomous assembly . 1998 - after five year of non-violent resistance through parallel institutions under the guidance of the moderate ibrahim rugova , the extremists among kosovo albanians take the initiative .
the separatist guerrilla kosovo liberation army uck launches attacks on police , military and serb civilians .
milosevic 's security apparatus cracks down on the rebels with massive force , effectively starting a war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato stationed thousands of troops in kosovo after the bombing campaign 1999 - talks between albanian leaders and belgrade - mediated in rambouillet , near paris by the contact group of big powers - fail to reach a solution by their conclusion on march 19 .
an escalation of violence in kosovo produces huge waves of refugees and on march 24 nato launches an aerial bombing campaign against yugoslavia to stop the bloodshed and the exodus .
after 78 days belgrade capitulates and orders its troops out of kosovo , making room for a nato-led peacekeeping mission of some 45,000 troops , but only after wrangling out a un resolution guaranteeing it sovereignty over kosovo .
the same resolution , 1244 , introduced a un administration to govern kosovo .
fearing reprisal attacks , thousands of serbs flee kosovo . 2001 - rugova named president in kosovo 's first general election . 2004 - on march 17 concerted kosovo-wide riots by albanians leave 19 dead and hundreds injured .
thousands of serbs flee their homes as hundreds of houses and dozens of churches are set on fire .
the eruption of violence was never properly explained and instigators were poorly prosecuted .
the incident was used by belgrade as an argument against kosovo 's independence . 2005 - kosovo prime minister ramush haradinaj resigns from office to face war crimes charges at the hague .
haradinaj strongly denies the charges ; the court has not issued a verdict .
the un security council agrees to talks on kosovo 's future .
former finnish president martti ahtissari is called on to mediate the talks . 2006 - in february in vienna the un launches the first direct talks on the status of kosovo between belgrade and the meanwhile fully-fledged kosovo authorities .
the vienna talks produce no result . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official declaration of independence came on feb .
17 , 2008 2007 - unable to find a negotiated solution to kosovo 's future status , ahtissari proposes supervised independence for the province .
another round of last-ditch talks , organized after russia shoots down an attempt at releasing kosovo from serbia 's sovereignty in the un , end in a deadlock by the dec .
10 deadline .
this paves the way for a unilateral declaration of independence by pristina with the support of the united states and several european union nations . 2008 - former guerrilla commander hashim thaci is elected prime minister and promises kosovo will declare independence in coordination with western governments .

nine years after they again lost control over kosovo in war , serbs are now also losing even the formal hold over it . serbs first lost kosovo when their declining empire suffered a huge defeat to ottoman turks in a 1389 battle .
they waited five centuries , until 1912 to return the land to serbian rule . here are some of the key dates in kosovo 's history : 1945 - kosovo becomes a province of serbia , the largest republic of the new , communist yugoslav federation . 1975 - with yugoslavia 's new constitution , kosovo acquires wide-ranging autonomy and a self-governing authority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic said serbia would never give up control of kosovo 1989 - with slobodan milosevic rising to power on a surge of national awakening in serbia , belgrade scraps the autonomy of the increasingly restive kosovo . 1990 - on july 2 , legislators of the dissolved provincial parliament declare independence from serbia , an act which the international community ignores .
belgrade then dissolves kosovo 's autonomous assembly . 1998 - after five year of non-violent resistance through parallel institutions under the guidance of the moderate ibrahim rugova , the extremists among kosovo albanians take the initiative .
the separatist guerrilla kosovo liberation army uck launches attacks on police , military and serb civilians .
milosevic 's security apparatus cracks down on the rebels with massive force , effectively starting a war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato stationed thousands of troops in kosovo after the bombing campaign 1999 - talks between albanian leaders and belgrade - mediated in rambouillet , near paris by the contact group of big powers - fail to reach a solution by their conclusion on march 19 .
an escalation of violence in kosovo produces huge waves of refugees and on march 24 nato launches an aerial bombing campaign against yugoslavia to stop the bloodshed and the exodus .
after 78 days belgrade capitulates and orders its troops out of kosovo , making room for a nato-led peacekeeping mission of some 45,000 troops , but only after wrangling out a un resolution guaranteeing it sovereignty over kosovo .
the same resolution , 1244 , introduced a un administration to govern kosovo .
fearing reprisal attacks , thousands of serbs flee kosovo . 2001 - rugova named president in kosovo 's first general election . 2004 - on march 17 concerted kosovo-wide riots by albanians leave 19 dead and hundreds injured .

nine years after they again lost control over kosovo in war , serbs are now also losing even the formal hold over it . serbs first lost kosovo when their declining empire suffered a huge defeat to ottoman turks in a 1389 battle .
they waited five centuries , until 1912 to return the land to serbian rule . here are some of the key dates in kosovo 's history : 1945 - kosovo becomes a province of serbia , the largest republic of the new , communist yugoslav federation . 1975 - with yugoslavia 's new constitution , kosovo acquires wide-ranging autonomy and a self-governing authority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic said serbia would never give up control of kosovo 1989 - with slobodan milosevic rising to power on a surge of national awakening in serbia , belgrade scraps the autonomy of the increasingly restive kosovo . 1990 - on july 2 , legislators of the dissolved provincial parliament declare independence from serbia , an act which the international community ignores .
belgrade then dissolves kosovo 's autonomous assembly . 1998 - after five year of non-violent resistance through parallel institutions under the guidance of the moderate ibrahim rugova , the extremists among kosovo albanians take the initiative .
the separatist guerrilla kosovo liberation army uck launches attacks on police , military and serb civilians .
milosevic 's security apparatus cracks down on the rebels with massive force , effectively starting a war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato stationed thousands of troops in kosovo after the bombing campaign 1999 - talks between albanian leaders and belgrade - mediated in rambouillet , near paris by the contact group of big powers - fail to reach a solution by their conclusion on march 19 .
an escalation of violence in kosovo produces huge waves of refugees and on march 24 nato launches an aerial bombing campaign against yugoslavia to stop the bloodshed and the exodus .
after 78 days belgrade capitulates and orders its troops out of kosovo , making room for a nato-led peacekeeping mission of some 45,000 troops , but only after wrangling out a un resolution guaranteeing it sovereignty over kosovo .
the same resolution , 1244 , introduced a un administration to govern kosovo .
fearing reprisal attacks , thousands of serbs flee kosovo . 2001 - rugova named president in kosovo 's first general election . 2004 - on march 17 concerted kosovo-wide riots by albanians leave 19 dead and hundreds injured .
thousands of serbs flee their homes as hundreds of houses and dozens of churches are set on fire .
the eruption of violence was never properly explained and instigators were poorly prosecuted .
the incident was used by belgrade as an argument against kosovo 's independence . 2005 - kosovo prime minister ramush haradinaj resigns from office to face war crimes charges at the hague .
haradinaj strongly denies the charges ; the court has not issued a verdict .
the un security council agrees to talks on kosovo 's future .
former finnish president martti ahtissari is called on to mediate the talks . 2006 - in february in vienna the un launches the first direct talks on the status of kosovo between belgrade and the meanwhile fully-fledged kosovo authorities .
the vienna talks produce no result . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official declaration of independence came on feb .
17 , 2008 2007 - unable to find a negotiated solution to kosovo 's future status , ahtissari proposes supervised independence for the province .
another round of last-ditch talks , organized after russia shoots down an attempt at releasing kosovo from serbia 's sovereignty in the un , end in a deadlock by the dec .
10 deadline .
this paves the way for a unilateral declaration of independence by pristina with the support of the united states and several european union nations . 2008 - former guerrilla commander hashim thaci is elected prime minister and promises kosovo will declare independence in coordination with western governments .

17 .
ten years after belgrade crushed a rebellion in kosovo , parliamentarians proclaimed the republic of kosovo and sovereign state . the parliament in kosovo voted in favor of independence from serbia , bringing the curtain down on a long chapter in the violent break-up of yugoslavia . " from today onwards , kosovo is proud , independent and free , " said prime minister hashim thaci .
" we never lost faith in the dream that one day we would stand among the free nations of the world , and today we do . " kosovo will be a " society that respects human dignity " and be committed to dealing with the " painful legacy of the recent past , in a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness , " thaci added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the members of parliament present approved independence for kosovo all 109 deputies present at the session in the capital pristina voted in favor with a show of hands .
eleven deputies from ethnic minorities , including serbs , were absent .
the parliament also approved a new flag for the landlocked state of about 2 million people . " today , a new life begins , " the kosovo daily koha ditore wrote .
" the past should not be forgotten , but it belongs to the past , and should be forgiven . " serbia calls declaration illegal while the united states and several european union members are quickly expected to recognize the new state , serbia is infuriated by the move and has been given strong support by russia , which called on the un and nato to annul kosovo 's independence . quickly after the deceleration , moscow called for a meeting of the united nations security council to discuss kosovo .
diplomats in new york said the council would hold an emergency meeting on sunday . " the decisions by the kosovo leadership create the risk of an escalation of tension and inter-ethnic violence in the province and of new conflict in the balkans , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . serbia 's president boris tadic said his country would never recognize the independence of kosovo . " the state of serbia will take responsible moves and will do everything in its power to annul this arbitrary and illegally proclaimed the independence of kosovo , " tadic said in a statement .
" serbia will not resort to violence and that is the only approach which can enable us to continue our legitimate fight to preserve the integrity of our country . " in a televised address , serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica called kosovo a " false state " supported unlawfully by the united states , which he said was " ready to violate the international order for its own military interests . " kosovo police had to stop several hundred former serbian army reservists - veterans of the 1998-99 kosovo war - from crossing into the territory ahead of the independence declaration . eu mission welcomed in pristina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrations have already begun in kosovo earlier , thaci said he would also welcome the law-implementing mission prepared by the european union to help kosovo along its first sovereign steps .
after slovenia , croatia , macedonia , bosnia and montenegro , kosovo is the sixth nation to emerge from the former yugoslav federation since 1991 . the independence proclamation started a 120-day transition period and the deployment of some 2,000 european union police and judicial officials to aid kosovo in the transition to independence . tens of thousands of albanians , a 90 percent majority in kosovo , began celebrating in capital pristina ahead of the declaration . flags of albania , the united states and western european countries were on display and waved everywhere , as police closed the central streets to traffic , allowing only pedestrians in . some of the people carried signs calling for a " celebration with dignity . " while albanians started celebrating already saturday night , the serbs in their enclaves remained calm even if wary .
their spiritual leader , the orthodox bishop artemije , dismissed the imminent declaration of independence , but denounced violence . " we are not calling anybody to a war , " artemije said after a prayer in the serb enclave gracanica , near the kosovo capital pristina .
" kosovo will always remain serbian and we regard this so- called declaration as occupation . " serbia slams eu mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars painted thanks to germany and other nations expected to recognize it serbian infrastructure minister velimir ilic , on a visit to gracanica , blasted the eu over its support for kosovo 's independence . " it is shame and disgrace what eu is doing , helping dismember serbia , " he said , referring to eu 's upcoming mission . serbia has already suspended its already cumbersome approach to eu membership over the mission , which it has fought diplomatically as a step to kosovo 's independence , and ilic signaled more of the same . " we will never cooperate with the eu mission in kosovo , " he said . ilic was just one of more than a dozen serbian government ministers and high-ranking officials who huddled with the serbs in their enclaves . serbia on thursday passed a resolution " annulling " the declaration of independence in advance .

17 .
ten years after belgrade crushed a rebellion in kosovo , parliamentarians proclaimed the republic of kosovo and sovereign state . the parliament in kosovo voted in favor of independence from serbia , bringing the curtain down on a long chapter in the violent break-up of yugoslavia . " from today onwards , kosovo is proud , independent and free , " said prime minister hashim thaci .
" we never lost faith in the dream that one day we would stand among the free nations of the world , and today we do . " kosovo will be a " society that respects human dignity " and be committed to dealing with the " painful legacy of the recent past , in a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness , " thaci added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the members of parliament present approved independence for kosovo all 109 deputies present at the session in the capital pristina voted in favor with a show of hands .
eleven deputies from ethnic minorities , including serbs , were absent .
the parliament also approved a new flag for the landlocked state of about 2 million people . " today , a new life begins , " the kosovo daily koha ditore wrote .
" the past should not be forgotten , but it belongs to the past , and should be forgiven . " serbia calls declaration illegal while the united states and several european union members are quickly expected to recognize the new state , serbia is infuriated by the move and has been given strong support by russia , which called on the un and nato to annul kosovo 's independence . quickly after the deceleration , moscow called for a meeting of the united nations security council to discuss kosovo .
diplomats in new york said the council would hold an emergency meeting on sunday . " the decisions by the kosovo leadership create the risk of an escalation of tension and inter-ethnic violence in the province and of new conflict in the balkans , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . serbia 's president boris tadic said his country would never recognize the independence of kosovo . " the state of serbia will take responsible moves and will do everything in its power to annul this arbitrary and illegally proclaimed the independence of kosovo , " tadic said in a statement .
" serbia will not resort to violence and that is the only approach which can enable us to continue our legitimate fight to preserve the integrity of our country . " in a televised address , serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica called kosovo a " false state " supported unlawfully by the united states , which he said was " ready to violate the international order for its own military interests . " kosovo police had to stop several hundred former serbian army reservists - veterans of the 1998-99 kosovo war - from crossing into the territory ahead of the independence declaration . eu mission welcomed in pristina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrations have already begun in kosovo earlier , thaci said he would also welcome the law-implementing mission prepared by the european union to help kosovo along its first sovereign steps .
after slovenia , croatia , macedonia , bosnia and montenegro , kosovo is the sixth nation to emerge from the former yugoslav federation since 1991 . the independence proclamation started a 120-day transition period and the deployment of some 2,000 european union police and judicial officials to aid kosovo in the transition to independence . tens of thousands of albanians , a 90 percent majority in kosovo , began celebrating in capital pristina ahead of the declaration . flags of albania , the united states and western european countries were on display and waved everywhere , as police closed the central streets to traffic , allowing only pedestrians in . some of the people carried signs calling for a " celebration with dignity . " while albanians started celebrating already saturday night , the serbs in their enclaves remained calm even if wary .
their spiritual leader , the orthodox bishop artemije , dismissed the imminent declaration of independence , but denounced violence . " we are not calling anybody to a war , " artemije said after a prayer in the serb enclave gracanica , near the kosovo capital pristina .
" kosovo will always remain serbian and we regard this so- called declaration as occupation . " serbia slams eu mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars painted thanks to germany and other nations expected to recognize it serbian infrastructure minister velimir ilic , on a visit to gracanica , blasted the eu over its support for kosovo 's independence . " it is shame and disgrace what eu is doing , helping dismember serbia , " he said , referring to eu 's upcoming mission . serbia has already suspended its already cumbersome approach to eu membership over the mission , which it has fought diplomatically as a step to kosovo 's independence , and ilic signaled more of the same . " we will never cooperate with the eu mission in kosovo , " he said . ilic was just one of more than a dozen serbian government ministers and high-ranking officials who huddled with the serbs in their enclaves . serbia on thursday passed a resolution " annulling " the declaration of independence in advance .

it beat out productions from britain and hollywood for the berlin festival 's top honor . " it is a prize for brazilian film , " said padilha whose movie tells the story of a brutal police clean-up operation ahead of a 1997 visit to brazil by pope john paul ii . wearing a red berlinale scarf , padilha said winning the award would encourage him to continue to make critical films success in berlin coming against the backdrop of a renewed international recognition of latin american cinema . with no script and his actors largely improvising , padilha hoped to give his movie a documentary film , he said . the film has come under criticism for glorifying police brutality in rio de janeiro 's slums . it 's criticism that is misplaced and often coming from viewers who did n't understand the film , padilha said .

the prize is valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,337 -rrb- . makhmalbaf 's movie screened in the berlinale 's generation section , which is aimed at younger audiences , and focuses on a young afghan girl who lives in the mountains near the place where the 1,500-year- old buddha statues were blown up by the taliban in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hawkins was moved by the jury 's decision british actress sally hawkins goes home with the festival 's award for best actress for her role in british director mike leigh 's " happy go lucky " about a positive-thinking londoner called poppy . speaking after accepting the festival 's silver bear , najie said it was his destiny to come to berlin .

it beat out productions from britain and hollywood for the berlin festival 's top honor . " it is a prize for brazilian film , " said padilha whose movie tells the story of a brutal police clean-up operation ahead of a 1997 visit to brazil by pope john paul ii . wearing a red berlinale scarf , padilha said winning the award would encourage him to continue to make critical films success in berlin coming against the backdrop of a renewed international recognition of latin american cinema . with no script and his actors largely improvising , padilha hoped to give his movie a documentary film , he said . the film has come under criticism for glorifying police brutality in rio de janeiro 's slums . it 's criticism that is misplaced and often coming from viewers who did n't understand the film , padilha said . " the film aims to explain how the state turns policemen either into corrupt people ... or worst of all violent people , " the 40-year-old director told reporters .
" the huge majority of brazilians understand that .
i do n't think it 's mysterious . " costa-gavras said the jury 's decision to award the golden bear to padilha was a unanimous decision . two awards for " there will be blood " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anderson also won in berlin eight years ago with " magnolia " the berlinale 's jury grand prize went to us oscar-winning documentary filmmaker errol morris ' " standard operating procedure , " a detailed examination into the shocking events surrounding iraq 's abu ghraib prison . a total of 21 films were competing for the festival 's top honors this year with " there will be blood " from us director paul anderson winning two awards - one for best director and for one for jonny greenwood for his musical score for the film . " there will be blood , " which stars daniel day-lewis as a ruthless oilman has been nominated for eight academy awards , which are to be presented in los angeles next week . but holding the two silver bears , anderson said , " that 's enough for me . "
anderson won a golden bear for " magnolia " eight years ago . some 400 films screened now in its 58th year , the berlinale is one of the world 's top three film festivals .
saturday 's berlinale awards were handed out in a hollywood-style gala ceremony . it has also been a successful festival for iranian cinema with one of the nation 's leading actors reza najie winning the berlin film festival 's top award for best actor . he played a stressed-out father trying to keep his family financially afloat in iranian director majid majidi 's light poignant comedy " the song of sparrows " -lrb- " avaze gonjeshk-ha " -rrb- . it was also announced saturday that iranian-born director hana makhmalbaf 's " buddha collapsed out of shame " -lrb- " buda az sharm foru rikht " -rrb- had won the 23rd film peace prize .
the prize is valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,337 -rrb- . makhmalbaf 's movie screened in the berlinale 's generation section , which is aimed at younger audiences , and focuses on a young afghan girl who lives in the mountains near the place where the 1,500-year- old buddha statues were blown up by the taliban in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hawkins was moved by the jury 's decision british actress sally hawkins goes home with the festival 's award for best actress for her role in british director mike leigh 's " happy go lucky " about a positive-thinking londoner called poppy . speaking after accepting the festival 's silver bear , najie said it was his destiny to come to berlin .
" thank you berlin , thank you cinema , " he told the awards ceremony in the german capital . hawkins said she had been completely overwhelmed after receiving the prize and had burst into tears after leaving the stage . the silver bear for best script went to chinese director wang xiaoshuai 's " in love we trust " -lrb- " zuo you " -rrb- about the tensions caused by a sick child . earlier saturday , the festival announced that " lemon tree " from israeli director eran riklis won the audience prize for one of the berlinale 's main sections . riklis ' film was not included in the berlinale 's main competition but was screened in the festival 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . the 11-day berlinale screened nearly 400 pictures and attracted 20,000 accredited visitors from 125 countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 17.02.2008 eu moves to protect ageing rockers with royalties in retirement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite already being extremely wealthy , the stones will also earn more from the plan it may not be something the rolling stones have to worry about , but many rock stars face cash concerns in their old age .
the eu is therefore planning to help out retired rockers , who never made millions to live on . many musicians and singers hit the big time in their 20s , and often even earlier .
under current rules , their airplay royalties stop coming in just as they retire , hitting them particularly hard .
that 's why the european commission announced this week that under a new proposal , european musicians and singers would see the copyright on their recorded performances extended to 95 years from the current level of 50 .
the eu 's move to help ageing rockers and other artists beat the financial blues during retirement would be ready for formal adoption by the european commission in the middle of the year , the european union 's executive arm said .
" if nothing is done , thousands of european performers who recorded in the late fifties and sixties will lose all of their airplay royalties over the next 10 years , " eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy said .
presenting the proposal , mccreevy said that he had found " no convincing reason " why composers should currently enjoy much longer copyright protection than performers .
commission moves to protect performers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles aznavour wo n't go hungry in his retirement " it is the performer who gives life to the composition and while most of us have no idea who wrote our favorite song , we can usually name the performer , " mccreevy said .
" i strongly believe that copyright protection for europe 's performers represents a moral right to control the use of their work and earn a living from their performances . "
in the united states , performers already enjoy copyright protection for 95 years .
in the european union , such protection has been limited to 50 years since the introduction of a 1993 law .
mccreevy acknowledged that he was less worried about big crowd-pullers such as britain 's ageless pop star cliff richard and french crooner charles aznavour than " the thousands of anonymous session musicians who contributed to sound recordings in the late fifties and sixties .
" they will no longer get airplay royalties from their recordings but these royalties are often their sole pension , " he said .
the aepo-artis association , representing several performer organizations at the european level , welcomed that brussels had recognized " the creative gain that performers bring . "
however , " some things still need to be clarified , " said guenaelle collet at apos-artis , citing in particular a proposal that record companies would have to contribute to a special fund for session musicians .
eu to investigate private copying and rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tokio hotel can look forward to decades of royalties mccreevy also said that he wanted to reopen consultations over levies for being able to make copies of a performance on computers , digital and other music players and which vary widely among countries .
" there can be no question of calling into doubt the entitlement of rights holders to compensation for private copying , " he said .
" at the same time there is a need to look at how the levies are applied in practice . "
collet warned that " performers will be extremely cautious about the question . "
while glad that the commission was consulting the industry , veronique desbrosses , secretary general of the european grouping of societies of authors and composers , said : " there 's no viable alternative to private copying levies .

the ground crew is working to find more tasks for the astronauts . " the crew is extremely quick , " markus bauer , agency spokesman , said late saturday , feb .
16 , at the german space agency mission control center in oberpfaffenhofen near munich .
a series of experiment and systems equipment on the european-built space lab have been powered up ahead of schedule , he said , adding , " that is good .
we 'll be able to activate columbus more quickly . " the speed of the installation is keeping busy the scientists and engineers in oberpfaffenhofen , which is directing the experiments and systems on board the orbiting lab . astronauts ahead of schedule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlegel , left , helped replace a used nitrogen tank on the iss " we have to keep up and give the astronauts new tasks to carry out , " bauer said . work has proceeded so quickly that some jobs that were n't scheduled to be taken on until the atlantis space shuttle undocks from the space station have already been completed , he said . the main task of atlantis mission , which began with the shuttle 's liftoff feb .
7 , was to carry and install columbus on the space station in three spacewalks , the last of which was completed friday . though he missed his first opportunity for a spacewalk due to illness , german astronaut hans schlegel was healthy and did n't let a second opportunity slip past .
he called the spacewalk the most exciting moment in his life . hardest part is going back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlegel said the view of earth was hard to beat " the hardest part was coming back inside at the end , " he said in a press conference broadcast from space to cologne , paris and houston on saturday .
" it 's just so wonderful to enjoy the view of the earth that you do n't want to go back . " atlantis and its seven-member crew are to undock from the station monday , leaving the three-member space station crew behind .
a landing back on earth is scheduled for wednesday . the addition of the lab to the station was delayed four years by the breakup of the space shuttle columbia in 2003 as it re-entered earth 's atmosphere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 17.02.2008 eu moves to protect ageing rockers with royalties in retirement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite already being extremely wealthy , the stones will also earn more from the plan it may not be something the rolling stones have to worry about , but many rock stars face cash concerns in their old age .
the eu is therefore planning to help out retired rockers , who never made millions to live on . many musicians and singers hit the big time in their 20s , and often even earlier .
under current rules , their airplay royalties stop coming in just as they retire , hitting them particularly hard .
that 's why the european commission announced this week that under a new proposal , european musicians and singers would see the copyright on their recorded performances extended to 95 years from the current level of 50 .
the eu 's move to help ageing rockers and other artists beat the financial blues during retirement would be ready for formal adoption by the european commission in the middle of the year , the european union 's executive arm said .
" if nothing is done , thousands of european performers who recorded in the late fifties and sixties will lose all of their airplay royalties over the next 10 years , " eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy said .
presenting the proposal , mccreevy said that he had found " no convincing reason " why composers should currently enjoy much longer copyright protection than performers .
commission moves to protect performers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles aznavour wo n't go hungry in his retirement " it is the performer who gives life to the composition and while most of us have no idea who wrote our favorite song , we can usually name the performer , " mccreevy said .
" i strongly believe that copyright protection for europe 's performers represents a moral right to control the use of their work and earn a living from their performances . "
in the united states , performers already enjoy copyright protection for 95 years .
in the european union , such protection has been limited to 50 years since the introduction of a 1993 law .
mccreevy acknowledged that he was less worried about big crowd-pullers such as britain 's ageless pop star cliff richard and french crooner charles aznavour than " the thousands of anonymous session musicians who contributed to sound recordings in the late fifties and sixties .
" they will no longer get airplay royalties from their recordings but these royalties are often their sole pension , " he said .
the aepo-artis association , representing several performer organizations at the european level , welcomed that brussels had recognized " the creative gain that performers bring . "
however , " some things still need to be clarified , " said guenaelle collet at apos-artis , citing in particular a proposal that record companies would have to contribute to a special fund for session musicians .
eu to investigate private copying and rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tokio hotel can look forward to decades of royalties mccreevy also said that he wanted to reopen consultations over levies for being able to make copies of a performance on computers , digital and other music players and which vary widely among countries .
" there can be no question of calling into doubt the entitlement of rights holders to compensation for private copying , " he said .
" at the same time there is a need to look at how the levies are applied in practice . "
collet warned that " performers will be extremely cautious about the question . "
while glad that the commission was consulting the industry , veronique desbrosses , secretary general of the european grouping of societies of authors and composers , said : " there 's no viable alternative to private copying levies .

16 , by an international jury headed by renowned greek-born director costa-gavras .
it beat out productions from britain and hollywood for the berlin festival 's top honor . " it is a prize for brazilian film , " said padilha whose movie tells the story of a brutal police clean-up operation ahead of a 1997 visit to brazil by pope john paul ii . wearing a red berlinale scarf , padilha said winning the award would encourage him to continue to make critical films success in berlin coming against the backdrop of a renewed international recognition of latin american cinema . with no script and his actors largely improvising , padilha hoped to give his movie a documentary film , he said . the film has come under criticism for glorifying police brutality in rio de janeiro 's slums . it 's criticism that is misplaced and often coming from viewers who did n't understand the film , padilha said . " the film aims to explain how the state turns policemen either into corrupt people ... or worst of all violent people , " the 40-year-old director told reporters .
" the huge majority of brazilians understand that .
i do n't think it 's mysterious . " costa-gavras said the jury 's decision to award the golden bear to padilha was a unanimous decision . two awards for " there will be blood " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anderson also won in berlin eight years ago with " magnolia " the berlinale 's jury grand prize went to us oscar-winning documentary filmmaker errol morris ' " standard operating procedure , " a detailed examination into the shocking events surrounding iraq 's abu ghraib prison . a total of 21 films were competing for the festival 's top honors this year with " there will be blood " from us director paul anderson winning two awards - one for best director and for one for jonny greenwood for his musical score for the film . " there will be blood , " which stars daniel day-lewis as a ruthless oilman has been nominated for eight academy awards , which are to be presented in los angeles next week . but holding the two silver bears , anderson said , " that 's enough for me .

the eu is therefore planning to help out retired rockers , who never made millions to live on . many musicians and singers hit the big time in their 20s , and often even earlier .
under current rules , their airplay royalties stop coming in just as they retire , hitting them particularly hard .
that 's why the european commission announced this week that under a new proposal , european musicians and singers would see the copyright on their recorded performances extended to 95 years from the current level of 50 .
the eu 's move to help ageing rockers and other artists beat the financial blues during retirement would be ready for formal adoption by the european commission in the middle of the year , the european union 's executive arm said .
" if nothing is done , thousands of european performers who recorded in the late fifties and sixties will lose all of their airplay royalties over the next 10 years , " eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy said .
presenting the proposal , mccreevy said that he had found " no convincing reason " why composers should currently enjoy much longer copyright protection than performers .
commission moves to protect performers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles aznavour wo n't go hungry in his retirement " it is the performer who gives life to the composition and while most of us have no idea who wrote our favorite song , we can usually name the performer , " mccreevy said .
" i strongly believe that copyright protection for europe 's performers represents a moral right to control the use of their work and earn a living from their performances . "
in the united states , performers already enjoy copyright protection for 95 years .
in the european union , such protection has been limited to 50 years since the introduction of a 1993 law .
mccreevy acknowledged that he was less worried about big crowd-pullers such as britain 's ageless pop star cliff richard and french crooner charles aznavour than " the thousands of anonymous session musicians who contributed to sound recordings in the late fifties and sixties .
" they will no longer get airplay royalties from their recordings but these royalties are often their sole pension , " he said .
the aepo-artis association , representing several performer organizations at the european level , welcomed that brussels had recognized " the creative gain that performers bring . "
however , " some things still need to be clarified , " said guenaelle collet at apos-artis , citing in particular a proposal that record companies would have to contribute to a special fund for session musicians .
eu to investigate private copying and rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tokio hotel can look forward to decades of royalties mccreevy also said that he wanted to reopen consultations over levies for being able to make copies of a performance on computers , digital and other music players and which vary widely among countries .
" there can be no question of calling into doubt the entitlement of rights holders to compensation for private copying , " he said .
" at the same time there is a need to look at how the levies are applied in practice . "
collet warned that " performers will be extremely cautious about the question . "

some leaders want the un to rule on kosovo 's status . while britain , france , germany and italy , along with the united states , were expected to recognize kosovo 's independence from serbia , several other eu nations have said they will not be sending ambassadors to pristina soon . great britain said it regarded kosovo 's declaration of independence on sunday , feb .
17 , as " an important development , " but it will wait until a meeting of eu foreign ministers on monday to make a formal statement , a foreign office spokeswoman said . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called on " all parties " to exercise moderation .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said he wished kosovo " good luck " following its vote for independence . russia strongly opposed to independence while thousands of kosovars danced in the streets of pristina waving us , british , french , german , italian flags in tribute to countries that supported the break kosovo made from serbia . bildunterschrift : not everyone in the eu received a thank you from kosovars on sunday " this is the happiest day ever in my life .
i 'm proud of our nation , which should be thankful eternally to the us , and to the eu too , " gazmend halimi , 22 , told the dpa news agency . but not all the eu is behind kosovo 's decision . cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain oppose recognizing kosovo .
others , including malta and portugal , want kosovo 's future be decided at the un security council .
with veto-wielding russia opposed to kosovo 's independence , there is no chance of a un security council resolution formalizing the pristina parliament 's decision . some eu members - as well as russia - see kosovo as potentially setting a dangerous precedent for other separatist movements , despite reassurances from brussels that kosovo is a unique case . cyprus is already split , and spain has long been confronted with basque and catalan nationalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the eu worry kosovars may embolden separatists in their own countries " we do not support a unilateral declaration of independence , " spain 's deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega said on local radio saturday .
" we think that ... it should have been in agreement with the various parties , which is not the case , or in line with international standards , that is to say with a -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution . " common stance elusive eu foreign ministers are expected to show as much unity as possible during a meeting on monday . an official with the eu 's presidency , currently held by slovenia , told the afp news agency that eu foreign ministers will want to " take note " of the changes in kosovo , but even this simple task is proving difficult to put to paper in the form of a declaration . " what 's important is the confirmation of the goal the eu has : that kosovo has a democratic , stable and multi-ethnic future and that this is all based on a european perspective , " the eu diplomat said . scores of joyous kosovo emigrants from belgium , the netherlands and germany , gathered outside european institutions in brussels sunday in advance of the announcement . " we have waited over 100 years for this and we are more than ready to become an independent state , above all a democratic state " writer-activist halit elshani , who fled kosovo in 1999 , told afp . eu mission to ease transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to help create a democratic and multi-ethnic kosovo kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , after nato bombed belgrade to end a bloody crackdown on albanian separatists , but the province has officially remained part of serbia . belgrade remains implacably opposed to losing the region which it considers the cradle of its serbian culture . the european union has already taken one major step towards easing kosovo 's independence by launching a police and justice mission . the 2,000-strong mission will be fully operational after a 120-day transition period , and aims to train and mentor police , judges and customs officials . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nine years after they again lost control over kosovo in war , serbs are now also losing even the formal hold over it . serbs first lost kosovo when their declining empire suffered a huge defeat to ottoman turks in a 1389 battle .
they waited five centuries , until 1912 to return the land to serbian rule . here are some of the key dates in kosovo 's history : 1945 - kosovo becomes a province of serbia , the largest republic of the new , communist yugoslav federation . 1975 - with yugoslavia 's new constitution , kosovo acquires wide-ranging autonomy and a self-governing authority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic said serbia would never give up control of kosovo 1989 - with slobodan milosevic rising to power on a surge of national awakening in serbia , belgrade scraps the autonomy of the increasingly restive kosovo . 1990 - on july 2 , legislators of the dissolved provincial parliament declare independence from serbia , an act which the international community ignores .
belgrade then dissolves kosovo 's autonomous assembly . 1998 - after five year of non-violent resistance through parallel institutions under the guidance of the moderate ibrahim rugova , the extremists among kosovo albanians take the initiative .
the separatist guerrilla kosovo liberation army uck launches attacks on police , military and serb civilians .
milosevic 's security apparatus cracks down on the rebels with massive force , effectively starting a war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato stationed thousands of troops in kosovo after the bombing campaign 1999 - talks between albanian leaders and belgrade - mediated in rambouillet , near paris by the contact group of big powers - fail to reach a solution by their conclusion on march 19 .
an escalation of violence in kosovo produces huge waves of refugees and on march 24 nato launches an aerial bombing campaign against yugoslavia to stop the bloodshed and the exodus .
after 78 days belgrade capitulates and orders its troops out of kosovo , making room for a nato-led peacekeeping mission of some 45,000 troops , but only after wrangling out a un resolution guaranteeing it sovereignty over kosovo .
the same resolution , 1244 , introduced a un administration to govern kosovo .
fearing reprisal attacks , thousands of serbs flee kosovo . 2001 - rugova named president in kosovo 's first general election . 2004 - on march 17 concerted kosovo-wide riots by albanians leave 19 dead and hundreds injured .
thousands of serbs flee their homes as hundreds of houses and dozens of churches are set on fire .
the eruption of violence was never properly explained and instigators were poorly prosecuted .
the incident was used by belgrade as an argument against kosovo 's independence . 2005 - kosovo prime minister ramush haradinaj resigns from office to face war crimes charges at the hague .
haradinaj strongly denies the charges ; the court has not issued a verdict .
the un security council agrees to talks on kosovo 's future .
former finnish president martti ahtissari is called on to mediate the talks . 2006 - in february in vienna the un launches the first direct talks on the status of kosovo between belgrade and the meanwhile fully-fledged kosovo authorities .
the vienna talks produce no result . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official declaration of independence came on feb .
17 , 2008 2007 - unable to find a negotiated solution to kosovo 's future status , ahtissari proposes supervised independence for the province .
another round of last-ditch talks , organized after russia shoots down an attempt at releasing kosovo from serbia 's sovereignty in the un , end in a deadlock by the dec .
10 deadline .
this paves the way for a unilateral declaration of independence by pristina with the support of the united states and several european union nations . 2008 - former guerrilla commander hashim thaci is elected prime minister and promises kosovo will declare independence in coordination with western governments .

ten years after belgrade crushed a rebellion in kosovo , parliamentarians proclaimed the republic of kosovo and sovereign state . the parliament in kosovo voted in favor of independence from serbia , bringing the curtain down on a long chapter in the violent break-up of yugoslavia . " from today onwards , kosovo is proud , independent and free , " said prime minister hashim thaci .
" we never lost faith in the dream that one day we would stand among the free nations of the world , and today we do . " kosovo will be a " society that respects human dignity " and be committed to dealing with the " painful legacy of the recent past , in a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness , " thaci added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the members of parliament present approved independence for kosovo all 109 deputies present at the session in the capital pristina voted in favor with a show of hands .
eleven deputies from ethnic minorities , including serbs , were absent .
the parliament also approved a new flag for the landlocked state of about 2 million people . " today , a new life begins , " the kosovo daily koha ditore wrote .
" the past should not be forgotten , but it belongs to the past , and should be forgiven . " serbia calls declaration illegal while the united states and several european union members are quickly expected to recognize the new state , serbia is infuriated by the move and has been given strong support by russia , which called on the un and nato to annul kosovo 's independence . quickly after the deceleration , moscow called for a meeting of the united nations security council to discuss kosovo .

" the decisions by the kosovo leadership create the risk of an escalation of tension and inter-ethnic violence in the province and of new conflict in the balkans , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . serbia 's president boris tadic said his country would never recognize the independence of kosovo . " the state of serbia will take responsible moves and will do everything in its power to annul this arbitrary and illegally proclaimed the independence of kosovo , " tadic said in a statement .
" serbia will not resort to violence and that is the only approach which can enable us to continue our legitimate fight to preserve the integrity of our country . " in a televised address , serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica called kosovo a " false state " supported unlawfully by the united states , which he said was " ready to violate the international order for its own military interests .

after slovenia , croatia , macedonia , bosnia and montenegro , kosovo is the sixth nation to emerge from the former yugoslav federation since 1991 . the independence proclamation started a 120-day transition period and the deployment of some 2,000 european union police and judicial officials to aid kosovo in the transition to independence . tens of thousands of albanians , a 90 percent majority in kosovo , began celebrating in capital pristina ahead of the declaration . flags of albania , the united states and western european countries were on display and waved everywhere , as police closed the central streets to traffic , allowing only pedestrians in . some of the people carried signs calling for a " celebration with dignity . " while albanians started celebrating already saturday night , the serbs in their enclaves remained calm even if wary .
their spiritual leader , the orthodox bishop artemije , dismissed the imminent declaration of independence , but denounced violence . " we are not calling anybody to a war , " artemije said after a prayer in the serb enclave gracanica , near the kosovo capital pristina .

17 .
ten years after belgrade crushed a rebellion in kosovo , parliamentarians proclaimed the republic of kosovo and sovereign state . the parliament in kosovo voted in favor of independence from serbia , bringing the curtain down on a long chapter in the violent break-up of yugoslavia . " from today onwards , kosovo is proud , independent and free , " said prime minister hashim thaci .
" we never lost faith in the dream that one day we would stand among the free nations of the world , and today we do . " kosovo will be a " society that respects human dignity " and be committed to dealing with the " painful legacy of the recent past , in a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness , " thaci added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the members of parliament present approved independence for kosovo all 109 deputies present at the session in the capital pristina voted in favor with a show of hands .
eleven deputies from ethnic minorities , including serbs , were absent .
the parliament also approved a new flag for the landlocked state of about 2 million people . " today , a new life begins , " the kosovo daily koha ditore wrote .
" the past should not be forgotten , but it belongs to the past , and should be forgiven . " serbia calls declaration illegal while the united states and several european union members are quickly expected to recognize the new state , serbia is infuriated by the move and has been given strong support by russia , which called on the un and nato to annul kosovo 's independence . quickly after the deceleration , moscow called for a meeting of the united nations security council to discuss kosovo .
diplomats in new york said the council would hold an emergency meeting on sunday . " the decisions by the kosovo leadership create the risk of an escalation of tension and inter-ethnic violence in the province and of new conflict in the balkans , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . serbia 's president boris tadic said his country would never recognize the independence of kosovo . " the state of serbia will take responsible moves and will do everything in its power to annul this arbitrary and illegally proclaimed the independence of kosovo , " tadic said in a statement .
" serbia will not resort to violence and that is the only approach which can enable us to continue our legitimate fight to preserve the integrity of our country . " in a televised address , serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica called kosovo a " false state " supported unlawfully by the united states , which he said was " ready to violate the international order for its own military interests . " kosovo police had to stop several hundred former serbian army reservists - veterans of the 1998-99 kosovo war - from crossing into the territory ahead of the independence declaration . eu mission welcomed in pristina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrations have already begun in kosovo earlier , thaci said he would also welcome the law-implementing mission prepared by the european union to help kosovo along its first sovereign steps .
after slovenia , croatia , macedonia , bosnia and montenegro , kosovo is the sixth nation to emerge from the former yugoslav federation since 1991 . the independence proclamation started a 120-day transition period and the deployment of some 2,000 european union police and judicial officials to aid kosovo in the transition to independence . tens of thousands of albanians , a 90 percent majority in kosovo , began celebrating in capital pristina ahead of the declaration . flags of albania , the united states and western european countries were on display and waved everywhere , as police closed the central streets to traffic , allowing only pedestrians in . some of the people carried signs calling for a " celebration with dignity . " while albanians started celebrating already saturday night , the serbs in their enclaves remained calm even if wary .
their spiritual leader , the orthodox bishop artemije , dismissed the imminent declaration of independence , but denounced violence . " we are not calling anybody to a war , " artemije said after a prayer in the serb enclave gracanica , near the kosovo capital pristina .
" kosovo will always remain serbian and we regard this so- called declaration as occupation . " serbia slams eu mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars painted thanks to germany and other nations expected to recognize it serbian infrastructure minister velimir ilic , on a visit to gracanica , blasted the eu over its support for kosovo 's independence . " it is shame and disgrace what eu is doing , helping dismember serbia , " he said , referring to eu 's upcoming mission . serbia has already suspended its already cumbersome approach to eu membership over the mission , which it has fought diplomatically as a step to kosovo 's independence , and ilic signaled more of the same . " we will never cooperate with the eu mission in kosovo , " he said . ilic was just one of more than a dozen serbian government ministers and high-ranking officials who huddled with the serbs in their enclaves . serbia on thursday passed a resolution " annulling " the declaration of independence in advance .

the finance committee in the german parliament recently met with experts to discuss the role of the rating agencies in the crisis . the agencies have been aware of the need for change for a long time , said rating expert oliver everling , who 'd spoken with the committee .

europe is paying more attention to both the potential and the problems of africa .
deutsche welle spoke with german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about two nations with troubled pasts : uganda and rwanda . german president horst koehler and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have both recently returned from trips to africa , where they pledged their support to the continent . deutsche welle asked german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about the situation in uganda and rwanda in particular . deutsche welle : horst koehler recently made his fifth trip to africa as germany 's president .
what were your impressions ? georg boomgaarden : in uganda and rwanda , the president visited two nations that suffered for years of civil war and are still influenced by the traumas resulting from internal strife .
so the trip was overshadowed by the past and the search for ways for these countries to find reconciliation and peace .
i think it was a very political trip . reconciliation is considered a precondition for peace and development .
are uganda and rwanda examples of that ? i think it 's too early to say .
we spoke with representatives of the president and the civilian population , and we again saw how difficult the process is .
it 's just beginning in uganda , and only time will tell whether it 's a success . by african standards , rwanda has seen fairly good economic development .
there 's a respectable amount of growth .
but the shadows of the past are still there .
together with president koehler we visited a so-called gachacha court , a traditional body that tries to combine legal justice and reconciliation .
that 's one possible path .
on the other hand , there is the international rwanda tribunal , which is looking at the 60 worst cases .
i think it will definitely take a generation or more before the wounds will heal .
the point now is to just co-exist in peace . traditional forms of justice sometimes have more to do with dealing with trauma than reaching legal decisions .
to what extent can international law be hooked up with local tradition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boomgaarden , right , is deputy to foreign minister steinmeier i think we 've been searching very intensively over the past few decades for ways of doing this .
the cases were all very different , and the earliest was perhaps the franco era in spain .
in bosnia and kosovo we also had cases where one part of a country 's population attacked another one .
and we 've seen similar things in various african and latin american countries . justice alone is n't sufficient to deal with the past .
on the one hand , it 's important to take away from those who rape women , kill children , burn down homes and commit acts of murder the sense of security that says there 's always an amnesty , and no one will be punished .
on the other hand , the desire for peace is enormous , as we just saw in uganda , so that there 's a tendency to sweep everything under the rug in the interests of harmony .
they say : if justice leads to a continuation of war , then we do n't want justice .
ultimately it 's an insoluble dilemma .
it 's always a political decision when it 's time for one approach or when it 's time for the other . the international community has a responsibility to prevent violations of human rights .
yet , in many cases , we have a hard time living up to this duty .
in rwanda , for example , the international community allowed genocide to go on for more than 100 days .
why ca n't we react more quickly ? one problem is that we germans represent 80 million people out of a total of 7.5 billion .
it would be a bit arrogant to think that we germans could force the rest of the world onto the path to virtue .
but that does n't change what you were saying .
in rwanda , the international community failed in a very scandalous way .
the only thing comparable , and that on a much smaller scale , was our failure in srebrenica , and both gave us lots to think about .
it gave rise to the idea that in such extreme and clear cases the international community has to feel responsible politically and intervene .
if a million people are being massacred , it 's no longer one nation 's internal affair .
on the other hand , in every individual case , we have to look at what we can do and whether we have the right instruments for it .
in the case of rwanda , the un should never have withdrawn .
it should have intervened .
that is absolutely clear .
but it 's another question whether the un can simultaneously intervene in all the conflicts going on in the world without over-stretching itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uganda is another african nation with which germany wants closer ties as you mentioned , rwanda 's president paul kagame has pursued an ambitious program of development .
but is not the other side of the coin a relatively authoritarian stance toward domestic politics , and especially toward the media ? in the end , the people in the countries themselves have to decide .
in rwanda , i had the feeling when we talked not to the government , but to journalists and people on the margins of power , that they thought more freedom for the press would be a good idea .
on the other hand , the same people said : " do n't forget that the press played a huge role in the genocide . "
back then radio stations broadcast messages like : " kill your neighbors .
there are people from other ethnic groups .
massacre them , chop off their heads . "
and if this is the role of the press , then i understand why fears persist . germany has been very present in africa and is increasing its activities there .
why is that ? you only need to look at the map .
africa is a huge continent with gigantic problems and a population of 900 million people .
if things are n't going well , and africa ca n't cope with its own problems , they hardly have a choice but to solve them by exporting them to us .
the problem of illegal migrants actually brought us closer to africa .
another thing is that we are encountering more and more nations in africa with a healthy sense of self-confidence .
they 're increasingly following their own policies , and in the future we 'll be increasingly connected to them by the need for natural resources and other interests . in terms of development , we 've been active for a long time in africa .
but in 2008 we 're beginning a special program .
we 'll be opening new goethe institutes in dar es salaam and luanda , that is in tanzania and angola .
and the goethe institute will also be represented in rwanda in the form of a field office of the goethe institute in nairobi .
that signals that we 're looking for more dialogue with africa .
we hope that with cultural exchanges of this kind we 'll be better able to master crises by talking to one another . interview : ute schaeffer -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europe is paying more attention to both the potential and the problems of africa .
deutsche welle spoke with german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about two nations with troubled pasts : uganda and rwanda . german president horst koehler and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have both recently returned from trips to africa , where they pledged their support to the continent . deutsche welle asked german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about the situation in uganda and rwanda in particular . deutsche welle : horst koehler recently made his fifth trip to africa as germany 's president .
what were your impressions ? georg boomgaarden : in uganda and rwanda , the president visited two nations that suffered for years of civil war and are still influenced by the traumas resulting from internal strife .
so the trip was overshadowed by the past and the search for ways for these countries to find reconciliation and peace .
i think it was a very political trip . reconciliation is considered a precondition for peace and development .
are uganda and rwanda examples of that ? i think it 's too early to say .
we spoke with representatives of the president and the civilian population , and we again saw how difficult the process is .
it 's just beginning in uganda , and only time will tell whether it 's a success . by african standards , rwanda has seen fairly good economic development .
there 's a respectable amount of growth .
but the shadows of the past are still there .
together with president koehler we visited a so-called gachacha court , a traditional body that tries to combine legal justice and reconciliation .
that 's one possible path .
on the other hand , there is the international rwanda tribunal , which is looking at the 60 worst cases .
i think it will definitely take a generation or more before the wounds will heal .
the point now is to just co-exist in peace . traditional forms of justice sometimes have more to do with dealing with trauma than reaching legal decisions .
to what extent can international law be hooked up with local tradition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boomgaarden , right , is deputy to foreign minister steinmeier i think we 've been searching very intensively over the past few decades for ways of doing this .
the cases were all very different , and the earliest was perhaps the franco era in spain .
in bosnia and kosovo we also had cases where one part of a country 's population attacked another one .
and we 've seen similar things in various african and latin american countries . justice alone is n't sufficient to deal with the past .
on the one hand , it 's important to take away from those who rape women , kill children , burn down homes and commit acts of murder the sense of security that says there 's always an amnesty , and no one will be punished .
on the other hand , the desire for peace is enormous , as we just saw in uganda , so that there 's a tendency to sweep everything under the rug in the interests of harmony .
they say : if justice leads to a continuation of war , then we do n't want justice .
ultimately it 's an insoluble dilemma .
it 's always a political decision when it 's time for one approach or when it 's time for the other . the international community has a responsibility to prevent violations of human rights .
yet , in many cases , we have a hard time living up to this duty .
in rwanda , for example , the international community allowed genocide to go on for more than 100 days .
why ca n't we react more quickly ? one problem is that we germans represent 80 million people out of a total of 7.5 billion .
it would be a bit arrogant to think that we germans could force the rest of the world onto the path to virtue .
but that does n't change what you were saying .
in rwanda , the international community failed in a very scandalous way .
the only thing comparable , and that on a much smaller scale , was our failure in srebrenica , and both gave us lots to think about .
it gave rise to the idea that in such extreme and clear cases the international community has to feel responsible politically and intervene .
if a million people are being massacred , it 's no longer one nation 's internal affair .
on the other hand , in every individual case , we have to look at what we can do and whether we have the right instruments for it .
in the case of rwanda , the un should never have withdrawn .
it should have intervened .
that is absolutely clear .
but it 's another question whether the un can simultaneously intervene in all the conflicts going on in the world without over-stretching itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uganda is another african nation with which germany wants closer ties as you mentioned , rwanda 's president paul kagame has pursued an ambitious program of development .
but is not the other side of the coin a relatively authoritarian stance toward domestic politics , and especially toward the media ? in the end , the people in the countries themselves have to decide .
in rwanda , i had the feeling when we talked not to the government , but to journalists and people on the margins of power , that they thought more freedom for the press would be a good idea .
on the other hand , the same people said : " do n't forget that the press played a huge role in the genocide . "
back then radio stations broadcast messages like : " kill your neighbors .
there are people from other ethnic groups .
massacre them , chop off their heads . "
and if this is the role of the press , then i understand why fears persist . germany has been very present in africa and is increasing its activities there .
why is that ? you only need to look at the map .
africa is a huge continent with gigantic problems and a population of 900 million people .
if things are n't going well , and africa ca n't cope with its own problems , they hardly have a choice but to solve them by exporting them to us .
the problem of illegal migrants actually brought us closer to africa .
another thing is that we are encountering more and more nations in africa with a healthy sense of self-confidence .
they 're increasingly following their own policies , and in the future we 'll be increasingly connected to them by the need for natural resources and other interests . in terms of development , we 've been active for a long time in africa .
but in 2008 we 're beginning a special program .
we 'll be opening new goethe institutes in dar es salaam and luanda , that is in tanzania and angola .
and the goethe institute will also be represented in rwanda in the form of a field office of the goethe institute in nairobi .
that signals that we 're looking for more dialogue with africa .
we hope that with cultural exchanges of this kind we 'll be better able to master crises by talking to one another . interview : ute schaeffer -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 17.02.2008 german experts : rating agencies take blame for subprime crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the early warning system malfunctioned the major rating agencies are desperately trying to repair their tattered image .
experts say they share responsibility for the financial crisis as calls for political consequences are getting louder . until the outbreak of the subprime crisis , sector giants like standard & poor 's and moody 's in the us had enjoyed an aura of expertise and incorruptibility .
half a year later , they 're on the defensive .
the finance committee in the german parliament recently met with experts to discuss the role of the rating agencies in the crisis . the agencies have been aware of the need for change for a long time , said rating expert oliver everling , who 'd spoken with the committee .
he added that " the agencies definitely do n't bear responsibility alone for the subprime crisis . " failure of early warning system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aaa rating was n't always legitimate indeed , the agencies have tried to take other market participants to task .
everling said that banks bore a greater share of the blame for investing in risky products whose complexity they did n't understand , such as collateralized debt obligations -lrb- cdos -rrb- . even after the shaky bonds had lost their value and experts had warned that the us mortgage market was about to burst , the rating agencies were still granting mortgage derivatives the highest score of aaa .
it was n't until june 2007 that the ratings dropped , leaving the agencies scrambling to defend their role as the " early warning system . " furthermore , the rating agencies have had to refute accusations of corruption and conflict of interest .
according to critics , the credit monitors not only evaluated complex financial products but also advised the issuers who wanted to sell them . consulting claims undermine transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us crisis had ramifications across the world moody 's has rebuffed claims that it had been involved in consulting , but said it 's possible that " analytical discussions " took place with issuers or their advisors . " the line between dialogue and consultation is fluid , " everling said . the rating expert warned against hastily slapping regulations on the industry .
the consequence of the agencies ' mistakes should be more and not less rating - with greater competition , he said .
after all , standard & poor 's and moody 's dominate the global market with an 80 percent share , making them practically immune to national politics . instead , politicians around the world have to convince standard & poor 's and moody 's to participate in regulation negotiations , said everling - at the very least to improve their reputation for transparency . it 's not always clear where their ratings actually come from , say critics .
german chancellor angela merkel said last year during the financial turbulence that " nothing should be pulled out of a black box that no one understands . " caution rises as confidence lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the chaos have been spared ?
wuerzburg economist ekkehard wenger said he doubts that pressure from politicians can bring transparency back to the industry . " as long as the rating agencies are paid by those that sell the papers , not much will change , " wenger said . at the very least , however , the sector already seems to have lost the blind trust it once enjoyed . " the confidence of the market in credit ratings has suffered under the current situation , " conceded the fitch rating agency recently . as a result , banks and investors will have to take a closer look at who they entrust their money with , said franz waas , head of dekabank . " traditional credit analysis will become more significant again , " he said .

europe is paying more attention to both the potential and the problems of africa .
deutsche welle spoke with german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about two nations with troubled pasts : uganda and rwanda . german president horst koehler and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have both recently returned from trips to africa , where they pledged their support to the continent . deutsche welle asked german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about the situation in uganda and rwanda in particular . deutsche welle : horst koehler recently made his fifth trip to africa as germany 's president .
what were your impressions ? georg boomgaarden : in uganda and rwanda , the president visited two nations that suffered for years of civil war and are still influenced by the traumas resulting from internal strife .
so the trip was overshadowed by the past and the search for ways for these countries to find reconciliation and peace .
i think it was a very political trip . reconciliation is considered a precondition for peace and development .
are uganda and rwanda examples of that ? i think it 's too early to say .
we spoke with representatives of the president and the civilian population , and we again saw how difficult the process is .
it 's just beginning in uganda , and only time will tell whether it 's a success . by african standards , rwanda has seen fairly good economic development .
there 's a respectable amount of growth .
but the shadows of the past are still there .
together with president koehler we visited a so-called gachacha court , a traditional body that tries to combine legal justice and reconciliation .
that 's one possible path .
on the other hand , there is the international rwanda tribunal , which is looking at the 60 worst cases .
i think it will definitely take a generation or more before the wounds will heal .
the point now is to just co-exist in peace . traditional forms of justice sometimes have more to do with dealing with trauma than reaching legal decisions .
to what extent can international law be hooked up with local tradition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boomgaarden , right , is deputy to foreign minister steinmeier i think we 've been searching very intensively over the past few decades for ways of doing this .
the cases were all very different , and the earliest was perhaps the franco era in spain .
in bosnia and kosovo we also had cases where one part of a country 's population attacked another one .
and we 've seen similar things in various african and latin american countries . justice alone is n't sufficient to deal with the past .
on the one hand , it 's important to take away from those who rape women , kill children , burn down homes and commit acts of murder the sense of security that says there 's always an amnesty , and no one will be punished .
on the other hand , the desire for peace is enormous , as we just saw in uganda , so that there 's a tendency to sweep everything under the rug in the interests of harmony .
they say : if justice leads to a continuation of war , then we do n't want justice .
ultimately it 's an insoluble dilemma .
it 's always a political decision when it 's time for one approach or when it 's time for the other . the international community has a responsibility to prevent violations of human rights .
yet , in many cases , we have a hard time living up to this duty .
in rwanda , for example , the international community allowed genocide to go on for more than 100 days .
why ca n't we react more quickly ? one problem is that we germans represent 80 million people out of a total of 7.5 billion .
it would be a bit arrogant to think that we germans could force the rest of the world onto the path to virtue .
but that does n't change what you were saying .
in rwanda , the international community failed in a very scandalous way .
the only thing comparable , and that on a much smaller scale , was our failure in srebrenica , and both gave us lots to think about .
it gave rise to the idea that in such extreme and clear cases the international community has to feel responsible politically and intervene .
if a million people are being massacred , it 's no longer one nation 's internal affair .
on the other hand , in every individual case , we have to look at what we can do and whether we have the right instruments for it .
in the case of rwanda , the un should never have withdrawn .
it should have intervened .
that is absolutely clear .
but it 's another question whether the un can simultaneously intervene in all the conflicts going on in the world without over-stretching itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uganda is another african nation with which germany wants closer ties as you mentioned , rwanda 's president paul kagame has pursued an ambitious program of development .
but is not the other side of the coin a relatively authoritarian stance toward domestic politics , and especially toward the media ? in the end , the people in the countries themselves have to decide .
in rwanda , i had the feeling when we talked not to the government , but to journalists and people on the margins of power , that they thought more freedom for the press would be a good idea .
on the other hand , the same people said : " do n't forget that the press played a huge role in the genocide . "
back then radio stations broadcast messages like : " kill your neighbors .
there are people from other ethnic groups .
massacre them , chop off their heads . "
and if this is the role of the press , then i understand why fears persist . germany has been very present in africa and is increasing its activities there .

europe is paying more attention to both the potential and the problems of africa .
deutsche welle spoke with german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about two nations with troubled pasts : uganda and rwanda . german president horst koehler and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have both recently returned from trips to africa , where they pledged their support to the continent . deutsche welle asked german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about the situation in uganda and rwanda in particular . deutsche welle : horst koehler recently made his fifth trip to africa as germany 's president .
what were your impressions ? georg boomgaarden : in uganda and rwanda , the president visited two nations that suffered for years of civil war and are still influenced by the traumas resulting from internal strife .
so the trip was overshadowed by the past and the search for ways for these countries to find reconciliation and peace .
i think it was a very political trip . reconciliation is considered a precondition for peace and development .
are uganda and rwanda examples of that ? i think it 's too early to say .
we spoke with representatives of the president and the civilian population , and we again saw how difficult the process is .
it 's just beginning in uganda , and only time will tell whether it 's a success . by african standards , rwanda has seen fairly good economic development .
there 's a respectable amount of growth .
but the shadows of the past are still there .
together with president koehler we visited a so-called gachacha court , a traditional body that tries to combine legal justice and reconciliation .
that 's one possible path .
on the other hand , there is the international rwanda tribunal , which is looking at the 60 worst cases .
i think it will definitely take a generation or more before the wounds will heal .
the point now is to just co-exist in peace . traditional forms of justice sometimes have more to do with dealing with trauma than reaching legal decisions .
to what extent can international law be hooked up with local tradition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boomgaarden , right , is deputy to foreign minister steinmeier i think we 've been searching very intensively over the past few decades for ways of doing this .
the cases were all very different , and the earliest was perhaps the franco era in spain .
in bosnia and kosovo we also had cases where one part of a country 's population attacked another one .
and we 've seen similar things in various african and latin american countries . justice alone is n't sufficient to deal with the past .
on the one hand , it 's important to take away from those who rape women , kill children , burn down homes and commit acts of murder the sense of security that says there 's always an amnesty , and no one will be punished .
on the other hand , the desire for peace is enormous , as we just saw in uganda , so that there 's a tendency to sweep everything under the rug in the interests of harmony .
they say : if justice leads to a continuation of war , then we do n't want justice .
ultimately it 's an insoluble dilemma .
it 's always a political decision when it 's time for one approach or when it 's time for the other . the international community has a responsibility to prevent violations of human rights .
yet , in many cases , we have a hard time living up to this duty .
in rwanda , for example , the international community allowed genocide to go on for more than 100 days .
why ca n't we react more quickly ? one problem is that we germans represent 80 million people out of a total of 7.5 billion .
it would be a bit arrogant to think that we germans could force the rest of the world onto the path to virtue .
but that does n't change what you were saying .
in rwanda , the international community failed in a very scandalous way .
the only thing comparable , and that on a much smaller scale , was our failure in srebrenica , and both gave us lots to think about .
it gave rise to the idea that in such extreme and clear cases the international community has to feel responsible politically and intervene .
if a million people are being massacred , it 's no longer one nation 's internal affair .
on the other hand , in every individual case , we have to look at what we can do and whether we have the right instruments for it .
in the case of rwanda , the un should never have withdrawn .
it should have intervened .
that is absolutely clear .
but it 's another question whether the un can simultaneously intervene in all the conflicts going on in the world without over-stretching itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uganda is another african nation with which germany wants closer ties as you mentioned , rwanda 's president paul kagame has pursued an ambitious program of development .
but is not the other side of the coin a relatively authoritarian stance toward domestic politics , and especially toward the media ? in the end , the people in the countries themselves have to decide .
in rwanda , i had the feeling when we talked not to the government , but to journalists and people on the margins of power , that they thought more freedom for the press would be a good idea .
on the other hand , the same people said : " do n't forget that the press played a huge role in the genocide . "
back then radio stations broadcast messages like : " kill your neighbors .
there are people from other ethnic groups .
massacre them , chop off their heads . "
and if this is the role of the press , then i understand why fears persist . germany has been very present in africa and is increasing its activities there .
why is that ? you only need to look at the map .
africa is a huge continent with gigantic problems and a population of 900 million people .
if things are n't going well , and africa ca n't cope with its own problems , they hardly have a choice but to solve them by exporting them to us .
the problem of illegal migrants actually brought us closer to africa .
another thing is that we are encountering more and more nations in africa with a healthy sense of self-confidence .
they 're increasingly following their own policies , and in the future we 'll be increasingly connected to them by the need for natural resources and other interests . in terms of development , we 've been active for a long time in africa .
but in 2008 we 're beginning a special program .
we 'll be opening new goethe institutes in dar es salaam and luanda , that is in tanzania and angola .
and the goethe institute will also be represented in rwanda in the form of a field office of the goethe institute in nairobi .
that signals that we 're looking for more dialogue with africa .
we hope that with cultural exchanges of this kind we 'll be better able to master crises by talking to one another . interview : ute schaeffer -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 .
ten years after belgrade crushed a rebellion in kosovo , parliamentarians proclaimed the republic of kosovo and sovereign state . the parliament in kosovo voted in favor of independence from serbia , bringing the curtain down on a long chapter in the violent break-up of yugoslavia . " from today onwards , kosovo is proud , independent and free , " said prime minister hashim thaci .
" we never lost faith in the dream that one day we would stand among the free nations of the world , and today we do . " kosovo will be a " society that respects human dignity " and be committed to dealing with the " painful legacy of the recent past , in a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness , " thaci added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the members of parliament present approved independence for kosovo all 109 deputies present at the session in the capital pristina voted in favor with a show of hands .
eleven deputies from ethnic minorities , including serbs , were absent .
the parliament also approved a new flag for the landlocked state of about 2 million people . " today , a new life begins , " the kosovo daily koha ditore wrote .
" the past should not be forgotten , but it belongs to the past , and should be forgiven . " serbia calls declaration illegal while the united states and several european union members are quickly expected to recognize the new state , serbia is infuriated by the move and has been given strong support by russia , which called on the un and nato to annul kosovo 's independence . quickly after the deceleration , moscow called for a meeting of the united nations security council to discuss kosovo .
diplomats in new york said the council would hold an emergency meeting on sunday . " the decisions by the kosovo leadership create the risk of an escalation of tension and inter-ethnic violence in the province and of new conflict in the balkans , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . serbia 's president boris tadic said his country would never recognize the independence of kosovo . " the state of serbia will take responsible moves and will do everything in its power to annul this arbitrary and illegally proclaimed the independence of kosovo , " tadic said in a statement .
" serbia will not resort to violence and that is the only approach which can enable us to continue our legitimate fight to preserve the integrity of our country . " in a televised address , serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica called kosovo a " false state " supported unlawfully by the united states , which he said was " ready to violate the international order for its own military interests . " kosovo police had to stop several hundred former serbian army reservists - veterans of the 1998-99 kosovo war - from crossing into the territory ahead of the independence declaration . eu mission welcomed in pristina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrations have already begun in kosovo earlier , thaci said he would also welcome the law-implementing mission prepared by the european union to help kosovo along its first sovereign steps .
after slovenia , croatia , macedonia , bosnia and montenegro , kosovo is the sixth nation to emerge from the former yugoslav federation since 1991 . the independence proclamation started a 120-day transition period and the deployment of some 2,000 european union police and judicial officials to aid kosovo in the transition to independence . tens of thousands of albanians , a 90 percent majority in kosovo , began celebrating in capital pristina ahead of the declaration . flags of albania , the united states and western european countries were on display and waved everywhere , as police closed the central streets to traffic , allowing only pedestrians in . some of the people carried signs calling for a " celebration with dignity . " while albanians started celebrating already saturday night , the serbs in their enclaves remained calm even if wary .
their spiritual leader , the orthodox bishop artemije , dismissed the imminent declaration of independence , but denounced violence . " we are not calling anybody to a war , " artemije said after a prayer in the serb enclave gracanica , near the kosovo capital pristina .
" kosovo will always remain serbian and we regard this so- called declaration as occupation . " serbia slams eu mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars painted thanks to germany and other nations expected to recognize it serbian infrastructure minister velimir ilic , on a visit to gracanica , blasted the eu over its support for kosovo 's independence . " it is shame and disgrace what eu is doing , helping dismember serbia , " he said , referring to eu 's upcoming mission . serbia has already suspended its already cumbersome approach to eu membership over the mission , which it has fought diplomatically as a step to kosovo 's independence , and ilic signaled more of the same . " we will never cooperate with the eu mission in kosovo , " he said . ilic was just one of more than a dozen serbian government ministers and high-ranking officials who huddled with the serbs in their enclaves . serbia on thursday passed a resolution " annulling " the declaration of independence in advance .
the document would come into effect with the declaration of independence by the kosovo authorities . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say they share responsibility for the financial crisis as calls for political consequences are getting louder . until the outbreak of the subprime crisis , sector giants like standard & poor 's and moody 's in the us had enjoyed an aura of expertise and incorruptibility .
half a year later , they 're on the defensive .
the finance committee in the german parliament recently met with experts to discuss the role of the rating agencies in the crisis . the agencies have been aware of the need for change for a long time , said rating expert oliver everling , who 'd spoken with the committee .
he added that " the agencies definitely do n't bear responsibility alone for the subprime crisis . " failure of early warning system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aaa rating was n't always legitimate indeed , the agencies have tried to take other market participants to task .
everling said that banks bore a greater share of the blame for investing in risky products whose complexity they did n't understand , such as collateralized debt obligations -lrb- cdos -rrb- . even after the shaky bonds had lost their value and experts had warned that the us mortgage market was about to burst , the rating agencies were still granting mortgage derivatives the highest score of aaa .
it was n't until june 2007 that the ratings dropped , leaving the agencies scrambling to defend their role as the " early warning system . " furthermore , the rating agencies have had to refute accusations of corruption and conflict of interest .
according to critics , the credit monitors not only evaluated complex financial products but also advised the issuers who wanted to sell them . consulting claims undermine transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us crisis had ramifications across the world moody 's has rebuffed claims that it had been involved in consulting , but said it 's possible that " analytical discussions " took place with issuers or their advisors . " the line between dialogue and consultation is fluid , " everling said . the rating expert warned against hastily slapping regulations on the industry .
the consequence of the agencies ' mistakes should be more and not less rating - with greater competition , he said .
after all , standard & poor 's and moody 's dominate the global market with an 80 percent share , making them practically immune to national politics . instead , politicians around the world have to convince standard & poor 's and moody 's to participate in regulation negotiations , said everling - at the very least to improve their reputation for transparency . it 's not always clear where their ratings actually come from , say critics .
german chancellor angela merkel said last year during the financial turbulence that " nothing should be pulled out of a black box that no one understands . " caution rises as confidence lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the chaos have been spared ?
wuerzburg economist ekkehard wenger said he doubts that pressure from politicians can bring transparency back to the industry . " as long as the rating agencies are paid by those that sell the papers , not much will change , " wenger said . at the very least , however , the sector already seems to have lost the blind trust it once enjoyed . " the confidence of the market in credit ratings has suffered under the current situation , " conceded the fitch rating agency recently . as a result , banks and investors will have to take a closer look at who they entrust their money with , said franz waas , head of dekabank .

experts say they share responsibility for the financial crisis as calls for political consequences are getting louder . until the outbreak of the subprime crisis , sector giants like standard & poor 's and moody 's in the us had enjoyed an aura of expertise and incorruptibility .
half a year later , they 're on the defensive .
the finance committee in the german parliament recently met with experts to discuss the role of the rating agencies in the crisis . the agencies have been aware of the need for change for a long time , said rating expert oliver everling , who 'd spoken with the committee .
he added that " the agencies definitely do n't bear responsibility alone for the subprime crisis . " failure of early warning system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aaa rating was n't always legitimate indeed , the agencies have tried to take other market participants to task .
everling said that banks bore a greater share of the blame for investing in risky products whose complexity they did n't understand , such as collateralized debt obligations -lrb- cdos -rrb- . even after the shaky bonds had lost their value and experts had warned that the us mortgage market was about to burst , the rating agencies were still granting mortgage derivatives the highest score of aaa .
it was n't until june 2007 that the ratings dropped , leaving the agencies scrambling to defend their role as the " early warning system . " furthermore , the rating agencies have had to refute accusations of corruption and conflict of interest .
according to critics , the credit monitors not only evaluated complex financial products but also advised the issuers who wanted to sell them . consulting claims undermine transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us crisis had ramifications across the world moody 's has rebuffed claims that it had been involved in consulting , but said it 's possible that " analytical discussions " took place with issuers or their advisors . " the line between dialogue and consultation is fluid , " everling said . the rating expert warned against hastily slapping regulations on the industry .
the consequence of the agencies ' mistakes should be more and not less rating - with greater competition , he said .
after all , standard & poor 's and moody 's dominate the global market with an 80 percent share , making them practically immune to national politics . instead , politicians around the world have to convince standard & poor 's and moody 's to participate in regulation negotiations , said everling - at the very least to improve their reputation for transparency . it 's not always clear where their ratings actually come from , say critics .
german chancellor angela merkel said last year during the financial turbulence that " nothing should be pulled out of a black box that no one understands . " caution rises as confidence lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the chaos have been spared ?
wuerzburg economist ekkehard wenger said he doubts that pressure from politicians can bring transparency back to the industry . " as long as the rating agencies are paid by those that sell the papers , not much will change , " wenger said . at the very least , however , the sector already seems to have lost the blind trust it once enjoyed . " the confidence of the market in credit ratings has suffered under the current situation , " conceded the fitch rating agency recently . as a result , banks and investors will have to take a closer look at who they entrust their money with , said franz waas , head of dekabank .

the eu is therefore planning to help out retired rockers , who never made millions to live on . many musicians and singers hit the big time in their 20s , and often even earlier .
under current rules , their airplay royalties stop coming in just as they retire , hitting them particularly hard .
that 's why the european commission announced this week that under a new proposal , european musicians and singers would see the copyright on their recorded performances extended to 95 years from the current level of 50 .
the eu 's move to help ageing rockers and other artists beat the financial blues during retirement would be ready for formal adoption by the european commission in the middle of the year , the european union 's executive arm said .
" if nothing is done , thousands of european performers who recorded in the late fifties and sixties will lose all of their airplay royalties over the next 10 years , " eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy said .
presenting the proposal , mccreevy said that he had found " no convincing reason " why composers should currently enjoy much longer copyright protection than performers .
commission moves to protect performers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles aznavour wo n't go hungry in his retirement " it is the performer who gives life to the composition and while most of us have no idea who wrote our favorite song , we can usually name the performer , " mccreevy said .
" i strongly believe that copyright protection for europe 's performers represents a moral right to control the use of their work and earn a living from their performances . "
in the united states , performers already enjoy copyright protection for 95 years .
in the european union , such protection has been limited to 50 years since the introduction of a 1993 law .
mccreevy acknowledged that he was less worried about big crowd-pullers such as britain 's ageless pop star cliff richard and french crooner charles aznavour than " the thousands of anonymous session musicians who contributed to sound recordings in the late fifties and sixties .
" they will no longer get airplay royalties from their recordings but these royalties are often their sole pension , " he said .
the aepo-artis association , representing several performer organizations at the european level , welcomed that brussels had recognized " the creative gain that performers bring . "
however , " some things still need to be clarified , " said guenaelle collet at apos-artis , citing in particular a proposal that record companies would have to contribute to a special fund for session musicians .
eu to investigate private copying and rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tokio hotel can look forward to decades of royalties mccreevy also said that he wanted to reopen consultations over levies for being able to make copies of a performance on computers , digital and other music players and which vary widely among countries .
" there can be no question of calling into doubt the entitlement of rights holders to compensation for private copying , " he said .
" at the same time there is a need to look at how the levies are applied in practice . "

the eu is therefore planning to help out retired rockers , who never made millions to live on . many musicians and singers hit the big time in their 20s , and often even earlier .
under current rules , their airplay royalties stop coming in just as they retire , hitting them particularly hard .
that 's why the european commission announced this week that under a new proposal , european musicians and singers would see the copyright on their recorded performances extended to 95 years from the current level of 50 .
the eu 's move to help ageing rockers and other artists beat the financial blues during retirement would be ready for formal adoption by the european commission in the middle of the year , the european union 's executive arm said .
" if nothing is done , thousands of european performers who recorded in the late fifties and sixties will lose all of their airplay royalties over the next 10 years , " eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy said .
presenting the proposal , mccreevy said that he had found " no convincing reason " why composers should currently enjoy much longer copyright protection than performers .

17 .
ten years after belgrade crushed a rebellion in kosovo , parliamentarians proclaimed the republic of kosovo and sovereign state . the parliament in kosovo voted in favor of independence from serbia , bringing the curtain down on a long chapter in the violent break-up of yugoslavia . " from today onwards , kosovo is proud , independent and free , " said prime minister hashim thaci .
" we never lost faith in the dream that one day we would stand among the free nations of the world , and today we do . " kosovo will be a " society that respects human dignity " and be committed to dealing with the " painful legacy of the recent past , in a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness , " thaci added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the members of parliament present approved independence for kosovo all 109 deputies present at the session in the capital pristina voted in favor with a show of hands .
eleven deputies from ethnic minorities , including serbs , were absent .
the parliament also approved a new flag for the landlocked state of about 2 million people . " today , a new life begins , " the kosovo daily koha ditore wrote .
" the past should not be forgotten , but it belongs to the past , and should be forgiven . " serbia calls declaration illegal while the united states and several european union members are quickly expected to recognize the new state , serbia is infuriated by the move and has been given strong support by russia , which called on the un and nato to annul kosovo 's independence . quickly after the deceleration , moscow called for a meeting of the united nations security council to discuss kosovo .
diplomats in new york said the council would hold an emergency meeting on sunday . " the decisions by the kosovo leadership create the risk of an escalation of tension and inter-ethnic violence in the province and of new conflict in the balkans , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . serbia 's president boris tadic said his country would never recognize the independence of kosovo . " the state of serbia will take responsible moves and will do everything in its power to annul this arbitrary and illegally proclaimed the independence of kosovo , " tadic said in a statement .
" serbia will not resort to violence and that is the only approach which can enable us to continue our legitimate fight to preserve the integrity of our country . " in a televised address , serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica called kosovo a " false state " supported unlawfully by the united states , which he said was " ready to violate the international order for its own military interests . " kosovo police had to stop several hundred former serbian army reservists - veterans of the 1998-99 kosovo war - from crossing into the territory ahead of the independence declaration . eu mission welcomed in pristina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrations have already begun in kosovo earlier , thaci said he would also welcome the law-implementing mission prepared by the european union to help kosovo along its first sovereign steps .
after slovenia , croatia , macedonia , bosnia and montenegro , kosovo is the sixth nation to emerge from the former yugoslav federation since 1991 . the independence proclamation started a 120-day transition period and the deployment of some 2,000 european union police and judicial officials to aid kosovo in the transition to independence . tens of thousands of albanians , a 90 percent majority in kosovo , began celebrating in capital pristina ahead of the declaration . flags of albania , the united states and western european countries were on display and waved everywhere , as police closed the central streets to traffic , allowing only pedestrians in . some of the people carried signs calling for a " celebration with dignity .

17 .
ten years after belgrade crushed a rebellion in kosovo , parliamentarians proclaimed the republic of kosovo and sovereign state . the parliament in kosovo voted in favor of independence from serbia , bringing the curtain down on a long chapter in the violent break-up of yugoslavia . " from today onwards , kosovo is proud , independent and free , " said prime minister hashim thaci .
" we never lost faith in the dream that one day we would stand among the free nations of the world , and today we do . " kosovo will be a " society that respects human dignity " and be committed to dealing with the " painful legacy of the recent past , in a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness , " thaci added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the members of parliament present approved independence for kosovo all 109 deputies present at the session in the capital pristina voted in favor with a show of hands .
eleven deputies from ethnic minorities , including serbs , were absent .
the parliament also approved a new flag for the landlocked state of about 2 million people . " today , a new life begins , " the kosovo daily koha ditore wrote .
" the past should not be forgotten , but it belongs to the past , and should be forgiven . " serbia calls declaration illegal while the united states and several european union members are quickly expected to recognize the new state , serbia is infuriated by the move and has been given strong support by russia , which called on the un and nato to annul kosovo 's independence . quickly after the deceleration , moscow called for a meeting of the united nations security council to discuss kosovo .
diplomats in new york said the council would hold an emergency meeting on sunday . " the decisions by the kosovo leadership create the risk of an escalation of tension and inter-ethnic violence in the province and of new conflict in the balkans , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . serbia 's president boris tadic said his country would never recognize the independence of kosovo . " the state of serbia will take responsible moves and will do everything in its power to annul this arbitrary and illegally proclaimed the independence of kosovo , " tadic said in a statement .
" serbia will not resort to violence and that is the only approach which can enable us to continue our legitimate fight to preserve the integrity of our country . " in a televised address , serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica called kosovo a " false state " supported unlawfully by the united states , which he said was " ready to violate the international order for its own military interests . " kosovo police had to stop several hundred former serbian army reservists - veterans of the 1998-99 kosovo war - from crossing into the territory ahead of the independence declaration . eu mission welcomed in pristina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrations have already begun in kosovo earlier , thaci said he would also welcome the law-implementing mission prepared by the european union to help kosovo along its first sovereign steps .
after slovenia , croatia , macedonia , bosnia and montenegro , kosovo is the sixth nation to emerge from the former yugoslav federation since 1991 . the independence proclamation started a 120-day transition period and the deployment of some 2,000 european union police and judicial officials to aid kosovo in the transition to independence . tens of thousands of albanians , a 90 percent majority in kosovo , began celebrating in capital pristina ahead of the declaration . flags of albania , the united states and western european countries were on display and waved everywhere , as police closed the central streets to traffic , allowing only pedestrians in . some of the people carried signs calling for a " celebration with dignity . " while albanians started celebrating already saturday night , the serbs in their enclaves remained calm even if wary .
their spiritual leader , the orthodox bishop artemije , dismissed the imminent declaration of independence , but denounced violence . " we are not calling anybody to a war , " artemije said after a prayer in the serb enclave gracanica , near the kosovo capital pristina .
" kosovo will always remain serbian and we regard this so- called declaration as occupation . " serbia slams eu mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars painted thanks to germany and other nations expected to recognize it serbian infrastructure minister velimir ilic , on a visit to gracanica , blasted the eu over its support for kosovo 's independence . " it is shame and disgrace what eu is doing , helping dismember serbia , " he said , referring to eu 's upcoming mission . serbia has already suspended its already cumbersome approach to eu membership over the mission , which it has fought diplomatically as a step to kosovo 's independence , and ilic signaled more of the same . " we will never cooperate with the eu mission in kosovo , " he said . ilic was just one of more than a dozen serbian government ministers and high-ranking officials who huddled with the serbs in their enclaves . serbia on thursday passed a resolution " annulling " the declaration of independence in advance .
the document would come into effect with the declaration of independence by the kosovo authorities . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 .
ten years after belgrade crushed a rebellion in kosovo , parliamentarians proclaimed the republic of kosovo and sovereign state . the parliament in kosovo voted in favor of independence from serbia , bringing the curtain down on a long chapter in the violent break-up of yugoslavia . " from today onwards , kosovo is proud , independent and free , " said prime minister hashim thaci .
" we never lost faith in the dream that one day we would stand among the free nations of the world , and today we do . " kosovo will be a " society that respects human dignity " and be committed to dealing with the " painful legacy of the recent past , in a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness , " thaci added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the members of parliament present approved independence for kosovo all 109 deputies present at the session in the capital pristina voted in favor with a show of hands .
eleven deputies from ethnic minorities , including serbs , were absent .
the parliament also approved a new flag for the landlocked state of about 2 million people . " today , a new life begins , " the kosovo daily koha ditore wrote .
" the past should not be forgotten , but it belongs to the past , and should be forgiven . " serbia calls declaration illegal while the united states and several european union members are quickly expected to recognize the new state , serbia is infuriated by the move and has been given strong support by russia , which called on the un and nato to annul kosovo 's independence . quickly after the deceleration , moscow called for a meeting of the united nations security council to discuss kosovo .
diplomats in new york said the council would hold an emergency meeting on sunday . " the decisions by the kosovo leadership create the risk of an escalation of tension and inter-ethnic violence in the province and of new conflict in the balkans , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . serbia 's president boris tadic said his country would never recognize the independence of kosovo . " the state of serbia will take responsible moves and will do everything in its power to annul this arbitrary and illegally proclaimed the independence of kosovo , " tadic said in a statement .
" serbia will not resort to violence and that is the only approach which can enable us to continue our legitimate fight to preserve the integrity of our country . " in a televised address , serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica called kosovo a " false state " supported unlawfully by the united states , which he said was " ready to violate the international order for its own military interests . " kosovo police had to stop several hundred former serbian army reservists - veterans of the 1998-99 kosovo war - from crossing into the territory ahead of the independence declaration . eu mission welcomed in pristina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrations have already begun in kosovo earlier , thaci said he would also welcome the law-implementing mission prepared by the european union to help kosovo along its first sovereign steps .
after slovenia , croatia , macedonia , bosnia and montenegro , kosovo is the sixth nation to emerge from the former yugoslav federation since 1991 . the independence proclamation started a 120-day transition period and the deployment of some 2,000 european union police and judicial officials to aid kosovo in the transition to independence . tens of thousands of albanians , a 90 percent majority in kosovo , began celebrating in capital pristina ahead of the declaration . flags of albania , the united states and western european countries were on display and waved everywhere , as police closed the central streets to traffic , allowing only pedestrians in . some of the people carried signs calling for a " celebration with dignity . " while albanians started celebrating already saturday night , the serbs in their enclaves remained calm even if wary .
their spiritual leader , the orthodox bishop artemije , dismissed the imminent declaration of independence , but denounced violence . " we are not calling anybody to a war , " artemije said after a prayer in the serb enclave gracanica , near the kosovo capital pristina .
" kosovo will always remain serbian and we regard this so- called declaration as occupation . " serbia slams eu mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars painted thanks to germany and other nations expected to recognize it serbian infrastructure minister velimir ilic , on a visit to gracanica , blasted the eu over its support for kosovo 's independence . " it is shame and disgrace what eu is doing , helping dismember serbia , " he said , referring to eu 's upcoming mission . serbia has already suspended its already cumbersome approach to eu membership over the mission , which it has fought diplomatically as a step to kosovo 's independence , and ilic signaled more of the same . " we will never cooperate with the eu mission in kosovo , " he said . ilic was just one of more than a dozen serbian government ministers and high-ranking officials who huddled with the serbs in their enclaves . serbia on thursday passed a resolution " annulling " the declaration of independence in advance .

some leaders want the un to rule on kosovo 's status . while britain , france , germany and italy , along with the united states , were expected to recognize kosovo 's independence from serbia , several other eu nations have said they will not be sending ambassadors to pristina soon . great britain said it regarded kosovo 's declaration of independence on sunday , feb .
17 , as " an important development , " but it will wait until a meeting of eu foreign ministers on monday to make a formal statement , a foreign office spokeswoman said . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called on " all parties " to exercise moderation .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said he wished kosovo " good luck " following its vote for independence . russia strongly opposed to independence while thousands of kosovars danced in the streets of pristina waving us , british , french , german , italian flags in tribute to countries that supported the break kosovo made from serbia . bildunterschrift : not everyone in the eu received a thank you from kosovars on sunday " this is the happiest day ever in my life .
i 'm proud of our nation , which should be thankful eternally to the us , and to the eu too , " gazmend halimi , 22 , told the dpa news agency . but not all the eu is behind kosovo 's decision . cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain oppose recognizing kosovo .
others , including malta and portugal , want kosovo 's future be decided at the un security council .
with veto-wielding russia opposed to kosovo 's independence , there is no chance of a un security council resolution formalizing the pristina parliament 's decision . some eu members - as well as russia - see kosovo as potentially setting a dangerous precedent for other separatist movements , despite reassurances from brussels that kosovo is a unique case . cyprus is already split , and spain has long been confronted with basque and catalan nationalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the eu worry kosovars may embolden separatists in their own countries " we do not support a unilateral declaration of independence , " spain 's deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega said on local radio saturday .
" we think that ... it should have been in agreement with the various parties , which is not the case , or in line with international standards , that is to say with a -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution . " common stance elusive eu foreign ministers are expected to show as much unity as possible during a meeting on monday . an official with the eu 's presidency , currently held by slovenia , told the afp news agency that eu foreign ministers will want to " take note " of the changes in kosovo , but even this simple task is proving difficult to put to paper in the form of a declaration . " what 's important is the confirmation of the goal the eu has : that kosovo has a democratic , stable and multi-ethnic future and that this is all based on a european perspective , " the eu diplomat said . scores of joyous kosovo emigrants from belgium , the netherlands and germany , gathered outside european institutions in brussels sunday in advance of the announcement . " we have waited over 100 years for this and we are more than ready to become an independent state , above all a democratic state " writer-activist halit elshani , who fled kosovo in 1999 , told afp . eu mission to ease transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to help create a democratic and multi-ethnic kosovo kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , after nato bombed belgrade to end a bloody crackdown on albanian separatists , but the province has officially remained part of serbia . belgrade remains implacably opposed to losing the region which it considers the cradle of its serbian culture . the european union has already taken one major step towards easing kosovo 's independence by launching a police and justice mission . the 2,000-strong mission will be fully operational after a 120-day transition period , and aims to train and mentor police , judges and customs officials . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" kosovo police had to stop several hundred former serbian army reservists - veterans of the 1998-99 kosovo war - from crossing into the territory ahead of the independence declaration . eu mission welcomed in pristina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrations have already begun in kosovo earlier , thaci said he would also welcome the law-implementing mission prepared by the european union to help kosovo along its first sovereign steps .
after slovenia , croatia , macedonia , bosnia and montenegro , kosovo is the sixth nation to emerge from the former yugoslav federation since 1991 . the independence proclamation started a 120-day transition period and the deployment of some 2,000 european union police and judicial officials to aid kosovo in the transition to independence . tens of thousands of albanians , a 90 percent majority in kosovo , began celebrating in capital pristina ahead of the declaration . flags of albania , the united states and western european countries were on display and waved everywhere , as police closed the central streets to traffic , allowing only pedestrians in . some of the people carried signs calling for a " celebration with dignity . " while albanians started celebrating already saturday night , the serbs in their enclaves remained calm even if wary .
their spiritual leader , the orthodox bishop artemije , dismissed the imminent declaration of independence , but denounced violence . " we are not calling anybody to a war , " artemije said after a prayer in the serb enclave gracanica , near the kosovo capital pristina .
" kosovo will always remain serbian and we regard this so- called declaration as occupation . " serbia slams eu mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars painted thanks to germany and other nations expected to recognize it serbian infrastructure minister velimir ilic , on a visit to gracanica , blasted the eu over its support for kosovo 's independence . " it is shame and disgrace what eu is doing , helping dismember serbia , " he said , referring to eu 's upcoming mission . serbia has already suspended its already cumbersome approach to eu membership over the mission , which it has fought diplomatically as a step to kosovo 's independence , and ilic signaled more of the same . " we will never cooperate with the eu mission in kosovo , " he said . ilic was just one of more than a dozen serbian government ministers and high-ranking officials who huddled with the serbs in their enclaves . serbia on thursday passed a resolution " annulling " the declaration of independence in advance .

16 , by an international jury headed by renowned greek-born director costa-gavras .
it beat out productions from britain and hollywood for the berlin festival 's top honor . " it is a prize for brazilian film , " said padilha whose movie tells the story of a brutal police clean-up operation ahead of a 1997 visit to brazil by pope john paul ii . wearing a red berlinale scarf , padilha said winning the award would encourage him to continue to make critical films success in berlin coming against the backdrop of a renewed international recognition of latin american cinema . with no script and his actors largely improvising , padilha hoped to give his movie a documentary film , he said . the film has come under criticism for glorifying police brutality in rio de janeiro 's slums . it 's criticism that is misplaced and often coming from viewers who did n't understand the film , padilha said . " the film aims to explain how the state turns policemen either into corrupt people ... or worst of all violent people , " the 40-year-old director told reporters .
" the huge majority of brazilians understand that .
i do n't think it 's mysterious . " costa-gavras said the jury 's decision to award the golden bear to padilha was a unanimous decision . two awards for " there will be blood " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anderson also won in berlin eight years ago with " magnolia " the berlinale 's jury grand prize went to us oscar-winning documentary filmmaker errol morris ' " standard operating procedure , " a detailed examination into the shocking events surrounding iraq 's abu ghraib prison . a total of 21 films were competing for the festival 's top honors this year with " there will be blood " from us director paul anderson winning two awards - one for best director and for one for jonny greenwood for his musical score for the film . " there will be blood , " which stars daniel day-lewis as a ruthless oilman has been nominated for eight academy awards , which are to be presented in los angeles next week . but holding the two silver bears , anderson said , " that 's enough for me . "
anderson won a golden bear for " magnolia " eight years ago . some 400 films screened now in its 58th year , the berlinale is one of the world 's top three film festivals .
saturday 's berlinale awards were handed out in a hollywood-style gala ceremony . it has also been a successful festival for iranian cinema with one of the nation 's leading actors reza najie winning the berlin film festival 's top award for best actor . he played a stressed-out father trying to keep his family financially afloat in iranian director majid majidi 's light poignant comedy " the song of sparrows " -lrb- " avaze gonjeshk-ha " -rrb- . it was also announced saturday that iranian-born director hana makhmalbaf 's " buddha collapsed out of shame " -lrb- " buda az sharm foru rikht " -rrb- had won the 23rd film peace prize .
the prize is valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,337 -rrb- . makhmalbaf 's movie screened in the berlinale 's generation section , which is aimed at younger audiences , and focuses on a young afghan girl who lives in the mountains near the place where the 1,500-year- old buddha statues were blown up by the taliban in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hawkins was moved by the jury 's decision british actress sally hawkins goes home with the festival 's award for best actress for her role in british director mike leigh 's " happy go lucky " about a positive-thinking londoner called poppy . speaking after accepting the festival 's silver bear , najie said it was his destiny to come to berlin .
" thank you berlin , thank you cinema , " he told the awards ceremony in the german capital . hawkins said she had been completely overwhelmed after receiving the prize and had burst into tears after leaving the stage . the silver bear for best script went to chinese director wang xiaoshuai 's " in love we trust " -lrb- " zuo you " -rrb- about the tensions caused by a sick child . earlier saturday , the festival announced that " lemon tree " from israeli director eran riklis won the audience prize for one of the berlinale 's main sections . riklis ' film was not included in the berlinale 's main competition but was screened in the festival 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . the 11-day berlinale screened nearly 400 pictures and attracted 20,000 accredited visitors from 125 countries .

experts say they share responsibility for the financial crisis as calls for political consequences are getting louder . until the outbreak of the subprime crisis , sector giants like standard & poor 's and moody 's in the us had enjoyed an aura of expertise and incorruptibility .
half a year later , they 're on the defensive .
the finance committee in the german parliament recently met with experts to discuss the role of the rating agencies in the crisis . the agencies have been aware of the need for change for a long time , said rating expert oliver everling , who 'd spoken with the committee .
he added that " the agencies definitely do n't bear responsibility alone for the subprime crisis . " failure of early warning system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aaa rating was n't always legitimate indeed , the agencies have tried to take other market participants to task .
everling said that banks bore a greater share of the blame for investing in risky products whose complexity they did n't understand , such as collateralized debt obligations -lrb- cdos -rrb- . even after the shaky bonds had lost their value and experts had warned that the us mortgage market was about to burst , the rating agencies were still granting mortgage derivatives the highest score of aaa .
it was n't until june 2007 that the ratings dropped , leaving the agencies scrambling to defend their role as the " early warning system . " furthermore , the rating agencies have had to refute accusations of corruption and conflict of interest .
according to critics , the credit monitors not only evaluated complex financial products but also advised the issuers who wanted to sell them . consulting claims undermine transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us crisis had ramifications across the world moody 's has rebuffed claims that it had been involved in consulting , but said it 's possible that " analytical discussions " took place with issuers or their advisors . " the line between dialogue and consultation is fluid , " everling said . the rating expert warned against hastily slapping regulations on the industry .
the consequence of the agencies ' mistakes should be more and not less rating - with greater competition , he said .
after all , standard & poor 's and moody 's dominate the global market with an 80 percent share , making them practically immune to national politics . instead , politicians around the world have to convince standard & poor 's and moody 's to participate in regulation negotiations , said everling - at the very least to improve their reputation for transparency . it 's not always clear where their ratings actually come from , say critics .
german chancellor angela merkel said last year during the financial turbulence that " nothing should be pulled out of a black box that no one understands . " caution rises as confidence lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the chaos have been spared ?
wuerzburg economist ekkehard wenger said he doubts that pressure from politicians can bring transparency back to the industry . " as long as the rating agencies are paid by those that sell the papers , not much will change , " wenger said . at the very least , however , the sector already seems to have lost the blind trust it once enjoyed . " the confidence of the market in credit ratings has suffered under the current situation , " conceded the fitch rating agency recently . as a result , banks and investors will have to take a closer look at who they entrust their money with , said franz waas , head of dekabank . " traditional credit analysis will become more significant again , " he said .

some leaders want the un to rule on kosovo 's status . while britain , france , germany and italy , along with the united states , were expected to recognize kosovo 's independence from serbia , several other eu nations have said they will not be sending ambassadors to pristina soon . great britain said it regarded kosovo 's declaration of independence on sunday , feb .
17 , as " an important development , " but it will wait until a meeting of eu foreign ministers on monday to make a formal statement , a foreign office spokeswoman said . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called on " all parties " to exercise moderation .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said he wished kosovo " good luck " following its vote for independence . russia strongly opposed to independence while thousands of kosovars danced in the streets of pristina waving us , british , french , german , italian flags in tribute to countries that supported the break kosovo made from serbia . bildunterschrift : not everyone in the eu received a thank you from kosovars on sunday " this is the happiest day ever in my life .
i 'm proud of our nation , which should be thankful eternally to the us , and to the eu too , " gazmend halimi , 22 , told the dpa news agency . but not all the eu is behind kosovo 's decision . cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain oppose recognizing kosovo .
others , including malta and portugal , want kosovo 's future be decided at the un security council .
with veto-wielding russia opposed to kosovo 's independence , there is no chance of a un security council resolution formalizing the pristina parliament 's decision . some eu members - as well as russia - see kosovo as potentially setting a dangerous precedent for other separatist movements , despite reassurances from brussels that kosovo is a unique case . cyprus is already split , and spain has long been confronted with basque and catalan nationalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the eu worry kosovars may embolden separatists in their own countries " we do not support a unilateral declaration of independence , " spain 's deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega said on local radio saturday .
" we think that ... it should have been in agreement with the various parties , which is not the case , or in line with international standards , that is to say with a -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution . " common stance elusive eu foreign ministers are expected to show as much unity as possible during a meeting on monday . an official with the eu 's presidency , currently held by slovenia , told the afp news agency that eu foreign ministers will want to " take note " of the changes in kosovo , but even this simple task is proving difficult to put to paper in the form of a declaration . " what 's important is the confirmation of the goal the eu has : that kosovo has a democratic , stable and multi-ethnic future and that this is all based on a european perspective , " the eu diplomat said . scores of joyous kosovo emigrants from belgium , the netherlands and germany , gathered outside european institutions in brussels sunday in advance of the announcement . " we have waited over 100 years for this and we are more than ready to become an independent state , above all a democratic state " writer-activist halit elshani , who fled kosovo in 1999 , told afp . eu mission to ease transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to help create a democratic and multi-ethnic kosovo kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , after nato bombed belgrade to end a bloody crackdown on albanian separatists , but the province has officially remained part of serbia . belgrade remains implacably opposed to losing the region which it considers the cradle of its serbian culture . the european union has already taken one major step towards easing kosovo 's independence by launching a police and justice mission . the 2,000-strong mission will be fully operational after a 120-day transition period , and aims to train and mentor police , judges and customs officials . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 17.02.2008 separatists damper eu support for independent kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's new flag -lrb- right -rrb- does n't resemble the albanian one -lrb- left -rrb- european backing for kosovo 's independence has been held back by worries in some eu capitals that it could inspire separatists in their own countries .
some leaders want the un to rule on kosovo 's status . while britain , france , germany and italy , along with the united states , were expected to recognize kosovo 's independence from serbia , several other eu nations have said they will not be sending ambassadors to pristina soon . great britain said it regarded kosovo 's declaration of independence on sunday , feb .
17 , as " an important development , " but it will wait until a meeting of eu foreign ministers on monday to make a formal statement , a foreign office spokeswoman said . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called on " all parties " to exercise moderation .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said he wished kosovo " good luck " following its vote for independence . russia strongly opposed to independence while thousands of kosovars danced in the streets of pristina waving us , british , french , german , italian flags in tribute to countries that supported the break kosovo made from serbia . bildunterschrift : not everyone in the eu received a thank you from kosovars on sunday " this is the happiest day ever in my life .
i 'm proud of our nation , which should be thankful eternally to the us , and to the eu too , " gazmend halimi , 22 , told the dpa news agency . but not all the eu is behind kosovo 's decision . cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain oppose recognizing kosovo .
others , including malta and portugal , want kosovo 's future be decided at the un security council .
with veto-wielding russia opposed to kosovo 's independence , there is no chance of a un security council resolution formalizing the pristina parliament 's decision . some eu members - as well as russia - see kosovo as potentially setting a dangerous precedent for other separatist movements , despite reassurances from brussels that kosovo is a unique case . cyprus is already split , and spain has long been confronted with basque and catalan nationalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the eu worry kosovars may embolden separatists in their own countries " we do not support a unilateral declaration of independence , " spain 's deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega said on local radio saturday .
" we think that ... it should have been in agreement with the various parties , which is not the case , or in line with international standards , that is to say with a -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution . " common stance elusive eu foreign ministers are expected to show as much unity as possible during a meeting on monday . an official with the eu 's presidency , currently held by slovenia , told the afp news agency that eu foreign ministers will want to " take note " of the changes in kosovo , but even this simple task is proving difficult to put to paper in the form of a declaration . " what 's important is the confirmation of the goal the eu has : that kosovo has a democratic , stable and multi-ethnic future and that this is all based on a european perspective , " the eu diplomat said . scores of joyous kosovo emigrants from belgium , the netherlands and germany , gathered outside european institutions in brussels sunday in advance of the announcement . " we have waited over 100 years for this and we are more than ready to become an independent state , above all a democratic state " writer-activist halit elshani , who fled kosovo in 1999 , told afp . eu mission to ease transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to help create a democratic and multi-ethnic kosovo kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , after nato bombed belgrade to end a bloody crackdown on albanian separatists , but the province has officially remained part of serbia . belgrade remains implacably opposed to losing the region which it considers the cradle of its serbian culture . the european union has already taken one major step towards easing kosovo 's independence by launching a police and justice mission . the 2,000-strong mission will be fully operational after a 120-day transition period , and aims to train and mentor police , judges and customs officials . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 .
ten years after belgrade crushed a rebellion in kosovo , parliamentarians proclaimed the republic of kosovo and sovereign state . the parliament in kosovo voted in favor of independence from serbia , bringing the curtain down on a long chapter in the violent break-up of yugoslavia . " from today onwards , kosovo is proud , independent and free , " said prime minister hashim thaci .
" we never lost faith in the dream that one day we would stand among the free nations of the world , and today we do . " kosovo will be a " society that respects human dignity " and be committed to dealing with the " painful legacy of the recent past , in a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness , " thaci added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the members of parliament present approved independence for kosovo all 109 deputies present at the session in the capital pristina voted in favor with a show of hands .
eleven deputies from ethnic minorities , including serbs , were absent .
the parliament also approved a new flag for the landlocked state of about 2 million people . " today , a new life begins , " the kosovo daily koha ditore wrote .
" the past should not be forgotten , but it belongs to the past , and should be forgiven . " serbia calls declaration illegal while the united states and several european union members are quickly expected to recognize the new state , serbia is infuriated by the move and has been given strong support by russia , which called on the un and nato to annul kosovo 's independence . quickly after the deceleration , moscow called for a meeting of the united nations security council to discuss kosovo .
diplomats in new york said the council would hold an emergency meeting on sunday . " the decisions by the kosovo leadership create the risk of an escalation of tension and inter-ethnic violence in the province and of new conflict in the balkans , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . serbia 's president boris tadic said his country would never recognize the independence of kosovo . " the state of serbia will take responsible moves and will do everything in its power to annul this arbitrary and illegally proclaimed the independence of kosovo , " tadic said in a statement .
" serbia will not resort to violence and that is the only approach which can enable us to continue our legitimate fight to preserve the integrity of our country . " in a televised address , serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica called kosovo a " false state " supported unlawfully by the united states , which he said was " ready to violate the international order for its own military interests . " kosovo police had to stop several hundred former serbian army reservists - veterans of the 1998-99 kosovo war - from crossing into the territory ahead of the independence declaration . eu mission welcomed in pristina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrations have already begun in kosovo earlier , thaci said he would also welcome the law-implementing mission prepared by the european union to help kosovo along its first sovereign steps .
after slovenia , croatia , macedonia , bosnia and montenegro , kosovo is the sixth nation to emerge from the former yugoslav federation since 1991 . the independence proclamation started a 120-day transition period and the deployment of some 2,000 european union police and judicial officials to aid kosovo in the transition to independence . tens of thousands of albanians , a 90 percent majority in kosovo , began celebrating in capital pristina ahead of the declaration . flags of albania , the united states and western european countries were on display and waved everywhere , as police closed the central streets to traffic , allowing only pedestrians in . some of the people carried signs calling for a " celebration with dignity . " while albanians started celebrating already saturday night , the serbs in their enclaves remained calm even if wary .
their spiritual leader , the orthodox bishop artemije , dismissed the imminent declaration of independence , but denounced violence . " we are not calling anybody to a war , " artemije said after a prayer in the serb enclave gracanica , near the kosovo capital pristina .
" kosovo will always remain serbian and we regard this so- called declaration as occupation . " serbia slams eu mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars painted thanks to germany and other nations expected to recognize it serbian infrastructure minister velimir ilic , on a visit to gracanica , blasted the eu over its support for kosovo 's independence . " it is shame and disgrace what eu is doing , helping dismember serbia , " he said , referring to eu 's upcoming mission . serbia has already suspended its already cumbersome approach to eu membership over the mission , which it has fought diplomatically as a step to kosovo 's independence , and ilic signaled more of the same . " we will never cooperate with the eu mission in kosovo , " he said . ilic was just one of more than a dozen serbian government ministers and high-ranking officials who huddled with the serbs in their enclaves . serbia on thursday passed a resolution " annulling " the declaration of independence in advance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 17.02.2008 german experts : rating agencies take blame for subprime crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the early warning system malfunctioned the major rating agencies are desperately trying to repair their tattered image .
experts say they share responsibility for the financial crisis as calls for political consequences are getting louder . until the outbreak of the subprime crisis , sector giants like standard & poor 's and moody 's in the us had enjoyed an aura of expertise and incorruptibility .
half a year later , they 're on the defensive .
the finance committee in the german parliament recently met with experts to discuss the role of the rating agencies in the crisis . the agencies have been aware of the need for change for a long time , said rating expert oliver everling , who 'd spoken with the committee .
he added that " the agencies definitely do n't bear responsibility alone for the subprime crisis . " failure of early warning system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aaa rating was n't always legitimate indeed , the agencies have tried to take other market participants to task .
everling said that banks bore a greater share of the blame for investing in risky products whose complexity they did n't understand , such as collateralized debt obligations -lrb- cdos -rrb- . even after the shaky bonds had lost their value and experts had warned that the us mortgage market was about to burst , the rating agencies were still granting mortgage derivatives the highest score of aaa .
it was n't until june 2007 that the ratings dropped , leaving the agencies scrambling to defend their role as the " early warning system . " furthermore , the rating agencies have had to refute accusations of corruption and conflict of interest .
according to critics , the credit monitors not only evaluated complex financial products but also advised the issuers who wanted to sell them . consulting claims undermine transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us crisis had ramifications across the world moody 's has rebuffed claims that it had been involved in consulting , but said it 's possible that " analytical discussions " took place with issuers or their advisors . " the line between dialogue and consultation is fluid , " everling said . the rating expert warned against hastily slapping regulations on the industry .
the consequence of the agencies ' mistakes should be more and not less rating - with greater competition , he said .
after all , standard & poor 's and moody 's dominate the global market with an 80 percent share , making them practically immune to national politics . instead , politicians around the world have to convince standard & poor 's and moody 's to participate in regulation negotiations , said everling - at the very least to improve their reputation for transparency . it 's not always clear where their ratings actually come from , say critics .
german chancellor angela merkel said last year during the financial turbulence that " nothing should be pulled out of a black box that no one understands . " caution rises as confidence lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the chaos have been spared ?
wuerzburg economist ekkehard wenger said he doubts that pressure from politicians can bring transparency back to the industry . " as long as the rating agencies are paid by those that sell the papers , not much will change , " wenger said . at the very least , however , the sector already seems to have lost the blind trust it once enjoyed . " the confidence of the market in credit ratings has suffered under the current situation , " conceded the fitch rating agency recently . as a result , banks and investors will have to take a closer look at who they entrust their money with , said franz waas , head of dekabank . " traditional credit analysis will become more significant again , " he said .
" people wo n't buy blindly based on the advice of the rating agencies anymore . " angela göpfert -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu is therefore planning to help out retired rockers , who never made millions to live on . many musicians and singers hit the big time in their 20s , and often even earlier .
under current rules , their airplay royalties stop coming in just as they retire , hitting them particularly hard .
that 's why the european commission announced this week that under a new proposal , european musicians and singers would see the copyright on their recorded performances extended to 95 years from the current level of 50 .
the eu 's move to help ageing rockers and other artists beat the financial blues during retirement would be ready for formal adoption by the european commission in the middle of the year , the european union 's executive arm said .
" if nothing is done , thousands of european performers who recorded in the late fifties and sixties will lose all of their airplay royalties over the next 10 years , " eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy said .
presenting the proposal , mccreevy said that he had found " no convincing reason " why composers should currently enjoy much longer copyright protection than performers .
commission moves to protect performers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles aznavour wo n't go hungry in his retirement " it is the performer who gives life to the composition and while most of us have no idea who wrote our favorite song , we can usually name the performer , " mccreevy said .
" i strongly believe that copyright protection for europe 's performers represents a moral right to control the use of their work and earn a living from their performances . "
in the united states , performers already enjoy copyright protection for 95 years .
in the european union , such protection has been limited to 50 years since the introduction of a 1993 law .
mccreevy acknowledged that he was less worried about big crowd-pullers such as britain 's ageless pop star cliff richard and french crooner charles aznavour than " the thousands of anonymous session musicians who contributed to sound recordings in the late fifties and sixties .
" they will no longer get airplay royalties from their recordings but these royalties are often their sole pension , " he said .
the aepo-artis association , representing several performer organizations at the european level , welcomed that brussels had recognized " the creative gain that performers bring . "
however , " some things still need to be clarified , " said guenaelle collet at apos-artis , citing in particular a proposal that record companies would have to contribute to a special fund for session musicians .
eu to investigate private copying and rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tokio hotel can look forward to decades of royalties mccreevy also said that he wanted to reopen consultations over levies for being able to make copies of a performance on computers , digital and other music players and which vary widely among countries .
" there can be no question of calling into doubt the entitlement of rights holders to compensation for private copying , " he said .
" at the same time there is a need to look at how the levies are applied in practice . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 17.02.2008 eu moves to protect ageing rockers with royalties in retirement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite already being extremely wealthy , the stones will also earn more from the plan it may not be something the rolling stones have to worry about , but many rock stars face cash concerns in their old age .
the eu is therefore planning to help out retired rockers , who never made millions to live on . many musicians and singers hit the big time in their 20s , and often even earlier .
under current rules , their airplay royalties stop coming in just as they retire , hitting them particularly hard .
that 's why the european commission announced this week that under a new proposal , european musicians and singers would see the copyright on their recorded performances extended to 95 years from the current level of 50 .
the eu 's move to help ageing rockers and other artists beat the financial blues during retirement would be ready for formal adoption by the european commission in the middle of the year , the european union 's executive arm said .
" if nothing is done , thousands of european performers who recorded in the late fifties and sixties will lose all of their airplay royalties over the next 10 years , " eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy said .
presenting the proposal , mccreevy said that he had found " no convincing reason " why composers should currently enjoy much longer copyright protection than performers .
commission moves to protect performers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles aznavour wo n't go hungry in his retirement " it is the performer who gives life to the composition and while most of us have no idea who wrote our favorite song , we can usually name the performer , " mccreevy said .
" i strongly believe that copyright protection for europe 's performers represents a moral right to control the use of their work and earn a living from their performances . "
in the united states , performers already enjoy copyright protection for 95 years .
in the european union , such protection has been limited to 50 years since the introduction of a 1993 law .
mccreevy acknowledged that he was less worried about big crowd-pullers such as britain 's ageless pop star cliff richard and french crooner charles aznavour than " the thousands of anonymous session musicians who contributed to sound recordings in the late fifties and sixties .
" they will no longer get airplay royalties from their recordings but these royalties are often their sole pension , " he said .
the aepo-artis association , representing several performer organizations at the european level , welcomed that brussels had recognized " the creative gain that performers bring . "
however , " some things still need to be clarified , " said guenaelle collet at apos-artis , citing in particular a proposal that record companies would have to contribute to a special fund for session musicians .
eu to investigate private copying and rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tokio hotel can look forward to decades of royalties mccreevy also said that he wanted to reopen consultations over levies for being able to make copies of a performance on computers , digital and other music players and which vary widely among countries .
" there can be no question of calling into doubt the entitlement of rights holders to compensation for private copying , " he said .
" at the same time there is a need to look at how the levies are applied in practice . "
collet warned that " performers will be extremely cautious about the question . "

nine years after they again lost control over kosovo in war , serbs are now also losing even the formal hold over it . serbs first lost kosovo when their declining empire suffered a huge defeat to ottoman turks in a 1389 battle .
they waited five centuries , until 1912 to return the land to serbian rule . here are some of the key dates in kosovo 's history : 1945 - kosovo becomes a province of serbia , the largest republic of the new , communist yugoslav federation . 1975 - with yugoslavia 's new constitution , kosovo acquires wide-ranging autonomy and a self-governing authority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic said serbia would never give up control of kosovo 1989 - with slobodan milosevic rising to power on a surge of national awakening in serbia , belgrade scraps the autonomy of the increasingly restive kosovo . 1990 - on july 2 , legislators of the dissolved provincial parliament declare independence from serbia , an act which the international community ignores .
belgrade then dissolves kosovo 's autonomous assembly . 1998 - after five year of non-violent resistance through parallel institutions under the guidance of the moderate ibrahim rugova , the extremists among kosovo albanians take the initiative .
the separatist guerrilla kosovo liberation army uck launches attacks on police , military and serb civilians .
milosevic 's security apparatus cracks down on the rebels with massive force , effectively starting a war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato stationed thousands of troops in kosovo after the bombing campaign 1999 - talks between albanian leaders and belgrade - mediated in rambouillet , near paris by the contact group of big powers - fail to reach a solution by their conclusion on march 19 .
an escalation of violence in kosovo produces huge waves of refugees and on march 24 nato launches an aerial bombing campaign against yugoslavia to stop the bloodshed and the exodus .
after 78 days belgrade capitulates and orders its troops out of kosovo , making room for a nato-led peacekeeping mission of some 45,000 troops , but only after wrangling out a un resolution guaranteeing it sovereignty over kosovo .
the same resolution , 1244 , introduced a un administration to govern kosovo .
fearing reprisal attacks , thousands of serbs flee kosovo . 2001 - rugova named president in kosovo 's first general election . 2004 - on march 17 concerted kosovo-wide riots by albanians leave 19 dead and hundreds injured .
thousands of serbs flee their homes as hundreds of houses and dozens of churches are set on fire .
the eruption of violence was never properly explained and instigators were poorly prosecuted .
the incident was used by belgrade as an argument against kosovo 's independence . 2005 - kosovo prime minister ramush haradinaj resigns from office to face war crimes charges at the hague .
haradinaj strongly denies the charges ; the court has not issued a verdict .
the un security council agrees to talks on kosovo 's future .
former finnish president martti ahtissari is called on to mediate the talks . 2006 - in february in vienna the un launches the first direct talks on the status of kosovo between belgrade and the meanwhile fully-fledged kosovo authorities .
the vienna talks produce no result . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official declaration of independence came on feb .
17 , 2008 2007 - unable to find a negotiated solution to kosovo 's future status , ahtissari proposes supervised independence for the province .
another round of last-ditch talks , organized after russia shoots down an attempt at releasing kosovo from serbia 's sovereignty in the un , end in a deadlock by the dec .
10 deadline .
this paves the way for a unilateral declaration of independence by pristina with the support of the united states and several european union nations . 2008 - former guerrilla commander hashim thaci is elected prime minister and promises kosovo will declare independence in coordination with western governments .

some leaders want the un to rule on kosovo 's status . while britain , france , germany and italy , along with the united states , were expected to recognize kosovo 's independence from serbia , several other eu nations have said they will not be sending ambassadors to pristina soon . great britain said it regarded kosovo 's declaration of independence on sunday , feb .
17 , as " an important development , " but it will wait until a meeting of eu foreign ministers on monday to make a formal statement , a foreign office spokeswoman said . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called on " all parties " to exercise moderation .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said he wished kosovo " good luck " following its vote for independence . russia strongly opposed to independence while thousands of kosovars danced in the streets of pristina waving us , british , french , german , italian flags in tribute to countries that supported the break kosovo made from serbia . bildunterschrift : not everyone in the eu received a thank you from kosovars on sunday " this is the happiest day ever in my life .
i 'm proud of our nation , which should be thankful eternally to the us , and to the eu too , " gazmend halimi , 22 , told the dpa news agency . but not all the eu is behind kosovo 's decision . cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain oppose recognizing kosovo .
others , including malta and portugal , want kosovo 's future be decided at the un security council .
with veto-wielding russia opposed to kosovo 's independence , there is no chance of a un security council resolution formalizing the pristina parliament 's decision . some eu members - as well as russia - see kosovo as potentially setting a dangerous precedent for other separatist movements , despite reassurances from brussels that kosovo is a unique case . cyprus is already split , and spain has long been confronted with basque and catalan nationalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the eu worry kosovars may embolden separatists in their own countries " we do not support a unilateral declaration of independence , " spain 's deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega said on local radio saturday .
" we think that ... it should have been in agreement with the various parties , which is not the case , or in line with international standards , that is to say with a -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution . " common stance elusive eu foreign ministers are expected to show as much unity as possible during a meeting on monday . an official with the eu 's presidency , currently held by slovenia , told the afp news agency that eu foreign ministers will want to " take note " of the changes in kosovo , but even this simple task is proving difficult to put to paper in the form of a declaration . " what 's important is the confirmation of the goal the eu has : that kosovo has a democratic , stable and multi-ethnic future and that this is all based on a european perspective , " the eu diplomat said . scores of joyous kosovo emigrants from belgium , the netherlands and germany , gathered outside european institutions in brussels sunday in advance of the announcement . " we have waited over 100 years for this and we are more than ready to become an independent state , above all a democratic state " writer-activist halit elshani , who fled kosovo in 1999 , told afp . eu mission to ease transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to help create a democratic and multi-ethnic kosovo kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , after nato bombed belgrade to end a bloody crackdown on albanian separatists , but the province has officially remained part of serbia . belgrade remains implacably opposed to losing the region which it considers the cradle of its serbian culture . the european union has already taken one major step towards easing kosovo 's independence by launching a police and justice mission . the 2,000-strong mission will be fully operational after a 120-day transition period , and aims to train and mentor police , judges and customs officials . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , by an international jury headed by renowned greek-born director costa-gavras .
it beat out productions from britain and hollywood for the berlin festival 's top honor . " it is a prize for brazilian film , " said padilha whose movie tells the story of a brutal police clean-up operation ahead of a 1997 visit to brazil by pope john paul ii . wearing a red berlinale scarf , padilha said winning the award would encourage him to continue to make critical films success in berlin coming against the backdrop of a renewed international recognition of latin american cinema . with no script and his actors largely improvising , padilha hoped to give his movie a documentary film , he said . the film has come under criticism for glorifying police brutality in rio de janeiro 's slums . it 's criticism that is misplaced and often coming from viewers who did n't understand the film , padilha said . " the film aims to explain how the state turns policemen either into corrupt people ... or worst of all violent people , " the 40-year-old director told reporters .
" the huge majority of brazilians understand that .
i do n't think it 's mysterious . " costa-gavras said the jury 's decision to award the golden bear to padilha was a unanimous decision . two awards for " there will be blood " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anderson also won in berlin eight years ago with " magnolia " the berlinale 's jury grand prize went to us oscar-winning documentary filmmaker errol morris ' " standard operating procedure , " a detailed examination into the shocking events surrounding iraq 's abu ghraib prison . a total of 21 films were competing for the festival 's top honors this year with " there will be blood " from us director paul anderson winning two awards - one for best director and for one for jonny greenwood for his musical score for the film . " there will be blood , " which stars daniel day-lewis as a ruthless oilman has been nominated for eight academy awards , which are to be presented in los angeles next week . but holding the two silver bears , anderson said , " that 's enough for me . "
anderson won a golden bear for " magnolia " eight years ago . some 400 films screened now in its 58th year , the berlinale is one of the world 's top three film festivals .
saturday 's berlinale awards were handed out in a hollywood-style gala ceremony . it has also been a successful festival for iranian cinema with one of the nation 's leading actors reza najie winning the berlin film festival 's top award for best actor . he played a stressed-out father trying to keep his family financially afloat in iranian director majid majidi 's light poignant comedy " the song of sparrows " -lrb- " avaze gonjeshk-ha " -rrb- . it was also announced saturday that iranian-born director hana makhmalbaf 's " buddha collapsed out of shame " -lrb- " buda az sharm foru rikht " -rrb- had won the 23rd film peace prize .
the prize is valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,337 -rrb- . makhmalbaf 's movie screened in the berlinale 's generation section , which is aimed at younger audiences , and focuses on a young afghan girl who lives in the mountains near the place where the 1,500-year- old buddha statues were blown up by the taliban in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hawkins was moved by the jury 's decision british actress sally hawkins goes home with the festival 's award for best actress for her role in british director mike leigh 's " happy go lucky " about a positive-thinking londoner called poppy . speaking after accepting the festival 's silver bear , najie said it was his destiny to come to berlin .
" thank you berlin , thank you cinema , " he told the awards ceremony in the german capital . hawkins said she had been completely overwhelmed after receiving the prize and had burst into tears after leaving the stage . the silver bear for best script went to chinese director wang xiaoshuai 's " in love we trust " -lrb- " zuo you " -rrb- about the tensions caused by a sick child . earlier saturday , the festival announced that " lemon tree " from israeli director eran riklis won the audience prize for one of the berlinale 's main sections . riklis ' film was not included in the berlinale 's main competition but was screened in the festival 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . the 11-day berlinale screened nearly 400 pictures and attracted 20,000 accredited visitors from 125 countries .

17 .
ten years after belgrade crushed a rebellion in kosovo , parliamentarians proclaimed the republic of kosovo and sovereign state . the parliament in kosovo voted in favor of independence from serbia , bringing the curtain down on a long chapter in the violent break-up of yugoslavia . " from today onwards , kosovo is proud , independent and free , " said prime minister hashim thaci .
" we never lost faith in the dream that one day we would stand among the free nations of the world , and today we do . " kosovo will be a " society that respects human dignity " and be committed to dealing with the " painful legacy of the recent past , in a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness , " thaci added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the members of parliament present approved independence for kosovo all 109 deputies present at the session in the capital pristina voted in favor with a show of hands .
eleven deputies from ethnic minorities , including serbs , were absent .
the parliament also approved a new flag for the landlocked state of about 2 million people . " today , a new life begins , " the kosovo daily koha ditore wrote .
" the past should not be forgotten , but it belongs to the past , and should be forgiven . " serbia calls declaration illegal while the united states and several european union members are quickly expected to recognize the new state , serbia is infuriated by the move and has been given strong support by russia , which called on the un and nato to annul kosovo 's independence . quickly after the deceleration , moscow called for a meeting of the united nations security council to discuss kosovo .
diplomats in new york said the council would hold an emergency meeting on sunday . " the decisions by the kosovo leadership create the risk of an escalation of tension and inter-ethnic violence in the province and of new conflict in the balkans , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . serbia 's president boris tadic said his country would never recognize the independence of kosovo . " the state of serbia will take responsible moves and will do everything in its power to annul this arbitrary and illegally proclaimed the independence of kosovo , " tadic said in a statement .
" serbia will not resort to violence and that is the only approach which can enable us to continue our legitimate fight to preserve the integrity of our country . " in a televised address , serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica called kosovo a " false state " supported unlawfully by the united states , which he said was " ready to violate the international order for its own military interests . " kosovo police had to stop several hundred former serbian army reservists - veterans of the 1998-99 kosovo war - from crossing into the territory ahead of the independence declaration . eu mission welcomed in pristina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrations have already begun in kosovo earlier , thaci said he would also welcome the law-implementing mission prepared by the european union to help kosovo along its first sovereign steps .
after slovenia , croatia , macedonia , bosnia and montenegro , kosovo is the sixth nation to emerge from the former yugoslav federation since 1991 . the independence proclamation started a 120-day transition period and the deployment of some 2,000 european union police and judicial officials to aid kosovo in the transition to independence . tens of thousands of albanians , a 90 percent majority in kosovo , began celebrating in capital pristina ahead of the declaration . flags of albania , the united states and western european countries were on display and waved everywhere , as police closed the central streets to traffic , allowing only pedestrians in . some of the people carried signs calling for a " celebration with dignity . " while albanians started celebrating already saturday night , the serbs in their enclaves remained calm even if wary .
their spiritual leader , the orthodox bishop artemije , dismissed the imminent declaration of independence , but denounced violence . " we are not calling anybody to a war , " artemije said after a prayer in the serb enclave gracanica , near the kosovo capital pristina .
" kosovo will always remain serbian and we regard this so- called declaration as occupation . " serbia slams eu mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars painted thanks to germany and other nations expected to recognize it serbian infrastructure minister velimir ilic , on a visit to gracanica , blasted the eu over its support for kosovo 's independence . " it is shame and disgrace what eu is doing , helping dismember serbia , " he said , referring to eu 's upcoming mission . serbia has already suspended its already cumbersome approach to eu membership over the mission , which it has fought diplomatically as a step to kosovo 's independence , and ilic signaled more of the same . " we will never cooperate with the eu mission in kosovo , " he said . ilic was just one of more than a dozen serbian government ministers and high-ranking officials who huddled with the serbs in their enclaves . serbia on thursday passed a resolution " annulling " the declaration of independence in advance .

" serbia calls declaration illegal while the united states and several european union members are quickly expected to recognize the new state , serbia is infuriated by the move and has been given strong support by russia , which called on the un and nato to annul kosovo 's independence . quickly after the deceleration , moscow called for a meeting of the united nations security council to discuss kosovo .
diplomats in new york said the council would hold an emergency meeting on sunday . " the decisions by the kosovo leadership create the risk of an escalation of tension and inter-ethnic violence in the province and of new conflict in the balkans , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . serbia 's president boris tadic said his country would never recognize the independence of kosovo . " the state of serbia will take responsible moves and will do everything in its power to annul this arbitrary and illegally proclaimed the independence of kosovo , " tadic said in a statement .
" serbia will not resort to violence and that is the only approach which can enable us to continue our legitimate fight to preserve the integrity of our country . " in a televised address , serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica called kosovo a " false state " supported unlawfully by the united states , which he said was " ready to violate the international order for its own military interests . " kosovo police had to stop several hundred former serbian army reservists - veterans of the 1998-99 kosovo war - from crossing into the territory ahead of the independence declaration . eu mission welcomed in pristina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrations have already begun in kosovo earlier , thaci said he would also welcome the law-implementing mission prepared by the european union to help kosovo along its first sovereign steps .
after slovenia , croatia , macedonia , bosnia and montenegro , kosovo is the sixth nation to emerge from the former yugoslav federation since 1991 . the independence proclamation started a 120-day transition period and the deployment of some 2,000 european union police and judicial officials to aid kosovo in the transition to independence . tens of thousands of albanians , a 90 percent majority in kosovo , began celebrating in capital pristina ahead of the declaration . flags of albania , the united states and western european countries were on display and waved everywhere , as police closed the central streets to traffic , allowing only pedestrians in . some of the people carried signs calling for a " celebration with dignity . " while albanians started celebrating already saturday night , the serbs in their enclaves remained calm even if wary .
their spiritual leader , the orthodox bishop artemije , dismissed the imminent declaration of independence , but denounced violence . " we are not calling anybody to a war , " artemije said after a prayer in the serb enclave gracanica , near the kosovo capital pristina .
" kosovo will always remain serbian and we regard this so- called declaration as occupation . " serbia slams eu mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars painted thanks to germany and other nations expected to recognize it serbian infrastructure minister velimir ilic , on a visit to gracanica , blasted the eu over its support for kosovo 's independence . " it is shame and disgrace what eu is doing , helping dismember serbia , " he said , referring to eu 's upcoming mission . serbia has already suspended its already cumbersome approach to eu membership over the mission , which it has fought diplomatically as a step to kosovo 's independence , and ilic signaled more of the same . " we will never cooperate with the eu mission in kosovo , " he said . ilic was just one of more than a dozen serbian government ministers and high-ranking officials who huddled with the serbs in their enclaves . serbia on thursday passed a resolution " annulling " the declaration of independence in advance .

experts say they share responsibility for the financial crisis as calls for political consequences are getting louder . until the outbreak of the subprime crisis , sector giants like standard & poor 's and moody 's in the us had enjoyed an aura of expertise and incorruptibility .
half a year later , they 're on the defensive .
the finance committee in the german parliament recently met with experts to discuss the role of the rating agencies in the crisis . the agencies have been aware of the need for change for a long time , said rating expert oliver everling , who 'd spoken with the committee .
he added that " the agencies definitely do n't bear responsibility alone for the subprime crisis . " failure of early warning system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aaa rating was n't always legitimate indeed , the agencies have tried to take other market participants to task .
everling said that banks bore a greater share of the blame for investing in risky products whose complexity they did n't understand , such as collateralized debt obligations -lrb- cdos -rrb- . even after the shaky bonds had lost their value and experts had warned that the us mortgage market was about to burst , the rating agencies were still granting mortgage derivatives the highest score of aaa .
it was n't until june 2007 that the ratings dropped , leaving the agencies scrambling to defend their role as the " early warning system . " furthermore , the rating agencies have had to refute accusations of corruption and conflict of interest .
according to critics , the credit monitors not only evaluated complex financial products but also advised the issuers who wanted to sell them . consulting claims undermine transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us crisis had ramifications across the world moody 's has rebuffed claims that it had been involved in consulting , but said it 's possible that " analytical discussions " took place with issuers or their advisors . " the line between dialogue and consultation is fluid , " everling said . the rating expert warned against hastily slapping regulations on the industry .
the consequence of the agencies ' mistakes should be more and not less rating - with greater competition , he said .
after all , standard & poor 's and moody 's dominate the global market with an 80 percent share , making them practically immune to national politics . instead , politicians around the world have to convince standard & poor 's and moody 's to participate in regulation negotiations , said everling - at the very least to improve their reputation for transparency . it 's not always clear where their ratings actually come from , say critics .
german chancellor angela merkel said last year during the financial turbulence that " nothing should be pulled out of a black box that no one understands . " caution rises as confidence lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the chaos have been spared ?
wuerzburg economist ekkehard wenger said he doubts that pressure from politicians can bring transparency back to the industry . " as long as the rating agencies are paid by those that sell the papers , not much will change , " wenger said . at the very least , however , the sector already seems to have lost the blind trust it once enjoyed . " the confidence of the market in credit ratings has suffered under the current situation , " conceded the fitch rating agency recently . as a result , banks and investors will have to take a closer look at who they entrust their money with , said franz waas , head of dekabank . " traditional credit analysis will become more significant again , " he said .

16 , by an international jury headed by renowned greek-born director costa-gavras .
it beat out productions from britain and hollywood for the berlin festival 's top honor . " it is a prize for brazilian film , " said padilha whose movie tells the story of a brutal police clean-up operation ahead of a 1997 visit to brazil by pope john paul ii . wearing a red berlinale scarf , padilha said winning the award would encourage him to continue to make critical films success in berlin coming against the backdrop of a renewed international recognition of latin american cinema . with no script and his actors largely improvising , padilha hoped to give his movie a documentary film , he said . the film has come under criticism for glorifying police brutality in rio de janeiro 's slums . it 's criticism that is misplaced and often coming from viewers who did n't understand the film , padilha said . " the film aims to explain how the state turns policemen either into corrupt people ... or worst of all violent people , " the 40-year-old director told reporters .
" the huge majority of brazilians understand that .
i do n't think it 's mysterious . " costa-gavras said the jury 's decision to award the golden bear to padilha was a unanimous decision . two awards for " there will be blood " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anderson also won in berlin eight years ago with " magnolia " the berlinale 's jury grand prize went to us oscar-winning documentary filmmaker errol morris ' " standard operating procedure , " a detailed examination into the shocking events surrounding iraq 's abu ghraib prison . a total of 21 films were competing for the festival 's top honors this year with " there will be blood " from us director paul anderson winning two awards - one for best director and for one for jonny greenwood for his musical score for the film . " there will be blood , " which stars daniel day-lewis as a ruthless oilman has been nominated for eight academy awards , which are to be presented in los angeles next week . but holding the two silver bears , anderson said , " that 's enough for me . "
anderson won a golden bear for " magnolia " eight years ago . some 400 films screened now in its 58th year , the berlinale is one of the world 's top three film festivals .
saturday 's berlinale awards were handed out in a hollywood-style gala ceremony . it has also been a successful festival for iranian cinema with one of the nation 's leading actors reza najie winning the berlin film festival 's top award for best actor . he played a stressed-out father trying to keep his family financially afloat in iranian director majid majidi 's light poignant comedy " the song of sparrows " -lrb- " avaze gonjeshk-ha " -rrb- . it was also announced saturday that iranian-born director hana makhmalbaf 's " buddha collapsed out of shame " -lrb- " buda az sharm foru rikht " -rrb- had won the 23rd film peace prize .
the prize is valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,337 -rrb- . makhmalbaf 's movie screened in the berlinale 's generation section , which is aimed at younger audiences , and focuses on a young afghan girl who lives in the mountains near the place where the 1,500-year- old buddha statues were blown up by the taliban in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hawkins was moved by the jury 's decision british actress sally hawkins goes home with the festival 's award for best actress for her role in british director mike leigh 's " happy go lucky " about a positive-thinking londoner called poppy . speaking after accepting the festival 's silver bear , najie said it was his destiny to come to berlin .
" thank you berlin , thank you cinema , " he told the awards ceremony in the german capital . hawkins said she had been completely overwhelmed after receiving the prize and had burst into tears after leaving the stage . the silver bear for best script went to chinese director wang xiaoshuai 's " in love we trust " -lrb- " zuo you " -rrb- about the tensions caused by a sick child . earlier saturday , the festival announced that " lemon tree " from israeli director eran riklis won the audience prize for one of the berlinale 's main sections . riklis ' film was not included in the berlinale 's main competition but was screened in the festival 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . the 11-day berlinale screened nearly 400 pictures and attracted 20,000 accredited visitors from 125 countries .

nine years after they again lost control over kosovo in war , serbs are now also losing even the formal hold over it . serbs first lost kosovo when their declining empire suffered a huge defeat to ottoman turks in a 1389 battle .
they waited five centuries , until 1912 to return the land to serbian rule . here are some of the key dates in kosovo 's history : 1945 - kosovo becomes a province of serbia , the largest republic of the new , communist yugoslav federation . 1975 - with yugoslavia 's new constitution , kosovo acquires wide-ranging autonomy and a self-governing authority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic said serbia would never give up control of kosovo 1989 - with slobodan milosevic rising to power on a surge of national awakening in serbia , belgrade scraps the autonomy of the increasingly restive kosovo . 1990 - on july 2 , legislators of the dissolved provincial parliament declare independence from serbia , an act which the international community ignores .
belgrade then dissolves kosovo 's autonomous assembly . 1998 - after five year of non-violent resistance through parallel institutions under the guidance of the moderate ibrahim rugova , the extremists among kosovo albanians take the initiative .
the separatist guerrilla kosovo liberation army uck launches attacks on police , military and serb civilians .
milosevic 's security apparatus cracks down on the rebels with massive force , effectively starting a war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato stationed thousands of troops in kosovo after the bombing campaign 1999 - talks between albanian leaders and belgrade - mediated in rambouillet , near paris by the contact group of big powers - fail to reach a solution by their conclusion on march 19 .
an escalation of violence in kosovo produces huge waves of refugees and on march 24 nato launches an aerial bombing campaign against yugoslavia to stop the bloodshed and the exodus .
after 78 days belgrade capitulates and orders its troops out of kosovo , making room for a nato-led peacekeeping mission of some 45,000 troops , but only after wrangling out a un resolution guaranteeing it sovereignty over kosovo .
the same resolution , 1244 , introduced a un administration to govern kosovo .
fearing reprisal attacks , thousands of serbs flee kosovo . 2001 - rugova named president in kosovo 's first general election . 2004 - on march 17 concerted kosovo-wide riots by albanians leave 19 dead and hundreds injured .
thousands of serbs flee their homes as hundreds of houses and dozens of churches are set on fire .
the eruption of violence was never properly explained and instigators were poorly prosecuted .
the incident was used by belgrade as an argument against kosovo 's independence . 2005 - kosovo prime minister ramush haradinaj resigns from office to face war crimes charges at the hague .
haradinaj strongly denies the charges ; the court has not issued a verdict .
the un security council agrees to talks on kosovo 's future .
former finnish president martti ahtissari is called on to mediate the talks . 2006 - in february in vienna the un launches the first direct talks on the status of kosovo between belgrade and the meanwhile fully-fledged kosovo authorities .
the vienna talks produce no result . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official declaration of independence came on feb .
17 , 2008 2007 - unable to find a negotiated solution to kosovo 's future status , ahtissari proposes supervised independence for the province .
another round of last-ditch talks , organized after russia shoots down an attempt at releasing kosovo from serbia 's sovereignty in the un , end in a deadlock by the dec .
10 deadline .
this paves the way for a unilateral declaration of independence by pristina with the support of the united states and several european union nations . 2008 - former guerrilla commander hashim thaci is elected prime minister and promises kosovo will declare independence in coordination with western governments .

experts say they share responsibility for the financial crisis as calls for political consequences are getting louder . until the outbreak of the subprime crisis , sector giants like standard & poor 's and moody 's in the us had enjoyed an aura of expertise and incorruptibility .
half a year later , they 're on the defensive .

17 .
ten years after belgrade crushed a rebellion in kosovo , parliamentarians proclaimed the republic of kosovo and sovereign state . the parliament in kosovo voted in favor of independence from serbia , bringing the curtain down on a long chapter in the violent break-up of yugoslavia . " from today onwards , kosovo is proud , independent and free , " said prime minister hashim thaci .
" we never lost faith in the dream that one day we would stand among the free nations of the world , and today we do . " kosovo will be a " society that respects human dignity " and be committed to dealing with the " painful legacy of the recent past , in a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness , " thaci added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the members of parliament present approved independence for kosovo all 109 deputies present at the session in the capital pristina voted in favor with a show of hands .
eleven deputies from ethnic minorities , including serbs , were absent .
the parliament also approved a new flag for the landlocked state of about 2 million people . " today , a new life begins , " the kosovo daily koha ditore wrote .
" the past should not be forgotten , but it belongs to the past , and should be forgiven . " serbia calls declaration illegal while the united states and several european union members are quickly expected to recognize the new state , serbia is infuriated by the move and has been given strong support by russia , which called on the un and nato to annul kosovo 's independence . quickly after the deceleration , moscow called for a meeting of the united nations security council to discuss kosovo .
diplomats in new york said the council would hold an emergency meeting on sunday . " the decisions by the kosovo leadership create the risk of an escalation of tension and inter-ethnic violence in the province and of new conflict in the balkans , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . serbia 's president boris tadic said his country would never recognize the independence of kosovo . " the state of serbia will take responsible moves and will do everything in its power to annul this arbitrary and illegally proclaimed the independence of kosovo , " tadic said in a statement .
" serbia will not resort to violence and that is the only approach which can enable us to continue our legitimate fight to preserve the integrity of our country . " in a televised address , serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica called kosovo a " false state " supported unlawfully by the united states , which he said was " ready to violate the international order for its own military interests . " kosovo police had to stop several hundred former serbian army reservists - veterans of the 1998-99 kosovo war - from crossing into the territory ahead of the independence declaration . eu mission welcomed in pristina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrations have already begun in kosovo earlier , thaci said he would also welcome the law-implementing mission prepared by the european union to help kosovo along its first sovereign steps .
after slovenia , croatia , macedonia , bosnia and montenegro , kosovo is the sixth nation to emerge from the former yugoslav federation since 1991 . the independence proclamation started a 120-day transition period and the deployment of some 2,000 european union police and judicial officials to aid kosovo in the transition to independence . tens of thousands of albanians , a 90 percent majority in kosovo , began celebrating in capital pristina ahead of the declaration . flags of albania , the united states and western european countries were on display and waved everywhere , as police closed the central streets to traffic , allowing only pedestrians in . some of the people carried signs calling for a " celebration with dignity . " while albanians started celebrating already saturday night , the serbs in their enclaves remained calm even if wary .
their spiritual leader , the orthodox bishop artemije , dismissed the imminent declaration of independence , but denounced violence . " we are not calling anybody to a war , " artemije said after a prayer in the serb enclave gracanica , near the kosovo capital pristina .
" kosovo will always remain serbian and we regard this so- called declaration as occupation . " serbia slams eu mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars painted thanks to germany and other nations expected to recognize it serbian infrastructure minister velimir ilic , on a visit to gracanica , blasted the eu over its support for kosovo 's independence . " it is shame and disgrace what eu is doing , helping dismember serbia , " he said , referring to eu 's upcoming mission . serbia has already suspended its already cumbersome approach to eu membership over the mission , which it has fought diplomatically as a step to kosovo 's independence , and ilic signaled more of the same . " we will never cooperate with the eu mission in kosovo , " he said . ilic was just one of more than a dozen serbian government ministers and high-ranking officials who huddled with the serbs in their enclaves . serbia on thursday passed a resolution " annulling " the declaration of independence in advance .

" from today onwards , kosovo is proud , independent and free , " said prime minister hashim thaci .
" we never lost faith in the dream that one day we would stand among the free nations of the world , and today we do .

" the past should not be forgotten , but it belongs to the past , and should be forgiven . " serbia calls declaration illegal while the united states and several european union members are quickly expected to recognize the new state , serbia is infuriated by the move and has been given strong support by russia , which called on the un and nato to annul kosovo 's independence . quickly after the deceleration , moscow called for a meeting of the united nations security council to discuss kosovo .
diplomats in new york said the council would hold an emergency meeting on sunday . " the decisions by the kosovo leadership create the risk of an escalation of tension and inter-ethnic violence in the province and of new conflict in the balkans , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . serbia 's president boris tadic said his country would never recognize the independence of kosovo . " the state of serbia will take responsible moves and will do everything in its power to annul this arbitrary and illegally proclaimed the independence of kosovo , " tadic said in a statement .

16 , by an international jury headed by renowned greek-born director costa-gavras .
it beat out productions from britain and hollywood for the berlin festival 's top honor . " it is a prize for brazilian film , " said padilha whose movie tells the story of a brutal police clean-up operation ahead of a 1997 visit to brazil by pope john paul ii . wearing a red berlinale scarf , padilha said winning the award would encourage him to continue to make critical films success in berlin coming against the backdrop of a renewed international recognition of latin american cinema . with no script and his actors largely improvising , padilha hoped to give his movie a documentary film , he said . the film has come under criticism for glorifying police brutality in rio de janeiro 's slums . it 's criticism that is misplaced and often coming from viewers who did n't understand the film , padilha said . " the film aims to explain how the state turns policemen either into corrupt people ... or worst of all violent people , " the 40-year-old director told reporters .
" the huge majority of brazilians understand that .
i do n't think it 's mysterious . " costa-gavras said the jury 's decision to award the golden bear to padilha was a unanimous decision . two awards for " there will be blood " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anderson also won in berlin eight years ago with " magnolia " the berlinale 's jury grand prize went to us oscar-winning documentary filmmaker errol morris ' " standard operating procedure , " a detailed examination into the shocking events surrounding iraq 's abu ghraib prison . a total of 21 films were competing for the festival 's top honors this year with " there will be blood " from us director paul anderson winning two awards - one for best director and for one for jonny greenwood for his musical score for the film . " there will be blood , " which stars daniel day-lewis as a ruthless oilman has been nominated for eight academy awards , which are to be presented in los angeles next week . but holding the two silver bears , anderson said , " that 's enough for me . "
anderson won a golden bear for " magnolia " eight years ago . some 400 films screened now in its 58th year , the berlinale is one of the world 's top three film festivals .
saturday 's berlinale awards were handed out in a hollywood-style gala ceremony . it has also been a successful festival for iranian cinema with one of the nation 's leading actors reza najie winning the berlin film festival 's top award for best actor . he played a stressed-out father trying to keep his family financially afloat in iranian director majid majidi 's light poignant comedy " the song of sparrows " -lrb- " avaze gonjeshk-ha " -rrb- . it was also announced saturday that iranian-born director hana makhmalbaf 's " buddha collapsed out of shame " -lrb- " buda az sharm foru rikht " -rrb- had won the 23rd film peace prize .
the prize is valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,337 -rrb- . makhmalbaf 's movie screened in the berlinale 's generation section , which is aimed at younger audiences , and focuses on a young afghan girl who lives in the mountains near the place where the 1,500-year- old buddha statues were blown up by the taliban in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hawkins was moved by the jury 's decision british actress sally hawkins goes home with the festival 's award for best actress for her role in british director mike leigh 's " happy go lucky " about a positive-thinking londoner called poppy . speaking after accepting the festival 's silver bear , najie said it was his destiny to come to berlin .
" thank you berlin , thank you cinema , " he told the awards ceremony in the german capital . hawkins said she had been completely overwhelmed after receiving the prize and had burst into tears after leaving the stage . the silver bear for best script went to chinese director wang xiaoshuai 's " in love we trust " -lrb- " zuo you " -rrb- about the tensions caused by a sick child . earlier saturday , the festival announced that " lemon tree " from israeli director eran riklis won the audience prize for one of the berlinale 's main sections . riklis ' film was not included in the berlinale 's main competition but was screened in the festival 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . the 11-day berlinale screened nearly 400 pictures and attracted 20,000 accredited visitors from 125 countries .

experts say they share responsibility for the financial crisis as calls for political consequences are getting louder . until the outbreak of the subprime crisis , sector giants like standard & poor 's and moody 's in the us had enjoyed an aura of expertise and incorruptibility .
half a year later , they 're on the defensive .
the finance committee in the german parliament recently met with experts to discuss the role of the rating agencies in the crisis . the agencies have been aware of the need for change for a long time , said rating expert oliver everling , who 'd spoken with the committee .
he added that " the agencies definitely do n't bear responsibility alone for the subprime crisis . " failure of early warning system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aaa rating was n't always legitimate indeed , the agencies have tried to take other market participants to task .
everling said that banks bore a greater share of the blame for investing in risky products whose complexity they did n't understand , such as collateralized debt obligations -lrb- cdos -rrb- . even after the shaky bonds had lost their value and experts had warned that the us mortgage market was about to burst , the rating agencies were still granting mortgage derivatives the highest score of aaa .
it was n't until june 2007 that the ratings dropped , leaving the agencies scrambling to defend their role as the " early warning system . " furthermore , the rating agencies have had to refute accusations of corruption and conflict of interest .
according to critics , the credit monitors not only evaluated complex financial products but also advised the issuers who wanted to sell them . consulting claims undermine transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us crisis had ramifications across the world moody 's has rebuffed claims that it had been involved in consulting , but said it 's possible that " analytical discussions " took place with issuers or their advisors . " the line between dialogue and consultation is fluid , " everling said . the rating expert warned against hastily slapping regulations on the industry .
the consequence of the agencies ' mistakes should be more and not less rating - with greater competition , he said .
after all , standard & poor 's and moody 's dominate the global market with an 80 percent share , making them practically immune to national politics . instead , politicians around the world have to convince standard & poor 's and moody 's to participate in regulation negotiations , said everling - at the very least to improve their reputation for transparency . it 's not always clear where their ratings actually come from , say critics .
german chancellor angela merkel said last year during the financial turbulence that " nothing should be pulled out of a black box that no one understands . " caution rises as confidence lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the chaos have been spared ?
wuerzburg economist ekkehard wenger said he doubts that pressure from politicians can bring transparency back to the industry . " as long as the rating agencies are paid by those that sell the papers , not much will change , " wenger said . at the very least , however , the sector already seems to have lost the blind trust it once enjoyed . " the confidence of the market in credit ratings has suffered under the current situation , " conceded the fitch rating agency recently . as a result , banks and investors will have to take a closer look at who they entrust their money with , said franz waas , head of dekabank .

the finance committee in the german parliament recently met with experts to discuss the role of the rating agencies in the crisis . the agencies have been aware of the need for change for a long time , said rating expert oliver everling , who 'd spoken with the committee .
he added that " the agencies definitely do n't bear responsibility alone for the subprime crisis . " failure of early warning system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aaa rating was n't always legitimate indeed , the agencies have tried to take other market participants to task .
everling said that banks bore a greater share of the blame for investing in risky products whose complexity they did n't understand , such as collateralized debt obligations -lrb- cdos -rrb- . even after the shaky bonds had lost their value and experts had warned that the us mortgage market was about to burst , the rating agencies were still granting mortgage derivatives the highest score of aaa .
it was n't until june 2007 that the ratings dropped , leaving the agencies scrambling to defend their role as the " early warning system . " furthermore , the rating agencies have had to refute accusations of corruption and conflict of interest .
according to critics , the credit monitors not only evaluated complex financial products but also advised the issuers who wanted to sell them . consulting claims undermine transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us crisis had ramifications across the world moody 's has rebuffed claims that it had been involved in consulting , but said it 's possible that " analytical discussions " took place with issuers or their advisors . " the line between dialogue and consultation is fluid , " everling said . the rating expert warned against hastily slapping regulations on the industry .
the consequence of the agencies ' mistakes should be more and not less rating - with greater competition , he said .
after all , standard & poor 's and moody 's dominate the global market with an 80 percent share , making them practically immune to national politics . instead , politicians around the world have to convince standard & poor 's and moody 's to participate in regulation negotiations , said everling - at the very least to improve their reputation for transparency . it 's not always clear where their ratings actually come from , say critics .
german chancellor angela merkel said last year during the financial turbulence that " nothing should be pulled out of a black box that no one understands . " caution rises as confidence lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the chaos have been spared ?
wuerzburg economist ekkehard wenger said he doubts that pressure from politicians can bring transparency back to the industry . " as long as the rating agencies are paid by those that sell the papers , not much will change , " wenger said . at the very least , however , the sector already seems to have lost the blind trust it once enjoyed . " the confidence of the market in credit ratings has suffered under the current situation , " conceded the fitch rating agency recently . as a result , banks and investors will have to take a closer look at who they entrust their money with , said franz waas , head of dekabank .

16 , by an international jury headed by renowned greek-born director costa-gavras .
it beat out productions from britain and hollywood for the berlin festival 's top honor . " it is a prize for brazilian film , " said padilha whose movie tells the story of a brutal police clean-up operation ahead of a 1997 visit to brazil by pope john paul ii . wearing a red berlinale scarf , padilha said winning the award would encourage him to continue to make critical films success in berlin coming against the backdrop of a renewed international recognition of latin american cinema . with no script and his actors largely improvising , padilha hoped to give his movie a documentary film , he said . the film has come under criticism for glorifying police brutality in rio de janeiro 's slums . it 's criticism that is misplaced and often coming from viewers who did n't understand the film , padilha said . " the film aims to explain how the state turns policemen either into corrupt people ... or worst of all violent people , " the 40-year-old director told reporters .
" the huge majority of brazilians understand that .
i do n't think it 's mysterious . " costa-gavras said the jury 's decision to award the golden bear to padilha was a unanimous decision . two awards for " there will be blood " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anderson also won in berlin eight years ago with " magnolia " the berlinale 's jury grand prize went to us oscar-winning documentary filmmaker errol morris ' " standard operating procedure , " a detailed examination into the shocking events surrounding iraq 's abu ghraib prison . a total of 21 films were competing for the festival 's top honors this year with " there will be blood " from us director paul anderson winning two awards - one for best director and for one for jonny greenwood for his musical score for the film . " there will be blood , " which stars daniel day-lewis as a ruthless oilman has been nominated for eight academy awards , which are to be presented in los angeles next week . but holding the two silver bears , anderson said , " that 's enough for me . "
anderson won a golden bear for " magnolia " eight years ago . some 400 films screened now in its 58th year , the berlinale is one of the world 's top three film festivals .
saturday 's berlinale awards were handed out in a hollywood-style gala ceremony . it has also been a successful festival for iranian cinema with one of the nation 's leading actors reza najie winning the berlin film festival 's top award for best actor . he played a stressed-out father trying to keep his family financially afloat in iranian director majid majidi 's light poignant comedy " the song of sparrows " -lrb- " avaze gonjeshk-ha " -rrb- . it was also announced saturday that iranian-born director hana makhmalbaf 's " buddha collapsed out of shame " -lrb- " buda az sharm foru rikht " -rrb- had won the 23rd film peace prize .
the prize is valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,337 -rrb- . makhmalbaf 's movie screened in the berlinale 's generation section , which is aimed at younger audiences , and focuses on a young afghan girl who lives in the mountains near the place where the 1,500-year- old buddha statues were blown up by the taliban in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hawkins was moved by the jury 's decision british actress sally hawkins goes home with the festival 's award for best actress for her role in british director mike leigh 's " happy go lucky " about a positive-thinking londoner called poppy . speaking after accepting the festival 's silver bear , najie said it was his destiny to come to berlin .
" thank you berlin , thank you cinema , " he told the awards ceremony in the german capital . hawkins said she had been completely overwhelmed after receiving the prize and had burst into tears after leaving the stage . the silver bear for best script went to chinese director wang xiaoshuai 's " in love we trust " -lrb- " zuo you " -rrb- about the tensions caused by a sick child . earlier saturday , the festival announced that " lemon tree " from israeli director eran riklis won the audience prize for one of the berlinale 's main sections . riklis ' film was not included in the berlinale 's main competition but was screened in the festival 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . the 11-day berlinale screened nearly 400 pictures and attracted 20,000 accredited visitors from 125 countries .
it concludes on sunday with repeat showings of some of the festival 's most popular films . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , by an international jury headed by renowned greek-born director costa-gavras .
it beat out productions from britain and hollywood for the berlin festival 's top honor . " it is a prize for brazilian film , " said padilha whose movie tells the story of a brutal police clean-up operation ahead of a 1997 visit to brazil by pope john paul ii . wearing a red berlinale scarf , padilha said winning the award would encourage him to continue to make critical films success in berlin coming against the backdrop of a renewed international recognition of latin american cinema . with no script and his actors largely improvising , padilha hoped to give his movie a documentary film , he said . the film has come under criticism for glorifying police brutality in rio de janeiro 's slums . it 's criticism that is misplaced and often coming from viewers who did n't understand the film , padilha said . " the film aims to explain how the state turns policemen either into corrupt people ... or worst of all violent people , " the 40-year-old director told reporters .
" the huge majority of brazilians understand that .
i do n't think it 's mysterious . " costa-gavras said the jury 's decision to award the golden bear to padilha was a unanimous decision . two awards for " there will be blood " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anderson also won in berlin eight years ago with " magnolia " the berlinale 's jury grand prize went to us oscar-winning documentary filmmaker errol morris ' " standard operating procedure , " a detailed examination into the shocking events surrounding iraq 's abu ghraib prison . a total of 21 films were competing for the festival 's top honors this year with " there will be blood " from us director paul anderson winning two awards - one for best director and for one for jonny greenwood for his musical score for the film . " there will be blood , " which stars daniel day-lewis as a ruthless oilman has been nominated for eight academy awards , which are to be presented in los angeles next week . but holding the two silver bears , anderson said , " that 's enough for me . "
anderson won a golden bear for " magnolia " eight years ago . some 400 films screened now in its 58th year , the berlinale is one of the world 's top three film festivals .
saturday 's berlinale awards were handed out in a hollywood-style gala ceremony . it has also been a successful festival for iranian cinema with one of the nation 's leading actors reza najie winning the berlin film festival 's top award for best actor . he played a stressed-out father trying to keep his family financially afloat in iranian director majid majidi 's light poignant comedy " the song of sparrows " -lrb- " avaze gonjeshk-ha " -rrb- . it was also announced saturday that iranian-born director hana makhmalbaf 's " buddha collapsed out of shame " -lrb- " buda az sharm foru rikht " -rrb- had won the 23rd film peace prize .
the prize is valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,337 -rrb- . makhmalbaf 's movie screened in the berlinale 's generation section , which is aimed at younger audiences , and focuses on a young afghan girl who lives in the mountains near the place where the 1,500-year- old buddha statues were blown up by the taliban in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hawkins was moved by the jury 's decision british actress sally hawkins goes home with the festival 's award for best actress for her role in british director mike leigh 's " happy go lucky " about a positive-thinking londoner called poppy . speaking after accepting the festival 's silver bear , najie said it was his destiny to come to berlin .
" thank you berlin , thank you cinema , " he told the awards ceremony in the german capital . hawkins said she had been completely overwhelmed after receiving the prize and had burst into tears after leaving the stage . the silver bear for best script went to chinese director wang xiaoshuai 's " in love we trust " -lrb- " zuo you " -rrb- about the tensions caused by a sick child . earlier saturday , the festival announced that " lemon tree " from israeli director eran riklis won the audience prize for one of the berlinale 's main sections . riklis ' film was not included in the berlinale 's main competition but was screened in the festival 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . the 11-day berlinale screened nearly 400 pictures and attracted 20,000 accredited visitors from 125 countries .
it concludes on sunday with repeat showings of some of the festival 's most popular films . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 17.02.2008 violent brazilian police brutality film wins berlinale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha 's award came as latin american cinema receives renewed international interest a police political thriller by brazilian director jose padilha won the berlin film festival 's coveted golden bear for best film . the film , " tropa de elite " -lrb- " elite squad " -rrb- has been a box-office hit in brazil and was chosen on saturday , feb .
16 , by an international jury headed by renowned greek-born director costa-gavras .
it beat out productions from britain and hollywood for the berlin festival 's top honor . " it is a prize for brazilian film , " said padilha whose movie tells the story of a brutal police clean-up operation ahead of a 1997 visit to brazil by pope john paul ii . wearing a red berlinale scarf , padilha said winning the award would encourage him to continue to make critical films success in berlin coming against the backdrop of a renewed international recognition of latin american cinema . with no script and his actors largely improvising , padilha hoped to give his movie a documentary film , he said . the film has come under criticism for glorifying police brutality in rio de janeiro 's slums . it 's criticism that is misplaced and often coming from viewers who did n't understand the film , padilha said . " the film aims to explain how the state turns policemen either into corrupt people ... or worst of all violent people , " the 40-year-old director told reporters .
" the huge majority of brazilians understand that .
i do n't think it 's mysterious . " costa-gavras said the jury 's decision to award the golden bear to padilha was a unanimous decision . two awards for " there will be blood " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anderson also won in berlin eight years ago with " magnolia " the berlinale 's jury grand prize went to us oscar-winning documentary filmmaker errol morris ' " standard operating procedure , " a detailed examination into the shocking events surrounding iraq 's abu ghraib prison . a total of 21 films were competing for the festival 's top honors this year with " there will be blood " from us director paul anderson winning two awards - one for best director and for one for jonny greenwood for his musical score for the film . " there will be blood , " which stars daniel day-lewis as a ruthless oilman has been nominated for eight academy awards , which are to be presented in los angeles next week . but holding the two silver bears , anderson said , " that 's enough for me . "
anderson won a golden bear for " magnolia " eight years ago . some 400 films screened now in its 58th year , the berlinale is one of the world 's top three film festivals .
saturday 's berlinale awards were handed out in a hollywood-style gala ceremony . it has also been a successful festival for iranian cinema with one of the nation 's leading actors reza najie winning the berlin film festival 's top award for best actor . he played a stressed-out father trying to keep his family financially afloat in iranian director majid majidi 's light poignant comedy " the song of sparrows " -lrb- " avaze gonjeshk-ha " -rrb- . it was also announced saturday that iranian-born director hana makhmalbaf 's " buddha collapsed out of shame " -lrb- " buda az sharm foru rikht " -rrb- had won the 23rd film peace prize .
the prize is valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,337 -rrb- . makhmalbaf 's movie screened in the berlinale 's generation section , which is aimed at younger audiences , and focuses on a young afghan girl who lives in the mountains near the place where the 1,500-year- old buddha statues were blown up by the taliban in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hawkins was moved by the jury 's decision british actress sally hawkins goes home with the festival 's award for best actress for her role in british director mike leigh 's " happy go lucky " about a positive-thinking londoner called poppy . speaking after accepting the festival 's silver bear , najie said it was his destiny to come to berlin .
" thank you berlin , thank you cinema , " he told the awards ceremony in the german capital . hawkins said she had been completely overwhelmed after receiving the prize and had burst into tears after leaving the stage . the silver bear for best script went to chinese director wang xiaoshuai 's " in love we trust " -lrb- " zuo you " -rrb- about the tensions caused by a sick child . earlier saturday , the festival announced that " lemon tree " from israeli director eran riklis won the audience prize for one of the berlinale 's main sections . riklis ' film was not included in the berlinale 's main competition but was screened in the festival 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . the 11-day berlinale screened nearly 400 pictures and attracted 20,000 accredited visitors from 125 countries .
it concludes on sunday with repeat showings of some of the festival 's most popular films . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , by an international jury headed by renowned greek-born director costa-gavras .
it beat out productions from britain and hollywood for the berlin festival 's top honor . " it is a prize for brazilian film , " said padilha whose movie tells the story of a brutal police clean-up operation ahead of a 1997 visit to brazil by pope john paul ii . wearing a red berlinale scarf , padilha said winning the award would encourage him to continue to make critical films success in berlin coming against the backdrop of a renewed international recognition of latin american cinema . with no script and his actors largely improvising , padilha hoped to give his movie a documentary film , he said . the film has come under criticism for glorifying police brutality in rio de janeiro 's slums . it 's criticism that is misplaced and often coming from viewers who did n't understand the film , padilha said . " the film aims to explain how the state turns policemen either into corrupt people ... or worst of all violent people , " the 40-year-old director told reporters .
" the huge majority of brazilians understand that .
i do n't think it 's mysterious . " costa-gavras said the jury 's decision to award the golden bear to padilha was a unanimous decision . two awards for " there will be blood " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anderson also won in berlin eight years ago with " magnolia " the berlinale 's jury grand prize went to us oscar-winning documentary filmmaker errol morris ' " standard operating procedure , " a detailed examination into the shocking events surrounding iraq 's abu ghraib prison . a total of 21 films were competing for the festival 's top honors this year with " there will be blood " from us director paul anderson winning two awards - one for best director and for one for jonny greenwood for his musical score for the film . " there will be blood , " which stars daniel day-lewis as a ruthless oilman has been nominated for eight academy awards , which are to be presented in los angeles next week . but holding the two silver bears , anderson said , " that 's enough for me . "
anderson won a golden bear for " magnolia " eight years ago . some 400 films screened now in its 58th year , the berlinale is one of the world 's top three film festivals .
saturday 's berlinale awards were handed out in a hollywood-style gala ceremony . it has also been a successful festival for iranian cinema with one of the nation 's leading actors reza najie winning the berlin film festival 's top award for best actor . he played a stressed-out father trying to keep his family financially afloat in iranian director majid majidi 's light poignant comedy " the song of sparrows " -lrb- " avaze gonjeshk-ha " -rrb- . it was also announced saturday that iranian-born director hana makhmalbaf 's " buddha collapsed out of shame " -lrb- " buda az sharm foru rikht " -rrb- had won the 23rd film peace prize .
the prize is valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,337 -rrb- . makhmalbaf 's movie screened in the berlinale 's generation section , which is aimed at younger audiences , and focuses on a young afghan girl who lives in the mountains near the place where the 1,500-year- old buddha statues were blown up by the taliban in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hawkins was moved by the jury 's decision british actress sally hawkins goes home with the festival 's award for best actress for her role in british director mike leigh 's " happy go lucky " about a positive-thinking londoner called poppy . speaking after accepting the festival 's silver bear , najie said it was his destiny to come to berlin .
" thank you berlin , thank you cinema , " he told the awards ceremony in the german capital . hawkins said she had been completely overwhelmed after receiving the prize and had burst into tears after leaving the stage . the silver bear for best script went to chinese director wang xiaoshuai 's " in love we trust " -lrb- " zuo you " -rrb- about the tensions caused by a sick child . earlier saturday , the festival announced that " lemon tree " from israeli director eran riklis won the audience prize for one of the berlinale 's main sections . riklis ' film was not included in the berlinale 's main competition but was screened in the festival 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . the 11-day berlinale screened nearly 400 pictures and attracted 20,000 accredited visitors from 125 countries .
it concludes on sunday with repeat showings of some of the festival 's most popular films . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 17.02.2008 eu moves to protect ageing rockers with royalties in retirement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite already being extremely wealthy , the stones will also earn more from the plan it may not be something the rolling stones have to worry about , but many rock stars face cash concerns in their old age .
the eu is therefore planning to help out retired rockers , who never made millions to live on . many musicians and singers hit the big time in their 20s , and often even earlier .
under current rules , their airplay royalties stop coming in just as they retire , hitting them particularly hard .
that 's why the european commission announced this week that under a new proposal , european musicians and singers would see the copyright on their recorded performances extended to 95 years from the current level of 50 .
the eu 's move to help ageing rockers and other artists beat the financial blues during retirement would be ready for formal adoption by the european commission in the middle of the year , the european union 's executive arm said .
" if nothing is done , thousands of european performers who recorded in the late fifties and sixties will lose all of their airplay royalties over the next 10 years , " eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy said .
presenting the proposal , mccreevy said that he had found " no convincing reason " why composers should currently enjoy much longer copyright protection than performers .
commission moves to protect performers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles aznavour wo n't go hungry in his retirement " it is the performer who gives life to the composition and while most of us have no idea who wrote our favorite song , we can usually name the performer , " mccreevy said .
" i strongly believe that copyright protection for europe 's performers represents a moral right to control the use of their work and earn a living from their performances . "
in the united states , performers already enjoy copyright protection for 95 years .
in the european union , such protection has been limited to 50 years since the introduction of a 1993 law .
mccreevy acknowledged that he was less worried about big crowd-pullers such as britain 's ageless pop star cliff richard and french crooner charles aznavour than " the thousands of anonymous session musicians who contributed to sound recordings in the late fifties and sixties .
" they will no longer get airplay royalties from their recordings but these royalties are often their sole pension , " he said .
the aepo-artis association , representing several performer organizations at the european level , welcomed that brussels had recognized " the creative gain that performers bring . "
however , " some things still need to be clarified , " said guenaelle collet at apos-artis , citing in particular a proposal that record companies would have to contribute to a special fund for session musicians .
eu to investigate private copying and rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tokio hotel can look forward to decades of royalties mccreevy also said that he wanted to reopen consultations over levies for being able to make copies of a performance on computers , digital and other music players and which vary widely among countries .
" there can be no question of calling into doubt the entitlement of rights holders to compensation for private copying , " he said .
" at the same time there is a need to look at how the levies are applied in practice . "
collet warned that " performers will be extremely cautious about the question . "
while glad that the commission was consulting the industry , veronique desbrosses , secretary general of the european grouping of societies of authors and composers , said : " there 's no viable alternative to private copying levies .

europe is paying more attention to both the potential and the problems of africa .
deutsche welle spoke with german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about two nations with troubled pasts : uganda and rwanda . german president horst koehler and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have both recently returned from trips to africa , where they pledged their support to the continent . deutsche welle asked german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about the situation in uganda and rwanda in particular . deutsche welle : horst koehler recently made his fifth trip to africa as germany 's president .
what were your impressions ? georg boomgaarden : in uganda and rwanda , the president visited two nations that suffered for years of civil war and are still influenced by the traumas resulting from internal strife .
so the trip was overshadowed by the past and the search for ways for these countries to find reconciliation and peace .
i think it was a very political trip . reconciliation is considered a precondition for peace and development .
are uganda and rwanda examples of that ? i think it 's too early to say .
we spoke with representatives of the president and the civilian population , and we again saw how difficult the process is .
it 's just beginning in uganda , and only time will tell whether it 's a success . by african standards , rwanda has seen fairly good economic development .
there 's a respectable amount of growth .
but the shadows of the past are still there .
together with president koehler we visited a so-called gachacha court , a traditional body that tries to combine legal justice and reconciliation .
that 's one possible path .
on the other hand , there is the international rwanda tribunal , which is looking at the 60 worst cases .
i think it will definitely take a generation or more before the wounds will heal .
the point now is to just co-exist in peace . traditional forms of justice sometimes have more to do with dealing with trauma than reaching legal decisions .
to what extent can international law be hooked up with local tradition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boomgaarden , right , is deputy to foreign minister steinmeier i think we 've been searching very intensively over the past few decades for ways of doing this .
the cases were all very different , and the earliest was perhaps the franco era in spain .
in bosnia and kosovo we also had cases where one part of a country 's population attacked another one .
and we 've seen similar things in various african and latin american countries . justice alone is n't sufficient to deal with the past .
on the one hand , it 's important to take away from those who rape women , kill children , burn down homes and commit acts of murder the sense of security that says there 's always an amnesty , and no one will be punished .
on the other hand , the desire for peace is enormous , as we just saw in uganda , so that there 's a tendency to sweep everything under the rug in the interests of harmony .
they say : if justice leads to a continuation of war , then we do n't want justice .
ultimately it 's an insoluble dilemma .
it 's always a political decision when it 's time for one approach or when it 's time for the other . the international community has a responsibility to prevent violations of human rights .
yet , in many cases , we have a hard time living up to this duty .
in rwanda , for example , the international community allowed genocide to go on for more than 100 days .
why ca n't we react more quickly ? one problem is that we germans represent 80 million people out of a total of 7.5 billion .
it would be a bit arrogant to think that we germans could force the rest of the world onto the path to virtue .
but that does n't change what you were saying .
in rwanda , the international community failed in a very scandalous way .
the only thing comparable , and that on a much smaller scale , was our failure in srebrenica , and both gave us lots to think about .
it gave rise to the idea that in such extreme and clear cases the international community has to feel responsible politically and intervene .
if a million people are being massacred , it 's no longer one nation 's internal affair .
on the other hand , in every individual case , we have to look at what we can do and whether we have the right instruments for it .
in the case of rwanda , the un should never have withdrawn .
it should have intervened .
that is absolutely clear .
but it 's another question whether the un can simultaneously intervene in all the conflicts going on in the world without over-stretching itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uganda is another african nation with which germany wants closer ties as you mentioned , rwanda 's president paul kagame has pursued an ambitious program of development .
but is not the other side of the coin a relatively authoritarian stance toward domestic politics , and especially toward the media ? in the end , the people in the countries themselves have to decide .
in rwanda , i had the feeling when we talked not to the government , but to journalists and people on the margins of power , that they thought more freedom for the press would be a good idea .
on the other hand , the same people said : " do n't forget that the press played a huge role in the genocide . "
back then radio stations broadcast messages like : " kill your neighbors .
there are people from other ethnic groups .
massacre them , chop off their heads . "
and if this is the role of the press , then i understand why fears persist . germany has been very present in africa and is increasing its activities there .
why is that ? you only need to look at the map .
africa is a huge continent with gigantic problems and a population of 900 million people .
if things are n't going well , and africa ca n't cope with its own problems , they hardly have a choice but to solve them by exporting them to us .
the problem of illegal migrants actually brought us closer to africa .
another thing is that we are encountering more and more nations in africa with a healthy sense of self-confidence .
they 're increasingly following their own policies , and in the future we 'll be increasingly connected to them by the need for natural resources and other interests . in terms of development , we 've been active for a long time in africa .
but in 2008 we 're beginning a special program .
we 'll be opening new goethe institutes in dar es salaam and luanda , that is in tanzania and angola .
and the goethe institute will also be represented in rwanda in the form of a field office of the goethe institute in nairobi .
that signals that we 're looking for more dialogue with africa .
we hope that with cultural exchanges of this kind we 'll be better able to master crises by talking to one another . interview : ute schaeffer -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europe is paying more attention to both the potential and the problems of africa .
deutsche welle spoke with german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about two nations with troubled pasts : uganda and rwanda . german president horst koehler and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have both recently returned from trips to africa , where they pledged their support to the continent . deutsche welle asked german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about the situation in uganda and rwanda in particular . deutsche welle : horst koehler recently made his fifth trip to africa as germany 's president .
what were your impressions ? georg boomgaarden : in uganda and rwanda , the president visited two nations that suffered for years of civil war and are still influenced by the traumas resulting from internal strife .
so the trip was overshadowed by the past and the search for ways for these countries to find reconciliation and peace .
i think it was a very political trip . reconciliation is considered a precondition for peace and development .
are uganda and rwanda examples of that ? i think it 's too early to say .
we spoke with representatives of the president and the civilian population , and we again saw how difficult the process is .
it 's just beginning in uganda , and only time will tell whether it 's a success . by african standards , rwanda has seen fairly good economic development .
there 's a respectable amount of growth .
but the shadows of the past are still there .
together with president koehler we visited a so-called gachacha court , a traditional body that tries to combine legal justice and reconciliation .
that 's one possible path .
on the other hand , there is the international rwanda tribunal , which is looking at the 60 worst cases .
i think it will definitely take a generation or more before the wounds will heal .
the point now is to just co-exist in peace . traditional forms of justice sometimes have more to do with dealing with trauma than reaching legal decisions .
to what extent can international law be hooked up with local tradition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boomgaarden , right , is deputy to foreign minister steinmeier i think we 've been searching very intensively over the past few decades for ways of doing this .
the cases were all very different , and the earliest was perhaps the franco era in spain .
in bosnia and kosovo we also had cases where one part of a country 's population attacked another one .
and we 've seen similar things in various african and latin american countries . justice alone is n't sufficient to deal with the past .
on the one hand , it 's important to take away from those who rape women , kill children , burn down homes and commit acts of murder the sense of security that says there 's always an amnesty , and no one will be punished .
on the other hand , the desire for peace is enormous , as we just saw in uganda , so that there 's a tendency to sweep everything under the rug in the interests of harmony .
they say : if justice leads to a continuation of war , then we do n't want justice .
ultimately it 's an insoluble dilemma .
it 's always a political decision when it 's time for one approach or when it 's time for the other . the international community has a responsibility to prevent violations of human rights .
yet , in many cases , we have a hard time living up to this duty .
in rwanda , for example , the international community allowed genocide to go on for more than 100 days .
why ca n't we react more quickly ? one problem is that we germans represent 80 million people out of a total of 7.5 billion .
it would be a bit arrogant to think that we germans could force the rest of the world onto the path to virtue .
but that does n't change what you were saying .
in rwanda , the international community failed in a very scandalous way .
the only thing comparable , and that on a much smaller scale , was our failure in srebrenica , and both gave us lots to think about .
it gave rise to the idea that in such extreme and clear cases the international community has to feel responsible politically and intervene .
if a million people are being massacred , it 's no longer one nation 's internal affair .
on the other hand , in every individual case , we have to look at what we can do and whether we have the right instruments for it .
in the case of rwanda , the un should never have withdrawn .
it should have intervened .
that is absolutely clear .
but it 's another question whether the un can simultaneously intervene in all the conflicts going on in the world without over-stretching itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uganda is another african nation with which germany wants closer ties as you mentioned , rwanda 's president paul kagame has pursued an ambitious program of development .
but is not the other side of the coin a relatively authoritarian stance toward domestic politics , and especially toward the media ? in the end , the people in the countries themselves have to decide .
in rwanda , i had the feeling when we talked not to the government , but to journalists and people on the margins of power , that they thought more freedom for the press would be a good idea .
on the other hand , the same people said : " do n't forget that the press played a huge role in the genocide . "
back then radio stations broadcast messages like : " kill your neighbors .
there are people from other ethnic groups .
massacre them , chop off their heads . "
and if this is the role of the press , then i understand why fears persist . germany has been very present in africa and is increasing its activities there .
why is that ? you only need to look at the map .
africa is a huge continent with gigantic problems and a population of 900 million people .
if things are n't going well , and africa ca n't cope with its own problems , they hardly have a choice but to solve them by exporting them to us .
the problem of illegal migrants actually brought us closer to africa .
another thing is that we are encountering more and more nations in africa with a healthy sense of self-confidence .
they 're increasingly following their own policies , and in the future we 'll be increasingly connected to them by the need for natural resources and other interests . in terms of development , we 've been active for a long time in africa .
but in 2008 we 're beginning a special program .
we 'll be opening new goethe institutes in dar es salaam and luanda , that is in tanzania and angola .
and the goethe institute will also be represented in rwanda in the form of a field office of the goethe institute in nairobi .
that signals that we 're looking for more dialogue with africa .
we hope that with cultural exchanges of this kind we 'll be better able to master crises by talking to one another . interview : ute schaeffer -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle spoke with german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about two nations with troubled pasts : uganda and rwanda . german president horst koehler and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have both recently returned from trips to africa , where they pledged their support to the continent . deutsche welle asked german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about the situation in uganda and rwanda in particular . deutsche welle : horst koehler recently made his fifth trip to africa as germany 's president .
what were your impressions ? georg boomgaarden : in uganda and rwanda , the president visited two nations that suffered for years of civil war and are still influenced by the traumas resulting from internal strife .
so the trip was overshadowed by the past and the search for ways for these countries to find reconciliation and peace .
i think it was a very political trip . reconciliation is considered a precondition for peace and development .
are uganda and rwanda examples of that ? i think it 's too early to say .
we spoke with representatives of the president and the civilian population , and we again saw how difficult the process is .
it 's just beginning in uganda , and only time will tell whether it 's a success . by african standards , rwanda has seen fairly good economic development .
there 's a respectable amount of growth .
but the shadows of the past are still there .
together with president koehler we visited a so-called gachacha court , a traditional body that tries to combine legal justice and reconciliation .
that 's one possible path .
on the other hand , there is the international rwanda tribunal , which is looking at the 60 worst cases .
i think it will definitely take a generation or more before the wounds will heal .
the point now is to just co-exist in peace . traditional forms of justice sometimes have more to do with dealing with trauma than reaching legal decisions .
to what extent can international law be hooked up with local tradition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boomgaarden , right , is deputy to foreign minister steinmeier i think we 've been searching very intensively over the past few decades for ways of doing this .
the cases were all very different , and the earliest was perhaps the franco era in spain .
in bosnia and kosovo we also had cases where one part of a country 's population attacked another one .
and we 've seen similar things in various african and latin american countries . justice alone is n't sufficient to deal with the past .
on the one hand , it 's important to take away from those who rape women , kill children , burn down homes and commit acts of murder the sense of security that says there 's always an amnesty , and no one will be punished .
on the other hand , the desire for peace is enormous , as we just saw in uganda , so that there 's a tendency to sweep everything under the rug in the interests of harmony .
they say : if justice leads to a continuation of war , then we do n't want justice .
ultimately it 's an insoluble dilemma .
it 's always a political decision when it 's time for one approach or when it 's time for the other . the international community has a responsibility to prevent violations of human rights .
yet , in many cases , we have a hard time living up to this duty .
in rwanda , for example , the international community allowed genocide to go on for more than 100 days .
why ca n't we react more quickly ? one problem is that we germans represent 80 million people out of a total of 7.5 billion .
it would be a bit arrogant to think that we germans could force the rest of the world onto the path to virtue .
but that does n't change what you were saying .
in rwanda , the international community failed in a very scandalous way .
the only thing comparable , and that on a much smaller scale , was our failure in srebrenica , and both gave us lots to think about .
it gave rise to the idea that in such extreme and clear cases the international community has to feel responsible politically and intervene .
if a million people are being massacred , it 's no longer one nation 's internal affair .
on the other hand , in every individual case , we have to look at what we can do and whether we have the right instruments for it .
in the case of rwanda , the un should never have withdrawn .
it should have intervened .
that is absolutely clear .
but it 's another question whether the un can simultaneously intervene in all the conflicts going on in the world without over-stretching itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uganda is another african nation with which germany wants closer ties as you mentioned , rwanda 's president paul kagame has pursued an ambitious program of development .
but is not the other side of the coin a relatively authoritarian stance toward domestic politics , and especially toward the media ? in the end , the people in the countries themselves have to decide .
in rwanda , i had the feeling when we talked not to the government , but to journalists and people on the margins of power , that they thought more freedom for the press would be a good idea .
on the other hand , the same people said : " do n't forget that the press played a huge role in the genocide . "
back then radio stations broadcast messages like : " kill your neighbors .
there are people from other ethnic groups .
massacre them , chop off their heads . "
and if this is the role of the press , then i understand why fears persist . germany has been very present in africa and is increasing its activities there .
why is that ? you only need to look at the map .
africa is a huge continent with gigantic problems and a population of 900 million people .
if things are n't going well , and africa ca n't cope with its own problems , they hardly have a choice but to solve them by exporting them to us .
the problem of illegal migrants actually brought us closer to africa .
another thing is that we are encountering more and more nations in africa with a healthy sense of self-confidence .
they 're increasingly following their own policies , and in the future we 'll be increasingly connected to them by the need for natural resources and other interests . in terms of development , we 've been active for a long time in africa .
but in 2008 we 're beginning a special program .
we 'll be opening new goethe institutes in dar es salaam and luanda , that is in tanzania and angola .
and the goethe institute will also be represented in rwanda in the form of a field office of the goethe institute in nairobi .
that signals that we 're looking for more dialogue with africa .
we hope that with cultural exchanges of this kind we 'll be better able to master crises by talking to one another . interview : ute schaeffer -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu is therefore planning to help out retired rockers , who never made millions to live on . many musicians and singers hit the big time in their 20s , and often even earlier .
under current rules , their airplay royalties stop coming in just as they retire , hitting them particularly hard .
that 's why the european commission announced this week that under a new proposal , european musicians and singers would see the copyright on their recorded performances extended to 95 years from the current level of 50 .
the eu 's move to help ageing rockers and other artists beat the financial blues during retirement would be ready for formal adoption by the european commission in the middle of the year , the european union 's executive arm said .
" if nothing is done , thousands of european performers who recorded in the late fifties and sixties will lose all of their airplay royalties over the next 10 years , " eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy said .
presenting the proposal , mccreevy said that he had found " no convincing reason " why composers should currently enjoy much longer copyright protection than performers .

" i strongly believe that copyright protection for europe 's performers represents a moral right to control the use of their work and earn a living from their performances . "
in the united states , performers already enjoy copyright protection for 95 years .
in the european union , such protection has been limited to 50 years since the introduction of a 1993 law .
mccreevy acknowledged that he was less worried about big crowd-pullers such as britain 's ageless pop star cliff richard and french crooner charles aznavour than " the thousands of anonymous session musicians who contributed to sound recordings in the late fifties and sixties .
" they will no longer get airplay royalties from their recordings but these royalties are often their sole pension , " he said .
the aepo-artis association , representing several performer organizations at the european level , welcomed that brussels had recognized " the creative gain that performers bring . "
however , " some things still need to be clarified , " said guenaelle collet at apos-artis , citing in particular a proposal that record companies would have to contribute to a special fund for session musicians .

the eu is therefore planning to help out retired rockers , who never made millions to live on . many musicians and singers hit the big time in their 20s , and often even earlier .
under current rules , their airplay royalties stop coming in just as they retire , hitting them particularly hard .
that 's why the european commission announced this week that under a new proposal , european musicians and singers would see the copyright on their recorded performances extended to 95 years from the current level of 50 .
the eu 's move to help ageing rockers and other artists beat the financial blues during retirement would be ready for formal adoption by the european commission in the middle of the year , the european union 's executive arm said .
" if nothing is done , thousands of european performers who recorded in the late fifties and sixties will lose all of their airplay royalties over the next 10 years , " eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy said .
presenting the proposal , mccreevy said that he had found " no convincing reason " why composers should currently enjoy much longer copyright protection than performers .
commission moves to protect performers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles aznavour wo n't go hungry in his retirement " it is the performer who gives life to the composition and while most of us have no idea who wrote our favorite song , we can usually name the performer , " mccreevy said .
" i strongly believe that copyright protection for europe 's performers represents a moral right to control the use of their work and earn a living from their performances . "
in the united states , performers already enjoy copyright protection for 95 years .
in the european union , such protection has been limited to 50 years since the introduction of a 1993 law .
mccreevy acknowledged that he was less worried about big crowd-pullers such as britain 's ageless pop star cliff richard and french crooner charles aznavour than " the thousands of anonymous session musicians who contributed to sound recordings in the late fifties and sixties .
" they will no longer get airplay royalties from their recordings but these royalties are often their sole pension , " he said .
the aepo-artis association , representing several performer organizations at the european level , welcomed that brussels had recognized " the creative gain that performers bring . "

europe is paying more attention to both the potential and the problems of africa .
deutsche welle spoke with german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about two nations with troubled pasts : uganda and rwanda . german president horst koehler and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have both recently returned from trips to africa , where they pledged their support to the continent . deutsche welle asked german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about the situation in uganda and rwanda in particular . deutsche welle : horst koehler recently made his fifth trip to africa as germany 's president .
what were your impressions ? georg boomgaarden : in uganda and rwanda , the president visited two nations that suffered for years of civil war and are still influenced by the traumas resulting from internal strife .
so the trip was overshadowed by the past and the search for ways for these countries to find reconciliation and peace .
i think it was a very political trip . reconciliation is considered a precondition for peace and development .
are uganda and rwanda examples of that ? i think it 's too early to say .
we spoke with representatives of the president and the civilian population , and we again saw how difficult the process is .
it 's just beginning in uganda , and only time will tell whether it 's a success . by african standards , rwanda has seen fairly good economic development .
there 's a respectable amount of growth .
but the shadows of the past are still there .
together with president koehler we visited a so-called gachacha court , a traditional body that tries to combine legal justice and reconciliation .
that 's one possible path .
on the other hand , there is the international rwanda tribunal , which is looking at the 60 worst cases .
i think it will definitely take a generation or more before the wounds will heal .
the point now is to just co-exist in peace . traditional forms of justice sometimes have more to do with dealing with trauma than reaching legal decisions .
to what extent can international law be hooked up with local tradition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boomgaarden , right , is deputy to foreign minister steinmeier i think we 've been searching very intensively over the past few decades for ways of doing this .
the cases were all very different , and the earliest was perhaps the franco era in spain .
in bosnia and kosovo we also had cases where one part of a country 's population attacked another one .
and we 've seen similar things in various african and latin american countries . justice alone is n't sufficient to deal with the past .
on the one hand , it 's important to take away from those who rape women , kill children , burn down homes and commit acts of murder the sense of security that says there 's always an amnesty , and no one will be punished .
on the other hand , the desire for peace is enormous , as we just saw in uganda , so that there 's a tendency to sweep everything under the rug in the interests of harmony .
they say : if justice leads to a continuation of war , then we do n't want justice .
ultimately it 's an insoluble dilemma .
it 's always a political decision when it 's time for one approach or when it 's time for the other . the international community has a responsibility to prevent violations of human rights .
yet , in many cases , we have a hard time living up to this duty .
in rwanda , for example , the international community allowed genocide to go on for more than 100 days .
why ca n't we react more quickly ? one problem is that we germans represent 80 million people out of a total of 7.5 billion .
it would be a bit arrogant to think that we germans could force the rest of the world onto the path to virtue .
but that does n't change what you were saying .
in rwanda , the international community failed in a very scandalous way .
the only thing comparable , and that on a much smaller scale , was our failure in srebrenica , and both gave us lots to think about .
it gave rise to the idea that in such extreme and clear cases the international community has to feel responsible politically and intervene .
if a million people are being massacred , it 's no longer one nation 's internal affair .
on the other hand , in every individual case , we have to look at what we can do and whether we have the right instruments for it .
in the case of rwanda , the un should never have withdrawn .
it should have intervened .
that is absolutely clear .
but it 's another question whether the un can simultaneously intervene in all the conflicts going on in the world without over-stretching itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uganda is another african nation with which germany wants closer ties as you mentioned , rwanda 's president paul kagame has pursued an ambitious program of development .
but is not the other side of the coin a relatively authoritarian stance toward domestic politics , and especially toward the media ? in the end , the people in the countries themselves have to decide .
in rwanda , i had the feeling when we talked not to the government , but to journalists and people on the margins of power , that they thought more freedom for the press would be a good idea .
on the other hand , the same people said : " do n't forget that the press played a huge role in the genocide . "
back then radio stations broadcast messages like : " kill your neighbors .
there are people from other ethnic groups .
massacre them , chop off their heads . "
and if this is the role of the press , then i understand why fears persist . germany has been very present in africa and is increasing its activities there .
why is that ? you only need to look at the map .
africa is a huge continent with gigantic problems and a population of 900 million people .
if things are n't going well , and africa ca n't cope with its own problems , they hardly have a choice but to solve them by exporting them to us .
the problem of illegal migrants actually brought us closer to africa .
another thing is that we are encountering more and more nations in africa with a healthy sense of self-confidence .
they 're increasingly following their own policies , and in the future we 'll be increasingly connected to them by the need for natural resources and other interests . in terms of development , we 've been active for a long time in africa .
but in 2008 we 're beginning a special program .
we 'll be opening new goethe institutes in dar es salaam and luanda , that is in tanzania and angola .
and the goethe institute will also be represented in rwanda in the form of a field office of the goethe institute in nairobi .
that signals that we 're looking for more dialogue with africa .
we hope that with cultural exchanges of this kind we 'll be better able to master crises by talking to one another . interview : ute schaeffer -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 .
ten years after belgrade crushed a rebellion in kosovo , parliamentarians proclaimed the republic of kosovo and sovereign state . the parliament in kosovo voted in favor of independence from serbia , bringing the curtain down on a long chapter in the violent break-up of yugoslavia . " from today onwards , kosovo is proud , independent and free , " said prime minister hashim thaci .
" we never lost faith in the dream that one day we would stand among the free nations of the world , and today we do . " kosovo will be a " society that respects human dignity " and be committed to dealing with the " painful legacy of the recent past , in a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness , " thaci added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the members of parliament present approved independence for kosovo all 109 deputies present at the session in the capital pristina voted in favor with a show of hands .
eleven deputies from ethnic minorities , including serbs , were absent .
the parliament also approved a new flag for the landlocked state of about 2 million people . " today , a new life begins , " the kosovo daily koha ditore wrote .
" the past should not be forgotten , but it belongs to the past , and should be forgiven . " serbia calls declaration illegal while the united states and several european union members are quickly expected to recognize the new state , serbia is infuriated by the move and has been given strong support by russia , which called on the un and nato to annul kosovo 's independence . quickly after the deceleration , moscow called for a meeting of the united nations security council to discuss kosovo .
diplomats in new york said the council would hold an emergency meeting on sunday . " the decisions by the kosovo leadership create the risk of an escalation of tension and inter-ethnic violence in the province and of new conflict in the balkans , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . serbia 's president boris tadic said his country would never recognize the independence of kosovo . " the state of serbia will take responsible moves and will do everything in its power to annul this arbitrary and illegally proclaimed the independence of kosovo , " tadic said in a statement .
" serbia will not resort to violence and that is the only approach which can enable us to continue our legitimate fight to preserve the integrity of our country . " in a televised address , serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica called kosovo a " false state " supported unlawfully by the united states , which he said was " ready to violate the international order for its own military interests . " kosovo police had to stop several hundred former serbian army reservists - veterans of the 1998-99 kosovo war - from crossing into the territory ahead of the independence declaration . eu mission welcomed in pristina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrations have already begun in kosovo earlier , thaci said he would also welcome the law-implementing mission prepared by the european union to help kosovo along its first sovereign steps .
after slovenia , croatia , macedonia , bosnia and montenegro , kosovo is the sixth nation to emerge from the former yugoslav federation since 1991 . the independence proclamation started a 120-day transition period and the deployment of some 2,000 european union police and judicial officials to aid kosovo in the transition to independence . tens of thousands of albanians , a 90 percent majority in kosovo , began celebrating in capital pristina ahead of the declaration . flags of albania , the united states and western european countries were on display and waved everywhere , as police closed the central streets to traffic , allowing only pedestrians in . some of the people carried signs calling for a " celebration with dignity . " while albanians started celebrating already saturday night , the serbs in their enclaves remained calm even if wary .
their spiritual leader , the orthodox bishop artemije , dismissed the imminent declaration of independence , but denounced violence . " we are not calling anybody to a war , " artemije said after a prayer in the serb enclave gracanica , near the kosovo capital pristina .

" we will never cooperate with the eu mission in kosovo , " he said . ilic was just one of more than a dozen serbian government ministers and high-ranking officials who huddled with the serbs in their enclaves . serbia on thursday passed a resolution " annulling " the declaration of independence in advance .
the document would come into effect with the declaration of independence by the kosovo authorities . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europe is paying more attention to both the potential and the problems of africa .
deutsche welle spoke with german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about two nations with troubled pasts : uganda and rwanda . german president horst koehler and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have both recently returned from trips to africa , where they pledged their support to the continent . deutsche welle asked german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about the situation in uganda and rwanda in particular . deutsche welle : horst koehler recently made his fifth trip to africa as germany 's president .
what were your impressions ? georg boomgaarden : in uganda and rwanda , the president visited two nations that suffered for years of civil war and are still influenced by the traumas resulting from internal strife .
so the trip was overshadowed by the past and the search for ways for these countries to find reconciliation and peace .
i think it was a very political trip . reconciliation is considered a precondition for peace and development .
are uganda and rwanda examples of that ? i think it 's too early to say .
we spoke with representatives of the president and the civilian population , and we again saw how difficult the process is .
it 's just beginning in uganda , and only time will tell whether it 's a success . by african standards , rwanda has seen fairly good economic development .
there 's a respectable amount of growth .
but the shadows of the past are still there .
together with president koehler we visited a so-called gachacha court , a traditional body that tries to combine legal justice and reconciliation .
that 's one possible path .
on the other hand , there is the international rwanda tribunal , which is looking at the 60 worst cases .
i think it will definitely take a generation or more before the wounds will heal .
the point now is to just co-exist in peace . traditional forms of justice sometimes have more to do with dealing with trauma than reaching legal decisions .
to what extent can international law be hooked up with local tradition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boomgaarden , right , is deputy to foreign minister steinmeier i think we 've been searching very intensively over the past few decades for ways of doing this .
the cases were all very different , and the earliest was perhaps the franco era in spain .
in bosnia and kosovo we also had cases where one part of a country 's population attacked another one .
and we 've seen similar things in various african and latin american countries . justice alone is n't sufficient to deal with the past .
on the one hand , it 's important to take away from those who rape women , kill children , burn down homes and commit acts of murder the sense of security that says there 's always an amnesty , and no one will be punished .
on the other hand , the desire for peace is enormous , as we just saw in uganda , so that there 's a tendency to sweep everything under the rug in the interests of harmony .
they say : if justice leads to a continuation of war , then we do n't want justice .
ultimately it 's an insoluble dilemma .
it 's always a political decision when it 's time for one approach or when it 's time for the other . the international community has a responsibility to prevent violations of human rights .
yet , in many cases , we have a hard time living up to this duty .
in rwanda , for example , the international community allowed genocide to go on for more than 100 days .
why ca n't we react more quickly ? one problem is that we germans represent 80 million people out of a total of 7.5 billion .
it would be a bit arrogant to think that we germans could force the rest of the world onto the path to virtue .
but that does n't change what you were saying .
in rwanda , the international community failed in a very scandalous way .
the only thing comparable , and that on a much smaller scale , was our failure in srebrenica , and both gave us lots to think about .
it gave rise to the idea that in such extreme and clear cases the international community has to feel responsible politically and intervene .
if a million people are being massacred , it 's no longer one nation 's internal affair .
on the other hand , in every individual case , we have to look at what we can do and whether we have the right instruments for it .
in the case of rwanda , the un should never have withdrawn .
it should have intervened .
that is absolutely clear .
but it 's another question whether the un can simultaneously intervene in all the conflicts going on in the world without over-stretching itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uganda is another african nation with which germany wants closer ties as you mentioned , rwanda 's president paul kagame has pursued an ambitious program of development .
but is not the other side of the coin a relatively authoritarian stance toward domestic politics , and especially toward the media ? in the end , the people in the countries themselves have to decide .
in rwanda , i had the feeling when we talked not to the government , but to journalists and people on the margins of power , that they thought more freedom for the press would be a good idea .
on the other hand , the same people said : " do n't forget that the press played a huge role in the genocide . "
back then radio stations broadcast messages like : " kill your neighbors .
there are people from other ethnic groups .
massacre them , chop off their heads . "
and if this is the role of the press , then i understand why fears persist . germany has been very present in africa and is increasing its activities there .
why is that ? you only need to look at the map .
africa is a huge continent with gigantic problems and a population of 900 million people .
if things are n't going well , and africa ca n't cope with its own problems , they hardly have a choice but to solve them by exporting them to us .
the problem of illegal migrants actually brought us closer to africa .
another thing is that we are encountering more and more nations in africa with a healthy sense of self-confidence .
they 're increasingly following their own policies , and in the future we 'll be increasingly connected to them by the need for natural resources and other interests . in terms of development , we 've been active for a long time in africa .
but in 2008 we 're beginning a special program .
we 'll be opening new goethe institutes in dar es salaam and luanda , that is in tanzania and angola .
and the goethe institute will also be represented in rwanda in the form of a field office of the goethe institute in nairobi .
that signals that we 're looking for more dialogue with africa .
we hope that with cultural exchanges of this kind we 'll be better able to master crises by talking to one another . interview : ute schaeffer -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europe is paying more attention to both the potential and the problems of africa .
deutsche welle spoke with german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about two nations with troubled pasts : uganda and rwanda . german president horst koehler and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have both recently returned from trips to africa , where they pledged their support to the continent . deutsche welle asked german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about the situation in uganda and rwanda in particular . deutsche welle : horst koehler recently made his fifth trip to africa as germany 's president .
what were your impressions ? georg boomgaarden : in uganda and rwanda , the president visited two nations that suffered for years of civil war and are still influenced by the traumas resulting from internal strife .
so the trip was overshadowed by the past and the search for ways for these countries to find reconciliation and peace .
i think it was a very political trip . reconciliation is considered a precondition for peace and development .
are uganda and rwanda examples of that ? i think it 's too early to say .
we spoke with representatives of the president and the civilian population , and we again saw how difficult the process is .
it 's just beginning in uganda , and only time will tell whether it 's a success . by african standards , rwanda has seen fairly good economic development .
there 's a respectable amount of growth .
but the shadows of the past are still there .
together with president koehler we visited a so-called gachacha court , a traditional body that tries to combine legal justice and reconciliation .
that 's one possible path .
on the other hand , there is the international rwanda tribunal , which is looking at the 60 worst cases .
i think it will definitely take a generation or more before the wounds will heal .
the point now is to just co-exist in peace . traditional forms of justice sometimes have more to do with dealing with trauma than reaching legal decisions .
to what extent can international law be hooked up with local tradition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boomgaarden , right , is deputy to foreign minister steinmeier i think we 've been searching very intensively over the past few decades for ways of doing this .
the cases were all very different , and the earliest was perhaps the franco era in spain .
in bosnia and kosovo we also had cases where one part of a country 's population attacked another one .
and we 've seen similar things in various african and latin american countries . justice alone is n't sufficient to deal with the past .
on the one hand , it 's important to take away from those who rape women , kill children , burn down homes and commit acts of murder the sense of security that says there 's always an amnesty , and no one will be punished .
on the other hand , the desire for peace is enormous , as we just saw in uganda , so that there 's a tendency to sweep everything under the rug in the interests of harmony .
they say : if justice leads to a continuation of war , then we do n't want justice .
ultimately it 's an insoluble dilemma .
it 's always a political decision when it 's time for one approach or when it 's time for the other . the international community has a responsibility to prevent violations of human rights .
yet , in many cases , we have a hard time living up to this duty .
in rwanda , for example , the international community allowed genocide to go on for more than 100 days .
why ca n't we react more quickly ? one problem is that we germans represent 80 million people out of a total of 7.5 billion .
it would be a bit arrogant to think that we germans could force the rest of the world onto the path to virtue .
but that does n't change what you were saying .
in rwanda , the international community failed in a very scandalous way .
the only thing comparable , and that on a much smaller scale , was our failure in srebrenica , and both gave us lots to think about .
it gave rise to the idea that in such extreme and clear cases the international community has to feel responsible politically and intervene .
if a million people are being massacred , it 's no longer one nation 's internal affair .
on the other hand , in every individual case , we have to look at what we can do and whether we have the right instruments for it .
in the case of rwanda , the un should never have withdrawn .
it should have intervened .
that is absolutely clear .
but it 's another question whether the un can simultaneously intervene in all the conflicts going on in the world without over-stretching itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uganda is another african nation with which germany wants closer ties as you mentioned , rwanda 's president paul kagame has pursued an ambitious program of development .
but is not the other side of the coin a relatively authoritarian stance toward domestic politics , and especially toward the media ? in the end , the people in the countries themselves have to decide .
in rwanda , i had the feeling when we talked not to the government , but to journalists and people on the margins of power , that they thought more freedom for the press would be a good idea .
on the other hand , the same people said : " do n't forget that the press played a huge role in the genocide . "
back then radio stations broadcast messages like : " kill your neighbors .
there are people from other ethnic groups .
massacre them , chop off their heads . "
and if this is the role of the press , then i understand why fears persist . germany has been very present in africa and is increasing its activities there .
why is that ? you only need to look at the map .
africa is a huge continent with gigantic problems and a population of 900 million people .
if things are n't going well , and africa ca n't cope with its own problems , they hardly have a choice but to solve them by exporting them to us .
the problem of illegal migrants actually brought us closer to africa .
another thing is that we are encountering more and more nations in africa with a healthy sense of self-confidence .
they 're increasingly following their own policies , and in the future we 'll be increasingly connected to them by the need for natural resources and other interests . in terms of development , we 've been active for a long time in africa .
but in 2008 we 're beginning a special program .
we 'll be opening new goethe institutes in dar es salaam and luanda , that is in tanzania and angola .
and the goethe institute will also be represented in rwanda in the form of a field office of the goethe institute in nairobi .
that signals that we 're looking for more dialogue with africa .
we hope that with cultural exchanges of this kind we 'll be better able to master crises by talking to one another . interview : ute schaeffer -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we spoke with representatives of the president and the civilian population , and we again saw how difficult the process is .
it 's just beginning in uganda , and only time will tell whether it 's a success . by african standards , rwanda has seen fairly good economic development .
there 's a respectable amount of growth .
but the shadows of the past are still there .
together with president koehler we visited a so-called gachacha court , a traditional body that tries to combine legal justice and reconciliation .
that 's one possible path .
on the other hand , there is the international rwanda tribunal , which is looking at the 60 worst cases .
i think it will definitely take a generation or more before the wounds will heal .
the point now is to just co-exist in peace . traditional forms of justice sometimes have more to do with dealing with trauma than reaching legal decisions .
to what extent can international law be hooked up with local tradition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boomgaarden , right , is deputy to foreign minister steinmeier i think we 've been searching very intensively over the past few decades for ways of doing this .
the cases were all very different , and the earliest was perhaps the franco era in spain .
in bosnia and kosovo we also had cases where one part of a country 's population attacked another one .
and we 've seen similar things in various african and latin american countries . justice alone is n't sufficient to deal with the past .
on the one hand , it 's important to take away from those who rape women , kill children , burn down homes and commit acts of murder the sense of security that says there 's always an amnesty , and no one will be punished .
on the other hand , the desire for peace is enormous , as we just saw in uganda , so that there 's a tendency to sweep everything under the rug in the interests of harmony .
they say : if justice leads to a continuation of war , then we do n't want justice .
ultimately it 's an insoluble dilemma .
it 's always a political decision when it 's time for one approach or when it 's time for the other . the international community has a responsibility to prevent violations of human rights .
yet , in many cases , we have a hard time living up to this duty .
in rwanda , for example , the international community allowed genocide to go on for more than 100 days .
why ca n't we react more quickly ? one problem is that we germans represent 80 million people out of a total of 7.5 billion .
it would be a bit arrogant to think that we germans could force the rest of the world onto the path to virtue .
but that does n't change what you were saying .
in rwanda , the international community failed in a very scandalous way .
the only thing comparable , and that on a much smaller scale , was our failure in srebrenica , and both gave us lots to think about .
it gave rise to the idea that in such extreme and clear cases the international community has to feel responsible politically and intervene .
if a million people are being massacred , it 's no longer one nation 's internal affair .
on the other hand , in every individual case , we have to look at what we can do and whether we have the right instruments for it .
in the case of rwanda , the un should never have withdrawn .
it should have intervened .
that is absolutely clear .
but it 's another question whether the un can simultaneously intervene in all the conflicts going on in the world without over-stretching itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uganda is another african nation with which germany wants closer ties as you mentioned , rwanda 's president paul kagame has pursued an ambitious program of development .
but is not the other side of the coin a relatively authoritarian stance toward domestic politics , and especially toward the media ? in the end , the people in the countries themselves have to decide .
in rwanda , i had the feeling when we talked not to the government , but to journalists and people on the margins of power , that they thought more freedom for the press would be a good idea .
on the other hand , the same people said : " do n't forget that the press played a huge role in the genocide . "
back then radio stations broadcast messages like : " kill your neighbors .
there are people from other ethnic groups .
massacre them , chop off their heads . "
and if this is the role of the press , then i understand why fears persist . germany has been very present in africa and is increasing its activities there .
why is that ? you only need to look at the map .
africa is a huge continent with gigantic problems and a population of 900 million people .
if things are n't going well , and africa ca n't cope with its own problems , they hardly have a choice but to solve them by exporting them to us .
the problem of illegal migrants actually brought us closer to africa .
another thing is that we are encountering more and more nations in africa with a healthy sense of self-confidence .
they 're increasingly following their own policies , and in the future we 'll be increasingly connected to them by the need for natural resources and other interests . in terms of development , we 've been active for a long time in africa .
but in 2008 we 're beginning a special program .
we 'll be opening new goethe institutes in dar es salaam and luanda , that is in tanzania and angola .
and the goethe institute will also be represented in rwanda in the form of a field office of the goethe institute in nairobi .
that signals that we 're looking for more dialogue with africa .

europe is paying more attention to both the potential and the problems of africa .
deutsche welle spoke with german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about two nations with troubled pasts : uganda and rwanda . german president horst koehler and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have both recently returned from trips to africa , where they pledged their support to the continent . deutsche welle asked german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about the situation in uganda and rwanda in particular . deutsche welle : horst koehler recently made his fifth trip to africa as germany 's president .
what were your impressions ? georg boomgaarden : in uganda and rwanda , the president visited two nations that suffered for years of civil war and are still influenced by the traumas resulting from internal strife .
so the trip was overshadowed by the past and the search for ways for these countries to find reconciliation and peace .
i think it was a very political trip . reconciliation is considered a precondition for peace and development .
are uganda and rwanda examples of that ? i think it 's too early to say .
we spoke with representatives of the president and the civilian population , and we again saw how difficult the process is .

europe is paying more attention to both the potential and the problems of africa .
deutsche welle spoke with german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about two nations with troubled pasts : uganda and rwanda . german president horst koehler and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have both recently returned from trips to africa , where they pledged their support to the continent . deutsche welle asked german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about the situation in uganda and rwanda in particular . deutsche welle : horst koehler recently made his fifth trip to africa as germany 's president .
what were your impressions ? georg boomgaarden : in uganda and rwanda , the president visited two nations that suffered for years of civil war and are still influenced by the traumas resulting from internal strife .
so the trip was overshadowed by the past and the search for ways for these countries to find reconciliation and peace .
i think it was a very political trip . reconciliation is considered a precondition for peace and development .
are uganda and rwanda examples of that ? i think it 's too early to say .
we spoke with representatives of the president and the civilian population , and we again saw how difficult the process is .
it 's just beginning in uganda , and only time will tell whether it 's a success . by african standards , rwanda has seen fairly good economic development .
there 's a respectable amount of growth .
but the shadows of the past are still there .
together with president koehler we visited a so-called gachacha court , a traditional body that tries to combine legal justice and reconciliation .
that 's one possible path .
on the other hand , there is the international rwanda tribunal , which is looking at the 60 worst cases .
i think it will definitely take a generation or more before the wounds will heal .
the point now is to just co-exist in peace . traditional forms of justice sometimes have more to do with dealing with trauma than reaching legal decisions .
to what extent can international law be hooked up with local tradition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boomgaarden , right , is deputy to foreign minister steinmeier i think we 've been searching very intensively over the past few decades for ways of doing this .
the cases were all very different , and the earliest was perhaps the franco era in spain .
in bosnia and kosovo we also had cases where one part of a country 's population attacked another one .
and we 've seen similar things in various african and latin american countries . justice alone is n't sufficient to deal with the past .
on the one hand , it 's important to take away from those who rape women , kill children , burn down homes and commit acts of murder the sense of security that says there 's always an amnesty , and no one will be punished .
on the other hand , the desire for peace is enormous , as we just saw in uganda , so that there 's a tendency to sweep everything under the rug in the interests of harmony .
they say : if justice leads to a continuation of war , then we do n't want justice .
ultimately it 's an insoluble dilemma .
it 's always a political decision when it 's time for one approach or when it 's time for the other . the international community has a responsibility to prevent violations of human rights .
yet , in many cases , we have a hard time living up to this duty .
in rwanda , for example , the international community allowed genocide to go on for more than 100 days .
why ca n't we react more quickly ? one problem is that we germans represent 80 million people out of a total of 7.5 billion .
it would be a bit arrogant to think that we germans could force the rest of the world onto the path to virtue .
but that does n't change what you were saying .
in rwanda , the international community failed in a very scandalous way .
the only thing comparable , and that on a much smaller scale , was our failure in srebrenica , and both gave us lots to think about .
it gave rise to the idea that in such extreme and clear cases the international community has to feel responsible politically and intervene .
if a million people are being massacred , it 's no longer one nation 's internal affair .
on the other hand , in every individual case , we have to look at what we can do and whether we have the right instruments for it .
in the case of rwanda , the un should never have withdrawn .
it should have intervened .
that is absolutely clear .
but it 's another question whether the un can simultaneously intervene in all the conflicts going on in the world without over-stretching itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uganda is another african nation with which germany wants closer ties as you mentioned , rwanda 's president paul kagame has pursued an ambitious program of development .
but is not the other side of the coin a relatively authoritarian stance toward domestic politics , and especially toward the media ? in the end , the people in the countries themselves have to decide .
in rwanda , i had the feeling when we talked not to the government , but to journalists and people on the margins of power , that they thought more freedom for the press would be a good idea .
on the other hand , the same people said : " do n't forget that the press played a huge role in the genocide . "
back then radio stations broadcast messages like : " kill your neighbors .
there are people from other ethnic groups .
massacre them , chop off their heads . "
and if this is the role of the press , then i understand why fears persist . germany has been very present in africa and is increasing its activities there .
why is that ? you only need to look at the map .
africa is a huge continent with gigantic problems and a population of 900 million people .
if things are n't going well , and africa ca n't cope with its own problems , they hardly have a choice but to solve them by exporting them to us .
the problem of illegal migrants actually brought us closer to africa .
another thing is that we are encountering more and more nations in africa with a healthy sense of self-confidence .
they 're increasingly following their own policies , and in the future we 'll be increasingly connected to them by the need for natural resources and other interests . in terms of development , we 've been active for a long time in africa .
but in 2008 we 're beginning a special program .
we 'll be opening new goethe institutes in dar es salaam and luanda , that is in tanzania and angola .
and the goethe institute will also be represented in rwanda in the form of a field office of the goethe institute in nairobi .
that signals that we 're looking for more dialogue with africa .
we hope that with cultural exchanges of this kind we 'll be better able to master crises by talking to one another . interview : ute schaeffer -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europe is paying more attention to both the potential and the problems of africa .
deutsche welle spoke with german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about two nations with troubled pasts : uganda and rwanda . german president horst koehler and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have both recently returned from trips to africa , where they pledged their support to the continent . deutsche welle asked german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about the situation in uganda and rwanda in particular . deutsche welle : horst koehler recently made his fifth trip to africa as germany 's president .
what were your impressions ? georg boomgaarden : in uganda and rwanda , the president visited two nations that suffered for years of civil war and are still influenced by the traumas resulting from internal strife .
so the trip was overshadowed by the past and the search for ways for these countries to find reconciliation and peace .
i think it was a very political trip . reconciliation is considered a precondition for peace and development .
are uganda and rwanda examples of that ? i think it 's too early to say .
we spoke with representatives of the president and the civilian population , and we again saw how difficult the process is .
it 's just beginning in uganda , and only time will tell whether it 's a success . by african standards , rwanda has seen fairly good economic development .
there 's a respectable amount of growth .
but the shadows of the past are still there .
together with president koehler we visited a so-called gachacha court , a traditional body that tries to combine legal justice and reconciliation .
that 's one possible path .
on the other hand , there is the international rwanda tribunal , which is looking at the 60 worst cases .
i think it will definitely take a generation or more before the wounds will heal .
the point now is to just co-exist in peace . traditional forms of justice sometimes have more to do with dealing with trauma than reaching legal decisions .
to what extent can international law be hooked up with local tradition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boomgaarden , right , is deputy to foreign minister steinmeier i think we 've been searching very intensively over the past few decades for ways of doing this .
the cases were all very different , and the earliest was perhaps the franco era in spain .
in bosnia and kosovo we also had cases where one part of a country 's population attacked another one .
and we 've seen similar things in various african and latin american countries . justice alone is n't sufficient to deal with the past .
on the one hand , it 's important to take away from those who rape women , kill children , burn down homes and commit acts of murder the sense of security that says there 's always an amnesty , and no one will be punished .

another thing is that we are encountering more and more nations in africa with a healthy sense of self-confidence .
they 're increasingly following their own policies , and in the future we 'll be increasingly connected to them by the need for natural resources and other interests . in terms of development , we 've been active for a long time in africa .
but in 2008 we 're beginning a special program .
we 'll be opening new goethe institutes in dar es salaam and luanda , that is in tanzania and angola .
and the goethe institute will also be represented in rwanda in the form of a field office of the goethe institute in nairobi .
that signals that we 're looking for more dialogue with africa .
we hope that with cultural exchanges of this kind we 'll be better able to master crises by talking to one another . interview : ute schaeffer -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say they share responsibility for the financial crisis as calls for political consequences are getting louder . until the outbreak of the subprime crisis , sector giants like standard & poor 's and moody 's in the us had enjoyed an aura of expertise and incorruptibility .
half a year later , they 're on the defensive .
the finance committee in the german parliament recently met with experts to discuss the role of the rating agencies in the crisis . the agencies have been aware of the need for change for a long time , said rating expert oliver everling , who 'd spoken with the committee .
he added that " the agencies definitely do n't bear responsibility alone for the subprime crisis . " failure of early warning system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aaa rating was n't always legitimate indeed , the agencies have tried to take other market participants to task .
everling said that banks bore a greater share of the blame for investing in risky products whose complexity they did n't understand , such as collateralized debt obligations -lrb- cdos -rrb- . even after the shaky bonds had lost their value and experts had warned that the us mortgage market was about to burst , the rating agencies were still granting mortgage derivatives the highest score of aaa .
it was n't until june 2007 that the ratings dropped , leaving the agencies scrambling to defend their role as the " early warning system . " furthermore , the rating agencies have had to refute accusations of corruption and conflict of interest .
according to critics , the credit monitors not only evaluated complex financial products but also advised the issuers who wanted to sell them . consulting claims undermine transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us crisis had ramifications across the world moody 's has rebuffed claims that it had been involved in consulting , but said it 's possible that " analytical discussions " took place with issuers or their advisors . " the line between dialogue and consultation is fluid , " everling said . the rating expert warned against hastily slapping regulations on the industry .
the consequence of the agencies ' mistakes should be more and not less rating - with greater competition , he said .
after all , standard & poor 's and moody 's dominate the global market with an 80 percent share , making them practically immune to national politics . instead , politicians around the world have to convince standard & poor 's and moody 's to participate in regulation negotiations , said everling - at the very least to improve their reputation for transparency . it 's not always clear where their ratings actually come from , say critics .
german chancellor angela merkel said last year during the financial turbulence that " nothing should be pulled out of a black box that no one understands . " caution rises as confidence lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the chaos have been spared ?
wuerzburg economist ekkehard wenger said he doubts that pressure from politicians can bring transparency back to the industry . " as long as the rating agencies are paid by those that sell the papers , not much will change , " wenger said . at the very least , however , the sector already seems to have lost the blind trust it once enjoyed . " the confidence of the market in credit ratings has suffered under the current situation , " conceded the fitch rating agency recently . as a result , banks and investors will have to take a closer look at who they entrust their money with , said franz waas , head of dekabank .

it was n't until june 2007 that the ratings dropped , leaving the agencies scrambling to defend their role as the " early warning system . " furthermore , the rating agencies have had to refute accusations of corruption and conflict of interest .

the consequence of the agencies ' mistakes should be more and not less rating - with greater competition , he said .

experts say they share responsibility for the financial crisis as calls for political consequences are getting louder . until the outbreak of the subprime crisis , sector giants like standard & poor 's and moody 's in the us had enjoyed an aura of expertise and incorruptibility .
half a year later , they 're on the defensive .

europe is paying more attention to both the potential and the problems of africa .
deutsche welle spoke with german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about two nations with troubled pasts : uganda and rwanda . german president horst koehler and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have both recently returned from trips to africa , where they pledged their support to the continent . deutsche welle asked german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about the situation in uganda and rwanda in particular . deutsche welle : horst koehler recently made his fifth trip to africa as germany 's president .
what were your impressions ? georg boomgaarden : in uganda and rwanda , the president visited two nations that suffered for years of civil war and are still influenced by the traumas resulting from internal strife .
so the trip was overshadowed by the past and the search for ways for these countries to find reconciliation and peace .
i think it was a very political trip . reconciliation is considered a precondition for peace and development .
are uganda and rwanda examples of that ? i think it 's too early to say .
we spoke with representatives of the president and the civilian population , and we again saw how difficult the process is .
it 's just beginning in uganda , and only time will tell whether it 's a success . by african standards , rwanda has seen fairly good economic development .
there 's a respectable amount of growth .
but the shadows of the past are still there .
together with president koehler we visited a so-called gachacha court , a traditional body that tries to combine legal justice and reconciliation .
that 's one possible path .
on the other hand , there is the international rwanda tribunal , which is looking at the 60 worst cases .
i think it will definitely take a generation or more before the wounds will heal .
the point now is to just co-exist in peace . traditional forms of justice sometimes have more to do with dealing with trauma than reaching legal decisions .
to what extent can international law be hooked up with local tradition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boomgaarden , right , is deputy to foreign minister steinmeier i think we 've been searching very intensively over the past few decades for ways of doing this .
the cases were all very different , and the earliest was perhaps the franco era in spain .
in bosnia and kosovo we also had cases where one part of a country 's population attacked another one .
and we 've seen similar things in various african and latin american countries . justice alone is n't sufficient to deal with the past .
on the one hand , it 's important to take away from those who rape women , kill children , burn down homes and commit acts of murder the sense of security that says there 's always an amnesty , and no one will be punished .
on the other hand , the desire for peace is enormous , as we just saw in uganda , so that there 's a tendency to sweep everything under the rug in the interests of harmony .
they say : if justice leads to a continuation of war , then we do n't want justice .
ultimately it 's an insoluble dilemma .
it 's always a political decision when it 's time for one approach or when it 's time for the other . the international community has a responsibility to prevent violations of human rights .
yet , in many cases , we have a hard time living up to this duty .
in rwanda , for example , the international community allowed genocide to go on for more than 100 days .
why ca n't we react more quickly ? one problem is that we germans represent 80 million people out of a total of 7.5 billion .
it would be a bit arrogant to think that we germans could force the rest of the world onto the path to virtue .
but that does n't change what you were saying .
in rwanda , the international community failed in a very scandalous way .
the only thing comparable , and that on a much smaller scale , was our failure in srebrenica , and both gave us lots to think about .
it gave rise to the idea that in such extreme and clear cases the international community has to feel responsible politically and intervene .
if a million people are being massacred , it 's no longer one nation 's internal affair .
on the other hand , in every individual case , we have to look at what we can do and whether we have the right instruments for it .
in the case of rwanda , the un should never have withdrawn .
it should have intervened .
that is absolutely clear .
but it 's another question whether the un can simultaneously intervene in all the conflicts going on in the world without over-stretching itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uganda is another african nation with which germany wants closer ties as you mentioned , rwanda 's president paul kagame has pursued an ambitious program of development .
but is not the other side of the coin a relatively authoritarian stance toward domestic politics , and especially toward the media ? in the end , the people in the countries themselves have to decide .
in rwanda , i had the feeling when we talked not to the government , but to journalists and people on the margins of power , that they thought more freedom for the press would be a good idea .
on the other hand , the same people said : " do n't forget that the press played a huge role in the genocide . "
back then radio stations broadcast messages like : " kill your neighbors .
there are people from other ethnic groups .
massacre them , chop off their heads . "
and if this is the role of the press , then i understand why fears persist . germany has been very present in africa and is increasing its activities there .
why is that ? you only need to look at the map .
africa is a huge continent with gigantic problems and a population of 900 million people .
if things are n't going well , and africa ca n't cope with its own problems , they hardly have a choice but to solve them by exporting them to us .
the problem of illegal migrants actually brought us closer to africa .
another thing is that we are encountering more and more nations in africa with a healthy sense of self-confidence .
they 're increasingly following their own policies , and in the future we 'll be increasingly connected to them by the need for natural resources and other interests . in terms of development , we 've been active for a long time in africa .
but in 2008 we 're beginning a special program .
we 'll be opening new goethe institutes in dar es salaam and luanda , that is in tanzania and angola .
and the goethe institute will also be represented in rwanda in the form of a field office of the goethe institute in nairobi .
that signals that we 're looking for more dialogue with africa .
we hope that with cultural exchanges of this kind we 'll be better able to master crises by talking to one another . interview : ute schaeffer -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu is therefore planning to help out retired rockers , who never made millions to live on . many musicians and singers hit the big time in their 20s , and often even earlier .
under current rules , their airplay royalties stop coming in just as they retire , hitting them particularly hard .
that 's why the european commission announced this week that under a new proposal , european musicians and singers would see the copyright on their recorded performances extended to 95 years from the current level of 50 .
the eu 's move to help ageing rockers and other artists beat the financial blues during retirement would be ready for formal adoption by the european commission in the middle of the year , the european union 's executive arm said .
" if nothing is done , thousands of european performers who recorded in the late fifties and sixties will lose all of their airplay royalties over the next 10 years , " eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy said .
presenting the proposal , mccreevy said that he had found " no convincing reason " why composers should currently enjoy much longer copyright protection than performers .
commission moves to protect performers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles aznavour wo n't go hungry in his retirement " it is the performer who gives life to the composition and while most of us have no idea who wrote our favorite song , we can usually name the performer , " mccreevy said .
" i strongly believe that copyright protection for europe 's performers represents a moral right to control the use of their work and earn a living from their performances . "
in the united states , performers already enjoy copyright protection for 95 years .
in the european union , such protection has been limited to 50 years since the introduction of a 1993 law .
mccreevy acknowledged that he was less worried about big crowd-pullers such as britain 's ageless pop star cliff richard and french crooner charles aznavour than " the thousands of anonymous session musicians who contributed to sound recordings in the late fifties and sixties .
" they will no longer get airplay royalties from their recordings but these royalties are often their sole pension , " he said .
the aepo-artis association , representing several performer organizations at the european level , welcomed that brussels had recognized " the creative gain that performers bring . "
however , " some things still need to be clarified , " said guenaelle collet at apos-artis , citing in particular a proposal that record companies would have to contribute to a special fund for session musicians .
eu to investigate private copying and rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tokio hotel can look forward to decades of royalties mccreevy also said that he wanted to reopen consultations over levies for being able to make copies of a performance on computers , digital and other music players and which vary widely among countries .

the eu is therefore planning to help out retired rockers , who never made millions to live on . many musicians and singers hit the big time in their 20s , and often even earlier .
under current rules , their airplay royalties stop coming in just as they retire , hitting them particularly hard .
that 's why the european commission announced this week that under a new proposal , european musicians and singers would see the copyright on their recorded performances extended to 95 years from the current level of 50 .
the eu 's move to help ageing rockers and other artists beat the financial blues during retirement would be ready for formal adoption by the european commission in the middle of the year , the european union 's executive arm said .
" if nothing is done , thousands of european performers who recorded in the late fifties and sixties will lose all of their airplay royalties over the next 10 years , " eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy said .
presenting the proposal , mccreevy said that he had found " no convincing reason " why composers should currently enjoy much longer copyright protection than performers .

" i strongly believe that copyright protection for europe 's performers represents a moral right to control the use of their work and earn a living from their performances . "
in the united states , performers already enjoy copyright protection for 95 years .
in the european union , such protection has been limited to 50 years since the introduction of a 1993 law .
mccreevy acknowledged that he was less worried about big crowd-pullers such as britain 's ageless pop star cliff richard and french crooner charles aznavour than " the thousands of anonymous session musicians who contributed to sound recordings in the late fifties and sixties .
" they will no longer get airplay royalties from their recordings but these royalties are often their sole pension , " he said .
the aepo-artis association , representing several performer organizations at the european level , welcomed that brussels had recognized " the creative gain that performers bring . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 17.02.2008 german experts : rating agencies take blame for subprime crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the early warning system malfunctioned the major rating agencies are desperately trying to repair their tattered image .
experts say they share responsibility for the financial crisis as calls for political consequences are getting louder . until the outbreak of the subprime crisis , sector giants like standard & poor 's and moody 's in the us had enjoyed an aura of expertise and incorruptibility .
half a year later , they 're on the defensive .
the finance committee in the german parliament recently met with experts to discuss the role of the rating agencies in the crisis . the agencies have been aware of the need for change for a long time , said rating expert oliver everling , who 'd spoken with the committee .
he added that " the agencies definitely do n't bear responsibility alone for the subprime crisis . " failure of early warning system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aaa rating was n't always legitimate indeed , the agencies have tried to take other market participants to task .
everling said that banks bore a greater share of the blame for investing in risky products whose complexity they did n't understand , such as collateralized debt obligations -lrb- cdos -rrb- . even after the shaky bonds had lost their value and experts had warned that the us mortgage market was about to burst , the rating agencies were still granting mortgage derivatives the highest score of aaa .
it was n't until june 2007 that the ratings dropped , leaving the agencies scrambling to defend their role as the " early warning system . " furthermore , the rating agencies have had to refute accusations of corruption and conflict of interest .
according to critics , the credit monitors not only evaluated complex financial products but also advised the issuers who wanted to sell them . consulting claims undermine transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us crisis had ramifications across the world moody 's has rebuffed claims that it had been involved in consulting , but said it 's possible that " analytical discussions " took place with issuers or their advisors . " the line between dialogue and consultation is fluid , " everling said . the rating expert warned against hastily slapping regulations on the industry .
the consequence of the agencies ' mistakes should be more and not less rating - with greater competition , he said .
after all , standard & poor 's and moody 's dominate the global market with an 80 percent share , making them practically immune to national politics . instead , politicians around the world have to convince standard & poor 's and moody 's to participate in regulation negotiations , said everling - at the very least to improve their reputation for transparency . it 's not always clear where their ratings actually come from , say critics .
german chancellor angela merkel said last year during the financial turbulence that " nothing should be pulled out of a black box that no one understands . " caution rises as confidence lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the chaos have been spared ?
wuerzburg economist ekkehard wenger said he doubts that pressure from politicians can bring transparency back to the industry . " as long as the rating agencies are paid by those that sell the papers , not much will change , " wenger said . at the very least , however , the sector already seems to have lost the blind trust it once enjoyed . " the confidence of the market in credit ratings has suffered under the current situation , " conceded the fitch rating agency recently . as a result , banks and investors will have to take a closer look at who they entrust their money with , said franz waas , head of dekabank . " traditional credit analysis will become more significant again , " he said .

" if nothing is done , thousands of european performers who recorded in the late fifties and sixties will lose all of their airplay royalties over the next 10 years , " eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy said .
presenting the proposal , mccreevy said that he had found " no convincing reason " why composers should currently enjoy much longer copyright protection than performers .
commission moves to protect performers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles aznavour wo n't go hungry in his retirement " it is the performer who gives life to the composition and while most of us have no idea who wrote our favorite song , we can usually name the performer , " mccreevy said .
" i strongly believe that copyright protection for europe 's performers represents a moral right to control the use of their work and earn a living from their performances . "
in the united states , performers already enjoy copyright protection for 95 years .
in the european union , such protection has been limited to 50 years since the introduction of a 1993 law .
mccreevy acknowledged that he was less worried about big crowd-pullers such as britain 's ageless pop star cliff richard and french crooner charles aznavour than " the thousands of anonymous session musicians who contributed to sound recordings in the late fifties and sixties .
" they will no longer get airplay royalties from their recordings but these royalties are often their sole pension , " he said .
the aepo-artis association , representing several performer organizations at the european level , welcomed that brussels had recognized " the creative gain that performers bring . "
however , " some things still need to be clarified , " said guenaelle collet at apos-artis , citing in particular a proposal that record companies would have to contribute to a special fund for session musicians .

the eu is therefore planning to help out retired rockers , who never made millions to live on . many musicians and singers hit the big time in their 20s , and often even earlier .
under current rules , their airplay royalties stop coming in just as they retire , hitting them particularly hard .
that 's why the european commission announced this week that under a new proposal , european musicians and singers would see the copyright on their recorded performances extended to 95 years from the current level of 50 .
the eu 's move to help ageing rockers and other artists beat the financial blues during retirement would be ready for formal adoption by the european commission in the middle of the year , the european union 's executive arm said .
" if nothing is done , thousands of european performers who recorded in the late fifties and sixties will lose all of their airplay royalties over the next 10 years , " eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy said .
presenting the proposal , mccreevy said that he had found " no convincing reason " why composers should currently enjoy much longer copyright protection than performers .
commission moves to protect performers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles aznavour wo n't go hungry in his retirement " it is the performer who gives life to the composition and while most of us have no idea who wrote our favorite song , we can usually name the performer , " mccreevy said .
" i strongly believe that copyright protection for europe 's performers represents a moral right to control the use of their work and earn a living from their performances . "
in the united states , performers already enjoy copyright protection for 95 years .
in the european union , such protection has been limited to 50 years since the introduction of a 1993 law .
mccreevy acknowledged that he was less worried about big crowd-pullers such as britain 's ageless pop star cliff richard and french crooner charles aznavour than " the thousands of anonymous session musicians who contributed to sound recordings in the late fifties and sixties .
" they will no longer get airplay royalties from their recordings but these royalties are often their sole pension , " he said .
the aepo-artis association , representing several performer organizations at the european level , welcomed that brussels had recognized " the creative gain that performers bring . "
however , " some things still need to be clarified , " said guenaelle collet at apos-artis , citing in particular a proposal that record companies would have to contribute to a special fund for session musicians .
eu to investigate private copying and rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tokio hotel can look forward to decades of royalties mccreevy also said that he wanted to reopen consultations over levies for being able to make copies of a performance on computers , digital and other music players and which vary widely among countries .
" there can be no question of calling into doubt the entitlement of rights holders to compensation for private copying , " he said .
" at the same time there is a need to look at how the levies are applied in practice . "
collet warned that " performers will be extremely cautious about the question . "
while glad that the commission was consulting the industry , veronique desbrosses , secretary general of the european grouping of societies of authors and composers , said : " there 's no viable alternative to private copying levies .

experts say they share responsibility for the financial crisis as calls for political consequences are getting louder . until the outbreak of the subprime crisis , sector giants like standard & poor 's and moody 's in the us had enjoyed an aura of expertise and incorruptibility .
half a year later , they 're on the defensive .
the finance committee in the german parliament recently met with experts to discuss the role of the rating agencies in the crisis . the agencies have been aware of the need for change for a long time , said rating expert oliver everling , who 'd spoken with the committee .
he added that " the agencies definitely do n't bear responsibility alone for the subprime crisis . " failure of early warning system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aaa rating was n't always legitimate indeed , the agencies have tried to take other market participants to task .
everling said that banks bore a greater share of the blame for investing in risky products whose complexity they did n't understand , such as collateralized debt obligations -lrb- cdos -rrb- . even after the shaky bonds had lost their value and experts had warned that the us mortgage market was about to burst , the rating agencies were still granting mortgage derivatives the highest score of aaa .
it was n't until june 2007 that the ratings dropped , leaving the agencies scrambling to defend their role as the " early warning system . " furthermore , the rating agencies have had to refute accusations of corruption and conflict of interest .
according to critics , the credit monitors not only evaluated complex financial products but also advised the issuers who wanted to sell them . consulting claims undermine transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us crisis had ramifications across the world moody 's has rebuffed claims that it had been involved in consulting , but said it 's possible that " analytical discussions " took place with issuers or their advisors . " the line between dialogue and consultation is fluid , " everling said . the rating expert warned against hastily slapping regulations on the industry .
the consequence of the agencies ' mistakes should be more and not less rating - with greater competition , he said .
after all , standard & poor 's and moody 's dominate the global market with an 80 percent share , making them practically immune to national politics . instead , politicians around the world have to convince standard & poor 's and moody 's to participate in regulation negotiations , said everling - at the very least to improve their reputation for transparency . it 's not always clear where their ratings actually come from , say critics .

wuerzburg economist ekkehard wenger said he doubts that pressure from politicians can bring transparency back to the industry . " as long as the rating agencies are paid by those that sell the papers , not much will change , " wenger said . at the very least , however , the sector already seems to have lost the blind trust it once enjoyed . " the confidence of the market in credit ratings has suffered under the current situation , " conceded the fitch rating agency recently . as a result , banks and investors will have to take a closer look at who they entrust their money with , said franz waas , head of dekabank .

europe is paying more attention to both the potential and the problems of africa .
deutsche welle spoke with german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about two nations with troubled pasts : uganda and rwanda . german president horst koehler and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have both recently returned from trips to africa , where they pledged their support to the continent . deutsche welle asked german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about the situation in uganda and rwanda in particular . deutsche welle : horst koehler recently made his fifth trip to africa as germany 's president .
what were your impressions ? georg boomgaarden : in uganda and rwanda , the president visited two nations that suffered for years of civil war and are still influenced by the traumas resulting from internal strife .
so the trip was overshadowed by the past and the search for ways for these countries to find reconciliation and peace .
i think it was a very political trip . reconciliation is considered a precondition for peace and development .
are uganda and rwanda examples of that ? i think it 's too early to say .
we spoke with representatives of the president and the civilian population , and we again saw how difficult the process is .
it 's just beginning in uganda , and only time will tell whether it 's a success . by african standards , rwanda has seen fairly good economic development .
there 's a respectable amount of growth .
but the shadows of the past are still there .
together with president koehler we visited a so-called gachacha court , a traditional body that tries to combine legal justice and reconciliation .
that 's one possible path .
on the other hand , there is the international rwanda tribunal , which is looking at the 60 worst cases .
i think it will definitely take a generation or more before the wounds will heal .
the point now is to just co-exist in peace . traditional forms of justice sometimes have more to do with dealing with trauma than reaching legal decisions .
to what extent can international law be hooked up with local tradition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boomgaarden , right , is deputy to foreign minister steinmeier i think we 've been searching very intensively over the past few decades for ways of doing this .
the cases were all very different , and the earliest was perhaps the franco era in spain .
in bosnia and kosovo we also had cases where one part of a country 's population attacked another one .
and we 've seen similar things in various african and latin american countries . justice alone is n't sufficient to deal with the past .
on the one hand , it 's important to take away from those who rape women , kill children , burn down homes and commit acts of murder the sense of security that says there 's always an amnesty , and no one will be punished .
on the other hand , the desire for peace is enormous , as we just saw in uganda , so that there 's a tendency to sweep everything under the rug in the interests of harmony .
they say : if justice leads to a continuation of war , then we do n't want justice .
ultimately it 's an insoluble dilemma .

why ca n't we react more quickly ? one problem is that we germans represent 80 million people out of a total of 7.5 billion .

if a million people are being massacred , it 's no longer one nation 's internal affair .
on the other hand , in every individual case , we have to look at what we can do and whether we have the right instruments for it .
in the case of rwanda , the un should never have withdrawn .
it should have intervened .
that is absolutely clear .

on the other hand , the same people said : " do n't forget that the press played a huge role in the genocide . "
back then radio stations broadcast messages like : " kill your neighbors .
there are people from other ethnic groups .

europe is paying more attention to both the potential and the problems of africa .
deutsche welle spoke with german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about two nations with troubled pasts : uganda and rwanda . german president horst koehler and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have both recently returned from trips to africa , where they pledged their support to the continent . deutsche welle asked german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about the situation in uganda and rwanda in particular . deutsche welle : horst koehler recently made his fifth trip to africa as germany 's president .
what were your impressions ? georg boomgaarden : in uganda and rwanda , the president visited two nations that suffered for years of civil war and are still influenced by the traumas resulting from internal strife .
so the trip was overshadowed by the past and the search for ways for these countries to find reconciliation and peace .
i think it was a very political trip . reconciliation is considered a precondition for peace and development .
are uganda and rwanda examples of that ? i think it 's too early to say .
we spoke with representatives of the president and the civilian population , and we again saw how difficult the process is .
it 's just beginning in uganda , and only time will tell whether it 's a success . by african standards , rwanda has seen fairly good economic development .
there 's a respectable amount of growth .
but the shadows of the past are still there .
together with president koehler we visited a so-called gachacha court , a traditional body that tries to combine legal justice and reconciliation .
that 's one possible path .
on the other hand , there is the international rwanda tribunal , which is looking at the 60 worst cases .
i think it will definitely take a generation or more before the wounds will heal .
the point now is to just co-exist in peace . traditional forms of justice sometimes have more to do with dealing with trauma than reaching legal decisions .
to what extent can international law be hooked up with local tradition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boomgaarden , right , is deputy to foreign minister steinmeier i think we 've been searching very intensively over the past few decades for ways of doing this .
the cases were all very different , and the earliest was perhaps the franco era in spain .
in bosnia and kosovo we also had cases where one part of a country 's population attacked another one .
and we 've seen similar things in various african and latin american countries . justice alone is n't sufficient to deal with the past .
on the one hand , it 's important to take away from those who rape women , kill children , burn down homes and commit acts of murder the sense of security that says there 's always an amnesty , and no one will be punished .
on the other hand , the desire for peace is enormous , as we just saw in uganda , so that there 's a tendency to sweep everything under the rug in the interests of harmony .
they say : if justice leads to a continuation of war , then we do n't want justice .
ultimately it 's an insoluble dilemma .
it 's always a political decision when it 's time for one approach or when it 's time for the other . the international community has a responsibility to prevent violations of human rights .
yet , in many cases , we have a hard time living up to this duty .
in rwanda , for example , the international community allowed genocide to go on for more than 100 days .

europe is paying more attention to both the potential and the problems of africa .
deutsche welle spoke with german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about two nations with troubled pasts : uganda and rwanda . german president horst koehler and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have both recently returned from trips to africa , where they pledged their support to the continent . deutsche welle asked german foreign undersecretary georg boomgaarden about the situation in uganda and rwanda in particular . deutsche welle : horst koehler recently made his fifth trip to africa as germany 's president .
what were your impressions ? georg boomgaarden : in uganda and rwanda , the president visited two nations that suffered for years of civil war and are still influenced by the traumas resulting from internal strife .
so the trip was overshadowed by the past and the search for ways for these countries to find reconciliation and peace .
i think it was a very political trip . reconciliation is considered a precondition for peace and development .
are uganda and rwanda examples of that ? i think it 's too early to say .
we spoke with representatives of the president and the civilian population , and we again saw how difficult the process is .
it 's just beginning in uganda , and only time will tell whether it 's a success . by african standards , rwanda has seen fairly good economic development .
there 's a respectable amount of growth .
but the shadows of the past are still there .
together with president koehler we visited a so-called gachacha court , a traditional body that tries to combine legal justice and reconciliation .
that 's one possible path .
on the other hand , there is the international rwanda tribunal , which is looking at the 60 worst cases .
i think it will definitely take a generation or more before the wounds will heal .
the point now is to just co-exist in peace . traditional forms of justice sometimes have more to do with dealing with trauma than reaching legal decisions .
to what extent can international law be hooked up with local tradition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boomgaarden , right , is deputy to foreign minister steinmeier i think we 've been searching very intensively over the past few decades for ways of doing this .
the cases were all very different , and the earliest was perhaps the franco era in spain .
in bosnia and kosovo we also had cases where one part of a country 's population attacked another one .
and we 've seen similar things in various african and latin american countries . justice alone is n't sufficient to deal with the past .
on the one hand , it 's important to take away from those who rape women , kill children , burn down homes and commit acts of murder the sense of security that says there 's always an amnesty , and no one will be punished .
on the other hand , the desire for peace is enormous , as we just saw in uganda , so that there 's a tendency to sweep everything under the rug in the interests of harmony .
they say : if justice leads to a continuation of war , then we do n't want justice .
ultimately it 's an insoluble dilemma .
it 's always a political decision when it 's time for one approach or when it 's time for the other . the international community has a responsibility to prevent violations of human rights .
yet , in many cases , we have a hard time living up to this duty .
in rwanda , for example , the international community allowed genocide to go on for more than 100 days .
why ca n't we react more quickly ? one problem is that we germans represent 80 million people out of a total of 7.5 billion .
it would be a bit arrogant to think that we germans could force the rest of the world onto the path to virtue .
but that does n't change what you were saying .
in rwanda , the international community failed in a very scandalous way .
the only thing comparable , and that on a much smaller scale , was our failure in srebrenica , and both gave us lots to think about .
it gave rise to the idea that in such extreme and clear cases the international community has to feel responsible politically and intervene .
if a million people are being massacred , it 's no longer one nation 's internal affair .
on the other hand , in every individual case , we have to look at what we can do and whether we have the right instruments for it .
in the case of rwanda , the un should never have withdrawn .
it should have intervened .
that is absolutely clear .
but it 's another question whether the un can simultaneously intervene in all the conflicts going on in the world without over-stretching itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uganda is another african nation with which germany wants closer ties as you mentioned , rwanda 's president paul kagame has pursued an ambitious program of development .
but is not the other side of the coin a relatively authoritarian stance toward domestic politics , and especially toward the media ? in the end , the people in the countries themselves have to decide .
in rwanda , i had the feeling when we talked not to the government , but to journalists and people on the margins of power , that they thought more freedom for the press would be a good idea .
on the other hand , the same people said : " do n't forget that the press played a huge role in the genocide . "
back then radio stations broadcast messages like : " kill your neighbors .
there are people from other ethnic groups .
massacre them , chop off their heads . "
and if this is the role of the press , then i understand why fears persist . germany has been very present in africa and is increasing its activities there .
why is that ? you only need to look at the map .
africa is a huge continent with gigantic problems and a population of 900 million people .
if things are n't going well , and africa ca n't cope with its own problems , they hardly have a choice but to solve them by exporting them to us .
the problem of illegal migrants actually brought us closer to africa .
another thing is that we are encountering more and more nations in africa with a healthy sense of self-confidence .
they 're increasingly following their own policies , and in the future we 'll be increasingly connected to them by the need for natural resources and other interests . in terms of development , we 've been active for a long time in africa .
but in 2008 we 're beginning a special program .
we 'll be opening new goethe institutes in dar es salaam and luanda , that is in tanzania and angola .

experts say they share responsibility for the financial crisis as calls for political consequences are getting louder . until the outbreak of the subprime crisis , sector giants like standard & poor 's and moody 's in the us had enjoyed an aura of expertise and incorruptibility .
half a year later , they 're on the defensive .
the finance committee in the german parliament recently met with experts to discuss the role of the rating agencies in the crisis . the agencies have been aware of the need for change for a long time , said rating expert oliver everling , who 'd spoken with the committee .
he added that " the agencies definitely do n't bear responsibility alone for the subprime crisis . " failure of early warning system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aaa rating was n't always legitimate indeed , the agencies have tried to take other market participants to task .
everling said that banks bore a greater share of the blame for investing in risky products whose complexity they did n't understand , such as collateralized debt obligations -lrb- cdos -rrb- . even after the shaky bonds had lost their value and experts had warned that the us mortgage market was about to burst , the rating agencies were still granting mortgage derivatives the highest score of aaa .
it was n't until june 2007 that the ratings dropped , leaving the agencies scrambling to defend their role as the " early warning system . " furthermore , the rating agencies have had to refute accusations of corruption and conflict of interest .
according to critics , the credit monitors not only evaluated complex financial products but also advised the issuers who wanted to sell them . consulting claims undermine transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us crisis had ramifications across the world moody 's has rebuffed claims that it had been involved in consulting , but said it 's possible that " analytical discussions " took place with issuers or their advisors . " the line between dialogue and consultation is fluid , " everling said . the rating expert warned against hastily slapping regulations on the industry .
the consequence of the agencies ' mistakes should be more and not less rating - with greater competition , he said .
after all , standard & poor 's and moody 's dominate the global market with an 80 percent share , making them practically immune to national politics . instead , politicians around the world have to convince standard & poor 's and moody 's to participate in regulation negotiations , said everling - at the very least to improve their reputation for transparency . it 's not always clear where their ratings actually come from , say critics .
german chancellor angela merkel said last year during the financial turbulence that " nothing should be pulled out of a black box that no one understands . " caution rises as confidence lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the chaos have been spared ?
wuerzburg economist ekkehard wenger said he doubts that pressure from politicians can bring transparency back to the industry . " as long as the rating agencies are paid by those that sell the papers , not much will change , " wenger said . at the very least , however , the sector already seems to have lost the blind trust it once enjoyed . " the confidence of the market in credit ratings has suffered under the current situation , " conceded the fitch rating agency recently . as a result , banks and investors will have to take a closer look at who they entrust their money with , said franz waas , head of dekabank .

16 , by an international jury headed by renowned greek-born director costa-gavras .
it beat out productions from britain and hollywood for the berlin festival 's top honor . " it is a prize for brazilian film , " said padilha whose movie tells the story of a brutal police clean-up operation ahead of a 1997 visit to brazil by pope john paul ii . wearing a red berlinale scarf , padilha said winning the award would encourage him to continue to make critical films success in berlin coming against the backdrop of a renewed international recognition of latin american cinema . with no script and his actors largely improvising , padilha hoped to give his movie a documentary film , he said . the film has come under criticism for glorifying police brutality in rio de janeiro 's slums . it 's criticism that is misplaced and often coming from viewers who did n't understand the film , padilha said . " the film aims to explain how the state turns policemen either into corrupt people ... or worst of all violent people , " the 40-year-old director told reporters .
" the huge majority of brazilians understand that .
i do n't think it 's mysterious . " costa-gavras said the jury 's decision to award the golden bear to padilha was a unanimous decision . two awards for " there will be blood " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anderson also won in berlin eight years ago with " magnolia " the berlinale 's jury grand prize went to us oscar-winning documentary filmmaker errol morris ' " standard operating procedure , " a detailed examination into the shocking events surrounding iraq 's abu ghraib prison . a total of 21 films were competing for the festival 's top honors this year with " there will be blood " from us director paul anderson winning two awards - one for best director and for one for jonny greenwood for his musical score for the film . " there will be blood , " which stars daniel day-lewis as a ruthless oilman has been nominated for eight academy awards , which are to be presented in los angeles next week . but holding the two silver bears , anderson said , " that 's enough for me . "
anderson won a golden bear for " magnolia " eight years ago . some 400 films screened now in its 58th year , the berlinale is one of the world 's top three film festivals .
saturday 's berlinale awards were handed out in a hollywood-style gala ceremony . it has also been a successful festival for iranian cinema with one of the nation 's leading actors reza najie winning the berlin film festival 's top award for best actor . he played a stressed-out father trying to keep his family financially afloat in iranian director majid majidi 's light poignant comedy " the song of sparrows " -lrb- " avaze gonjeshk-ha " -rrb- . it was also announced saturday that iranian-born director hana makhmalbaf 's " buddha collapsed out of shame " -lrb- " buda az sharm foru rikht " -rrb- had won the 23rd film peace prize .
the prize is valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,337 -rrb- . makhmalbaf 's movie screened in the berlinale 's generation section , which is aimed at younger audiences , and focuses on a young afghan girl who lives in the mountains near the place where the 1,500-year- old buddha statues were blown up by the taliban in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hawkins was moved by the jury 's decision british actress sally hawkins goes home with the festival 's award for best actress for her role in british director mike leigh 's " happy go lucky " about a positive-thinking londoner called poppy . speaking after accepting the festival 's silver bear , najie said it was his destiny to come to berlin .
" thank you berlin , thank you cinema , " he told the awards ceremony in the german capital . hawkins said she had been completely overwhelmed after receiving the prize and had burst into tears after leaving the stage . the silver bear for best script went to chinese director wang xiaoshuai 's " in love we trust " -lrb- " zuo you " -rrb- about the tensions caused by a sick child . earlier saturday , the festival announced that " lemon tree " from israeli director eran riklis won the audience prize for one of the berlinale 's main sections . riklis ' film was not included in the berlinale 's main competition but was screened in the festival 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . the 11-day berlinale screened nearly 400 pictures and attracted 20,000 accredited visitors from 125 countries .
it concludes on sunday with repeat showings of some of the festival 's most popular films . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 17.02.2008 eu moves to protect ageing rockers with royalties in retirement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite already being extremely wealthy , the stones will also earn more from the plan it may not be something the rolling stones have to worry about , but many rock stars face cash concerns in their old age .
the eu is therefore planning to help out retired rockers , who never made millions to live on . many musicians and singers hit the big time in their 20s , and often even earlier .
under current rules , their airplay royalties stop coming in just as they retire , hitting them particularly hard .
that 's why the european commission announced this week that under a new proposal , european musicians and singers would see the copyright on their recorded performances extended to 95 years from the current level of 50 .
the eu 's move to help ageing rockers and other artists beat the financial blues during retirement would be ready for formal adoption by the european commission in the middle of the year , the european union 's executive arm said .
" if nothing is done , thousands of european performers who recorded in the late fifties and sixties will lose all of their airplay royalties over the next 10 years , " eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy said .
presenting the proposal , mccreevy said that he had found " no convincing reason " why composers should currently enjoy much longer copyright protection than performers .
commission moves to protect performers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles aznavour wo n't go hungry in his retirement " it is the performer who gives life to the composition and while most of us have no idea who wrote our favorite song , we can usually name the performer , " mccreevy said .
" i strongly believe that copyright protection for europe 's performers represents a moral right to control the use of their work and earn a living from their performances . "
in the united states , performers already enjoy copyright protection for 95 years .
in the european union , such protection has been limited to 50 years since the introduction of a 1993 law .
mccreevy acknowledged that he was less worried about big crowd-pullers such as britain 's ageless pop star cliff richard and french crooner charles aznavour than " the thousands of anonymous session musicians who contributed to sound recordings in the late fifties and sixties .
" they will no longer get airplay royalties from their recordings but these royalties are often their sole pension , " he said .
the aepo-artis association , representing several performer organizations at the european level , welcomed that brussels had recognized " the creative gain that performers bring . "
however , " some things still need to be clarified , " said guenaelle collet at apos-artis , citing in particular a proposal that record companies would have to contribute to a special fund for session musicians .
eu to investigate private copying and rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tokio hotel can look forward to decades of royalties mccreevy also said that he wanted to reopen consultations over levies for being able to make copies of a performance on computers , digital and other music players and which vary widely among countries .
" there can be no question of calling into doubt the entitlement of rights holders to compensation for private copying , " he said .
" at the same time there is a need to look at how the levies are applied in practice . "
collet warned that " performers will be extremely cautious about the question . "
while glad that the commission was consulting the industry , veronique desbrosses , secretary general of the european grouping of societies of authors and composers , said : " there 's no viable alternative to private copying levies .

cardiff council wants to avoid the tribunals which have dogged a number of uk councils following the introduction of equal pay legislation .
the settlement could mean a pay-out of more than £ 9,500 per person .
the council has the go-ahead to borrow £ 11.5m to cover settlements , if its executive agrees to the proposals .
but the council admitted it had not reached a settlement that trade unions could recommend to members .
the council 's executive has been advised to make settlement offers to all potential equal pay claim recipients " in the interests of maintaining good employee relations and preventing costly and time-consuming legal action " .
we believe that this is a fair settlement which will prevent a lengthy legal battle and enable us to pay compensation councillor mark stephens members will meet on thursday to discuss the report relating to equal pay .
similar settlements have already been reached in fellow welsh councils neath port talbot and torfaen and across the uk .
the welsh assembly government has given approval to the council to borrow £ 11.5m to fund the settlement , which covers discrepancies in back pay .
alternatively , the council said it was looking at other sources of finance which would not affect the council tax payer .
working hours a council spokeswoman said it had been negotiating with trade unions since september and that it believed its offer was fair .
" -lsb- it -rsb- would prevent potential costly legal battles which the authority would defend robustly , " she said .
staff believed to be affected will be invited to a series of briefing sessions to learn what their entitlement might be and learn how to claim it .
the level of settlement would depend on grade , length of service and contracted working hours .
the assembly government requires that all payment to eligible employees is made by 31 march .
executive member for finance mark stephens said : " we want to ensure that we look after our employees affected in this way and have worked hard to bring as speedy a conclusion as we can to this process .
" we believe that this is a fair settlement which will prevent a lengthy legal battle and enable us to pay compensation . "

cardiff council wants to avoid the tribunals which have dogged a number of uk councils following the introduction of equal pay legislation .
the settlement could mean a pay-out of more than £ 9,500 per person .
the council has the go-ahead to borrow £ 11.5m to cover settlements , if its executive agrees to the proposals .
but the council admitted it had not reached a settlement that trade unions could recommend to members .
the council 's executive has been advised to make settlement offers to all potential equal pay claim recipients " in the interests of maintaining good employee relations and preventing costly and time-consuming legal action " .
we believe that this is a fair settlement which will prevent a lengthy legal battle and enable us to pay compensation councillor mark stephens members will meet on thursday to discuss the report relating to equal pay .
similar settlements have already been reached in fellow welsh councils neath port talbot and torfaen and across the uk .
the welsh assembly government has given approval to the council to borrow £ 11.5m to fund the settlement , which covers discrepancies in back pay .
alternatively , the council said it was looking at other sources of finance which would not affect the council tax payer .
working hours a council spokeswoman said it had been negotiating with trade unions since september and that it believed its offer was fair .
" -lsb- it -rsb- would prevent potential costly legal battles which the authority would defend robustly , " she said .
staff believed to be affected will be invited to a series of briefing sessions to learn what their entitlement might be and learn how to claim it .
the level of settlement would depend on grade , length of service and contracted working hours .
the assembly government requires that all payment to eligible employees is made by 31 march .
executive member for finance mark stephens said : " we want to ensure that we look after our employees affected in this way and have worked hard to bring as speedy a conclusion as we can to this process .
" we believe that this is a fair settlement which will prevent a lengthy legal battle and enable us to pay compensation . "
councils agreed to review wages and implement new pay structures in 1997 .

the secretary of state for communities also said local authorities should " think carefully " about whether documents needed to be translated .
she told the bbc 's andrew marr show the ability to speak english was " fundamental " for migrants to the uk .
gordon brown has previously said people who want british citizenship should be expected to learn the language .
ms blears said : " if you want to get on , if you want to get a job , if you want to look after your family , the ability to speak the language is fundamental .
" we 're saying to local authorities in particular - do n't go translating all the documents that you used to in the past .
" think very carefully about how you can bring people together . "
the government announced in january it was to give free english language classes to immigrants to england who have long-term needs .
picture messages the tuition will be free for those on benefits , and aimed at long-standing residents whose english is still poor - rather than those who may not stay .
the government introduced means-testing for english courses last september , following a surge in demand .
ms blears also said there may be an alternative method in which messages can be communicated to non-english speakers .
she said : " some local authorities were translating annual reports - probably most english people do n't read a local authority 's annual report .
" if you 've got emergency instructions for how to get to the accident and emergency department in the hospital , if you have a terrible accident , then you may well need to translate that .
" but the advice is ' think twice ' and maybe you can do things in a pictorial way that has the english translation underneath .
" so actually , in the process of giving people information , you 're helping them to learn english as well . "
multicultural concerns ms blears also said the term multiculturalism means " all things to all people " but that for both her and the labour party it meant that we " celebrate the diversity of this country " .
on the whole we 've been taking separate groups and treating them rather separately , and giving them special status and instead of saying that all of us have got to be part of the same single framework of law and habit baroness pauline neville-jones but she added : " that should n't mean people leading separate lives , and that 's where i think the danger is . "
the prime minister said in december that immigrants " should be able to speak the english language ... should be able to understand and speak about british cultural traditions " .
meanwhile conservative shadow security minister , baroness pauline neville-jones , has agreed with a report by security experts , who claim the uk has become a " soft touch " for terrorists because of rising multiculturalism .
she said : " on the whole we 've been taking separate groups and treating them rather separately , and giving them special status and instead of saying that all of us have got to be part of the same single framework of law and habit and getting at some of the separatism that 's been going on . "

once again , the balkans are entering uncharted waters .
while slovenia and albania are expected to be among the first countries to recognise kosovo , others like macedonia and bosnia are hesitating due to their own painful experience with ethnic separatism .
those who support kosovo 's independence say it will close the last chapter in the break up of yugoslavia .
those who oppose it fear it will rekindle the embers of ethnic conflict at the heart of europe .
police in republika srpska , bosnia 's serb entity , have been put on alert , after some local serb groups called for secession .
clear message but local politicians are more likely to use kosovo as a way of strengthening their position within bosnia rather than seek unification with serbia .
restive albanian minorities in serbia 's southern presevo valley and in macedonia are also watching events in kosovo closely .
but the message from the west is clear - " do n't even think about it " .
in 2001 , the eu and nato managed to prevent an all-out conflict in macedonia between security forces and ethnic albanians , who make up one-quarter of the population .
now , hopes that the country may be invited to join both the eu and nato this year seem to have taken over from dreams of a greater albania , which the president of albania himself said should be relegated to history .
what 's changed since the break-up of yugoslavia is the clear prospect that all countries in the region can become members of the western clubs , as slovenia has already done , with croatia soon to follow .
the big question is which way serbia will decide to go , and much will depend on how belgrade reacts to kosovo 's independence .

in its latest budget , the authority says it will have almost £ 30m available by april 2008 to fund expected payouts .
cumbria county council is among several authorities facing hefty bills to pay for equal pay settlements involving care workers , cleaners and cooks .
unions say the settlements will involve thousands of mostly female staff .
' past liabilities ' a cumbria county council spokesman said : " our budget continues to take into account the potential settlement implications of employment tribunal judgements on equal pay and equal value claims from county council employees .
" the precise amount the council must pay out is still unknown , but the council will have set aside £ 29.5m by april 2008 to help cover its past liabilities and future costs .
" this budget adds a further £ 11m in 2008/9 .
" the savings to cover equal pay / value claims may need to be maintained for each of the next 10 years to cover the cost of borrowing and other increased costs . "
