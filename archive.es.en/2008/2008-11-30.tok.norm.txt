france midfielder ribery - wearing red gloves and pink boots - was again the outstanding figure , coming close to a goal with a shot saved by adler after he had dribbled round four players .
instead , with bayern now fully in charge , he was the provider when he collected the ball in midfield and cleverly threaded the ball through for klose whose low shot beat adler into the corner .

we could n't get the ball forward precisely enough and bayern deserved to win . "
elsewhere , claudio pizarro scored a hat-trick , diego converted a penalty and aaron hunt was also on target as werder bremen ran out 5-0 winners over visiting eintracht frankfurt .
mike hanke bagged a brace and mikael forssell added a third just before the break as hanover raced into a 3-0 lead over karlsruhe .

toni ended the deadlock in the day 's top match in leverkusen when ze roberto 's cross from the left found the italian striker with space in front of goal to head home in the 59th minute .
klose finished the game off with a strike from the edge of the box with eight minutes remaining after a pass from franck ribery .
league top scorer vedad ibisevic meanwhile increased his tally to 17 with a fifth-minute goal , carlos eduardo added a second with a solo run six minutes later and francisco copado scored an 89th-minute penalty as promoted hoffenheim overcame bielefeld .
bayern to challenge hoffenheim it was the eighth victory in nine games for ralf rangnick 's side who now have 34 points from 15 matches , three more than bayern going into next friday 's match between the two sides in munich .

it 's a great story what 's happened there in the last few months but we want to get to the top and we are pleased they are now coming to munich ...
i am looking forward to the game , " bayern coach juergen klinsmann told premiere television .
ribery shines in red and pink hertha berlin , who defeated cologne 2-1 on friday evening , are now third on 30 , with leverkusen slipping to fourth on 28 .
leverkusen had slightly the better of the opening exchanges against bayern with patrick helmes seeing a shot tipped over the bar by michael rensing , before henrique headed against the bar from a corner .
however bayern also threatened , and rene adler in goal twice had to save long-range efforts from bastian schweinsteiger , who also saw a shot flash narrowly wide of the post before the break .
neither side looked like scoring until toni rose to head in ze robert 's cross for a goal which heralded a more controlled spell for klinsmann 's side .
france midfielder ribery - wearing red gloves and pink boots - was again the outstanding figure , coming close to a goal with a shot saved by adler after he had dribbled round four players .
instead , with bayern now fully in charge , he was the provider when he collected the ball in midfield and cleverly threaded the ball through for klose whose low shot beat adler into the corner .
a cross from tranquillo barnetta which came off the top of the bar two minutes from time was the nearest leverkusen came to a goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said bayern 's class was coming out klinsmann said bayern 's class was beginning to shine through as the season progressed .
bayern improving , says coach klinsi " the boys are enjoying their football and the team is now in a position to control a game .
we were in complete control in the second half and it was only a matter of time before we scored . "
leverkusen coach bruno labbadia said : " we started the first 25 minutes as we wanted to and were in control , but then we were pushed back too deep .
we could n't get the ball forward precisely enough and bayern deserved to win . "
elsewhere , claudio pizarro scored a hat-trick , diego converted a penalty and aaron hunt was also on target as werder bremen ran out 5-0 winners over visiting eintracht frankfurt .
mike hanke bagged a brace and mikael forssell added a third just before the break as hanover raced into a 3-0 lead over karlsruhe .
but the home side were left hanging on after a penalty shortly after the interval from antonio da silva and a late goal from lars stindl reduced the deficit to 3-2 .

toni ended the deadlock in the day 's top match in leverkusen when ze roberto 's cross from the left found the italian striker with space in front of goal to head home in the 59th minute .
klose finished the game off with a strike from the edge of the box with eight minutes remaining after a pass from franck ribery .
league top scorer vedad ibisevic meanwhile increased his tally to 17 with a fifth-minute goal , carlos eduardo added a second with a solo run six minutes later and francisco copado scored an 89th-minute penalty as promoted hoffenheim overcame bielefeld .

ribery shines in red and pink hertha berlin , who defeated cologne 2-1 on friday evening , are now third on 30 , with leverkusen slipping to fourth on 28 .
leverkusen had slightly the better of the opening exchanges against bayern with patrick helmes seeing a shot tipped over the bar by michael rensing , before henrique headed against the bar from a corner .
however bayern also threatened , and rene adler in goal twice had to save long-range efforts from bastian schweinsteiger , who also saw a shot flash narrowly wide of the post before the break .
neither side looked like scoring until toni rose to head in ze robert 's cross for a goal which heralded a more controlled spell for klinsmann 's side .
france midfielder ribery - wearing red gloves and pink boots - was again the outstanding figure , coming close to a goal with a shot saved by adler after he had dribbled round four players .
instead , with bayern now fully in charge , he was the provider when he collected the ball in midfield and cleverly threaded the ball through for klose whose low shot beat adler into the corner .
a cross from tranquillo barnetta which came off the top of the bar two minutes from time was the nearest leverkusen came to a goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said bayern 's class was coming out klinsmann said bayern 's class was beginning to shine through as the season progressed .
bayern improving , says coach klinsi " the boys are enjoying their football and the team is now in a position to control a game .
we were in complete control in the second half and it was only a matter of time before we scored . "
leverkusen coach bruno labbadia said : " we started the first 25 minutes as we wanted to and were in control , but then we were pushed back too deep .
we could n't get the ball forward precisely enough and bayern deserved to win . "
elsewhere , claudio pizarro scored a hat-trick , diego converted a penalty and aaron hunt was also on target as werder bremen ran out 5-0 winners over visiting eintracht frankfurt .
mike hanke bagged a brace and mikael forssell added a third just before the break as hanover raced into a 3-0 lead over karlsruhe .
but the home side were left hanging on after a penalty shortly after the interval from antonio da silva and a late goal from lars stindl reduced the deficit to 3-2 .

klose finished the game off with a strike from the edge of the box with eight minutes remaining after a pass from franck ribery .
league top scorer vedad ibisevic meanwhile increased his tally to 17 with a fifth-minute goal , carlos eduardo added a second with a solo run six minutes later and francisco copado scored an 89th-minute penalty as promoted hoffenheim overcame bielefeld .
bayern to challenge hoffenheim it was the eighth victory in nine games for ralf rangnick 's side who now have 34 points from 15 matches , three more than bayern going into next friday 's match between the two sides in munich .

ribery shines in red and pink hertha berlin , who defeated cologne 2-1 on friday evening , are now third on 30 , with leverkusen slipping to fourth on 28 .
leverkusen had slightly the better of the opening exchanges against bayern with patrick helmes seeing a shot tipped over the bar by michael rensing , before henrique headed against the bar from a corner .
however bayern also threatened , and rene adler in goal twice had to save long-range efforts from bastian schweinsteiger , who also saw a shot flash narrowly wide of the post before the break .
neither side looked like scoring until toni rose to head in ze robert 's cross for a goal which heralded a more controlled spell for klinsmann 's side .
france midfielder ribery - wearing red gloves and pink boots - was again the outstanding figure , coming close to a goal with a shot saved by adler after he had dribbled round four players .
instead , with bayern now fully in charge , he was the provider when he collected the ball in midfield and cleverly threaded the ball through for klose whose low shot beat adler into the corner .
a cross from tranquillo barnetta which came off the top of the bar two minutes from time was the nearest leverkusen came to a goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said bayern 's class was coming out klinsmann said bayern 's class was beginning to shine through as the season progressed .
bayern improving , says coach klinsi " the boys are enjoying their football and the team is now in a position to control a game .
we were in complete control in the second half and it was only a matter of time before we scored . "
leverkusen coach bruno labbadia said : " we started the first 25 minutes as we wanted to and were in control , but then we were pushed back too deep .
we could n't get the ball forward precisely enough and bayern deserved to win . "
elsewhere , claudio pizarro scored a hat-trick , diego converted a penalty and aaron hunt was also on target as werder bremen ran out 5-0 winners over visiting eintracht frankfurt .
mike hanke bagged a brace and mikael forssell added a third just before the break as hanover raced into a 3-0 lead over karlsruhe .
but the home side were left hanging on after a penalty shortly after the interval from antonio da silva and a late goal from lars stindl reduced the deficit to 3-2 .
energie cottbus moved off the bottom - leaving karlsruhe last - with a 3-1 win at fellow strugglers borussia moenchengladbach .

" we 're currently preparing to reduce production by 30 percent compared with the previous year , " daimler factory manager martin daum told the weekly magazine " automobilwoche . "
daum said the stuttgart-based manufacturer was n't planning to eliminate jobs , but would extend the mandatory christmas break from three to four weeks .
factories would also shut for a week during the carnival season in mid-february .
volkswagen has also announced it would suspend production for over three weeks during the holiday season .
porsche was planning a total of eight production-free days and ford said it would close its cologne factory for five weeks starting in early november .
in addition to halting production in several factories , munich-based bmw has also said it would lay off several thousand of its temporary workers .
suppliers hurting from fewer orders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer cars means fewer tires auto parts suppliers like continental are experiencing a spill-over effect from the industry 's financial hardships .
in response to lower output by the manufacturers , the hanover-based firm planned to reduce the hours its employees work , a spokesman told reuters news agency on saturday .
the move comes in addition to previously announced plans for a prolonged christmas break and lay-offs among temporary workers .
continental 's principal shareholder schaeffler is faced with a similar situation .
" in the past few months , carmakers ' supply orders have abruptly fallen - by 20 percent for us , " juergen geissinger , chairman of the managing board at schaeffer , told the saturday edition of sueddeutsche zeitung .
" that will certainly continue into next year . "

" we 're currently preparing to reduce production by 30 percent compared with the previous year , " daimler factory manager martin daum told the weekly magazine " automobilwoche . "
daum said the stuttgart-based manufacturer was n't planning to eliminate jobs , but would extend the mandatory christmas break from three to four weeks .
factories would also shut for a week during the carnival season in mid-february .
volkswagen has also announced it would suspend production for over three weeks during the holiday season .

30 , by a suicide bomber who had strapped explosives to his body to target the vehicle of the german military attache , police said . alishah ahmadzai , deputy police chief of kabul city , said the bomber was on foot when he attacked a german embassy vehicle , which was damaged in the blast .
no diplomats were killed or wounded .
" the attack killed two afghan civilians and wounded three others , " ahmadzai said .
german embassy officials were not immediately available for comment .
a german foreign ministry spokesman said the only occupant of the vehicle , an afghan employee of the embassy , was injured .
residents said the force of the blast broke windows in several nearby buildings .
the attack , which took place in front of habibia high school on a road close to the parliament building in the western part of kabul city , raises doubts about the prospects for stability in the war-torn country .
violence has increased this year , with over 4,000 killed so far , a quarter of them civilians .
the militants , who are said to control districts that border the capital , have intensified their attacks on the city recently .
no group took responsibility for the attack .
taliban militants , who lost power in late 2001 in the us military invasion , have conducted hundreds of similar attacks in the past .
four civilians were killed and 20 were wounded in a suicide attack close to the us embassy in kabul on thursday .
earlier this year , the taliban carried out a series of high-profile attacks , including an aborted assassination attempt on afghan president hamid karzai and a suicide attack outside the indian embassy , in which 60 people were killed . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 .
toni ended the deadlock in the day 's top match in leverkusen when ze roberto 's cross from the left found the italian striker with space in front of goal to head home in the 59th minute .
klose finished the game off with a strike from the edge of the box with eight minutes remaining after a pass from franck ribery .
league top scorer vedad ibisevic meanwhile increased his tally to 17 with a fifth-minute goal , carlos eduardo added a second with a solo run six minutes later and francisco copado scored an 89th-minute penalty as promoted hoffenheim overcame bielefeld .
bayern to challenge hoffenheim it was the eighth victory in nine games for ralf rangnick 's side who now have 34 points from 15 matches , three more than bayern going into next friday 's match between the two sides in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will have to defend their lead with bayern - after a slow start to the season - now nine league games without a defeat , the visit of hoffenheim will be an eagerly awaited duel between the two form teams of the league .
" we have a lot of respect for hoffenheim .
it 's a great story what 's happened there in the last few months but we want to get to the top and we are pleased they are now coming to munich ...
i am looking forward to the game , " bayern coach juergen klinsmann told premiere television .
ribery shines in red and pink hertha berlin , who defeated cologne 2-1 on friday evening , are now third on 30 , with leverkusen slipping to fourth on 28 .
leverkusen had slightly the better of the opening exchanges against bayern with patrick helmes seeing a shot tipped over the bar by michael rensing , before henrique headed against the bar from a corner .
however bayern also threatened , and rene adler in goal twice had to save long-range efforts from bastian schweinsteiger , who also saw a shot flash narrowly wide of the post before the break .
neither side looked like scoring until toni rose to head in ze robert 's cross for a goal which heralded a more controlled spell for klinsmann 's side .
france midfielder ribery - wearing red gloves and pink boots - was again the outstanding figure , coming close to a goal with a shot saved by adler after he had dribbled round four players .
instead , with bayern now fully in charge , he was the provider when he collected the ball in midfield and cleverly threaded the ball through for klose whose low shot beat adler into the corner .
a cross from tranquillo barnetta which came off the top of the bar two minutes from time was the nearest leverkusen came to a goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said bayern 's class was coming out klinsmann said bayern 's class was beginning to shine through as the season progressed .
bayern improving , says coach klinsi " the boys are enjoying their football and the team is now in a position to control a game .
we were in complete control in the second half and it was only a matter of time before we scored . "
leverkusen coach bruno labbadia said : " we started the first 25 minutes as we wanted to and were in control , but then we were pushed back too deep .
we could n't get the ball forward precisely enough and bayern deserved to win . "
elsewhere , claudio pizarro scored a hat-trick , diego converted a penalty and aaron hunt was also on target as werder bremen ran out 5-0 winners over visiting eintracht frankfurt .
mike hanke bagged a brace and mikael forssell added a third just before the break as hanover raced into a 3-0 lead over karlsruhe .

klose finished the game off with a strike from the edge of the box with eight minutes remaining after a pass from franck ribery .
league top scorer vedad ibisevic meanwhile increased his tally to 17 with a fifth-minute goal , carlos eduardo added a second with a solo run six minutes later and francisco copado scored an 89th-minute penalty as promoted hoffenheim overcame bielefeld .

france midfielder ribery - wearing red gloves and pink boots - was again the outstanding figure , coming close to a goal with a shot saved by adler after he had dribbled round four players .
instead , with bayern now fully in charge , he was the provider when he collected the ball in midfield and cleverly threaded the ball through for klose whose low shot beat adler into the corner .
a cross from tranquillo barnetta which came off the top of the bar two minutes from time was the nearest leverkusen came to a goal .

we were in complete control in the second half and it was only a matter of time before we scored . "
leverkusen coach bruno labbadia said : " we started the first 25 minutes as we wanted to and were in control , but then we were pushed back too deep .
we could n't get the ball forward precisely enough and bayern deserved to win . "
elsewhere , claudio pizarro scored a hat-trick , diego converted a penalty and aaron hunt was also on target as werder bremen ran out 5-0 winners over visiting eintracht frankfurt .
mike hanke bagged a brace and mikael forssell added a third just before the break as hanover raced into a 3-0 lead over karlsruhe .
but the home side were left hanging on after a penalty shortly after the interval from antonio da silva and a late goal from lars stindl reduced the deficit to 3-2 .

" we 're currently preparing to reduce production by 30 percent compared with the previous year , " daimler factory manager martin daum told the weekly magazine " automobilwoche . "
daum said the stuttgart-based manufacturer was n't planning to eliminate jobs , but would extend the mandatory christmas break from three to four weeks .
factories would also shut for a week during the carnival season in mid-february .
volkswagen has also announced it would suspend production for over three weeks during the holiday season .

30 , by a suicide bomber who had strapped explosives to his body to target the vehicle of the german military attache , police said . alishah ahmadzai , deputy police chief of kabul city , said the bomber was on foot when he attacked a german embassy vehicle , which was damaged in the blast .
no diplomats were killed or wounded .
" the attack killed two afghan civilians and wounded three others , " ahmadzai said .
german embassy officials were not immediately available for comment .
a german foreign ministry spokesman said the only occupant of the vehicle , an afghan employee of the embassy , was injured .
residents said the force of the blast broke windows in several nearby buildings .
the attack , which took place in front of habibia high school on a road close to the parliament building in the western part of kabul city , raises doubts about the prospects for stability in the war-torn country .
violence has increased this year , with over 4,000 killed so far , a quarter of them civilians .
the militants , who are said to control districts that border the capital , have intensified their attacks on the city recently .
no group took responsibility for the attack .
taliban militants , who lost power in late 2001 in the us military invasion , have conducted hundreds of similar attacks in the past .
four civilians were killed and 20 were wounded in a suicide attack close to the us embassy in kabul on thursday .
earlier this year , the taliban carried out a series of high-profile attacks , including an aborted assassination attempt on afghan president hamid karzai and a suicide attack outside the indian embassy , in which 60 people were killed . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany could be without a formula one race for the first time in half a century in 2010 for financial reasons , it emerged on sunday . officials from the nuerburgring said they would be unable to stage the 2010 german grand prix if the original cash-strapped host hockenheim had to withdraw .

neither side looked like scoring until toni rose to head in ze robert 's cross for a goal which heralded a more controlled spell for klinsmann 's side .
france midfielder ribery - wearing red gloves and pink boots - was again the outstanding figure , coming close to a goal with a shot saved by adler after he had dribbled round four players .
instead , with bayern now fully in charge , he was the provider when he collected the ball in midfield and cleverly threaded the ball through for klose whose low shot beat adler into the corner .
a cross from tranquillo barnetta which came off the top of the bar two minutes from time was the nearest leverkusen came to a goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said bayern 's class was coming out klinsmann said bayern 's class was beginning to shine through as the season progressed .

we were in complete control in the second half and it was only a matter of time before we scored . "
leverkusen coach bruno labbadia said : " we started the first 25 minutes as we wanted to and were in control , but then we were pushed back too deep .
we could n't get the ball forward precisely enough and bayern deserved to win . "
elsewhere , claudio pizarro scored a hat-trick , diego converted a penalty and aaron hunt was also on target as werder bremen ran out 5-0 winners over visiting eintracht frankfurt .
mike hanke bagged a brace and mikael forssell added a third just before the break as hanover raced into a 3-0 lead over karlsruhe .

" it 's vital that the people have more money in their pockets , " he said . economics minister michael glos , a member of the csu , is also in favor of lowering taxes , particularly for those in the middle and lower-income brackets . " it will help the economy , " he said .

27 , 2009 . merkel is opposed to lowering taxes before the polls , pointing out that berlin 's prime goal is to reduce borrowing and balance the budget .
originally , the government had hoped to balance the budget by 2011 , but that date was abandoned after germany fell into recession and the government was forced to increase net borrowing for 2009 by eight billion euros to 18 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.3 billion to $ 23.1 billion -rrb- . lacking vision ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy and merkel do n't see eye to eye on economic stimuli some critics have accused the chancellor of lacking vision and responding too late to the crisis .
her refusal to pump more funds into the european union 's 200-billion-euro economic recovery package prompted one opposition deputy to refer to her as " madame no " in a debate on the budget in parliament this week . analysts say the cdu leader will seek to keep her options open at the party conference in stuttgart in order to allow her plenty of leeway when leaders of her " grand coalition " meet on jan .
5 to discuss whether further steps are needed to combat the recession . tax cut debate the tax cut issue is expected to dominate proceedings that merkel had initially hoped to use to promote her government 's economic achievements .
but that was before the severity of the global financial crisis torpedoed to center stage . " given the current situation it is more important to promote growth than to balance the budget , " said peter mueller , cdu prime minister in the state of saarland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos thinks the government should take less money from people right now christian baldauf , cdu party leader in the state of rhineland-palatinate , believes tax cuts are the best way to revive the economy . " it 's vital that the people have more money in their pockets , " he said . economics minister michael glos , a member of the csu , is also in favor of lowering taxes , particularly for those in the middle and lower-income brackets . " it will help the economy , " he said .
" special measures are needed in special circumstances like these . " early campaigning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is hoping to unseat merkel next year merkel has found an ally for fiscal prudence in peer steinbrueck , the sharp-tongued spd finance minister .
for some in the cdu , this is evidence that the chancellor is not paying enough attention to her own party 's profile in the coalition with the social democrats . opinion polls show the cdu with a comfortable 10-percent lead over the spd and merkel herself well ahead of foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd candidate who will battle her for the chancellorship next year . but this lead could melt if the recession drags on and unemployment rises sharply , analysts warn . unwanted marriage merkel experienced a similar situation in the last election in 2005 , when her party was well ahead of incumbent gerhard schroeder 's spd in opinion polls , only to see the gap narrow to one percent on election day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants a coalition with fdp leader guido westerwelle that left the cdu without enough parliamentary seats to form an alliance with its preferred partner , the free democrats .
instead , the cdu was forced into a marriage of convenience with the spd .
in one of their first acts as grand coalition partners , the two parties raised sales tax by three percent to 19 percent and cut a range of tax subsidies . this helped germany regain its position as europe 's economic locomotive , until it slipped into recession in the third quarter of this year . nevertheless , the chancellor believes the nation is better equipped that most " to overcome the challenges posed by the global economic crisis .

league top scorer vedad ibisevic meanwhile increased his tally to 17 with a fifth-minute goal , carlos eduardo added a second with a solo run six minutes later and francisco copado scored an 89th-minute penalty as promoted hoffenheim overcame bielefeld .

neither side looked like scoring until toni rose to head in ze robert 's cross for a goal which heralded a more controlled spell for klinsmann 's side .
france midfielder ribery - wearing red gloves and pink boots - was again the outstanding figure , coming close to a goal with a shot saved by adler after he had dribbled round four players .
instead , with bayern now fully in charge , he was the provider when he collected the ball in midfield and cleverly threaded the ball through for klose whose low shot beat adler into the corner .

we were in complete control in the second half and it was only a matter of time before we scored . "
leverkusen coach bruno labbadia said : " we started the first 25 minutes as we wanted to and were in control , but then we were pushed back too deep .
we could n't get the ball forward precisely enough and bayern deserved to win . "
elsewhere , claudio pizarro scored a hat-trick , diego converted a penalty and aaron hunt was also on target as werder bremen ran out 5-0 winners over visiting eintracht frankfurt .
mike hanke bagged a brace and mikael forssell added a third just before the break as hanover raced into a 3-0 lead over karlsruhe .
but the home side were left hanging on after a penalty shortly after the interval from antonio da silva and a late goal from lars stindl reduced the deficit to 3-2 .

these matches are generally hard-fought affairs with few goals , especially for hamburg .

hamburg ’ s paolo guerrero opened the scoring in the 6th minute , scoring from a tight angle after he raced first to a rebound of a mladen petric shot .
18 minutes later , bremen playmaker diego was fouled outside the hamburg penalty area .
he then curled a masterful free kick into the upper right-hand corner for the equalizer .
after that , bremen were tactically the better side , but that didn ’ t matter the olic who gave hamburg the 2-1 victory , boosting them to fifth place .
bremen are still mired in the middle of the table . on saturday , hoffenheim reclaimed the bundesliga lead . cologne 1 hoffenheim 3 surprise team hoffenheim are on top of the bundesliga again after beating fc cologne .

leverkusen ’ s patrick helmes cut the deficit in the 78th minute , and simon rolfes could have scored the equalizer in the 87th , but his own teammate manuel friedrich blocked his shot from close range .
2-1 for bielefeld , and a painful defeat for leverkusen who must host bayern munich next week .
wolfsburg 4 stuttgart 1 another strong performance at home by the wolves .

meanwhile , bayern munich jürgen klinsmann 's season may be determined already in the next two weeks with top matches against leverkusen and hoffenheim . olic 's smashing strike give hamburg win over bremen hamburg vs. bremen is one of the more traditional and bitter rivalries in german soccer .
these matches are generally hard-fought affairs with few goals , especially for hamburg .
in fact , they haven ’ t found the net more than twice against their northern neighbours bremen in more than a decade .
it wasn ’ t any different on sunday , but hamburg came away with a 2-1 victory after ivica olic ’ s smashing strike 16 minutes from time .
the croatian national launched a stunning goal from more than 20 meters across the mouth of tim wiese ’ s goal into the upper-left hand corner .
but what preceded it for nearly an hour was not the greatest of all games .
hamburg ’ s paolo guerrero opened the scoring in the 6th minute , scoring from a tight angle after he raced first to a rebound of a mladen petric shot .
18 minutes later , bremen playmaker diego was fouled outside the hamburg penalty area .
he then curled a masterful free kick into the upper right-hand corner for the equalizer .
after that , bremen were tactically the better side , but that didn ’ t matter the olic who gave hamburg the 2-1 victory , boosting them to fifth place .
bremen are still mired in the middle of the table . on saturday , hoffenheim reclaimed the bundesliga lead . cologne 1 hoffenheim 3 surprise team hoffenheim are on top of the bundesliga again after beating fc cologne .

but hoffenheim is playing in a league of its own , and both top strikers demba ba and ibisevic scored one goal .
portuguese star petit scored one back for cologne in the 79th , but in the 87th , ibisevic initiated a wonderful counterattack , and finished the moves himself .
who will be able to stop those incredible newcomers .
bayern munich 4 cottbus 1 easy home win for the current champion , but it was cottbus who scored the first goal .
erwin skela curled in a free kick in the 21st minute .
but bayern were not shocked .
they dominated the first 20 minutes of the game , having 12 unsuccessful shots on goal , and immediately came back to equalize the game .
superstar frank ribéry responded with a fantastic freekick of his own to make it 1-1 , and bayern just kept rolling .
martin demichelis , miroslav klose and luca toni scored the other goals .
bielefeld 2 leverkusen 1 surprise victory for lowly bielefeld against the bundesliga leaders .
bielefeld had not won a match since september 20th , but a courageous performance gave the hosts a very deserved 2-1 victory .
artur wichniarek scored the first goal in the 53rd minute , and daniel halfar made it 2-0 after a terrible mistake by leverkusen keeper rené adler .
leverkusen ’ s patrick helmes cut the deficit in the 78th minute , and simon rolfes could have scored the equalizer in the 87th , but his own teammate manuel friedrich blocked his shot from close range .
2-1 for bielefeld , and a painful defeat for leverkusen who must host bayern munich next week .
wolfsburg 4 stuttgart 1 another strong performance at home by the wolves .
although stuttgart went ahead in the 17th minute with a goal by martin lanig , wolfsburg kept pushing stuttgart to their limits .
but the wolfsburg fans had to wait until the second half to see their team score four goals and make former germany keeper jens lehmann look like a rookie .

18 minutes later , bremen playmaker diego was fouled outside the hamburg penalty area .

but what preceded it for nearly an hour was not the greatest of all games .
hamburg ’ s paolo guerrero opened the scoring in the 6th minute , scoring from a tight angle after he raced first to a rebound of a mladen petric shot .
18 minutes later , bremen playmaker diego was fouled outside the hamburg penalty area .
he then curled a masterful free kick into the upper right-hand corner for the equalizer .
after that , bremen were tactically the better side , but that didn ’ t matter the olic who gave hamburg the 2-1 victory , boosting them to fifth place .
bremen are still mired in the middle of the table . on saturday , hoffenheim reclaimed the bundesliga lead . cologne 1 hoffenheim 3 surprise team hoffenheim are on top of the bundesliga again after beating fc cologne .
both teams had played each other in second division last year , and cologne won both league games .
but hoffenheim is playing in a league of its own , and both top strikers demba ba and ibisevic scored one goal .
portuguese star petit scored one back for cologne in the 79th , but in the 87th , ibisevic initiated a wonderful counterattack , and finished the moves himself .
who will be able to stop those incredible newcomers .
bayern munich 4 cottbus 1 easy home win for the current champion , but it was cottbus who scored the first goal .
erwin skela curled in a free kick in the 21st minute .
but bayern were not shocked .
they dominated the first 20 minutes of the game , having 12 unsuccessful shots on goal , and immediately came back to equalize the game .
superstar frank ribéry responded with a fantastic freekick of his own to make it 1-1 , and bayern just kept rolling .
martin demichelis , miroslav klose and luca toni scored the other goals .
bielefeld 2 leverkusen 1 surprise victory for lowly bielefeld against the bundesliga leaders .
bielefeld had not won a match since september 20th , but a courageous performance gave the hosts a very deserved 2-1 victory .
artur wichniarek scored the first goal in the 53rd minute , and daniel halfar made it 2-0 after a terrible mistake by leverkusen keeper rené adler .
leverkusen ’ s patrick helmes cut the deficit in the 78th minute , and simon rolfes could have scored the equalizer in the 87th , but his own teammate manuel friedrich blocked his shot from close range .
2-1 for bielefeld , and a painful defeat for leverkusen who must host bayern munich next week .
wolfsburg 4 stuttgart 1 another strong performance at home by the wolves .
although stuttgart went ahead in the 17th minute with a goal by martin lanig , wolfsburg kept pushing stuttgart to their limits .
but the wolfsburg fans had to wait until the second half to see their team score four goals and make former germany keeper jens lehmann look like a rookie .
grafite and dzeko both scored twice to make it 4-1 for wolfsburg .
bochum 2 berlin 3 in-form berlin made the game look easy in the first half .
raffael , katsar and santos scored 3 goals in the first half , but once again , bochum proved that you can never write them off .
they dominated the second half , with sestak and mietziel scoring two goals , but in the end , it was enough to stop berlin ’ s brilliant run .
third win in a row for berlin .
frankfurt 4 hannover 0 frankfurt are slowly climbing up the bundesliga table .
after their embarrassing 4-0 defeat at dortmund last week , they scored 4 goals of their own on saturday to send hannover back home reeling .
the 3 points take frankfurt up to 12th in the rankings , while hannover are three points behind .
schalke 3 mönchengladbach 1 easy game for schalke , who were trying to make up for poor results during the last couple of weeks , and they succeeded .
all the goals came in the first half .
halil altintop scored twice and jefferson farfán converted a penalty , while rob friend scored the consolation goal for the guests .
karlsruhe 0 dortmund 1 the 14th matchday of the bundesliga saw karlsruhe hosting borussia dortmund on friday evening .
the guests deservedly won the game 1-0 , with egyptian star mohamed zidan scoring the only goal in the 20th minute .
in the standings : hoffenheim are first on 31 points , with leverkusen and bayern munich 3 points behind .
berlin are fourth on 27 points , and hamburg now rest in fifth on 26 points .
at the bottom , we find karlsruhe and bochum on 10 points , and cottbus on 9 . alex sisto / john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

klose finished the game off with a strike from the edge of the box with eight minutes remaining after a pass from franck ribery .
league top scorer vedad ibisevic meanwhile increased his tally to 17 with a fifth-minute goal , carlos eduardo added a second with a solo run six minutes later and francisco copado scored an 89th-minute penalty as promoted hoffenheim overcame bielefeld .
bayern to challenge hoffenheim it was the eighth victory in nine games for ralf rangnick 's side who now have 34 points from 15 matches , three more than bayern going into next friday 's match between the two sides in munich .

i am looking forward to the game , " bayern coach juergen klinsmann told premiere television .
ribery shines in red and pink hertha berlin , who defeated cologne 2-1 on friday evening , are now third on 30 , with leverkusen slipping to fourth on 28 .
leverkusen had slightly the better of the opening exchanges against bayern with patrick helmes seeing a shot tipped over the bar by michael rensing , before henrique headed against the bar from a corner .
however bayern also threatened , and rene adler in goal twice had to save long-range efforts from bastian schweinsteiger , who also saw a shot flash narrowly wide of the post before the break .
neither side looked like scoring until toni rose to head in ze robert 's cross for a goal which heralded a more controlled spell for klinsmann 's side .
france midfielder ribery - wearing red gloves and pink boots - was again the outstanding figure , coming close to a goal with a shot saved by adler after he had dribbled round four players .
instead , with bayern now fully in charge , he was the provider when he collected the ball in midfield and cleverly threaded the ball through for klose whose low shot beat adler into the corner .
a cross from tranquillo barnetta which came off the top of the bar two minutes from time was the nearest leverkusen came to a goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said bayern 's class was coming out klinsmann said bayern 's class was beginning to shine through as the season progressed .
bayern improving , says coach klinsi " the boys are enjoying their football and the team is now in a position to control a game .
we were in complete control in the second half and it was only a matter of time before we scored . "
leverkusen coach bruno labbadia said : " we started the first 25 minutes as we wanted to and were in control , but then we were pushed back too deep .
we could n't get the ball forward precisely enough and bayern deserved to win . "
elsewhere , claudio pizarro scored a hat-trick , diego converted a penalty and aaron hunt was also on target as werder bremen ran out 5-0 winners over visiting eintracht frankfurt .
mike hanke bagged a brace and mikael forssell added a third just before the break as hanover raced into a 3-0 lead over karlsruhe .

29 .
toni ended the deadlock in the day 's top match in leverkusen when ze roberto 's cross from the left found the italian striker with space in front of goal to head home in the 59th minute .
klose finished the game off with a strike from the edge of the box with eight minutes remaining after a pass from franck ribery .
league top scorer vedad ibisevic meanwhile increased his tally to 17 with a fifth-minute goal , carlos eduardo added a second with a solo run six minutes later and francisco copado scored an 89th-minute penalty as promoted hoffenheim overcame bielefeld .
bayern to challenge hoffenheim it was the eighth victory in nine games for ralf rangnick 's side who now have 34 points from 15 matches , three more than bayern going into next friday 's match between the two sides in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will have to defend their lead with bayern - after a slow start to the season - now nine league games without a defeat , the visit of hoffenheim will be an eagerly awaited duel between the two form teams of the league .
" we have a lot of respect for hoffenheim .
it 's a great story what 's happened there in the last few months but we want to get to the top and we are pleased they are now coming to munich ...
i am looking forward to the game , " bayern coach juergen klinsmann told premiere television .
ribery shines in red and pink hertha berlin , who defeated cologne 2-1 on friday evening , are now third on 30 , with leverkusen slipping to fourth on 28 .
leverkusen had slightly the better of the opening exchanges against bayern with patrick helmes seeing a shot tipped over the bar by michael rensing , before henrique headed against the bar from a corner .
however bayern also threatened , and rene adler in goal twice had to save long-range efforts from bastian schweinsteiger , who also saw a shot flash narrowly wide of the post before the break .
neither side looked like scoring until toni rose to head in ze robert 's cross for a goal which heralded a more controlled spell for klinsmann 's side .
france midfielder ribery - wearing red gloves and pink boots - was again the outstanding figure , coming close to a goal with a shot saved by adler after he had dribbled round four players .
instead , with bayern now fully in charge , he was the provider when he collected the ball in midfield and cleverly threaded the ball through for klose whose low shot beat adler into the corner .
a cross from tranquillo barnetta which came off the top of the bar two minutes from time was the nearest leverkusen came to a goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said bayern 's class was coming out klinsmann said bayern 's class was beginning to shine through as the season progressed .
bayern improving , says coach klinsi " the boys are enjoying their football and the team is now in a position to control a game .
we were in complete control in the second half and it was only a matter of time before we scored . "
leverkusen coach bruno labbadia said : " we started the first 25 minutes as we wanted to and were in control , but then we were pushed back too deep .
we could n't get the ball forward precisely enough and bayern deserved to win . "
elsewhere , claudio pizarro scored a hat-trick , diego converted a penalty and aaron hunt was also on target as werder bremen ran out 5-0 winners over visiting eintracht frankfurt .
mike hanke bagged a brace and mikael forssell added a third just before the break as hanover raced into a 3-0 lead over karlsruhe .
but the home side were left hanging on after a penalty shortly after the interval from antonio da silva and a late goal from lars stindl reduced the deficit to 3-2 .

klose finished the game off with a strike from the edge of the box with eight minutes remaining after a pass from franck ribery .
league top scorer vedad ibisevic meanwhile increased his tally to 17 with a fifth-minute goal , carlos eduardo added a second with a solo run six minutes later and francisco copado scored an 89th-minute penalty as promoted hoffenheim overcame bielefeld .
bayern to challenge hoffenheim it was the eighth victory in nine games for ralf rangnick 's side who now have 34 points from 15 matches , three more than bayern going into next friday 's match between the two sides in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will have to defend their lead with bayern - after a slow start to the season - now nine league games without a defeat , the visit of hoffenheim will be an eagerly awaited duel between the two form teams of the league .
" we have a lot of respect for hoffenheim .
it 's a great story what 's happened there in the last few months but we want to get to the top and we are pleased they are now coming to munich ...
i am looking forward to the game , " bayern coach juergen klinsmann told premiere television .
ribery shines in red and pink hertha berlin , who defeated cologne 2-1 on friday evening , are now third on 30 , with leverkusen slipping to fourth on 28 .
leverkusen had slightly the better of the opening exchanges against bayern with patrick helmes seeing a shot tipped over the bar by michael rensing , before henrique headed against the bar from a corner .
however bayern also threatened , and rene adler in goal twice had to save long-range efforts from bastian schweinsteiger , who also saw a shot flash narrowly wide of the post before the break .
neither side looked like scoring until toni rose to head in ze robert 's cross for a goal which heralded a more controlled spell for klinsmann 's side .
france midfielder ribery - wearing red gloves and pink boots - was again the outstanding figure , coming close to a goal with a shot saved by adler after he had dribbled round four players .
instead , with bayern now fully in charge , he was the provider when he collected the ball in midfield and cleverly threaded the ball through for klose whose low shot beat adler into the corner .
a cross from tranquillo barnetta which came off the top of the bar two minutes from time was the nearest leverkusen came to a goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said bayern 's class was coming out klinsmann said bayern 's class was beginning to shine through as the season progressed .
bayern improving , says coach klinsi " the boys are enjoying their football and the team is now in a position to control a game .
we were in complete control in the second half and it was only a matter of time before we scored . "
leverkusen coach bruno labbadia said : " we started the first 25 minutes as we wanted to and were in control , but then we were pushed back too deep .
we could n't get the ball forward precisely enough and bayern deserved to win . "
elsewhere , claudio pizarro scored a hat-trick , diego converted a penalty and aaron hunt was also on target as werder bremen ran out 5-0 winners over visiting eintracht frankfurt .
mike hanke bagged a brace and mikael forssell added a third just before the break as hanover raced into a 3-0 lead over karlsruhe .
but the home side were left hanging on after a penalty shortly after the interval from antonio da silva and a late goal from lars stindl reduced the deficit to 3-2 .

meanwhile , bayern munich jürgen klinsmann 's season may be determined already in the next two weeks with top matches against leverkusen and hoffenheim . olic 's smashing strike give hamburg win over bremen hamburg vs. bremen is one of the more traditional and bitter rivalries in german soccer .
these matches are generally hard-fought affairs with few goals , especially for hamburg .
in fact , they haven ’ t found the net more than twice against their northern neighbours bremen in more than a decade .
it wasn ’ t any different on sunday , but hamburg came away with a 2-1 victory after ivica olic ’ s smashing strike 16 minutes from time .
the croatian national launched a stunning goal from more than 20 meters across the mouth of tim wiese ’ s goal into the upper-left hand corner .
but what preceded it for nearly an hour was not the greatest of all games .
hamburg ’ s paolo guerrero opened the scoring in the 6th minute , scoring from a tight angle after he raced first to a rebound of a mladen petric shot .
18 minutes later , bremen playmaker diego was fouled outside the hamburg penalty area .
he then curled a masterful free kick into the upper right-hand corner for the equalizer .
after that , bremen were tactically the better side , but that didn ’ t matter the olic who gave hamburg the 2-1 victory , boosting them to fifth place .
bremen are still mired in the middle of the table . on saturday , hoffenheim reclaimed the bundesliga lead . cologne 1 hoffenheim 3 surprise team hoffenheim are on top of the bundesliga again after beating fc cologne .

but hoffenheim is playing in a league of its own , and both top strikers demba ba and ibisevic scored one goal .
portuguese star petit scored one back for cologne in the 79th , but in the 87th , ibisevic initiated a wonderful counterattack , and finished the moves himself .
who will be able to stop those incredible newcomers .
bayern munich 4 cottbus 1 easy home win for the current champion , but it was cottbus who scored the first goal .
erwin skela curled in a free kick in the 21st minute .
but bayern were not shocked .
they dominated the first 20 minutes of the game , having 12 unsuccessful shots on goal , and immediately came back to equalize the game .
superstar frank ribéry responded with a fantastic freekick of his own to make it 1-1 , and bayern just kept rolling .
martin demichelis , miroslav klose and luca toni scored the other goals .
bielefeld 2 leverkusen 1 surprise victory for lowly bielefeld against the bundesliga leaders .
bielefeld had not won a match since september 20th , but a courageous performance gave the hosts a very deserved 2-1 victory .
artur wichniarek scored the first goal in the 53rd minute , and daniel halfar made it 2-0 after a terrible mistake by leverkusen keeper rené adler .
leverkusen ’ s patrick helmes cut the deficit in the 78th minute , and simon rolfes could have scored the equalizer in the 87th , but his own teammate manuel friedrich blocked his shot from close range .
2-1 for bielefeld , and a painful defeat for leverkusen who must host bayern munich next week .
wolfsburg 4 stuttgart 1 another strong performance at home by the wolves .
although stuttgart went ahead in the 17th minute with a goal by martin lanig , wolfsburg kept pushing stuttgart to their limits .
but the wolfsburg fans had to wait until the second half to see their team score four goals and make former germany keeper jens lehmann look like a rookie .
grafite and dzeko both scored twice to make it 4-1 for wolfsburg .
bochum 2 berlin 3 in-form berlin made the game look easy in the first half .
raffael , katsar and santos scored 3 goals in the first half , but once again , bochum proved that you can never write them off .
they dominated the second half , with sestak and mietziel scoring two goals , but in the end , it was enough to stop berlin ’ s brilliant run .
third win in a row for berlin .
frankfurt 4 hannover 0 frankfurt are slowly climbing up the bundesliga table .
after their embarrassing 4-0 defeat at dortmund last week , they scored 4 goals of their own on saturday to send hannover back home reeling .
the 3 points take frankfurt up to 12th in the rankings , while hannover are three points behind .
schalke 3 mönchengladbach 1 easy game for schalke , who were trying to make up for poor results during the last couple of weeks , and they succeeded .
all the goals came in the first half .
halil altintop scored twice and jefferson farfán converted a penalty , while rob friend scored the consolation goal for the guests .
karlsruhe 0 dortmund 1 the 14th matchday of the bundesliga saw karlsruhe hosting borussia dortmund on friday evening .
the guests deservedly won the game 1-0 , with egyptian star mohamed zidan scoring the only goal in the 20th minute .

wolfsburg 4 stuttgart 1 another strong performance at home by the wolves .

germany could be without a formula one race for the first time in half a century in 2010 for financial reasons , it emerged on sunday . officials from the nuerburgring said they would be unable to stage the 2010 german grand prix if the original cash-strapped host hockenheim had to withdraw .

" there will be no more formula one in hockenheim without state funds , " hockenheim boss josef schmidt told sunday 's edition of der tagesspiegel paper . huge deficit hockenheim ran up a deficit of more than 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.3 million -rrb- from the 2008 race and would have similar losses in 2010 .
kafitz said that nuerburgring 's losses in 2007 were in the same range . germany was last without a formula one race in 1960 .

her refusal to pump more funds into the european union 's 200-billion-euro economic recovery package prompted one opposition deputy to refer to her as " madame no " in a debate on the budget in parliament this week . analysts say the cdu leader will seek to keep her options open at the party conference in stuttgart in order to allow her plenty of leeway when leaders of her " grand coalition " meet on jan .

in one of their first acts as grand coalition partners , the two parties raised sales tax by three percent to 19 percent and cut a range of tax subsidies . this helped germany regain its position as europe 's economic locomotive , until it slipped into recession in the third quarter of this year . nevertheless , the chancellor believes the nation is better equipped that most " to overcome the challenges posed by the global economic crisis .

toni ended the deadlock in the day 's top match in leverkusen when ze roberto 's cross from the left found the italian striker with space in front of goal to head home in the 59th minute .
klose finished the game off with a strike from the edge of the box with eight minutes remaining after a pass from franck ribery .
league top scorer vedad ibisevic meanwhile increased his tally to 17 with a fifth-minute goal , carlos eduardo added a second with a solo run six minutes later and francisco copado scored an 89th-minute penalty as promoted hoffenheim overcame bielefeld .

leverkusen had slightly the better of the opening exchanges against bayern with patrick helmes seeing a shot tipped over the bar by michael rensing , before henrique headed against the bar from a corner .
however bayern also threatened , and rene adler in goal twice had to save long-range efforts from bastian schweinsteiger , who also saw a shot flash narrowly wide of the post before the break .
neither side looked like scoring until toni rose to head in ze robert 's cross for a goal which heralded a more controlled spell for klinsmann 's side .
france midfielder ribery - wearing red gloves and pink boots - was again the outstanding figure , coming close to a goal with a shot saved by adler after he had dribbled round four players .
instead , with bayern now fully in charge , he was the provider when he collected the ball in midfield and cleverly threaded the ball through for klose whose low shot beat adler into the corner .
a cross from tranquillo barnetta which came off the top of the bar two minutes from time was the nearest leverkusen came to a goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said bayern 's class was coming out klinsmann said bayern 's class was beginning to shine through as the season progressed .
bayern improving , says coach klinsi " the boys are enjoying their football and the team is now in a position to control a game .

leverkusen coach bruno labbadia said : " we started the first 25 minutes as we wanted to and were in control , but then we were pushed back too deep .
we could n't get the ball forward precisely enough and bayern deserved to win . "
elsewhere , claudio pizarro scored a hat-trick , diego converted a penalty and aaron hunt was also on target as werder bremen ran out 5-0 winners over visiting eintracht frankfurt .
mike hanke bagged a brace and mikael forssell added a third just before the break as hanover raced into a 3-0 lead over karlsruhe .

these matches are generally hard-fought affairs with few goals , especially for hamburg .

it wasn ’ t any different on sunday , but hamburg came away with a 2-1 victory after ivica olic ’ s smashing strike 16 minutes from time .
the croatian national launched a stunning goal from more than 20 meters across the mouth of tim wiese ’ s goal into the upper-left hand corner .
but what preceded it for nearly an hour was not the greatest of all games .
hamburg ’ s paolo guerrero opened the scoring in the 6th minute , scoring from a tight angle after he raced first to a rebound of a mladen petric shot .
18 minutes later , bremen playmaker diego was fouled outside the hamburg penalty area .
he then curled a masterful free kick into the upper right-hand corner for the equalizer .
after that , bremen were tactically the better side , but that didn ’ t matter the olic who gave hamburg the 2-1 victory , boosting them to fifth place .
bremen are still mired in the middle of the table . on saturday , hoffenheim reclaimed the bundesliga lead . cologne 1 hoffenheim 3 surprise team hoffenheim are on top of the bundesliga again after beating fc cologne .

2-1 for bielefeld , and a painful defeat for leverkusen who must host bayern munich next week .
wolfsburg 4 stuttgart 1 another strong performance at home by the wolves .
although stuttgart went ahead in the 17th minute with a goal by martin lanig , wolfsburg kept pushing stuttgart to their limits .

police said the gunmen arrived at the restaurant in three cars , approached a group of people and opened fire .
the city , across the frontier from el paso in texas , has seen spiralling violence this year , most of it connected with the drug industry .
on friday , mexican government figures showed limited success in a campaign to reduce the murder and kidnapping rates .
drug war frontline the bbc 's stephen gibbs , in mexico city , says the restaurant attack had all the hallmarks of a inter-drug cartel assassination .
ciudad juarez is on the front-line of mexico 's vicious drug wars and across the city on friday night alone , a total of 25 people were killed .
the government of felipe calderon has vowed to take on the gangs which make billions of dollars a year exporting cocaine and other drugs to the us , our correspondent says .
at least 20,000 troops have been deployed to capture or kill the ringleaders .
government officials say that the extreme violence in the last few months is a sign that the cartels are under pressure , and are increasingly fighting amongst themselves for fewer spoils .
but , our correspondent adds , that is little comfort for ordinary mexicans , who believe that the general state of insecurity across this country is unacceptable .
on friday , hours before the restaurant attack occurred , official crime figures showed that over the last 100 days , the number of kidnappings in the country had fallen from four a day , to three .
but as most kidnappings go unreported , many observers believe the real figure is around seven times that amount , says our correspondent .

government officials say that the extreme violence in the last few months is a sign that the cartels are under pressure , and are increasingly fighting amongst themselves for fewer spoils .
but , our correspondent adds , that is little comfort for ordinary mexicans , who believe that the general state of insecurity across this country is unacceptable .
on friday , hours before the restaurant attack occurred , official crime figures showed that over the last 100 days , the number of kidnappings in the country had fallen from four a day , to three .
but as most kidnappings go unreported , many observers believe the real figure is around seven times that amount , says our correspondent .

the 26-year-old bowed out with a final rendition of bon jovi 's always .
britney spears also took to the x factor stage to perform current hit single womanizer , in her first uk television performance in four years .
earlier , all of the five remaining contestants sang one of spears ' hits and an american classic .
lorenzo said : " i fought with all my heart , with everything i had .
and this does n't end here .
x factor song choices ruth lorenzo britney : i love rock ' n ' roll america : always -lrb- bon jovi -rrb- jls britney : baby ...

she 's going to be a friend forever , " she said .
earlier judge simon cowell praised her " determination and effort " .
with the show down to its final weeks , lorenzo was chosen solely by public vote .
her exit means diana vickers , eoghan quigg , alexandra burke and boyband jls have all secured a place in the show 's semi-final .
burke , 20 , is now favourite to win the show , after singing powerful versions of spears ' toxic and beyonce 's listen .
simon cowell told the londoner her performance of the dream girls song was the " best performance of the competition " .
" you make me very proud to be british , " he said .
spears is on a whistle-stop tour of europe ahead of the release of her latest album , circus , on monday .
she wore an all black outfit , with hotpants , fishnet tights and knee-high boots during her mimed performance - which received a standing ovation from the judges and studio audience .
afterwards she said : " i love being here in london , it 's awesome . "
she told the remaining contestants : " good luck and just keep doing it . "
on thursday she performed at an awards ceremony in germany , where she was named best international pop star .
on friday , she sang on french tv show star academy .
hannah montana star miley cyrus also appeared on this week 's x factor to play her latest single , 7 things .

in these terms , the attackers received as much attention as they could possibly have hoped for , and the mumbai outrage can only be described as a very significant terrorist success .
the attack received saturation coverage in the world 's media from the outset .
the attacks were a strike at the city 's symbolic buildings almost within minutes , television screens showed harrowing scenes of pools of blood where people had died or been injured , hotels ablaze , indian army snipers firing at distant targets , and cctv images of the attackers .
especially disturbing , hostages and survivors reported that certain nationalities had been identified by their passports and taken away for execution .
no matter how obscure , every detail of this multi-point , sustained attack was soon being pored over by terrorism experts , trying to fit the carnage in mumbai into one template or another .
unanswered questions so the speculative - and often tendentious - questioning began .
what were the tactics of the terrorists ?
what weapons did they have and where could they have got them ?
how much planning and preparation would have been necessary for a military-style operation of this sort ?
who were the terrorists - where were they from and what did they want ?
who was the mastermind behind the attacks ?
and did the attacks have the hallmarks of an al-qaeda-style operation .
was it all part of the global jihad against the west ?
this is precisely how terrorism is meant to work - the terrorist 's action must always be complemented by the target 's reaction in order to complete the scene .
how the attack is carried out , and what is done to whom , matters no more - and often rather less - than the way the attack is received , and the impact accorded to it .
the impact has indeed been instant and extensive , reaching into the worlds of politics , business and even sport , and on all levels - internationally , regionally and nationally in india .
adding meaning but , for all the horror of the mumbai attack , there might have been much less to it than first met the eye , and a hasty and exaggerated response might have played more of a part , and given more meaning to the attack than it should .
nobody appears to have heard of the deccan mujahideen - perhaps because they have never existed .
perhaps it was not so difficult after all to plan and execute this attack : small arms and hand grenades are not hard to find , boats are scarcely specialised equipment , and mumbai is a vast , open city with more than enough soft targets .
these individuals indulge in terrorism simply because they can , while their audience concocts a rationale on their behalf perhaps we do not know enough about where the perpetrators are from , because they could have come from almost anywhere ?
the terrorists were willing to show their faces on cctv .
was this suicide for martyrdom - as in new york and washington in 2001 , and london in 2005 - or suicide for celebrity , as in columbine in 1999 and virginia tech in 2007 ?
and perhaps so little is known of the terrorists ' cause , because they simply did not feel the need to have one .
the attack in mumbai was obviously planned - but " military-style planning " -lrb- whatever that means -rrb- is probably not necessary for the mass murder of unarmed and unsuspecting civilians going about their business in crowded railway stations and restaurants .
this could also have been a plan which had a large gap where mission , cause or vision statement ought to have been .
but no matter .
the terrorists might have assumed , quite correctly as it happens , that the world 's media and the terrorism analysis industry would very quickly fill in any gaps for them .
writing the narrative the character of modern terrorism is widely understood to have been shaped by a mid-19th-century idea known as the " propaganda of the deed " - a strategy for political change in which the message or cause is contained within , and expressed by the violent act .
in a novel twist , the mumbai terrorists might have embarked on propaganda of the deed without the propaganda in the confident expectation that the rationalisation for the attack - the narrative - would be provided by politicians , the media and terrorism analysts .
the mumbai attacks have dominated the airwaves if so , then mumbai could represent something rather different in the history of terrorism , and possibly something far more disturbing even than global jihad .
perhaps we have come to the point where casually self-radicalised , sociopathic individuals can form a loose organisation , acquire sufficient weapons and equipment for a few thousand dollars , make a basic plan of action and indulge in a violent expression of their generalised disaffection and anomie .
these individuals indulge in terrorism simply because they can , while their audience concocts a rationale on their behalf .
welcome to the age of celebrity terrorism .
the invitation to the world 's d-list malcontents reads as follows : no matter how corrupt your moral sense , how contorted your view of the world , how vapid and inarticulate your ideas , how talentless you are and how exaggerated your grievance , an obsessive audience will watch your every move and turn you into what you most want to be , just before your death .

in these terms , the attackers received as much attention as they could possibly have hoped for , and the mumbai outrage can only be described as a very significant terrorist success .
the attack received saturation coverage in the world 's media from the outset .
the attacks were a strike at the city 's symbolic buildings almost within minutes , television screens showed harrowing scenes of pools of blood where people had died or been injured , hotels ablaze , indian army snipers firing at distant targets , and cctv images of the attackers .
especially disturbing , hostages and survivors reported that certain nationalities had been identified by their passports and taken away for execution .
no matter how obscure , every detail of this multi-point , sustained attack was soon being pored over by terrorism experts , trying to fit the carnage in mumbai into one template or another .
unanswered questions so the speculative - and often tendentious - questioning began .
what were the tactics of the terrorists ?
what weapons did they have and where could they have got them ?
how much planning and preparation would have been necessary for a military-style operation of this sort ?
who were the terrorists - where were they from and what did they want ?
who was the mastermind behind the attacks ?
and did the attacks have the hallmarks of an al-qaeda-style operation .
was it all part of the global jihad against the west ?
this is precisely how terrorism is meant to work - the terrorist 's action must always be complemented by the target 's reaction in order to complete the scene .
how the attack is carried out , and what is done to whom , matters no more - and often rather less - than the way the attack is received , and the impact accorded to it .
the impact has indeed been instant and extensive , reaching into the worlds of politics , business and even sport , and on all levels - internationally , regionally and nationally in india .
adding meaning but , for all the horror of the mumbai attack , there might have been much less to it than first met the eye , and a hasty and exaggerated response might have played more of a part , and given more meaning to the attack than it should .
nobody appears to have heard of the deccan mujahideen - perhaps because they have never existed .
perhaps it was not so difficult after all to plan and execute this attack : small arms and hand grenades are not hard to find , boats are scarcely specialised equipment , and mumbai is a vast , open city with more than enough soft targets .
these individuals indulge in terrorism simply because they can , while their audience concocts a rationale on their behalf perhaps we do not know enough about where the perpetrators are from , because they could have come from almost anywhere ?
the terrorists were willing to show their faces on cctv .
was this suicide for martyrdom - as in new york and washington in 2001 , and london in 2005 - or suicide for celebrity , as in columbine in 1999 and virginia tech in 2007 ?
and perhaps so little is known of the terrorists ' cause , because they simply did not feel the need to have one .
the attack in mumbai was obviously planned - but " military-style planning " -lrb- whatever that means -rrb- is probably not necessary for the mass murder of unarmed and unsuspecting civilians going about their business in crowded railway stations and restaurants .
this could also have been a plan which had a large gap where mission , cause or vision statement ought to have been .
but no matter .
the terrorists might have assumed , quite correctly as it happens , that the world 's media and the terrorism analysis industry would very quickly fill in any gaps for them .
writing the narrative the character of modern terrorism is widely understood to have been shaped by a mid-19th-century idea known as the " propaganda of the deed " - a strategy for political change in which the message or cause is contained within , and expressed by the violent act .
in a novel twist , the mumbai terrorists might have embarked on propaganda of the deed without the propaganda in the confident expectation that the rationalisation for the attack - the narrative - would be provided by politicians , the media and terrorism analysts .
the mumbai attacks have dominated the airwaves if so , then mumbai could represent something rather different in the history of terrorism , and possibly something far more disturbing even than global jihad .
perhaps we have come to the point where casually self-radicalised , sociopathic individuals can form a loose organisation , acquire sufficient weapons and equipment for a few thousand dollars , make a basic plan of action and indulge in a violent expression of their generalised disaffection and anomie .
these individuals indulge in terrorism simply because they can , while their audience concocts a rationale on their behalf .
welcome to the age of celebrity terrorism .
the invitation to the world 's d-list malcontents reads as follows : no matter how corrupt your moral sense , how contorted your view of the world , how vapid and inarticulate your ideas , how talentless you are and how exaggerated your grievance , an obsessive audience will watch your every move and turn you into what you most want to be , just before your death .
