instead of protecting a witness on a plane , as he did in the film , flynn could be protecting a post office worker who has vital information on a local crime lord who is shipping in out-of-date kebab meat through the branch before distributing it across eastern germany . to add some kind of credibility , the film could be sold with the tagline : based on a -lrb- nearly -rrb- true story . taking its core premise from the events which actually happened in the eastern german city on friday , jackson 's character fritz could be the guy who discovered a package containing three live pythons ; two tiger pythons and an albino tiger python of more than 3 feet -lrb- 1 meter -rrb- in length . three pythons sent through german postal system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pythons ' arrival proved to be something of a shock the post office worker - who would provide the basis for jackson 's character - noticed one of the reptiles after it had apparently bit its way through the package .
assisted by a number of colleagues , he managed to catch it and put it into an empty box .
the other two pythons were discovered by police who soon arrived at the scene .
all three were then taken to a reptile house . police say they have put the package 's sender under investigation for possible violation of animal protection laws . of course , there would have to be a little artistic license involved in the hollywood version .
fritz and the potential whistle-blower could be working late alone at the depot when the snakes break out , intent on killing both of them and removing any threat to the crime lord 's rancid meat empire .
trying to escape , the deutsche post workers find that all the doors have been locked - and , to no one 's surprise - neither has a key . cue two hours of predictable plot twists , minimal scares and lots of close-ups of sam jackson wrestling obviously plastic snakes and there 's a hollywood blockbuster in the waiting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a formal inquiry was being opened into whether he and other chief officers had committed any misdemeanour , which is a minor offence punishable by a fine , by failing in their duty to supervise the company 's affairs .
german law required executives to put " practicable organizational measures " in place to prevent crime , they added .
widespread corruption pierer , 67 , left siemens after revelations that sales executives used slush funds to bribe officials in greece , italy and other nations to purchase siemens telecommunications gear or machinery .
leaked allegations in recent weeks had suggested pierer may have been warned about the irregularities at the time .
the decision in munich was the conclusion of a preliminary inquiry that followed an interview by prosecutors with pierer on april 18 .
prosecutors said they would not disclose any other details .
preventing repeats the new chief executive of siemens , peter loescher , said in a news interview released on friday that the company had set up a system of checks to prevent any repeats and to punish any offenders .
" one can never rule out individual crookedness , " loescher told news magazine focus .
" but we have a system in place that makes broad-based misdeeds on the past scale impossible in the future . "
siemens employs around 400,000 people around the world and makes a broad range of products including household appliances , medical equipment , trains , turbines and power stations . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a formal inquiry was being opened into whether he and other chief officers had committed any misdemeanour , which is a minor offence punishable by a fine , by failing in their duty to supervise the company 's affairs .
german law required executives to put " practicable organizational measures " in place to prevent crime , they added .
widespread corruption pierer , 67 , left siemens after revelations that sales executives used slush funds to bribe officials in greece , italy and other nations to purchase siemens telecommunications gear or machinery .
leaked allegations in recent weeks had suggested pierer may have been warned about the irregularities at the time .
the decision in munich was the conclusion of a preliminary inquiry that followed an interview by prosecutors with pierer on april 18 .
prosecutors said they would not disclose any other details .
preventing repeats the new chief executive of siemens , peter loescher , said in a news interview released on friday that the company had set up a system of checks to prevent any repeats and to punish any offenders .
" one can never rule out individual crookedness , " loescher told news magazine focus .
" but we have a system in place that makes broad-based misdeeds on the past scale impossible in the future . "
siemens employs around 400,000 people around the world and makes a broad range of products including household appliances , medical equipment , trains , turbines and power stations . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" as already announced , we will make an active contribution to this consolidation , " said perlet , adding that the german banking industry was too fragmented . his comments came after allianz reported a 65-percent slump in first-quarter earnings following a first-quarter loss booked by dresdner in the wake of the global financial crisis . munich-based allianz said net profits dropped to 1.15 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- in the first-three months of the year following a 513-million-euros loss run up at its dresdner banking group . this followed a 64.5-percent drop in revenue at dresdner with the frankfurt-based bank writing down asset-backed securities by 845 million euros during the first quarter .
allianz shares dropped by 0.8 percent to 129.95 euros in early trading friday .

the decision on thursday ratifies the proposal made by the european parliament 's constitutional affairs committee on tuesday , april 1 , in favor of the compulsory register for the lobbyists working to influence eu policies via the eu assembly , states and the bloc 's executive european commission .
the report , drafted by finnish conservative mep alexander stubb before he became finland 's foreign minister , also calls for a code of conduct and sanctions for those who flaunt it .
critics say the lobbyists have held far too much sway in the drafting of eu laws and measures concerning everything from blacklisting bad chemicals to deciding how to set carbon dioxide emission caps .
the eu assembly and member-states adopt laws that directly affect the daily lives of 490 million people .
the outcome of those laws can have a major impact on companies doing business in the 27-nation bloc .
register aims to end era of impunity many feel that the lobbyists have worked with impunity in the european capital , without having to provide any information on the dealings , financial status or partners in business and politics .
the new register aims to change this .
under the new rules , professional lobbyists would have to disclose in the register the importance of their major clients and the costs associated with lobbying , while ngos and think-tanks would be required to state their overall budgets and main funding sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the register aims to shed light into lobbying 's dark corners " -lsb- the committee 's -rsb- report represents a decisive step for a new culture of transparency in brussels , " said german jo leinen , the constitutional affairs committee 's chairman .
" in the future , strict rules will apply to lobbying . "
siim kallas vice-president of the european commission responsible for administrative affairs , added that lobbyists had a role to play in brussels but they had to open up to regulated scrutiny .
“ pressure groups are legitimate and they also bring a lot of swing in the decision-making process , ” he said . “ but these things must be clear .
and , therefore , the european transparency initiative wants to bring light to this often dark chamber . ”
kallas added that the register would " give all lobbies the opportunity to demonstrate their strong commitment to the cause of transparency and the full legitimacy of their profession . "
european capital inundated by lobbyists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels comes second only to washington in lobbying brussels is notorious for its lobbying community which makes it one of the most saturated political capitals on the planet .
" after washington , brussels is the worlds ' largest lobbyists ' city , " said erik wesselius of the corporate europe observatory .
the amsterdam-based non-governmental organization observes the economic and political power of lobbyists .
the organization estimates that the lobbyists spend up to 1 billion euros -lsb- $ 1.5 billion -rsb- a year to influence decision-makers in brussels .
but even wesselius does n't know how many representations there actually are in the city .
estimates put the number of lobbyists in brussels at 15,000 while there are an estimated 2,500 lobby organizations working there , with some 5,000 lobbyists operating in the parliament alone .
lobbyists ready to ignore voluntary register wesselius believes the few of these individuals and organizations will be happy with the regulations pertaining to disclosure .
" many lobbyists have already indicated they will not register because they would have to reveal their clients and their income , " he said .
british liberal european parliamentarian diana wallis told reuters that she also had doubts .
" i have my doubts as to the effectiveness of a voluntary registration system but it is a first step and , in any case , there will be review of the register after a year , " she said .
unlike the european commission and the european council of member governments , only the european parliament currently has a voluntary register of lobbyists and a code of lobbying conduct , which has been in place for the past 10 years .
however , the commission is setting one up to be in place in june .
the new measures are hoped to be in place in time for european parliament elections in june 2009 .
once these new rules are implemented , we will have a real culture of transparency in brussels , " said german socialist eu lawmaker jo leinen .
critics accuse plan of not going far enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics complain of corporate lobbying at the eu however , green lawmakers and an anti-lobby lobby lamented that the measures were not even stronger , saying that they had been watered down with a loophole for lawyers .

" lawyers play an increasingly important role in influencing policy in brussels and they promote themselves as such on their own websites . "
the alliance for lobbying transparency and ethics regulation also said the loophole for lawyers was the work of conservative lawmaker klaus-heiner lehne , who himself is a partner at law firm taylor wessing , specialized in eu law .

" it 's not easy to confront ourselves because we are not the victims but we are the sons and daughters of the perpetrators , " organizer hans minow said .
" we say this knowing that perhaps our fathers and mothers - if not participated - did not do what they had to do when the crimes started , " he said .
the train 's arrival at auschwitz coincided with the 63rd anniversary of the end of the second world war in europe on may 8 , 1945 .
controversial exhibit the exhibit , which originated in the western german city of frankfurt in november , provoked controversy after the state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn refused permission for the train to stop in berlin 's gleaming new hauptbahnhof central station .
deutsche bahn said at the time that this would have caused major disruption to normal services .
the exhibition took place instead at ostbahnhof , the main train station of the former east berlin .
the train of commemoration foundation also complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally and that no one could use the tracks for free .
symbolic journey organizers said that more than 225,000 people viewed the exhibition during its six-month voyage .
detailing the fate of jewish children and teenagers deported by the nazis between october 1940 to december 1944 , the " memorial train " focuses on the biographies of several such children .
the organizers created an exhibit that symbolically travelled through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations after hearing of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the initiative was also intended to encourage visitors to search for traces of jewish people who had vanished from their towns or region during the war . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's not easy to confront ourselves because we are not the victims but we are the sons and daughters of the perpetrators , " organizer hans minow said .
" we say this knowing that perhaps our fathers and mothers - if not participated - did not do what they had to do when the crimes started , " he said .
the train 's arrival at auschwitz coincided with the 63rd anniversary of the end of the second world war in europe on may 8 , 1945 .
controversial exhibit the exhibit , which originated in the western german city of frankfurt in november , provoked controversy after the state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn refused permission for the train to stop in berlin 's gleaming new hauptbahnhof central station .
deutsche bahn said at the time that this would have caused major disruption to normal services .
the exhibition took place instead at ostbahnhof , the main train station of the former east berlin .
the train of commemoration foundation also complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally and that no one could use the tracks for free .
symbolic journey organizers said that more than 225,000 people viewed the exhibition during its six-month voyage .
detailing the fate of jewish children and teenagers deported by the nazis between october 1940 to december 1944 , the " memorial train " focuses on the biographies of several such children .
the organizers created an exhibit that symbolically travelled through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations after hearing of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the initiative was also intended to encourage visitors to search for traces of jewish people who had vanished from their towns or region during the war . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the world food program temporarily suspended aid but said two planes would deliver supplies saturday . the united nations estimated friday that the death toll could reach more than 100,000 in burma , a dramatic increase in the estimate of the devastation in the 55 townships in the country 's low-lying delta region delivered by cyclone nargis . by contrast , burma 's military government has estimated 23,000 dead and 40,000 people still missing .
an estimated 13 million people of myanmar 's population of 53 million live in areas hit by the cyclone . demanding that burma ease entry restrictions on aid workers , she told german news agency dpa she would phone un secretary-general ban ki-moon to ask the un security council to meet on the crisis , as requested by france .
the french move has been blocked by permanent member china , with the support of indonesia and other countries , which said they did not want the issue politicized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irrawaddy delta , in the country 's south , was devastated " in such a situation , it is utterly inexplicable to me that the military government is not letting into the country the desperately needed relief that has been offered , " she said in berlin on friday , may 9 . merkel appealed to burma 's neighbors and the association of south-east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- to use their influence on the country also known as myanmar . she said a " blockade " in the un security council against discussion of the issue was " irresponsible . " " i strongly appeal to the government to meet its responsibility to its people and to let world aid into the entire disaster area , " she said , adding she was shocked at the " appalling images of human suffering that have come here from myanmar . " the victims needed rapid assistance that germany was willing to provide along with others , she said .
germany doubles aid " the people in myanmar need the aid now , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an extraordinary meeting of the ministry 's humanitarian aid coordination committee on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the full extent of the damage is not yet known steinmeier said the damage done by cyclone nargis was likely to be even greater than that caused by the catastrophe caused by the devastating tsunami that upset southeast asia in 2004 . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul announced a doubling in emergency aid to the people of burma to 2 million euros -lrb- $ 3.1 million -rrb- .
the aid would be channeled through relief organizations and not the burmese government , she said , adding that some estimates said that up to 1.9 million people were in urgent need of assistance .
un food program suspends deliveries also on friday , the un world food program said the military regime had confiscated all foreign aid entering the country .
the organization suspended aid deliveries on friday but hours later said two more planes with food and water would land in burma on saturday . wfp spokesman paul risley said the organization stopped delivering assistance after the the last two deliveries of 38 tons ' worth of aid had been stopped at the airport .
he told the bbc that the aid was not reaching cyclone victims . " the world food program has decided to send in two relief flights as planned -lsb- saturday -rsb- , while discussions continue with the government of myanmar on the distribution of the food that was flown in -lsb- friday -rsb- , and not released to wfp , " nancy e. roman , wfp 's communications director , said in a statement . the white house welcomed news on friday that it could send one military cargo plane carrying supplies that reach burma on monday . " one flight is much better than no flights , " said spokesman gordon johndroe , who told reporters us officials were trying to determine what supplies were most needed . earlier in the day , the german red cross had said it would continue efforts to dispatch a water purification plant , along with german aid experts , to the devastated area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany hope to push the un into action spokeswoman svenja koch said the organization planned to fly the equipment , which can provide 15,000 people with drinking water , from berlin next week .
she said that there had been an official request from the red cross in burma and that this might make it easier to gain permission . on thursday , steinmeier summoned the burmese ambassador to the foreign ministry . the minister told ambassador u tin win that berlin was " deeply concerned " and that " the government in myanmar is still standing in the way of effective cooperation in organizing assistance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 09.05.2008 european parliament moves to curb power of lobbyists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the handshakes which seal the deals around brussels will soon have to be documented the european parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favor of tightening rules regulating the 15,000 lobbyists that gravitate around the eu institutions . by an overwhelming majority , eu lawmakers adopted a report recommending a mandatory public register for lobbyists that seek to influence decisions at the european union 's institutions .
the decision on thursday ratifies the proposal made by the european parliament 's constitutional affairs committee on tuesday , april 1 , in favor of the compulsory register for the lobbyists working to influence eu policies via the eu assembly , states and the bloc 's executive european commission .
the report , drafted by finnish conservative mep alexander stubb before he became finland 's foreign minister , also calls for a code of conduct and sanctions for those who flaunt it .
critics say the lobbyists have held far too much sway in the drafting of eu laws and measures concerning everything from blacklisting bad chemicals to deciding how to set carbon dioxide emission caps .
the eu assembly and member-states adopt laws that directly affect the daily lives of 490 million people .
the outcome of those laws can have a major impact on companies doing business in the 27-nation bloc .
register aims to end era of impunity many feel that the lobbyists have worked with impunity in the european capital , without having to provide any information on the dealings , financial status or partners in business and politics .
the new register aims to change this .
under the new rules , professional lobbyists would have to disclose in the register the importance of their major clients and the costs associated with lobbying , while ngos and think-tanks would be required to state their overall budgets and main funding sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the register aims to shed light into lobbying 's dark corners " -lsb- the committee 's -rsb- report represents a decisive step for a new culture of transparency in brussels , " said german jo leinen , the constitutional affairs committee 's chairman .
" in the future , strict rules will apply to lobbying . "
siim kallas vice-president of the european commission responsible for administrative affairs , added that lobbyists had a role to play in brussels but they had to open up to regulated scrutiny .
“ pressure groups are legitimate and they also bring a lot of swing in the decision-making process , ” he said . “ but these things must be clear .
and , therefore , the european transparency initiative wants to bring light to this often dark chamber . ”
kallas added that the register would " give all lobbies the opportunity to demonstrate their strong commitment to the cause of transparency and the full legitimacy of their profession . "
european capital inundated by lobbyists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels comes second only to washington in lobbying brussels is notorious for its lobbying community which makes it one of the most saturated political capitals on the planet .
" after washington , brussels is the worlds ' largest lobbyists ' city , " said erik wesselius of the corporate europe observatory .
the amsterdam-based non-governmental organization observes the economic and political power of lobbyists .
the organization estimates that the lobbyists spend up to 1 billion euros -lsb- $ 1.5 billion -rsb- a year to influence decision-makers in brussels .
but even wesselius does n't know how many representations there actually are in the city .
estimates put the number of lobbyists in brussels at 15,000 while there are an estimated 2,500 lobby organizations working there , with some 5,000 lobbyists operating in the parliament alone .
lobbyists ready to ignore voluntary register wesselius believes the few of these individuals and organizations will be happy with the regulations pertaining to disclosure .
" many lobbyists have already indicated they will not register because they would have to reveal their clients and their income , " he said .
british liberal european parliamentarian diana wallis told reuters that she also had doubts .
" i have my doubts as to the effectiveness of a voluntary registration system but it is a first step and , in any case , there will be review of the register after a year , " she said .
unlike the european commission and the european council of member governments , only the european parliament currently has a voluntary register of lobbyists and a code of lobbying conduct , which has been in place for the past 10 years .
however , the commission is setting one up to be in place in june .
the new measures are hoped to be in place in time for european parliament elections in june 2009 .
once these new rules are implemented , we will have a real culture of transparency in brussels , " said german socialist eu lawmaker jo leinen .
critics accuse plan of not going far enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics complain of corporate lobbying at the eu however , green lawmakers and an anti-lobby lobby lamented that the measures were not even stronger , saying that they had been watered down with a loophole for lawyers .
" lawyers are exempted from the scope of rules , which , given all available evidence is absurd , " said italian green monica frassoni .
" lawyers play an increasingly important role in influencing policy in brussels and they promote themselves as such on their own websites . "
the alliance for lobbying transparency and ethics regulation also said the loophole for lawyers was the work of conservative lawmaker klaus-heiner lehne , who himself is a partner at law firm taylor wessing , specialized in eu law .
" this outcome shows the need for the parliament to clean up its own house and introduce strong rules to prevent conflicts of interest , " said paul de clerck with environmentalist campaigners friends of the earth europe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a formal inquiry was being opened into whether he and other chief officers had committed any misdemeanour , which is a minor offence punishable by a fine , by failing in their duty to supervise the company 's affairs .
german law required executives to put " practicable organizational measures " in place to prevent crime , they added .
widespread corruption pierer , 67 , left siemens after revelations that sales executives used slush funds to bribe officials in greece , italy and other nations to purchase siemens telecommunications gear or machinery .
leaked allegations in recent weeks had suggested pierer may have been warned about the irregularities at the time .
the decision in munich was the conclusion of a preliminary inquiry that followed an interview by prosecutors with pierer on april 18 .
prosecutors said they would not disclose any other details .
preventing repeats the new chief executive of siemens , peter loescher , said in a news interview released on friday that the company had set up a system of checks to prevent any repeats and to punish any offenders .
" one can never rule out individual crookedness , " loescher told news magazine focus .
" but we have a system in place that makes broad-based misdeeds on the past scale impossible in the future . "
siemens employs around 400,000 people around the world and makes a broad range of products including household appliances , medical equipment , trains , turbines and power stations . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 09.05.2008 serbian elections in kosovo cause controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgrade wants serbs in kosovo to vote in parliamentary elections organized by belgrade serbia goes to the polls on sunday .
serbs in kosovo have also been called on to vote in their electoral districts .
but those districts are now located in a different country - kosovo - under un administration . if belgrade gets its wish , kosovo 's serbs will be able to vote in serbian parliamentary and local elections on sunday , may 11 .
serbian citizens who live in kosovo - or anywhere else for that matter - have the right to vote just as those who live in the country do .
but there 's a catch : serbia wants to hold elections in kosovo . the un interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- , which oversees the former serbian administration , rejects the idea , as do kosovar albanians , who see belgrade as undermining their institutions . serbian state local elections in kosovo would not be recognized and would even be counterproductive if they were n't organized by unmik , according to oliver ivanovic , head of the serb list for kosovo and metohija , one of the main parliamentary parties in kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only unmik , under joachim ruecker , may organize elections in kosovo " these polls will lead to controversy right from the beginning , because they are n't well prepared technically , " he said . the voter registers of kosovo serbs were from 1996 , he said , adding that : " our estimates show that more than 200,000 serbs and non-albanians have moved away in the meantime . " " the credibility of these elections is arguable , because according to un security council resolution 1244 , the international community alone is authorized to organize elections on a local or provincial level on kosovar territory , " ivanovic said . unmik calls the shots it was clear that resolution 1244 allowed only unmik to organize elections , said nebojsa jovic , head of the executive committee of the serb national council in mitrovica , which aims to defend the interests of the serb minority .
and it was " certainly desirable that the elections were in this way recognized as entirely legitimate by unmik , " jovic said .
" but we 're in a strange situation in which unmik head joachim ruecker and the international administration declare they will not recognize the local elections .
they have to give good reasons for that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo declared independence on feb .
17 the reasons they give are that belgrade is no longer responsible for local elections because kosovo declared independence from serbia . unmik has been responsible for organizing elections in kosovo ever since the former serbian province was put under international administration in 1999 and resolution 1244 was passed in the wake of nato 's bombing campaign against yugoslavia .
multi-ethnic country kosovo 's president , fatmir sejdiu , also rejects serbia carrying out elections in his county .
" serbia wants -lsb- the polls in kosovo -rsb- so that kosovar institutions are trampled underfoot .
we want citizens of serbian ethnicity to become part of our institutions .
that 's why these elections are unacceptable to us , and they wo n't have any validity . " kosovo 's citizens are hardly of one mind on the issue . " kosovo is an independent and sovereign state and serbian elections have no place in our country , " said kosovar albanian asan bitiqi . slobodan petkovic , a kosovo serb , looked toward the past : " unmik prevented neither parliamentary elections nor presidential elections in serbia , " he said .

" it 's not easy to confront ourselves because we are not the victims but we are the sons and daughters of the perpetrators , " organizer hans minow said .
" we say this knowing that perhaps our fathers and mothers - if not participated - did not do what they had to do when the crimes started , " he said .
the train 's arrival at auschwitz coincided with the 63rd anniversary of the end of the second world war in europe on may 8 , 1945 .
controversial exhibit the exhibit , which originated in the western german city of frankfurt in november , provoked controversy after the state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn refused permission for the train to stop in berlin 's gleaming new hauptbahnhof central station .
deutsche bahn said at the time that this would have caused major disruption to normal services .
the exhibition took place instead at ostbahnhof , the main train station of the former east berlin .
the train of commemoration foundation also complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally and that no one could use the tracks for free .

detailing the fate of jewish children and teenagers deported by the nazis between october 1940 to december 1944 , the " memorial train " focuses on the biographies of several such children .

the world food program temporarily suspended aid but said two planes would deliver supplies saturday . the united nations estimated friday that the death toll could reach more than 100,000 in burma , a dramatic increase in the estimate of the devastation in the 55 townships in the country 's low-lying delta region delivered by cyclone nargis . by contrast , burma 's military government has estimated 23,000 dead and 40,000 people still missing .
an estimated 13 million people of myanmar 's population of 53 million live in areas hit by the cyclone . demanding that burma ease entry restrictions on aid workers , she told german news agency dpa she would phone un secretary-general ban ki-moon to ask the un security council to meet on the crisis , as requested by france .
the french move has been blocked by permanent member china , with the support of indonesia and other countries , which said they did not want the issue politicized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irrawaddy delta , in the country 's south , was devastated " in such a situation , it is utterly inexplicable to me that the military government is not letting into the country the desperately needed relief that has been offered , " she said in berlin on friday , may 9 . merkel appealed to burma 's neighbors and the association of south-east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- to use their influence on the country also known as myanmar . she said a " blockade " in the un security council against discussion of the issue was " irresponsible . " " i strongly appeal to the government to meet its responsibility to its people and to let world aid into the entire disaster area , " she said , adding she was shocked at the " appalling images of human suffering that have come here from myanmar . " the victims needed rapid assistance that germany was willing to provide along with others , she said .
germany doubles aid " the people in myanmar need the aid now , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an extraordinary meeting of the ministry 's humanitarian aid coordination committee on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the full extent of the damage is not yet known steinmeier said the damage done by cyclone nargis was likely to be even greater than that caused by the catastrophe caused by the devastating tsunami that upset southeast asia in 2004 . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul announced a doubling in emergency aid to the people of burma to 2 million euros -lrb- $ 3.1 million -rrb- .
the aid would be channeled through relief organizations and not the burmese government , she said , adding that some estimates said that up to 1.9 million people were in urgent need of assistance .
un food program suspends deliveries also on friday , the un world food program said the military regime had confiscated all foreign aid entering the country .
the organization suspended aid deliveries on friday but hours later said two more planes with food and water would land in burma on saturday . wfp spokesman paul risley said the organization stopped delivering assistance after the the last two deliveries of 38 tons ' worth of aid had been stopped at the airport .
he told the bbc that the aid was not reaching cyclone victims . " the world food program has decided to send in two relief flights as planned -lsb- saturday -rsb- , while discussions continue with the government of myanmar on the distribution of the food that was flown in -lsb- friday -rsb- , and not released to wfp , " nancy e. roman , wfp 's communications director , said in a statement . the white house welcomed news on friday that it could send one military cargo plane carrying supplies that reach burma on monday . " one flight is much better than no flights , " said spokesman gordon johndroe , who told reporters us officials were trying to determine what supplies were most needed . earlier in the day , the german red cross had said it would continue efforts to dispatch a water purification plant , along with german aid experts , to the devastated area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany hope to push the un into action spokeswoman svenja koch said the organization planned to fly the equipment , which can provide 15,000 people with drinking water , from berlin next week .
she said that there had been an official request from the red cross in burma and that this might make it easier to gain permission . on thursday , steinmeier summoned the burmese ambassador to the foreign ministry . the minister told ambassador u tin win that berlin was " deeply concerned " and that " the government in myanmar is still standing in the way of effective cooperation in organizing assistance . " cyclone nargis left burma 's largest city , yangon , without electricity and water after it struck a week ago , causing untold damage to the fragile infrastructure and food supply . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an estimated 13 million people of myanmar 's population of 53 million live in areas hit by the cyclone . demanding that burma ease entry restrictions on aid workers , she told german news agency dpa she would phone un secretary-general ban ki-moon to ask the un security council to meet on the crisis , as requested by france .

the aid would be channeled through relief organizations and not the burmese government , she said , adding that some estimates said that up to 1.9 million people were in urgent need of assistance .
un food program suspends deliveries also on friday , the un world food program said the military regime had confiscated all foreign aid entering the country .
the organization suspended aid deliveries on friday but hours later said two more planes with food and water would land in burma on saturday . wfp spokesman paul risley said the organization stopped delivering assistance after the the last two deliveries of 38 tons ' worth of aid had been stopped at the airport .

" one flight is much better than no flights , " said spokesman gordon johndroe , who told reporters us officials were trying to determine what supplies were most needed . earlier in the day , the german red cross had said it would continue efforts to dispatch a water purification plant , along with german aid experts , to the devastated area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany hope to push the un into action spokeswoman svenja koch said the organization planned to fly the equipment , which can provide 15,000 people with drinking water , from berlin next week .
she said that there had been an official request from the red cross in burma and that this might make it easier to gain permission . on thursday , steinmeier summoned the burmese ambassador to the foreign ministry . the minister told ambassador u tin win that berlin was " deeply concerned " and that " the government in myanmar is still standing in the way of effective cooperation in organizing assistance .

instead of protecting a witness on a plane , as he did in the film , flynn could be protecting a post office worker who has vital information on a local crime lord who is shipping in out-of-date kebab meat through the branch before distributing it across eastern germany . to add some kind of credibility , the film could be sold with the tagline : based on a -lrb- nearly -rrb- true story . taking its core premise from the events which actually happened in the eastern german city on friday , jackson 's character fritz could be the guy who discovered a package containing three live pythons ; two tiger pythons and an albino tiger python of more than 3 feet -lrb- 1 meter -rrb- in length . three pythons sent through german postal system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pythons ' arrival proved to be something of a shock the post office worker - who would provide the basis for jackson 's character - noticed one of the reptiles after it had apparently bit its way through the package .
assisted by a number of colleagues , he managed to catch it and put it into an empty box .
the other two pythons were discovered by police who soon arrived at the scene .
all three were then taken to a reptile house . police say they have put the package 's sender under investigation for possible violation of animal protection laws . of course , there would have to be a little artistic license involved in the hollywood version .
fritz and the potential whistle-blower could be working late alone at the depot when the snakes break out , intent on killing both of them and removing any threat to the crime lord 's rancid meat empire .
trying to escape , the deutsche post workers find that all the doors have been locked - and , to no one 's surprise - neither has a key . cue two hours of predictable plot twists , minimal scares and lots of close-ups of sam jackson wrestling obviously plastic snakes and there 's a hollywood blockbuster in the waiting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" as already announced , we will make an active contribution to this consolidation , " said perlet , adding that the german banking industry was too fragmented . his comments came after allianz reported a 65-percent slump in first-quarter earnings following a first-quarter loss booked by dresdner in the wake of the global financial crisis . munich-based allianz said net profits dropped to 1.15 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- in the first-three months of the year following a 513-million-euros loss run up at its dresdner banking group . this followed a 64.5-percent drop in revenue at dresdner with the frankfurt-based bank writing down asset-backed securities by 845 million euros during the first quarter .
allianz shares dropped by 0.8 percent to 129.95 euros in early trading friday . " while 2008 will remain a challenging year , the longer this environment persists the harder it will also be to achieve our medium term outlook , " perlet said . dresdner split part of consolidation plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allianz could dismantle itself allianz plans to divide dresdner operations into two completely separate entities under a holding company to help it participate in the drive for consolidation in germany 's banking industry . the insurer 's push to break up dresdner comes about seven years after allianz acquired the bank as part of efforts by the insurance group to cash in on the then german government 's plans to promote private pension schemes . allianz 's plans for dresdner also come in the wake of media speculation that the insurer could be considering orchestrating a broad banking merger in germany . this could include the merger of dresdner with germany 's second biggest listed bank , commerzbank ag and deutsche postbank ag , the banking offshoot of the postal and logistic group , deutsche post ag . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" as already announced , we will make an active contribution to this consolidation , " said perlet , adding that the german banking industry was too fragmented . his comments came after allianz reported a 65-percent slump in first-quarter earnings following a first-quarter loss booked by dresdner in the wake of the global financial crisis . munich-based allianz said net profits dropped to 1.15 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- in the first-three months of the year following a 513-million-euros loss run up at its dresdner banking group . this followed a 64.5-percent drop in revenue at dresdner with the frankfurt-based bank writing down asset-backed securities by 845 million euros during the first quarter .
allianz shares dropped by 0.8 percent to 129.95 euros in early trading friday . " while 2008 will remain a challenging year , the longer this environment persists the harder it will also be to achieve our medium term outlook , " perlet said . dresdner split part of consolidation plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allianz could dismantle itself allianz plans to divide dresdner operations into two completely separate entities under a holding company to help it participate in the drive for consolidation in germany 's banking industry . the insurer 's push to break up dresdner comes about seven years after allianz acquired the bank as part of efforts by the insurance group to cash in on the then german government 's plans to promote private pension schemes . allianz 's plans for dresdner also come in the wake of media speculation that the insurer could be considering orchestrating a broad banking merger in germany . this could include the merger of dresdner with germany 's second biggest listed bank , commerzbank ag and deutsche postbank ag , the banking offshoot of the postal and logistic group , deutsche post ag . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision on thursday ratifies the proposal made by the european parliament 's constitutional affairs committee on tuesday , april 1 , in favor of the compulsory register for the lobbyists working to influence eu policies via the eu assembly , states and the bloc 's executive european commission .
the report , drafted by finnish conservative mep alexander stubb before he became finland 's foreign minister , also calls for a code of conduct and sanctions for those who flaunt it .
critics say the lobbyists have held far too much sway in the drafting of eu laws and measures concerning everything from blacklisting bad chemicals to deciding how to set carbon dioxide emission caps .

rsf called company executives to consider the implications of its brand being linked with human rights violations in china .
" adidas has a moral responsibility , " said rsf executive officer elke schaefter .
adidas chief executive herbert hainer said he took human rights very seriously , according to the text of his speech at the meeting .
he nevertheless criticized human rights organisations as " moralists who just emit rhetoric . "
the paris-based rsf used the same tactic in order to attend the annual general meeting of coca-cola last month in the united states .
the company is also sponsoring this summer 's olympics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 09.05.2008 european parliament moves to curb power of lobbyists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the handshakes which seal the deals around brussels will soon have to be documented the european parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favor of tightening rules regulating the 15,000 lobbyists that gravitate around the eu institutions . by an overwhelming majority , eu lawmakers adopted a report recommending a mandatory public register for lobbyists that seek to influence decisions at the european union 's institutions .
the decision on thursday ratifies the proposal made by the european parliament 's constitutional affairs committee on tuesday , april 1 , in favor of the compulsory register for the lobbyists working to influence eu policies via the eu assembly , states and the bloc 's executive european commission .
the report , drafted by finnish conservative mep alexander stubb before he became finland 's foreign minister , also calls for a code of conduct and sanctions for those who flaunt it .
critics say the lobbyists have held far too much sway in the drafting of eu laws and measures concerning everything from blacklisting bad chemicals to deciding how to set carbon dioxide emission caps .
the eu assembly and member-states adopt laws that directly affect the daily lives of 490 million people .
the outcome of those laws can have a major impact on companies doing business in the 27-nation bloc .
register aims to end era of impunity many feel that the lobbyists have worked with impunity in the european capital , without having to provide any information on the dealings , financial status or partners in business and politics .
the new register aims to change this .
under the new rules , professional lobbyists would have to disclose in the register the importance of their major clients and the costs associated with lobbying , while ngos and think-tanks would be required to state their overall budgets and main funding sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the register aims to shed light into lobbying 's dark corners " -lsb- the committee 's -rsb- report represents a decisive step for a new culture of transparency in brussels , " said german jo leinen , the constitutional affairs committee 's chairman .
" in the future , strict rules will apply to lobbying . "
siim kallas vice-president of the european commission responsible for administrative affairs , added that lobbyists had a role to play in brussels but they had to open up to regulated scrutiny .
“ pressure groups are legitimate and they also bring a lot of swing in the decision-making process , ” he said . “ but these things must be clear .
and , therefore , the european transparency initiative wants to bring light to this often dark chamber . ”
kallas added that the register would " give all lobbies the opportunity to demonstrate their strong commitment to the cause of transparency and the full legitimacy of their profession . "
european capital inundated by lobbyists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels comes second only to washington in lobbying brussels is notorious for its lobbying community which makes it one of the most saturated political capitals on the planet .
" after washington , brussels is the worlds ' largest lobbyists ' city , " said erik wesselius of the corporate europe observatory .
the amsterdam-based non-governmental organization observes the economic and political power of lobbyists .
the organization estimates that the lobbyists spend up to 1 billion euros -lsb- $ 1.5 billion -rsb- a year to influence decision-makers in brussels .
but even wesselius does n't know how many representations there actually are in the city .
estimates put the number of lobbyists in brussels at 15,000 while there are an estimated 2,500 lobby organizations working there , with some 5,000 lobbyists operating in the parliament alone .
lobbyists ready to ignore voluntary register wesselius believes the few of these individuals and organizations will be happy with the regulations pertaining to disclosure .
" many lobbyists have already indicated they will not register because they would have to reveal their clients and their income , " he said .
british liberal european parliamentarian diana wallis told reuters that she also had doubts .
" i have my doubts as to the effectiveness of a voluntary registration system but it is a first step and , in any case , there will be review of the register after a year , " she said .
unlike the european commission and the european council of member governments , only the european parliament currently has a voluntary register of lobbyists and a code of lobbying conduct , which has been in place for the past 10 years .
however , the commission is setting one up to be in place in june .
the new measures are hoped to be in place in time for european parliament elections in june 2009 .
once these new rules are implemented , we will have a real culture of transparency in brussels , " said german socialist eu lawmaker jo leinen .
critics accuse plan of not going far enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics complain of corporate lobbying at the eu however , green lawmakers and an anti-lobby lobby lamented that the measures were not even stronger , saying that they had been watered down with a loophole for lawyers .

" it is the most difficult decisions , " loew said .
" every one of them has his strengths . " loew may also name a squad of 25 or 26 players next friday to take to a 10-day training camp in majorca three days later . the squad would then be trimmed to 23 when the final list is presented to uefa , european soccer 's governing body , by the may 28 deadline , a day after germany play a friendly against belarus in kaiserslautern . the usual suspects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose have been regulars on the german national side with four weeks to the start of euro 2008 , miroslav klose , lukas podolski , who both play for bayern munich , mario gomez of vfb stuttgart , and kevin kuranyi , who is at schalke 04 , can bank on their places in the squad barring injury . loew will have all his scouting staff at matches on saturday in the penultimate games of the bundesliga season .

" as already announced , we will make an active contribution to this consolidation , " said perlet , adding that the german banking industry was too fragmented . his comments came after allianz reported a 65-percent slump in first-quarter earnings following a first-quarter loss booked by dresdner in the wake of the global financial crisis . munich-based allianz said net profits dropped to 1.15 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- in the first-three months of the year following a 513-million-euros loss run up at its dresdner banking group . this followed a 64.5-percent drop in revenue at dresdner with the frankfurt-based bank writing down asset-backed securities by 845 million euros during the first quarter .
allianz shares dropped by 0.8 percent to 129.95 euros in early trading friday . " while 2008 will remain a challenging year , the longer this environment persists the harder it will also be to achieve our medium term outlook , " perlet said . dresdner split part of consolidation plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allianz could dismantle itself allianz plans to divide dresdner operations into two completely separate entities under a holding company to help it participate in the drive for consolidation in germany 's banking industry . the insurer 's push to break up dresdner comes about seven years after allianz acquired the bank as part of efforts by the insurance group to cash in on the then german government 's plans to promote private pension schemes . allianz 's plans for dresdner also come in the wake of media speculation that the insurer could be considering orchestrating a broad banking merger in germany . this could include the merger of dresdner with germany 's second biggest listed bank , commerzbank ag and deutsche postbank ag , the banking offshoot of the postal and logistic group , deutsche post ag . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" i urgently call on all parties to withdraw their armed factions , lay down their weapons and recognise the lebanese state 's exclusive right to use force , " steinmeier said in a statement .
" the developments of the last few days have shown that a resolution to the political conflict in lebanon can not wait any longer . "
at least 11 people have been killed and dozens more wounded in the civil unrest that erupted on thursday after hezbollah chief hassan nasrallah said a government crackdown on his iranian-backed shiite muslim group was a declaration of war .
power vacuum steinmeier noted that the parties represented in the lebanese parliament agreed months ago on a presidential candidate who would be acceptable for all .
" they are now called upon to finally end the vacuum at the top of the state leadership , " he said .
the lebanese parliament has not been able to agree on the make-up of the new cabinet .
as a consequence , 18 sessions of parliament to choose a new president have been cancelled .
germany has repeatedly called for a resolution to the crisis over the election of a lebanese president and accused syria of blocking the process and of contributing to rising tensions in the country .
profound crisis " the profound crisis in lebanon can only be resolved with dialogue and in the framework of institutions that are laid out in the constitution , " steinmeier said .
" part of this dialogue must be an agreement on disarming all the militias in lebanon , " he said .
german government spokesmen said there was constant contact between german diplomats and lebanese leaders , including seniora and lebanese house speaker nabih berri .

" it 's not easy to confront ourselves because we are not the victims but we are the sons and daughters of the perpetrators , " organizer hans minow said .
" we say this knowing that perhaps our fathers and mothers - if not participated - did not do what they had to do when the crimes started , " he said .
the train 's arrival at auschwitz coincided with the 63rd anniversary of the end of the second world war in europe on may 8 , 1945 .
controversial exhibit the exhibit , which originated in the western german city of frankfurt in november , provoked controversy after the state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn refused permission for the train to stop in berlin 's gleaming new hauptbahnhof central station .
deutsche bahn said at the time that this would have caused major disruption to normal services .
the exhibition took place instead at ostbahnhof , the main train station of the former east berlin .
the train of commemoration foundation also complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally and that no one could use the tracks for free .
symbolic journey organizers said that more than 225,000 people viewed the exhibition during its six-month voyage .
detailing the fate of jewish children and teenagers deported by the nazis between october 1940 to december 1944 , the " memorial train " focuses on the biographies of several such children .
the organizers created an exhibit that symbolically travelled through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations after hearing of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the initiative was also intended to encourage visitors to search for traces of jewish people who had vanished from their towns or region during the war . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead of protecting a witness on a plane , as he did in the film , flynn could be protecting a post office worker who has vital information on a local crime lord who is shipping in out-of-date kebab meat through the branch before distributing it across eastern germany . to add some kind of credibility , the film could be sold with the tagline : based on a -lrb- nearly -rrb- true story . taking its core premise from the events which actually happened in the eastern german city on friday , jackson 's character fritz could be the guy who discovered a package containing three live pythons ; two tiger pythons and an albino tiger python of more than 3 feet -lrb- 1 meter -rrb- in length . three pythons sent through german postal system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pythons ' arrival proved to be something of a shock the post office worker - who would provide the basis for jackson 's character - noticed one of the reptiles after it had apparently bit its way through the package .
assisted by a number of colleagues , he managed to catch it and put it into an empty box .
the other two pythons were discovered by police who soon arrived at the scene .
all three were then taken to a reptile house . police say they have put the package 's sender under investigation for possible violation of animal protection laws . of course , there would have to be a little artistic license involved in the hollywood version .
fritz and the potential whistle-blower could be working late alone at the depot when the snakes break out , intent on killing both of them and removing any threat to the crime lord 's rancid meat empire .
trying to escape , the deutsche post workers find that all the doors have been locked - and , to no one 's surprise - neither has a key . cue two hours of predictable plot twists , minimal scares and lots of close-ups of sam jackson wrestling obviously plastic snakes and there 's a hollywood blockbuster in the waiting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's not easy to confront ourselves because we are not the victims but we are the sons and daughters of the perpetrators , " organizer hans minow said .
" we say this knowing that perhaps our fathers and mothers - if not participated - did not do what they had to do when the crimes started , " he said .
the train 's arrival at auschwitz coincided with the 63rd anniversary of the end of the second world war in europe on may 8 , 1945 .
controversial exhibit the exhibit , which originated in the western german city of frankfurt in november , provoked controversy after the state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn refused permission for the train to stop in berlin 's gleaming new hauptbahnhof central station .
deutsche bahn said at the time that this would have caused major disruption to normal services .
the exhibition took place instead at ostbahnhof , the main train station of the former east berlin .
the train of commemoration foundation also complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally and that no one could use the tracks for free .
symbolic journey organizers said that more than 225,000 people viewed the exhibition during its six-month voyage .
detailing the fate of jewish children and teenagers deported by the nazis between october 1940 to december 1944 , the " memorial train " focuses on the biographies of several such children .
the organizers created an exhibit that symbolically travelled through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations after hearing of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the initiative was also intended to encourage visitors to search for traces of jewish people who had vanished from their towns or region during the war . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" as already announced , we will make an active contribution to this consolidation , " said perlet , adding that the german banking industry was too fragmented . his comments came after allianz reported a 65-percent slump in first-quarter earnings following a first-quarter loss booked by dresdner in the wake of the global financial crisis . munich-based allianz said net profits dropped to 1.15 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- in the first-three months of the year following a 513-million-euros loss run up at its dresdner banking group . this followed a 64.5-percent drop in revenue at dresdner with the frankfurt-based bank writing down asset-backed securities by 845 million euros during the first quarter .
allianz shares dropped by 0.8 percent to 129.95 euros in early trading friday .

serbs in kosovo have also been called on to vote in their electoral districts .
but those districts are now located in a different country - kosovo - under un administration . if belgrade gets its wish , kosovo 's serbs will be able to vote in serbian parliamentary and local elections on sunday , may 11 .
serbian citizens who live in kosovo - or anywhere else for that matter - have the right to vote just as those who live in the country do .
but there 's a catch : serbia wants to hold elections in kosovo . the un interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- , which oversees the former serbian administration , rejects the idea , as do kosovar albanians , who see belgrade as undermining their institutions . serbian state local elections in kosovo would not be recognized and would even be counterproductive if they were n't organized by unmik , according to oliver ivanovic , head of the serb list for kosovo and metohija , one of the main parliamentary parties in kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only unmik , under joachim ruecker , may organize elections in kosovo " these polls will lead to controversy right from the beginning , because they are n't well prepared technically , " he said . the voter registers of kosovo serbs were from 1996 , he said , adding that : " our estimates show that more than 200,000 serbs and non-albanians have moved away in the meantime . " " the credibility of these elections is arguable , because according to un security council resolution 1244 , the international community alone is authorized to organize elections on a local or provincial level on kosovar territory , " ivanovic said . unmik calls the shots it was clear that resolution 1244 allowed only unmik to organize elections , said nebojsa jovic , head of the executive committee of the serb national council in mitrovica , which aims to defend the interests of the serb minority .
and it was " certainly desirable that the elections were in this way recognized as entirely legitimate by unmik , " jovic said .
" but we 're in a strange situation in which unmik head joachim ruecker and the international administration declare they will not recognize the local elections .
they have to give good reasons for that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo declared independence on feb .
17 the reasons they give are that belgrade is no longer responsible for local elections because kosovo declared independence from serbia . unmik has been responsible for organizing elections in kosovo ever since the former serbian province was put under international administration in 1999 and resolution 1244 was passed in the wake of nato 's bombing campaign against yugoslavia .
multi-ethnic country kosovo 's president , fatmir sejdiu , also rejects serbia carrying out elections in his county .
" serbia wants -lsb- the polls in kosovo -rsb- so that kosovar institutions are trampled underfoot .
we want citizens of serbian ethnicity to become part of our institutions .
that 's why these elections are unacceptable to us , and they wo n't have any validity . " kosovo 's citizens are hardly of one mind on the issue . " kosovo is an independent and sovereign state and serbian elections have no place in our country , " said kosovar albanian asan bitiqi . slobodan petkovic , a kosovo serb , looked toward the past : " unmik prevented neither parliamentary elections nor presidential elections in serbia , " he said .

" as already announced , we will make an active contribution to this consolidation , " said perlet , adding that the german banking industry was too fragmented . his comments came after allianz reported a 65-percent slump in first-quarter earnings following a first-quarter loss booked by dresdner in the wake of the global financial crisis . munich-based allianz said net profits dropped to 1.15 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- in the first-three months of the year following a 513-million-euros loss run up at its dresdner banking group . this followed a 64.5-percent drop in revenue at dresdner with the frankfurt-based bank writing down asset-backed securities by 845 million euros during the first quarter .
allianz shares dropped by 0.8 percent to 129.95 euros in early trading friday . " while 2008 will remain a challenging year , the longer this environment persists the harder it will also be to achieve our medium term outlook , " perlet said . dresdner split part of consolidation plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allianz could dismantle itself allianz plans to divide dresdner operations into two completely separate entities under a holding company to help it participate in the drive for consolidation in germany 's banking industry . the insurer 's push to break up dresdner comes about seven years after allianz acquired the bank as part of efforts by the insurance group to cash in on the then german government 's plans to promote private pension schemes . allianz 's plans for dresdner also come in the wake of media speculation that the insurer could be considering orchestrating a broad banking merger in germany . this could include the merger of dresdner with germany 's second biggest listed bank , commerzbank ag and deutsche postbank ag , the banking offshoot of the postal and logistic group , deutsche post ag . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" i urgently call on all parties to withdraw their armed factions , lay down their weapons and recognise the lebanese state 's exclusive right to use force , " steinmeier said in a statement .
" the developments of the last few days have shown that a resolution to the political conflict in lebanon can not wait any longer . "
at least 11 people have been killed and dozens more wounded in the civil unrest that erupted on thursday after hezbollah chief hassan nasrallah said a government crackdown on his iranian-backed shiite muslim group was a declaration of war .
power vacuum steinmeier noted that the parties represented in the lebanese parliament agreed months ago on a presidential candidate who would be acceptable for all .
" they are now called upon to finally end the vacuum at the top of the state leadership , " he said .
the lebanese parliament has not been able to agree on the make-up of the new cabinet .
as a consequence , 18 sessions of parliament to choose a new president have been cancelled .
germany has repeatedly called for a resolution to the crisis over the election of a lebanese president and accused syria of blocking the process and of contributing to rising tensions in the country .
profound crisis " the profound crisis in lebanon can only be resolved with dialogue and in the framework of institutions that are laid out in the constitution , " steinmeier said .
" part of this dialogue must be an agreement on disarming all the militias in lebanon , " he said .
german government spokesmen said there was constant contact between german diplomats and lebanese leaders , including seniora and lebanese house speaker nabih berri .
chancellor merkel , who maintains a close relationship with seniora , had not had direct contact with the premier " in recent days , " merkel 's spokesman thomas steg said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the world food program temporarily suspended aid but said two planes would deliver supplies saturday . the united nations estimated friday that the death toll could reach more than 100,000 in burma , a dramatic increase in the estimate of the devastation in the 55 townships in the country 's low-lying delta region delivered by cyclone nargis . by contrast , burma 's military government has estimated 23,000 dead and 40,000 people still missing .
an estimated 13 million people of myanmar 's population of 53 million live in areas hit by the cyclone . demanding that burma ease entry restrictions on aid workers , she told german news agency dpa she would phone un secretary-general ban ki-moon to ask the un security council to meet on the crisis , as requested by france .
the french move has been blocked by permanent member china , with the support of indonesia and other countries , which said they did not want the issue politicized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irrawaddy delta , in the country 's south , was devastated " in such a situation , it is utterly inexplicable to me that the military government is not letting into the country the desperately needed relief that has been offered , " she said in berlin on friday , may 9 . merkel appealed to burma 's neighbors and the association of south-east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- to use their influence on the country also known as myanmar . she said a " blockade " in the un security council against discussion of the issue was " irresponsible . " " i strongly appeal to the government to meet its responsibility to its people and to let world aid into the entire disaster area , " she said , adding she was shocked at the " appalling images of human suffering that have come here from myanmar . " the victims needed rapid assistance that germany was willing to provide along with others , she said .
germany doubles aid " the people in myanmar need the aid now , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an extraordinary meeting of the ministry 's humanitarian aid coordination committee on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the full extent of the damage is not yet known steinmeier said the damage done by cyclone nargis was likely to be even greater than that caused by the catastrophe caused by the devastating tsunami that upset southeast asia in 2004 . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul announced a doubling in emergency aid to the people of burma to 2 million euros -lrb- $ 3.1 million -rrb- .
the aid would be channeled through relief organizations and not the burmese government , she said , adding that some estimates said that up to 1.9 million people were in urgent need of assistance .
un food program suspends deliveries also on friday , the un world food program said the military regime had confiscated all foreign aid entering the country .
the organization suspended aid deliveries on friday but hours later said two more planes with food and water would land in burma on saturday . wfp spokesman paul risley said the organization stopped delivering assistance after the the last two deliveries of 38 tons ' worth of aid had been stopped at the airport .
he told the bbc that the aid was not reaching cyclone victims . " the world food program has decided to send in two relief flights as planned -lsb- saturday -rsb- , while discussions continue with the government of myanmar on the distribution of the food that was flown in -lsb- friday -rsb- , and not released to wfp , " nancy e. roman , wfp 's communications director , said in a statement . the white house welcomed news on friday that it could send one military cargo plane carrying supplies that reach burma on monday .

but a formal inquiry was being opened into whether he and other chief officers had committed any misdemeanour , which is a minor offence punishable by a fine , by failing in their duty to supervise the company 's affairs .
german law required executives to put " practicable organizational measures " in place to prevent crime , they added .
widespread corruption pierer , 67 , left siemens after revelations that sales executives used slush funds to bribe officials in greece , italy and other nations to purchase siemens telecommunications gear or machinery .
leaked allegations in recent weeks had suggested pierer may have been warned about the irregularities at the time .
the decision in munich was the conclusion of a preliminary inquiry that followed an interview by prosecutors with pierer on april 18 .
prosecutors said they would not disclose any other details .
preventing repeats the new chief executive of siemens , peter loescher , said in a news interview released on friday that the company had set up a system of checks to prevent any repeats and to punish any offenders .
" one can never rule out individual crookedness , " loescher told news magazine focus .
" but we have a system in place that makes broad-based misdeeds on the past scale impossible in the future . "

rsf called company executives to consider the implications of its brand being linked with human rights violations in china .
" adidas has a moral responsibility , " said rsf executive officer elke schaefter .
adidas chief executive herbert hainer said he took human rights very seriously , according to the text of his speech at the meeting .
he nevertheless criticized human rights organisations as " moralists who just emit rhetoric . "

the ceo of the international campaign for tibet in germany , kai mueller , said adidas should work on improving human rights in tibet .
the adidas chief , however , said that his company was combining profitable growth with social and environmental responsibility .
" i do n't think that what 's going on in china is good , " hainer said .
" but adidas has nothing to do with it . "
earlier this week , the brand with the three stripes reported a big jump in profits for the first quarter of 2008 , driven by double-digit growth in sales .
net income attributable to shareholders increased 32 percent from the same period a year ago to 169 million euros -lrb- $ 260 million -rrb- , the company said in a statement .
first-quarter sales in asia increased 25 percent on a currency-neutral basis , driven by particularly strong growth in china and korea , the company said .

but a formal inquiry was being opened into whether he and other chief officers had committed any misdemeanour , which is a minor offence punishable by a fine , by failing in their duty to supervise the company 's affairs .
german law required executives to put " practicable organizational measures " in place to prevent crime , they added .
widespread corruption pierer , 67 , left siemens after revelations that sales executives used slush funds to bribe officials in greece , italy and other nations to purchase siemens telecommunications gear or machinery .
leaked allegations in recent weeks had suggested pierer may have been warned about the irregularities at the time .
the decision in munich was the conclusion of a preliminary inquiry that followed an interview by prosecutors with pierer on april 18 .
prosecutors said they would not disclose any other details .
preventing repeats the new chief executive of siemens , peter loescher , said in a news interview released on friday that the company had set up a system of checks to prevent any repeats and to punish any offenders .
" one can never rule out individual crookedness , " loescher told news magazine focus .
" but we have a system in place that makes broad-based misdeeds on the past scale impossible in the future . "
siemens employs around 400,000 people around the world and makes a broad range of products including household appliances , medical equipment , trains , turbines and power stations . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead of protecting a witness on a plane , as he did in the film , flynn could be protecting a post office worker who has vital information on a local crime lord who is shipping in out-of-date kebab meat through the branch before distributing it across eastern germany . to add some kind of credibility , the film could be sold with the tagline : based on a -lrb- nearly -rrb- true story . taking its core premise from the events which actually happened in the eastern german city on friday , jackson 's character fritz could be the guy who discovered a package containing three live pythons ; two tiger pythons and an albino tiger python of more than 3 feet -lrb- 1 meter -rrb- in length . three pythons sent through german postal system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pythons ' arrival proved to be something of a shock the post office worker - who would provide the basis for jackson 's character - noticed one of the reptiles after it had apparently bit its way through the package .
assisted by a number of colleagues , he managed to catch it and put it into an empty box .
the other two pythons were discovered by police who soon arrived at the scene .
all three were then taken to a reptile house . police say they have put the package 's sender under investigation for possible violation of animal protection laws . of course , there would have to be a little artistic license involved in the hollywood version .
fritz and the potential whistle-blower could be working late alone at the depot when the snakes break out , intent on killing both of them and removing any threat to the crime lord 's rancid meat empire .
trying to escape , the deutsche post workers find that all the doors have been locked - and , to no one 's surprise - neither has a key . cue two hours of predictable plot twists , minimal scares and lots of close-ups of sam jackson wrestling obviously plastic snakes and there 's a hollywood blockbuster in the waiting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" as already announced , we will make an active contribution to this consolidation , " said perlet , adding that the german banking industry was too fragmented . his comments came after allianz reported a 65-percent slump in first-quarter earnings following a first-quarter loss booked by dresdner in the wake of the global financial crisis . munich-based allianz said net profits dropped to 1.15 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- in the first-three months of the year following a 513-million-euros loss run up at its dresdner banking group . this followed a 64.5-percent drop in revenue at dresdner with the frankfurt-based bank writing down asset-backed securities by 845 million euros during the first quarter .
allianz shares dropped by 0.8 percent to 129.95 euros in early trading friday .

instead of protecting a witness on a plane , as he did in the film , flynn could be protecting a post office worker who has vital information on a local crime lord who is shipping in out-of-date kebab meat through the branch before distributing it across eastern germany . to add some kind of credibility , the film could be sold with the tagline : based on a -lrb- nearly -rrb- true story . taking its core premise from the events which actually happened in the eastern german city on friday , jackson 's character fritz could be the guy who discovered a package containing three live pythons ; two tiger pythons and an albino tiger python of more than 3 feet -lrb- 1 meter -rrb- in length . three pythons sent through german postal system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pythons ' arrival proved to be something of a shock the post office worker - who would provide the basis for jackson 's character - noticed one of the reptiles after it had apparently bit its way through the package .
assisted by a number of colleagues , he managed to catch it and put it into an empty box .
the other two pythons were discovered by police who soon arrived at the scene .
all three were then taken to a reptile house . police say they have put the package 's sender under investigation for possible violation of animal protection laws . of course , there would have to be a little artistic license involved in the hollywood version .
fritz and the potential whistle-blower could be working late alone at the depot when the snakes break out , intent on killing both of them and removing any threat to the crime lord 's rancid meat empire .
trying to escape , the deutsche post workers find that all the doors have been locked - and , to no one 's surprise - neither has a key . cue two hours of predictable plot twists , minimal scares and lots of close-ups of sam jackson wrestling obviously plastic snakes and there 's a hollywood blockbuster in the waiting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead of protecting a witness on a plane , as he did in the film , flynn could be protecting a post office worker who has vital information on a local crime lord who is shipping in out-of-date kebab meat through the branch before distributing it across eastern germany . to add some kind of credibility , the film could be sold with the tagline : based on a -lrb- nearly -rrb- true story . taking its core premise from the events which actually happened in the eastern german city on friday , jackson 's character fritz could be the guy who discovered a package containing three live pythons ; two tiger pythons and an albino tiger python of more than 3 feet -lrb- 1 meter -rrb- in length . three pythons sent through german postal system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pythons ' arrival proved to be something of a shock the post office worker - who would provide the basis for jackson 's character - noticed one of the reptiles after it had apparently bit its way through the package .
assisted by a number of colleagues , he managed to catch it and put it into an empty box .
the other two pythons were discovered by police who soon arrived at the scene .
all three were then taken to a reptile house . police say they have put the package 's sender under investigation for possible violation of animal protection laws . of course , there would have to be a little artistic license involved in the hollywood version .
fritz and the potential whistle-blower could be working late alone at the depot when the snakes break out , intent on killing both of them and removing any threat to the crime lord 's rancid meat empire .
trying to escape , the deutsche post workers find that all the doors have been locked - and , to no one 's surprise - neither has a key . cue two hours of predictable plot twists , minimal scares and lots of close-ups of sam jackson wrestling obviously plastic snakes and there 's a hollywood blockbuster in the waiting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a formal inquiry was being opened into whether he and other chief officers had committed any misdemeanour , which is a minor offence punishable by a fine , by failing in their duty to supervise the company 's affairs .
german law required executives to put " practicable organizational measures " in place to prevent crime , they added .
widespread corruption pierer , 67 , left siemens after revelations that sales executives used slush funds to bribe officials in greece , italy and other nations to purchase siemens telecommunications gear or machinery .
leaked allegations in recent weeks had suggested pierer may have been warned about the irregularities at the time .
the decision in munich was the conclusion of a preliminary inquiry that followed an interview by prosecutors with pierer on april 18 .
prosecutors said they would not disclose any other details .
preventing repeats the new chief executive of siemens , peter loescher , said in a news interview released on friday that the company had set up a system of checks to prevent any repeats and to punish any offenders .
" one can never rule out individual crookedness , " loescher told news magazine focus .
" but we have a system in place that makes broad-based misdeeds on the past scale impossible in the future . "
siemens employs around 400,000 people around the world and makes a broad range of products including household appliances , medical equipment , trains , turbines and power stations . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision on thursday ratifies the proposal made by the european parliament 's constitutional affairs committee on tuesday , april 1 , in favor of the compulsory register for the lobbyists working to influence eu policies via the eu assembly , states and the bloc 's executive european commission .
the report , drafted by finnish conservative mep alexander stubb before he became finland 's foreign minister , also calls for a code of conduct and sanctions for those who flaunt it .
critics say the lobbyists have held far too much sway in the drafting of eu laws and measures concerning everything from blacklisting bad chemicals to deciding how to set carbon dioxide emission caps .
the eu assembly and member-states adopt laws that directly affect the daily lives of 490 million people .
the outcome of those laws can have a major impact on companies doing business in the 27-nation bloc .
register aims to end era of impunity many feel that the lobbyists have worked with impunity in the european capital , without having to provide any information on the dealings , financial status or partners in business and politics .
the new register aims to change this .
under the new rules , professional lobbyists would have to disclose in the register the importance of their major clients and the costs associated with lobbying , while ngos and think-tanks would be required to state their overall budgets and main funding sources .

" in the future , strict rules will apply to lobbying . "
siim kallas vice-president of the european commission responsible for administrative affairs , added that lobbyists had a role to play in brussels but they had to open up to regulated scrutiny .
“ pressure groups are legitimate and they also bring a lot of swing in the decision-making process , ” he said . “ but these things must be clear .
and , therefore , the european transparency initiative wants to bring light to this often dark chamber . ”
kallas added that the register would " give all lobbies the opportunity to demonstrate their strong commitment to the cause of transparency and the full legitimacy of their profession . "

the organization estimates that the lobbyists spend up to 1 billion euros -lsb- $ 1.5 billion -rsb- a year to influence decision-makers in brussels .
but even wesselius does n't know how many representations there actually are in the city .

" it 's not easy to confront ourselves because we are not the victims but we are the sons and daughters of the perpetrators , " organizer hans minow said .
" we say this knowing that perhaps our fathers and mothers - if not participated - did not do what they had to do when the crimes started , " he said .
the train 's arrival at auschwitz coincided with the 63rd anniversary of the end of the second world war in europe on may 8 , 1945 .
controversial exhibit the exhibit , which originated in the western german city of frankfurt in november , provoked controversy after the state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn refused permission for the train to stop in berlin 's gleaming new hauptbahnhof central station .
deutsche bahn said at the time that this would have caused major disruption to normal services .
the exhibition took place instead at ostbahnhof , the main train station of the former east berlin .
the train of commemoration foundation also complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally and that no one could use the tracks for free .
symbolic journey organizers said that more than 225,000 people viewed the exhibition during its six-month voyage .
detailing the fate of jewish children and teenagers deported by the nazis between october 1940 to december 1944 , the " memorial train " focuses on the biographies of several such children .
the organizers created an exhibit that symbolically travelled through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations after hearing of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .

the world food program temporarily suspended aid but said two planes would deliver supplies saturday . the united nations estimated friday that the death toll could reach more than 100,000 in burma , a dramatic increase in the estimate of the devastation in the 55 townships in the country 's low-lying delta region delivered by cyclone nargis . by contrast , burma 's military government has estimated 23,000 dead and 40,000 people still missing .
an estimated 13 million people of myanmar 's population of 53 million live in areas hit by the cyclone . demanding that burma ease entry restrictions on aid workers , she told german news agency dpa she would phone un secretary-general ban ki-moon to ask the un security council to meet on the crisis , as requested by france .
the french move has been blocked by permanent member china , with the support of indonesia and other countries , which said they did not want the issue politicized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irrawaddy delta , in the country 's south , was devastated " in such a situation , it is utterly inexplicable to me that the military government is not letting into the country the desperately needed relief that has been offered , " she said in berlin on friday , may 9 . merkel appealed to burma 's neighbors and the association of south-east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- to use their influence on the country also known as myanmar . she said a " blockade " in the un security council against discussion of the issue was " irresponsible . " " i strongly appeal to the government to meet its responsibility to its people and to let world aid into the entire disaster area , " she said , adding she was shocked at the " appalling images of human suffering that have come here from myanmar . " the victims needed rapid assistance that germany was willing to provide along with others , she said .
germany doubles aid " the people in myanmar need the aid now , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an extraordinary meeting of the ministry 's humanitarian aid coordination committee on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the full extent of the damage is not yet known steinmeier said the damage done by cyclone nargis was likely to be even greater than that caused by the catastrophe caused by the devastating tsunami that upset southeast asia in 2004 . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul announced a doubling in emergency aid to the people of burma to 2 million euros -lrb- $ 3.1 million -rrb- .
the aid would be channeled through relief organizations and not the burmese government , she said , adding that some estimates said that up to 1.9 million people were in urgent need of assistance .
un food program suspends deliveries also on friday , the un world food program said the military regime had confiscated all foreign aid entering the country .
the organization suspended aid deliveries on friday but hours later said two more planes with food and water would land in burma on saturday . wfp spokesman paul risley said the organization stopped delivering assistance after the the last two deliveries of 38 tons ' worth of aid had been stopped at the airport .
he told the bbc that the aid was not reaching cyclone victims . " the world food program has decided to send in two relief flights as planned -lsb- saturday -rsb- , while discussions continue with the government of myanmar on the distribution of the food that was flown in -lsb- friday -rsb- , and not released to wfp , " nancy e. roman , wfp 's communications director , said in a statement . the white house welcomed news on friday that it could send one military cargo plane carrying supplies that reach burma on monday . " one flight is much better than no flights , " said spokesman gordon johndroe , who told reporters us officials were trying to determine what supplies were most needed . earlier in the day , the german red cross had said it would continue efforts to dispatch a water purification plant , along with german aid experts , to the devastated area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany hope to push the un into action spokeswoman svenja koch said the organization planned to fly the equipment , which can provide 15,000 people with drinking water , from berlin next week .
she said that there had been an official request from the red cross in burma and that this might make it easier to gain permission . on thursday , steinmeier summoned the burmese ambassador to the foreign ministry . the minister told ambassador u tin win that berlin was " deeply concerned " and that " the government in myanmar is still standing in the way of effective cooperation in organizing assistance . " cyclone nargis left burma 's largest city , yangon , without electricity and water after it struck a week ago , causing untold damage to the fragile infrastructure and food supply . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu urges burma to ease aid delivery the european union and germany expressed concern thursday , may 8 , over the progress of aid sent to the victims of burma 's cyclone .
meanwhile un agencies were preparing to enter the country after experiencing delays .
-lrb- 08.05.2008 -rrb- information on international aid groups helping burma the following international organizations are involved in delivering aid and supplies to myanmar in the aftermath of a devastating cyclone that killed more than 20,000 people .

" i urgently call on all parties to withdraw their armed factions , lay down their weapons and recognise the lebanese state 's exclusive right to use force , " steinmeier said in a statement .

" as already announced , we will make an active contribution to this consolidation , " said perlet , adding that the german banking industry was too fragmented . his comments came after allianz reported a 65-percent slump in first-quarter earnings following a first-quarter loss booked by dresdner in the wake of the global financial crisis . munich-based allianz said net profits dropped to 1.15 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- in the first-three months of the year following a 513-million-euros loss run up at its dresdner banking group . this followed a 64.5-percent drop in revenue at dresdner with the frankfurt-based bank writing down asset-backed securities by 845 million euros during the first quarter .
allianz shares dropped by 0.8 percent to 129.95 euros in early trading friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 09.05.2008 european parliament moves to curb power of lobbyists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the handshakes which seal the deals around brussels will soon have to be documented the european parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favor of tightening rules regulating the 15,000 lobbyists that gravitate around the eu institutions . by an overwhelming majority , eu lawmakers adopted a report recommending a mandatory public register for lobbyists that seek to influence decisions at the european union 's institutions .
the decision on thursday ratifies the proposal made by the european parliament 's constitutional affairs committee on tuesday , april 1 , in favor of the compulsory register for the lobbyists working to influence eu policies via the eu assembly , states and the bloc 's executive european commission .
the report , drafted by finnish conservative mep alexander stubb before he became finland 's foreign minister , also calls for a code of conduct and sanctions for those who flaunt it .
critics say the lobbyists have held far too much sway in the drafting of eu laws and measures concerning everything from blacklisting bad chemicals to deciding how to set carbon dioxide emission caps .
the eu assembly and member-states adopt laws that directly affect the daily lives of 490 million people .
the outcome of those laws can have a major impact on companies doing business in the 27-nation bloc .
register aims to end era of impunity many feel that the lobbyists have worked with impunity in the european capital , without having to provide any information on the dealings , financial status or partners in business and politics .
the new register aims to change this .
under the new rules , professional lobbyists would have to disclose in the register the importance of their major clients and the costs associated with lobbying , while ngos and think-tanks would be required to state their overall budgets and main funding sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the register aims to shed light into lobbying 's dark corners " -lsb- the committee 's -rsb- report represents a decisive step for a new culture of transparency in brussels , " said german jo leinen , the constitutional affairs committee 's chairman .
" in the future , strict rules will apply to lobbying . "
siim kallas vice-president of the european commission responsible for administrative affairs , added that lobbyists had a role to play in brussels but they had to open up to regulated scrutiny .
“ pressure groups are legitimate and they also bring a lot of swing in the decision-making process , ” he said . “ but these things must be clear .
and , therefore , the european transparency initiative wants to bring light to this often dark chamber . ”
kallas added that the register would " give all lobbies the opportunity to demonstrate their strong commitment to the cause of transparency and the full legitimacy of their profession . "
european capital inundated by lobbyists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels comes second only to washington in lobbying brussels is notorious for its lobbying community which makes it one of the most saturated political capitals on the planet .
" after washington , brussels is the worlds ' largest lobbyists ' city , " said erik wesselius of the corporate europe observatory .
the amsterdam-based non-governmental organization observes the economic and political power of lobbyists .
the organization estimates that the lobbyists spend up to 1 billion euros -lsb- $ 1.5 billion -rsb- a year to influence decision-makers in brussels .
but even wesselius does n't know how many representations there actually are in the city .
estimates put the number of lobbyists in brussels at 15,000 while there are an estimated 2,500 lobby organizations working there , with some 5,000 lobbyists operating in the parliament alone .
lobbyists ready to ignore voluntary register wesselius believes the few of these individuals and organizations will be happy with the regulations pertaining to disclosure .
" many lobbyists have already indicated they will not register because they would have to reveal their clients and their income , " he said .
british liberal european parliamentarian diana wallis told reuters that she also had doubts .
" i have my doubts as to the effectiveness of a voluntary registration system but it is a first step and , in any case , there will be review of the register after a year , " she said .
unlike the european commission and the european council of member governments , only the european parliament currently has a voluntary register of lobbyists and a code of lobbying conduct , which has been in place for the past 10 years .
however , the commission is setting one up to be in place in june .
the new measures are hoped to be in place in time for european parliament elections in june 2009 .
once these new rules are implemented , we will have a real culture of transparency in brussels , " said german socialist eu lawmaker jo leinen .
critics accuse plan of not going far enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics complain of corporate lobbying at the eu however , green lawmakers and an anti-lobby lobby lamented that the measures were not even stronger , saying that they had been watered down with a loophole for lawyers .
" lawyers are exempted from the scope of rules , which , given all available evidence is absurd , " said italian green monica frassoni .

the decision on thursday ratifies the proposal made by the european parliament 's constitutional affairs committee on tuesday , april 1 , in favor of the compulsory register for the lobbyists working to influence eu policies via the eu assembly , states and the bloc 's executive european commission .
the report , drafted by finnish conservative mep alexander stubb before he became finland 's foreign minister , also calls for a code of conduct and sanctions for those who flaunt it .
critics say the lobbyists have held far too much sway in the drafting of eu laws and measures concerning everything from blacklisting bad chemicals to deciding how to set carbon dioxide emission caps .
the eu assembly and member-states adopt laws that directly affect the daily lives of 490 million people .
the outcome of those laws can have a major impact on companies doing business in the 27-nation bloc .
register aims to end era of impunity many feel that the lobbyists have worked with impunity in the european capital , without having to provide any information on the dealings , financial status or partners in business and politics .
the new register aims to change this .
under the new rules , professional lobbyists would have to disclose in the register the importance of their major clients and the costs associated with lobbying , while ngos and think-tanks would be required to state their overall budgets and main funding sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the register aims to shed light into lobbying 's dark corners " -lsb- the committee 's -rsb- report represents a decisive step for a new culture of transparency in brussels , " said german jo leinen , the constitutional affairs committee 's chairman .
" in the future , strict rules will apply to lobbying . "
siim kallas vice-president of the european commission responsible for administrative affairs , added that lobbyists had a role to play in brussels but they had to open up to regulated scrutiny .
“ pressure groups are legitimate and they also bring a lot of swing in the decision-making process , ” he said . “ but these things must be clear .
and , therefore , the european transparency initiative wants to bring light to this often dark chamber . ”
kallas added that the register would " give all lobbies the opportunity to demonstrate their strong commitment to the cause of transparency and the full legitimacy of their profession . "
european capital inundated by lobbyists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels comes second only to washington in lobbying brussels is notorious for its lobbying community which makes it one of the most saturated political capitals on the planet .

"
" i urgently call on all parties to withdraw their armed factions , lay down their weapons and recognise the lebanese state 's exclusive right to use force , " steinmeier said in a statement .
" the developments of the last few days have shown that a resolution to the political conflict in lebanon can not wait any longer . "
at least 11 people have been killed and dozens more wounded in the civil unrest that erupted on thursday after hezbollah chief hassan nasrallah said a government crackdown on his iranian-backed shiite muslim group was a declaration of war .

" they are now called upon to finally end the vacuum at the top of the state leadership , " he said .
the lebanese parliament has not been able to agree on the make-up of the new cabinet .
as a consequence , 18 sessions of parliament to choose a new president have been cancelled .
germany has repeatedly called for a resolution to the crisis over the election of a lebanese president and accused syria of blocking the process and of contributing to rising tensions in the country .
profound crisis " the profound crisis in lebanon can only be resolved with dialogue and in the framework of institutions that are laid out in the constitution , " steinmeier said .
" part of this dialogue must be an agreement on disarming all the militias in lebanon , " he said .
german government spokesmen said there was constant contact between german diplomats and lebanese leaders , including seniora and lebanese house speaker nabih berri .
chancellor merkel , who maintains a close relationship with seniora , had not had direct contact with the premier " in recent days , " merkel 's spokesman thomas steg said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" as already announced , we will make an active contribution to this consolidation , " said perlet , adding that the german banking industry was too fragmented . his comments came after allianz reported a 65-percent slump in first-quarter earnings following a first-quarter loss booked by dresdner in the wake of the global financial crisis . munich-based allianz said net profits dropped to 1.15 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- in the first-three months of the year following a 513-million-euros loss run up at its dresdner banking group . this followed a 64.5-percent drop in revenue at dresdner with the frankfurt-based bank writing down asset-backed securities by 845 million euros during the first quarter .
allianz shares dropped by 0.8 percent to 129.95 euros in early trading friday . " while 2008 will remain a challenging year , the longer this environment persists the harder it will also be to achieve our medium term outlook , " perlet said . dresdner split part of consolidation plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allianz could dismantle itself allianz plans to divide dresdner operations into two completely separate entities under a holding company to help it participate in the drive for consolidation in germany 's banking industry . the insurer 's push to break up dresdner comes about seven years after allianz acquired the bank as part of efforts by the insurance group to cash in on the then german government 's plans to promote private pension schemes . allianz 's plans for dresdner also come in the wake of media speculation that the insurer could be considering orchestrating a broad banking merger in germany . this could include the merger of dresdner with germany 's second biggest listed bank , commerzbank ag and deutsche postbank ag , the banking offshoot of the postal and logistic group , deutsche post ag . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" i urgently call on all parties to withdraw their armed factions , lay down their weapons and recognise the lebanese state 's exclusive right to use force , " steinmeier said in a statement .
" the developments of the last few days have shown that a resolution to the political conflict in lebanon can not wait any longer . "

" they are now called upon to finally end the vacuum at the top of the state leadership , " he said .
the lebanese parliament has not been able to agree on the make-up of the new cabinet .
as a consequence , 18 sessions of parliament to choose a new president have been cancelled .
germany has repeatedly called for a resolution to the crisis over the election of a lebanese president and accused syria of blocking the process and of contributing to rising tensions in the country .
profound crisis " the profound crisis in lebanon can only be resolved with dialogue and in the framework of institutions that are laid out in the constitution , " steinmeier said .
" part of this dialogue must be an agreement on disarming all the militias in lebanon , " he said .
german government spokesmen said there was constant contact between german diplomats and lebanese leaders , including seniora and lebanese house speaker nabih berri .
chancellor merkel , who maintains a close relationship with seniora , had not had direct contact with the premier " in recent days , " merkel 's spokesman thomas steg said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

serbs in kosovo have also been called on to vote in their electoral districts .
but those districts are now located in a different country - kosovo - under un administration . if belgrade gets its wish , kosovo 's serbs will be able to vote in serbian parliamentary and local elections on sunday , may 11 .
serbian citizens who live in kosovo - or anywhere else for that matter - have the right to vote just as those who live in the country do .
but there 's a catch : serbia wants to hold elections in kosovo . the un interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- , which oversees the former serbian administration , rejects the idea , as do kosovar albanians , who see belgrade as undermining their institutions . serbian state local elections in kosovo would not be recognized and would even be counterproductive if they were n't organized by unmik , according to oliver ivanovic , head of the serb list for kosovo and metohija , one of the main parliamentary parties in kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only unmik , under joachim ruecker , may organize elections in kosovo " these polls will lead to controversy right from the beginning , because they are n't well prepared technically , " he said . the voter registers of kosovo serbs were from 1996 , he said , adding that : " our estimates show that more than 200,000 serbs and non-albanians have moved away in the meantime . " " the credibility of these elections is arguable , because according to un security council resolution 1244 , the international community alone is authorized to organize elections on a local or provincial level on kosovar territory , " ivanovic said . unmik calls the shots it was clear that resolution 1244 allowed only unmik to organize elections , said nebojsa jovic , head of the executive committee of the serb national council in mitrovica , which aims to defend the interests of the serb minority .
and it was " certainly desirable that the elections were in this way recognized as entirely legitimate by unmik , " jovic said .
" but we 're in a strange situation in which unmik head joachim ruecker and the international administration declare they will not recognize the local elections .
they have to give good reasons for that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo declared independence on feb .
17 the reasons they give are that belgrade is no longer responsible for local elections because kosovo declared independence from serbia . unmik has been responsible for organizing elections in kosovo ever since the former serbian province was put under international administration in 1999 and resolution 1244 was passed in the wake of nato 's bombing campaign against yugoslavia .
multi-ethnic country kosovo 's president , fatmir sejdiu , also rejects serbia carrying out elections in his county .
" serbia wants -lsb- the polls in kosovo -rsb- so that kosovar institutions are trampled underfoot .
we want citizens of serbian ethnicity to become part of our institutions .
that 's why these elections are unacceptable to us , and they wo n't have any validity . " kosovo 's citizens are hardly of one mind on the issue .

the world food program temporarily suspended aid but said two planes would deliver supplies saturday . the united nations estimated friday that the death toll could reach more than 100,000 in burma , a dramatic increase in the estimate of the devastation in the 55 townships in the country 's low-lying delta region delivered by cyclone nargis . by contrast , burma 's military government has estimated 23,000 dead and 40,000 people still missing .
an estimated 13 million people of myanmar 's population of 53 million live in areas hit by the cyclone . demanding that burma ease entry restrictions on aid workers , she told german news agency dpa she would phone un secretary-general ban ki-moon to ask the un security council to meet on the crisis , as requested by france .
the french move has been blocked by permanent member china , with the support of indonesia and other countries , which said they did not want the issue politicized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irrawaddy delta , in the country 's south , was devastated " in such a situation , it is utterly inexplicable to me that the military government is not letting into the country the desperately needed relief that has been offered , " she said in berlin on friday , may 9 . merkel appealed to burma 's neighbors and the association of south-east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- to use their influence on the country also known as myanmar . she said a " blockade " in the un security council against discussion of the issue was " irresponsible . " " i strongly appeal to the government to meet its responsibility to its people and to let world aid into the entire disaster area , " she said , adding she was shocked at the " appalling images of human suffering that have come here from myanmar . " the victims needed rapid assistance that germany was willing to provide along with others , she said .
germany doubles aid " the people in myanmar need the aid now , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an extraordinary meeting of the ministry 's humanitarian aid coordination committee on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the full extent of the damage is not yet known steinmeier said the damage done by cyclone nargis was likely to be even greater than that caused by the catastrophe caused by the devastating tsunami that upset southeast asia in 2004 . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul announced a doubling in emergency aid to the people of burma to 2 million euros -lrb- $ 3.1 million -rrb- .
the aid would be channeled through relief organizations and not the burmese government , she said , adding that some estimates said that up to 1.9 million people were in urgent need of assistance .
un food program suspends deliveries also on friday , the un world food program said the military regime had confiscated all foreign aid entering the country .
the organization suspended aid deliveries on friday but hours later said two more planes with food and water would land in burma on saturday . wfp spokesman paul risley said the organization stopped delivering assistance after the the last two deliveries of 38 tons ' worth of aid had been stopped at the airport .
he told the bbc that the aid was not reaching cyclone victims . " the world food program has decided to send in two relief flights as planned -lsb- saturday -rsb- , while discussions continue with the government of myanmar on the distribution of the food that was flown in -lsb- friday -rsb- , and not released to wfp , " nancy e. roman , wfp 's communications director , said in a statement . the white house welcomed news on friday that it could send one military cargo plane carrying supplies that reach burma on monday . " one flight is much better than no flights , " said spokesman gordon johndroe , who told reporters us officials were trying to determine what supplies were most needed . earlier in the day , the german red cross had said it would continue efforts to dispatch a water purification plant , along with german aid experts , to the devastated area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany hope to push the un into action spokeswoman svenja koch said the organization planned to fly the equipment , which can provide 15,000 people with drinking water , from berlin next week .
she said that there had been an official request from the red cross in burma and that this might make it easier to gain permission . on thursday , steinmeier summoned the burmese ambassador to the foreign ministry . the minister told ambassador u tin win that berlin was " deeply concerned " and that " the government in myanmar is still standing in the way of effective cooperation in organizing assistance . " cyclone nargis left burma 's largest city , yangon , without electricity and water after it struck a week ago , causing untold damage to the fragile infrastructure and food supply . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a formal inquiry was being opened into whether he and other chief officers had committed any misdemeanour , which is a minor offence punishable by a fine , by failing in their duty to supervise the company 's affairs .
german law required executives to put " practicable organizational measures " in place to prevent crime , they added .
widespread corruption pierer , 67 , left siemens after revelations that sales executives used slush funds to bribe officials in greece , italy and other nations to purchase siemens telecommunications gear or machinery .
leaked allegations in recent weeks had suggested pierer may have been warned about the irregularities at the time .
the decision in munich was the conclusion of a preliminary inquiry that followed an interview by prosecutors with pierer on april 18 .
prosecutors said they would not disclose any other details .
preventing repeats the new chief executive of siemens , peter loescher , said in a news interview released on friday that the company had set up a system of checks to prevent any repeats and to punish any offenders .
" one can never rule out individual crookedness , " loescher told news magazine focus .
" but we have a system in place that makes broad-based misdeeds on the past scale impossible in the future . "
siemens employs around 400,000 people around the world and makes a broad range of products including household appliances , medical equipment , trains , turbines and power stations . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead of protecting a witness on a plane , as he did in the film , flynn could be protecting a post office worker who has vital information on a local crime lord who is shipping in out-of-date kebab meat through the branch before distributing it across eastern germany . to add some kind of credibility , the film could be sold with the tagline : based on a -lrb- nearly -rrb- true story . taking its core premise from the events which actually happened in the eastern german city on friday , jackson 's character fritz could be the guy who discovered a package containing three live pythons ; two tiger pythons and an albino tiger python of more than 3 feet -lrb- 1 meter -rrb- in length . three pythons sent through german postal system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pythons ' arrival proved to be something of a shock the post office worker - who would provide the basis for jackson 's character - noticed one of the reptiles after it had apparently bit its way through the package .
assisted by a number of colleagues , he managed to catch it and put it into an empty box .
the other two pythons were discovered by police who soon arrived at the scene .
all three were then taken to a reptile house . police say they have put the package 's sender under investigation for possible violation of animal protection laws . of course , there would have to be a little artistic license involved in the hollywood version .
fritz and the potential whistle-blower could be working late alone at the depot when the snakes break out , intent on killing both of them and removing any threat to the crime lord 's rancid meat empire .
trying to escape , the deutsche post workers find that all the doors have been locked - and , to no one 's surprise - neither has a key . cue two hours of predictable plot twists , minimal scares and lots of close-ups of sam jackson wrestling obviously plastic snakes and there 's a hollywood blockbuster in the waiting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the world food program temporarily suspended aid but said two planes would deliver supplies saturday . the united nations estimated friday that the death toll could reach more than 100,000 in burma , a dramatic increase in the estimate of the devastation in the 55 townships in the country 's low-lying delta region delivered by cyclone nargis . by contrast , burma 's military government has estimated 23,000 dead and 40,000 people still missing .
an estimated 13 million people of myanmar 's population of 53 million live in areas hit by the cyclone . demanding that burma ease entry restrictions on aid workers , she told german news agency dpa she would phone un secretary-general ban ki-moon to ask the un security council to meet on the crisis , as requested by france .
the french move has been blocked by permanent member china , with the support of indonesia and other countries , which said they did not want the issue politicized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irrawaddy delta , in the country 's south , was devastated " in such a situation , it is utterly inexplicable to me that the military government is not letting into the country the desperately needed relief that has been offered , " she said in berlin on friday , may 9 . merkel appealed to burma 's neighbors and the association of south-east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- to use their influence on the country also known as myanmar . she said a " blockade " in the un security council against discussion of the issue was " irresponsible . " " i strongly appeal to the government to meet its responsibility to its people and to let world aid into the entire disaster area , " she said , adding she was shocked at the " appalling images of human suffering that have come here from myanmar . " the victims needed rapid assistance that germany was willing to provide along with others , she said .
germany doubles aid " the people in myanmar need the aid now , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an extraordinary meeting of the ministry 's humanitarian aid coordination committee on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the full extent of the damage is not yet known steinmeier said the damage done by cyclone nargis was likely to be even greater than that caused by the catastrophe caused by the devastating tsunami that upset southeast asia in 2004 . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul announced a doubling in emergency aid to the people of burma to 2 million euros -lrb- $ 3.1 million -rrb- .
the aid would be channeled through relief organizations and not the burmese government , she said , adding that some estimates said that up to 1.9 million people were in urgent need of assistance .
un food program suspends deliveries also on friday , the un world food program said the military regime had confiscated all foreign aid entering the country .
the organization suspended aid deliveries on friday but hours later said two more planes with food and water would land in burma on saturday . wfp spokesman paul risley said the organization stopped delivering assistance after the the last two deliveries of 38 tons ' worth of aid had been stopped at the airport .
he told the bbc that the aid was not reaching cyclone victims . " the world food program has decided to send in two relief flights as planned -lsb- saturday -rsb- , while discussions continue with the government of myanmar on the distribution of the food that was flown in -lsb- friday -rsb- , and not released to wfp , " nancy e. roman , wfp 's communications director , said in a statement . the white house welcomed news on friday that it could send one military cargo plane carrying supplies that reach burma on monday . " one flight is much better than no flights , " said spokesman gordon johndroe , who told reporters us officials were trying to determine what supplies were most needed . earlier in the day , the german red cross had said it would continue efforts to dispatch a water purification plant , along with german aid experts , to the devastated area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany hope to push the un into action spokeswoman svenja koch said the organization planned to fly the equipment , which can provide 15,000 people with drinking water , from berlin next week .
she said that there had been an official request from the red cross in burma and that this might make it easier to gain permission . on thursday , steinmeier summoned the burmese ambassador to the foreign ministry . the minister told ambassador u tin win that berlin was " deeply concerned " and that " the government in myanmar is still standing in the way of effective cooperation in organizing assistance . " cyclone nargis left burma 's largest city , yangon , without electricity and water after it struck a week ago , causing untold damage to the fragile infrastructure and food supply . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

serbs in kosovo have also been called on to vote in their electoral districts .
but those districts are now located in a different country - kosovo - under un administration . if belgrade gets its wish , kosovo 's serbs will be able to vote in serbian parliamentary and local elections on sunday , may 11 .
serbian citizens who live in kosovo - or anywhere else for that matter - have the right to vote just as those who live in the country do .
but there 's a catch : serbia wants to hold elections in kosovo . the un interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- , which oversees the former serbian administration , rejects the idea , as do kosovar albanians , who see belgrade as undermining their institutions . serbian state local elections in kosovo would not be recognized and would even be counterproductive if they were n't organized by unmik , according to oliver ivanovic , head of the serb list for kosovo and metohija , one of the main parliamentary parties in kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only unmik , under joachim ruecker , may organize elections in kosovo " these polls will lead to controversy right from the beginning , because they are n't well prepared technically , " he said . the voter registers of kosovo serbs were from 1996 , he said , adding that : " our estimates show that more than 200,000 serbs and non-albanians have moved away in the meantime . " " the credibility of these elections is arguable , because according to un security council resolution 1244 , the international community alone is authorized to organize elections on a local or provincial level on kosovar territory , " ivanovic said . unmik calls the shots it was clear that resolution 1244 allowed only unmik to organize elections , said nebojsa jovic , head of the executive committee of the serb national council in mitrovica , which aims to defend the interests of the serb minority .
and it was " certainly desirable that the elections were in this way recognized as entirely legitimate by unmik , " jovic said .
" but we 're in a strange situation in which unmik head joachim ruecker and the international administration declare they will not recognize the local elections .
they have to give good reasons for that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo declared independence on feb .
17 the reasons they give are that belgrade is no longer responsible for local elections because kosovo declared independence from serbia . unmik has been responsible for organizing elections in kosovo ever since the former serbian province was put under international administration in 1999 and resolution 1244 was passed in the wake of nato 's bombing campaign against yugoslavia .
multi-ethnic country kosovo 's president , fatmir sejdiu , also rejects serbia carrying out elections in his county .
" serbia wants -lsb- the polls in kosovo -rsb- so that kosovar institutions are trampled underfoot .
we want citizens of serbian ethnicity to become part of our institutions .
that 's why these elections are unacceptable to us , and they wo n't have any validity . " kosovo 's citizens are hardly of one mind on the issue . " kosovo is an independent and sovereign state and serbian elections have no place in our country , " said kosovar albanian asan bitiqi . slobodan petkovic , a kosovo serb , looked toward the past : " unmik prevented neither parliamentary elections nor presidential elections in serbia , " he said .

" it 's not easy to confront ourselves because we are not the victims but we are the sons and daughters of the perpetrators , " organizer hans minow said .
" we say this knowing that perhaps our fathers and mothers - if not participated - did not do what they had to do when the crimes started , " he said .
the train 's arrival at auschwitz coincided with the 63rd anniversary of the end of the second world war in europe on may 8 , 1945 .
controversial exhibit the exhibit , which originated in the western german city of frankfurt in november , provoked controversy after the state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn refused permission for the train to stop in berlin 's gleaming new hauptbahnhof central station .
deutsche bahn said at the time that this would have caused major disruption to normal services .
the exhibition took place instead at ostbahnhof , the main train station of the former east berlin .
the train of commemoration foundation also complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally and that no one could use the tracks for free .
symbolic journey organizers said that more than 225,000 people viewed the exhibition during its six-month voyage .
detailing the fate of jewish children and teenagers deported by the nazis between october 1940 to december 1944 , the " memorial train " focuses on the biographies of several such children .
the organizers created an exhibit that symbolically travelled through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations after hearing of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the initiative was also intended to encourage visitors to search for traces of jewish people who had vanished from their towns or region during the war . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's not easy to confront ourselves because we are not the victims but we are the sons and daughters of the perpetrators , " organizer hans minow said .
" we say this knowing that perhaps our fathers and mothers - if not participated - did not do what they had to do when the crimes started , " he said .
the train 's arrival at auschwitz coincided with the 63rd anniversary of the end of the second world war in europe on may 8 , 1945 .
controversial exhibit the exhibit , which originated in the western german city of frankfurt in november , provoked controversy after the state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn refused permission for the train to stop in berlin 's gleaming new hauptbahnhof central station .
deutsche bahn said at the time that this would have caused major disruption to normal services .
the exhibition took place instead at ostbahnhof , the main train station of the former east berlin .
the train of commemoration foundation also complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally and that no one could use the tracks for free .

the world food program temporarily suspended aid but said two planes would deliver supplies saturday . the united nations estimated friday that the death toll could reach more than 100,000 in burma , a dramatic increase in the estimate of the devastation in the 55 townships in the country 's low-lying delta region delivered by cyclone nargis . by contrast , burma 's military government has estimated 23,000 dead and 40,000 people still missing .
an estimated 13 million people of myanmar 's population of 53 million live in areas hit by the cyclone . demanding that burma ease entry restrictions on aid workers , she told german news agency dpa she would phone un secretary-general ban ki-moon to ask the un security council to meet on the crisis , as requested by france .
the french move has been blocked by permanent member china , with the support of indonesia and other countries , which said they did not want the issue politicized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irrawaddy delta , in the country 's south , was devastated " in such a situation , it is utterly inexplicable to me that the military government is not letting into the country the desperately needed relief that has been offered , " she said in berlin on friday , may 9 . merkel appealed to burma 's neighbors and the association of south-east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- to use their influence on the country also known as myanmar . she said a " blockade " in the un security council against discussion of the issue was " irresponsible . " " i strongly appeal to the government to meet its responsibility to its people and to let world aid into the entire disaster area , " she said , adding she was shocked at the " appalling images of human suffering that have come here from myanmar . " the victims needed rapid assistance that germany was willing to provide along with others , she said .
germany doubles aid " the people in myanmar need the aid now , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an extraordinary meeting of the ministry 's humanitarian aid coordination committee on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the full extent of the damage is not yet known steinmeier said the damage done by cyclone nargis was likely to be even greater than that caused by the catastrophe caused by the devastating tsunami that upset southeast asia in 2004 . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul announced a doubling in emergency aid to the people of burma to 2 million euros -lrb- $ 3.1 million -rrb- .
the aid would be channeled through relief organizations and not the burmese government , she said , adding that some estimates said that up to 1.9 million people were in urgent need of assistance .
un food program suspends deliveries also on friday , the un world food program said the military regime had confiscated all foreign aid entering the country .
the organization suspended aid deliveries on friday but hours later said two more planes with food and water would land in burma on saturday . wfp spokesman paul risley said the organization stopped delivering assistance after the the last two deliveries of 38 tons ' worth of aid had been stopped at the airport .
he told the bbc that the aid was not reaching cyclone victims . " the world food program has decided to send in two relief flights as planned -lsb- saturday -rsb- , while discussions continue with the government of myanmar on the distribution of the food that was flown in -lsb- friday -rsb- , and not released to wfp , " nancy e. roman , wfp 's communications director , said in a statement . the white house welcomed news on friday that it could send one military cargo plane carrying supplies that reach burma on monday . " one flight is much better than no flights , " said spokesman gordon johndroe , who told reporters us officials were trying to determine what supplies were most needed . earlier in the day , the german red cross had said it would continue efforts to dispatch a water purification plant , along with german aid experts , to the devastated area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany hope to push the un into action spokeswoman svenja koch said the organization planned to fly the equipment , which can provide 15,000 people with drinking water , from berlin next week .
she said that there had been an official request from the red cross in burma and that this might make it easier to gain permission . on thursday , steinmeier summoned the burmese ambassador to the foreign ministry . the minister told ambassador u tin win that berlin was " deeply concerned " and that " the government in myanmar is still standing in the way of effective cooperation in organizing assistance . " cyclone nargis left burma 's largest city , yangon , without electricity and water after it struck a week ago , causing untold damage to the fragile infrastructure and food supply . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead of protecting a witness on a plane , as he did in the film , flynn could be protecting a post office worker who has vital information on a local crime lord who is shipping in out-of-date kebab meat through the branch before distributing it across eastern germany . to add some kind of credibility , the film could be sold with the tagline : based on a -lrb- nearly -rrb- true story . taking its core premise from the events which actually happened in the eastern german city on friday , jackson 's character fritz could be the guy who discovered a package containing three live pythons ; two tiger pythons and an albino tiger python of more than 3 feet -lrb- 1 meter -rrb- in length . three pythons sent through german postal system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pythons ' arrival proved to be something of a shock the post office worker - who would provide the basis for jackson 's character - noticed one of the reptiles after it had apparently bit its way through the package .
assisted by a number of colleagues , he managed to catch it and put it into an empty box .
the other two pythons were discovered by police who soon arrived at the scene .

" it 's not easy to confront ourselves because we are not the victims but we are the sons and daughters of the perpetrators , " organizer hans minow said .
" we say this knowing that perhaps our fathers and mothers - if not participated - did not do what they had to do when the crimes started , " he said .
the train 's arrival at auschwitz coincided with the 63rd anniversary of the end of the second world war in europe on may 8 , 1945 .
controversial exhibit the exhibit , which originated in the western german city of frankfurt in november , provoked controversy after the state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn refused permission for the train to stop in berlin 's gleaming new hauptbahnhof central station .
deutsche bahn said at the time that this would have caused major disruption to normal services .
the exhibition took place instead at ostbahnhof , the main train station of the former east berlin .
the train of commemoration foundation also complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally and that no one could use the tracks for free .
symbolic journey organizers said that more than 225,000 people viewed the exhibition during its six-month voyage .
detailing the fate of jewish children and teenagers deported by the nazis between october 1940 to december 1944 , the " memorial train " focuses on the biographies of several such children .
the organizers created an exhibit that symbolically travelled through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations after hearing of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the initiative was also intended to encourage visitors to search for traces of jewish people who had vanished from their towns or region during the war . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's not easy to confront ourselves because we are not the victims but we are the sons and daughters of the perpetrators , " organizer hans minow said .
" we say this knowing that perhaps our fathers and mothers - if not participated - did not do what they had to do when the crimes started , " he said .
the train 's arrival at auschwitz coincided with the 63rd anniversary of the end of the second world war in europe on may 8 , 1945 .

the exhibition took place instead at ostbahnhof , the main train station of the former east berlin .
the train of commemoration foundation also complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .

instead of protecting a witness on a plane , as he did in the film , flynn could be protecting a post office worker who has vital information on a local crime lord who is shipping in out-of-date kebab meat through the branch before distributing it across eastern germany . to add some kind of credibility , the film could be sold with the tagline : based on a -lrb- nearly -rrb- true story . taking its core premise from the events which actually happened in the eastern german city on friday , jackson 's character fritz could be the guy who discovered a package containing three live pythons ; two tiger pythons and an albino tiger python of more than 3 feet -lrb- 1 meter -rrb- in length . three pythons sent through german postal system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pythons ' arrival proved to be something of a shock the post office worker - who would provide the basis for jackson 's character - noticed one of the reptiles after it had apparently bit its way through the package .
assisted by a number of colleagues , he managed to catch it and put it into an empty box .
the other two pythons were discovered by police who soon arrived at the scene .
all three were then taken to a reptile house . police say they have put the package 's sender under investigation for possible violation of animal protection laws . of course , there would have to be a little artistic license involved in the hollywood version .
fritz and the potential whistle-blower could be working late alone at the depot when the snakes break out , intent on killing both of them and removing any threat to the crime lord 's rancid meat empire .
trying to escape , the deutsche post workers find that all the doors have been locked - and , to no one 's surprise - neither has a key . cue two hours of predictable plot twists , minimal scares and lots of close-ups of sam jackson wrestling obviously plastic snakes and there 's a hollywood blockbuster in the waiting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rsf called company executives to consider the implications of its brand being linked with human rights violations in china .
" adidas has a moral responsibility , " said rsf executive officer elke schaefter .
adidas chief executive herbert hainer said he took human rights very seriously , according to the text of his speech at the meeting .

" but adidas has nothing to do with it . "

first-quarter sales in asia increased 25 percent on a currency-neutral basis , driven by particularly strong growth in china and korea , the company said .

serbs in kosovo have also been called on to vote in their electoral districts .
but those districts are now located in a different country - kosovo - under un administration . if belgrade gets its wish , kosovo 's serbs will be able to vote in serbian parliamentary and local elections on sunday , may 11 .
serbian citizens who live in kosovo - or anywhere else for that matter - have the right to vote just as those who live in the country do .
but there 's a catch : serbia wants to hold elections in kosovo . the un interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- , which oversees the former serbian administration , rejects the idea , as do kosovar albanians , who see belgrade as undermining their institutions . serbian state local elections in kosovo would not be recognized and would even be counterproductive if they were n't organized by unmik , according to oliver ivanovic , head of the serb list for kosovo and metohija , one of the main parliamentary parties in kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only unmik , under joachim ruecker , may organize elections in kosovo " these polls will lead to controversy right from the beginning , because they are n't well prepared technically , " he said . the voter registers of kosovo serbs were from 1996 , he said , adding that : " our estimates show that more than 200,000 serbs and non-albanians have moved away in the meantime .

serbs in kosovo have also been called on to vote in their electoral districts .
but those districts are now located in a different country - kosovo - under un administration . if belgrade gets its wish , kosovo 's serbs will be able to vote in serbian parliamentary and local elections on sunday , may 11 .
serbian citizens who live in kosovo - or anywhere else for that matter - have the right to vote just as those who live in the country do .
but there 's a catch : serbia wants to hold elections in kosovo . the un interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- , which oversees the former serbian administration , rejects the idea , as do kosovar albanians , who see belgrade as undermining their institutions . serbian state local elections in kosovo would not be recognized and would even be counterproductive if they were n't organized by unmik , according to oliver ivanovic , head of the serb list for kosovo and metohija , one of the main parliamentary parties in kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only unmik , under joachim ruecker , may organize elections in kosovo " these polls will lead to controversy right from the beginning , because they are n't well prepared technically , " he said . the voter registers of kosovo serbs were from 1996 , he said , adding that : " our estimates show that more than 200,000 serbs and non-albanians have moved away in the meantime .

the decision on thursday ratifies the proposal made by the european parliament 's constitutional affairs committee on tuesday , april 1 , in favor of the compulsory register for the lobbyists working to influence eu policies via the eu assembly , states and the bloc 's executive european commission .
the report , drafted by finnish conservative mep alexander stubb before he became finland 's foreign minister , also calls for a code of conduct and sanctions for those who flaunt it .
critics say the lobbyists have held far too much sway in the drafting of eu laws and measures concerning everything from blacklisting bad chemicals to deciding how to set carbon dioxide emission caps .
the eu assembly and member-states adopt laws that directly affect the daily lives of 490 million people .
the outcome of those laws can have a major impact on companies doing business in the 27-nation bloc .
register aims to end era of impunity many feel that the lobbyists have worked with impunity in the european capital , without having to provide any information on the dealings , financial status or partners in business and politics .
the new register aims to change this .
under the new rules , professional lobbyists would have to disclose in the register the importance of their major clients and the costs associated with lobbying , while ngos and think-tanks would be required to state their overall budgets and main funding sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the register aims to shed light into lobbying 's dark corners " -lsb- the committee 's -rsb- report represents a decisive step for a new culture of transparency in brussels , " said german jo leinen , the constitutional affairs committee 's chairman .
" in the future , strict rules will apply to lobbying . "
siim kallas vice-president of the european commission responsible for administrative affairs , added that lobbyists had a role to play in brussels but they had to open up to regulated scrutiny .
“ pressure groups are legitimate and they also bring a lot of swing in the decision-making process , ” he said . “ but these things must be clear .
and , therefore , the european transparency initiative wants to bring light to this often dark chamber . ”
kallas added that the register would " give all lobbies the opportunity to demonstrate their strong commitment to the cause of transparency and the full legitimacy of their profession . "
european capital inundated by lobbyists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels comes second only to washington in lobbying brussels is notorious for its lobbying community which makes it one of the most saturated political capitals on the planet .
" after washington , brussels is the worlds ' largest lobbyists ' city , " said erik wesselius of the corporate europe observatory .
the amsterdam-based non-governmental organization observes the economic and political power of lobbyists .
the organization estimates that the lobbyists spend up to 1 billion euros -lsb- $ 1.5 billion -rsb- a year to influence decision-makers in brussels .
but even wesselius does n't know how many representations there actually are in the city .
estimates put the number of lobbyists in brussels at 15,000 while there are an estimated 2,500 lobby organizations working there , with some 5,000 lobbyists operating in the parliament alone .
lobbyists ready to ignore voluntary register wesselius believes the few of these individuals and organizations will be happy with the regulations pertaining to disclosure .
" many lobbyists have already indicated they will not register because they would have to reveal their clients and their income , " he said .
british liberal european parliamentarian diana wallis told reuters that she also had doubts .
" i have my doubts as to the effectiveness of a voluntary registration system but it is a first step and , in any case , there will be review of the register after a year , " she said .
unlike the european commission and the european council of member governments , only the european parliament currently has a voluntary register of lobbyists and a code of lobbying conduct , which has been in place for the past 10 years .
however , the commission is setting one up to be in place in june .
the new measures are hoped to be in place in time for european parliament elections in june 2009 .
once these new rules are implemented , we will have a real culture of transparency in brussels , " said german socialist eu lawmaker jo leinen .
critics accuse plan of not going far enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics complain of corporate lobbying at the eu however , green lawmakers and an anti-lobby lobby lamented that the measures were not even stronger , saying that they had been watered down with a loophole for lawyers .
" lawyers are exempted from the scope of rules , which , given all available evidence is absurd , " said italian green monica frassoni .
" lawyers play an increasingly important role in influencing policy in brussels and they promote themselves as such on their own websites . "
the alliance for lobbying transparency and ethics regulation also said the loophole for lawyers was the work of conservative lawmaker klaus-heiner lehne , who himself is a partner at law firm taylor wessing , specialized in eu law .
" this outcome shows the need for the parliament to clean up its own house and introduce strong rules to prevent conflicts of interest , " said paul de clerck with environmentalist campaigners friends of the earth europe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision on thursday ratifies the proposal made by the european parliament 's constitutional affairs committee on tuesday , april 1 , in favor of the compulsory register for the lobbyists working to influence eu policies via the eu assembly , states and the bloc 's executive european commission .
the report , drafted by finnish conservative mep alexander stubb before he became finland 's foreign minister , also calls for a code of conduct and sanctions for those who flaunt it .
critics say the lobbyists have held far too much sway in the drafting of eu laws and measures concerning everything from blacklisting bad chemicals to deciding how to set carbon dioxide emission caps .
the eu assembly and member-states adopt laws that directly affect the daily lives of 490 million people .
the outcome of those laws can have a major impact on companies doing business in the 27-nation bloc .
register aims to end era of impunity many feel that the lobbyists have worked with impunity in the european capital , without having to provide any information on the dealings , financial status or partners in business and politics .
the new register aims to change this .
under the new rules , professional lobbyists would have to disclose in the register the importance of their major clients and the costs associated with lobbying , while ngos and think-tanks would be required to state their overall budgets and main funding sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the register aims to shed light into lobbying 's dark corners " -lsb- the committee 's -rsb- report represents a decisive step for a new culture of transparency in brussels , " said german jo leinen , the constitutional affairs committee 's chairman .
" in the future , strict rules will apply to lobbying . "
siim kallas vice-president of the european commission responsible for administrative affairs , added that lobbyists had a role to play in brussels but they had to open up to regulated scrutiny .
“ pressure groups are legitimate and they also bring a lot of swing in the decision-making process , ” he said . “ but these things must be clear .
and , therefore , the european transparency initiative wants to bring light to this often dark chamber . ”
kallas added that the register would " give all lobbies the opportunity to demonstrate their strong commitment to the cause of transparency and the full legitimacy of their profession . "
european capital inundated by lobbyists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels comes second only to washington in lobbying brussels is notorious for its lobbying community which makes it one of the most saturated political capitals on the planet .
" after washington , brussels is the worlds ' largest lobbyists ' city , " said erik wesselius of the corporate europe observatory .
the amsterdam-based non-governmental organization observes the economic and political power of lobbyists .
the organization estimates that the lobbyists spend up to 1 billion euros -lsb- $ 1.5 billion -rsb- a year to influence decision-makers in brussels .
but even wesselius does n't know how many representations there actually are in the city .
estimates put the number of lobbyists in brussels at 15,000 while there are an estimated 2,500 lobby organizations working there , with some 5,000 lobbyists operating in the parliament alone .
lobbyists ready to ignore voluntary register wesselius believes the few of these individuals and organizations will be happy with the regulations pertaining to disclosure .
" many lobbyists have already indicated they will not register because they would have to reveal their clients and their income , " he said .
british liberal european parliamentarian diana wallis told reuters that she also had doubts .
" i have my doubts as to the effectiveness of a voluntary registration system but it is a first step and , in any case , there will be review of the register after a year , " she said .
unlike the european commission and the european council of member governments , only the european parliament currently has a voluntary register of lobbyists and a code of lobbying conduct , which has been in place for the past 10 years .
however , the commission is setting one up to be in place in june .
the new measures are hoped to be in place in time for european parliament elections in june 2009 .
once these new rules are implemented , we will have a real culture of transparency in brussels , " said german socialist eu lawmaker jo leinen .
critics accuse plan of not going far enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics complain of corporate lobbying at the eu however , green lawmakers and an anti-lobby lobby lamented that the measures were not even stronger , saying that they had been watered down with a loophole for lawyers .
" lawyers are exempted from the scope of rules , which , given all available evidence is absurd , " said italian green monica frassoni .
" lawyers play an increasingly important role in influencing policy in brussels and they promote themselves as such on their own websites . "
the alliance for lobbying transparency and ethics regulation also said the loophole for lawyers was the work of conservative lawmaker klaus-heiner lehne , who himself is a partner at law firm taylor wessing , specialized in eu law .
" this outcome shows the need for the parliament to clean up its own house and introduce strong rules to prevent conflicts of interest , " said paul de clerck with environmentalist campaigners friends of the earth europe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but those districts are now located in a different country - kosovo - under un administration . if belgrade gets its wish , kosovo 's serbs will be able to vote in serbian parliamentary and local elections on sunday , may 11 .
serbian citizens who live in kosovo - or anywhere else for that matter - have the right to vote just as those who live in the country do .
but there 's a catch : serbia wants to hold elections in kosovo . the un interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- , which oversees the former serbian administration , rejects the idea , as do kosovar albanians , who see belgrade as undermining their institutions . serbian state local elections in kosovo would not be recognized and would even be counterproductive if they were n't organized by unmik , according to oliver ivanovic , head of the serb list for kosovo and metohija , one of the main parliamentary parties in kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only unmik , under joachim ruecker , may organize elections in kosovo " these polls will lead to controversy right from the beginning , because they are n't well prepared technically , " he said . the voter registers of kosovo serbs were from 1996 , he said , adding that : " our estimates show that more than 200,000 serbs and non-albanians have moved away in the meantime . " " the credibility of these elections is arguable , because according to un security council resolution 1244 , the international community alone is authorized to organize elections on a local or provincial level on kosovar territory , " ivanovic said . unmik calls the shots it was clear that resolution 1244 allowed only unmik to organize elections , said nebojsa jovic , head of the executive committee of the serb national council in mitrovica , which aims to defend the interests of the serb minority .
and it was " certainly desirable that the elections were in this way recognized as entirely legitimate by unmik , " jovic said .
" but we 're in a strange situation in which unmik head joachim ruecker and the international administration declare they will not recognize the local elections .
they have to give good reasons for that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo declared independence on feb .
17 the reasons they give are that belgrade is no longer responsible for local elections because kosovo declared independence from serbia . unmik has been responsible for organizing elections in kosovo ever since the former serbian province was put under international administration in 1999 and resolution 1244 was passed in the wake of nato 's bombing campaign against yugoslavia .
multi-ethnic country kosovo 's president , fatmir sejdiu , also rejects serbia carrying out elections in his county .
" serbia wants -lsb- the polls in kosovo -rsb- so that kosovar institutions are trampled underfoot .
we want citizens of serbian ethnicity to become part of our institutions .
that 's why these elections are unacceptable to us , and they wo n't have any validity . " kosovo 's citizens are hardly of one mind on the issue . " kosovo is an independent and sovereign state and serbian elections have no place in our country , " said kosovar albanian asan bitiqi . slobodan petkovic , a kosovo serb , looked toward the past : " unmik prevented neither parliamentary elections nor presidential elections in serbia , " he said .

serbs in kosovo have also been called on to vote in their electoral districts .
but those districts are now located in a different country - kosovo - under un administration . if belgrade gets its wish , kosovo 's serbs will be able to vote in serbian parliamentary and local elections on sunday , may 11 .
serbian citizens who live in kosovo - or anywhere else for that matter - have the right to vote just as those who live in the country do .
but there 's a catch : serbia wants to hold elections in kosovo . the un interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- , which oversees the former serbian administration , rejects the idea , as do kosovar albanians , who see belgrade as undermining their institutions . serbian state local elections in kosovo would not be recognized and would even be counterproductive if they were n't organized by unmik , according to oliver ivanovic , head of the serb list for kosovo and metohija , one of the main parliamentary parties in kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only unmik , under joachim ruecker , may organize elections in kosovo " these polls will lead to controversy right from the beginning , because they are n't well prepared technically , " he said . the voter registers of kosovo serbs were from 1996 , he said , adding that : " our estimates show that more than 200,000 serbs and non-albanians have moved away in the meantime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 09.05.2008 holocaust memorial train ends journey at auschwitz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 200,000 people saw the memorial train exhibition since november a memorial train featuring an exhibition on the thousands of children deported and murdered by the nazis during world war ii completed its journey near the former auschwitz death camp in southern poland . some 200 people marched on thursday from the railway station in oswiecim , where the train arrived , to a platform at the nearby auschwitz camp , where more than 1.1 million people , including one million european jews , were killed there between 1941-45 .
" it 's not easy to confront ourselves because we are not the victims but we are the sons and daughters of the perpetrators , " organizer hans minow said .
" we say this knowing that perhaps our fathers and mothers - if not participated - did not do what they had to do when the crimes started , " he said .
the train 's arrival at auschwitz coincided with the 63rd anniversary of the end of the second world war in europe on may 8 , 1945 .
controversial exhibit the exhibit , which originated in the western german city of frankfurt in november , provoked controversy after the state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn refused permission for the train to stop in berlin 's gleaming new hauptbahnhof central station .
deutsche bahn said at the time that this would have caused major disruption to normal services .
the exhibition took place instead at ostbahnhof , the main train station of the former east berlin .
the train of commemoration foundation also complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally and that no one could use the tracks for free .

" it 's not easy to confront ourselves because we are not the victims but we are the sons and daughters of the perpetrators , " organizer hans minow said .
" we say this knowing that perhaps our fathers and mothers - if not participated - did not do what they had to do when the crimes started , " he said .
the train 's arrival at auschwitz coincided with the 63rd anniversary of the end of the second world war in europe on may 8 , 1945 .
controversial exhibit the exhibit , which originated in the western german city of frankfurt in november , provoked controversy after the state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn refused permission for the train to stop in berlin 's gleaming new hauptbahnhof central station .
deutsche bahn said at the time that this would have caused major disruption to normal services .
the exhibition took place instead at ostbahnhof , the main train station of the former east berlin .
the train of commemoration foundation also complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .

" we say this knowing that perhaps our fathers and mothers - if not participated - did not do what they had to do when the crimes started , " he said .
the train 's arrival at auschwitz coincided with the 63rd anniversary of the end of the second world war in europe on may 8 , 1945 .
controversial exhibit the exhibit , which originated in the western german city of frankfurt in november , provoked controversy after the state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn refused permission for the train to stop in berlin 's gleaming new hauptbahnhof central station .
deutsche bahn said at the time that this would have caused major disruption to normal services .
the exhibition took place instead at ostbahnhof , the main train station of the former east berlin .
the train of commemoration foundation also complained that , despite deutsche bahn 's historic involvement in the transportation of prisoners to nazi death camps , the company had invoiced the foundation for rail-track use .
after the foundation threatened to publicly shame the company , deutsche bahn admitted that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as it charged other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally and that no one could use the tracks for free .
symbolic journey organizers said that more than 225,000 people viewed the exhibition during its six-month voyage .
detailing the fate of jewish children and teenagers deported by the nazis between october 1940 to december 1944 , the " memorial train " focuses on the biographies of several such children .
the organizers created an exhibit that symbolically travelled through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations after hearing of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the initiative was also intended to encourage visitors to search for traces of jewish people who had vanished from their towns or region during the war . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rsf called company executives to consider the implications of its brand being linked with human rights violations in china .
" adidas has a moral responsibility , " said rsf executive officer elke schaefter .
adidas chief executive herbert hainer said he took human rights very seriously , according to the text of his speech at the meeting .
he nevertheless criticized human rights organisations as " moralists who just emit rhetoric . "
the paris-based rsf used the same tactic in order to attend the annual general meeting of coca-cola last month in the united states .
the company is also sponsoring this summer 's olympics .
business or politics ?
the ceo of the international campaign for tibet in germany , kai mueller , said adidas should work on improving human rights in tibet .
the adidas chief , however , said that his company was combining profitable growth with social and environmental responsibility .
" i do n't think that what 's going on in china is good , " hainer said .
" but adidas has nothing to do with it . "
earlier this week , the brand with the three stripes reported a big jump in profits for the first quarter of 2008 , driven by double-digit growth in sales .
net income attributable to shareholders increased 32 percent from the same period a year ago to 169 million euros -lrb- $ 260 million -rrb- , the company said in a statement .
first-quarter sales in asia increased 25 percent on a currency-neutral basis , driven by particularly strong growth in china and korea , the company said .
in addition to sponsoring the olympic games in beijing , adidas will be represented at this year 's european soccer championship to be held in austria and in switzerland , as well . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a formal inquiry was being opened into whether he and other chief officers had committed any misdemeanour , which is a minor offence punishable by a fine , by failing in their duty to supervise the company 's affairs .
german law required executives to put " practicable organizational measures " in place to prevent crime , they added .
widespread corruption pierer , 67 , left siemens after revelations that sales executives used slush funds to bribe officials in greece , italy and other nations to purchase siemens telecommunications gear or machinery .
leaked allegations in recent weeks had suggested pierer may have been warned about the irregularities at the time .
the decision in munich was the conclusion of a preliminary inquiry that followed an interview by prosecutors with pierer on april 18 .
prosecutors said they would not disclose any other details .
preventing repeats the new chief executive of siemens , peter loescher , said in a news interview released on friday that the company had set up a system of checks to prevent any repeats and to punish any offenders .
" one can never rule out individual crookedness , " loescher told news magazine focus .
" but we have a system in place that makes broad-based misdeeds on the past scale impossible in the future . "
siemens employs around 400,000 people around the world and makes a broad range of products including household appliances , medical equipment , trains , turbines and power stations . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i urgently call on all parties to withdraw their armed factions , lay down their weapons and recognise the lebanese state 's exclusive right to use force , " steinmeier said in a statement .
" the developments of the last few days have shown that a resolution to the political conflict in lebanon can not wait any longer . "
at least 11 people have been killed and dozens more wounded in the civil unrest that erupted on thursday after hezbollah chief hassan nasrallah said a government crackdown on his iranian-backed shiite muslim group was a declaration of war .

profound crisis " the profound crisis in lebanon can only be resolved with dialogue and in the framework of institutions that are laid out in the constitution , " steinmeier said .
" part of this dialogue must be an agreement on disarming all the militias in lebanon , " he said .

"
" i urgently call on all parties to withdraw their armed factions , lay down their weapons and recognise the lebanese state 's exclusive right to use force , " steinmeier said in a statement .
" the developments of the last few days have shown that a resolution to the political conflict in lebanon can not wait any longer . "
at least 11 people have been killed and dozens more wounded in the civil unrest that erupted on thursday after hezbollah chief hassan nasrallah said a government crackdown on his iranian-backed shiite muslim group was a declaration of war .
power vacuum steinmeier noted that the parties represented in the lebanese parliament agreed months ago on a presidential candidate who would be acceptable for all .
" they are now called upon to finally end the vacuum at the top of the state leadership , " he said .
the lebanese parliament has not been able to agree on the make-up of the new cabinet .
as a consequence , 18 sessions of parliament to choose a new president have been cancelled .
germany has repeatedly called for a resolution to the crisis over the election of a lebanese president and accused syria of blocking the process and of contributing to rising tensions in the country .
profound crisis " the profound crisis in lebanon can only be resolved with dialogue and in the framework of institutions that are laid out in the constitution , " steinmeier said .
" part of this dialogue must be an agreement on disarming all the militias in lebanon , " he said .
german government spokesmen said there was constant contact between german diplomats and lebanese leaders , including seniora and lebanese house speaker nabih berri .
chancellor merkel , who maintains a close relationship with seniora , had not had direct contact with the premier " in recent days , " merkel 's spokesman thomas steg said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead of protecting a witness on a plane , as he did in the film , flynn could be protecting a post office worker who has vital information on a local crime lord who is shipping in out-of-date kebab meat through the branch before distributing it across eastern germany . to add some kind of credibility , the film could be sold with the tagline : based on a -lrb- nearly -rrb- true story . taking its core premise from the events which actually happened in the eastern german city on friday , jackson 's character fritz could be the guy who discovered a package containing three live pythons ; two tiger pythons and an albino tiger python of more than 3 feet -lrb- 1 meter -rrb- in length . three pythons sent through german postal system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pythons ' arrival proved to be something of a shock the post office worker - who would provide the basis for jackson 's character - noticed one of the reptiles after it had apparently bit its way through the package .
assisted by a number of colleagues , he managed to catch it and put it into an empty box .
the other two pythons were discovered by police who soon arrived at the scene .
all three were then taken to a reptile house . police say they have put the package 's sender under investigation for possible violation of animal protection laws . of course , there would have to be a little artistic license involved in the hollywood version .
fritz and the potential whistle-blower could be working late alone at the depot when the snakes break out , intent on killing both of them and removing any threat to the crime lord 's rancid meat empire .
trying to escape , the deutsche post workers find that all the doors have been locked - and , to no one 's surprise - neither has a key . cue two hours of predictable plot twists , minimal scares and lots of close-ups of sam jackson wrestling obviously plastic snakes and there 's a hollywood blockbuster in the waiting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the uk has one of the worst reputations for binge drinking and underage sex but there are striking similarities between countries , a study found .
a third of 16 to 35-year-old men and 23 % of women questioned said they drank to increase their chance of sex .
the study - of 1,341 young people in nine countries including the uk - is published in bmc public health .
young people were also more at risk of unsafe sex while under the influence of alcohol or drugs , the study found .
despite the negative consequences , we found many are deliberately taking these substances to achieve quite specific sexual effects professor mark bellis the researchers said although it was well known that use of alcohol and drugs was linked to risky sexual behaviour , this study showed many young people were " strategically " binge drinking or abusing drugs to improve their sex lives .
they questioned young people in nine cities , one each in the uk , germany , austria , czech republic , greece , italy , portugal , spain and slovenia - who all routinely went to pubs , bars and nightclubs .
early use of alcohol and other drugs was closely linked to having sex under the age of 16 years , in all countries , especially in girls .
almost half of participants in vienna , austria had drunk alcohol and had sex by the time they were 16 compared with 36 % in venice , italy , 37 % in palma , spain and 30 % in liverpool .
the same was true for those who took drugs under the age of 16 but there were variations in popularity of different drugs among different countries .
more than a quarter of youngsters taking cocaine said they used it to prolong sex and drug use in general was linked to having multiple partners .
' risky ' drunkenness and drug use were found to be strongly associated with an increase in risk taking behaviour and feeling regretful about having sex .
those who had been drunk in the past four weeks were more likely to have had five or more partners , sex without a condom and to have regretted sex after drink or drugs in the past 12 months .
cannabis , cocaine or ecstasy use was linked to similar consequences .
study leader professor mark bellis , director of the centre for public health at liverpool john moore 's university said : " millions of young europeans now take drugs and drink in ways which alter their sexual decisions and increase their chances of unsafe sex or sex that is later regretted .
" yet despite the negative consequences , we found many are deliberately taking these substances to achieve quite specific sexual effects . "
he added that strategies to reduce substance abuse and encourage safe sexual behaviour needed to take into account the fact that the two were inextricably linked .
simon blake , chief executive of brook , said : " when it comes to drugs and alcohol young people learn from us , the adults who help determine the culture in which young people are learning about sex , and learning about drugs and alcohol .
" sex and relationships education also needs to include more discussion about the association between alcohol , drugs and unsafe sex . "
frank sodeen from alcohol concern said : " the report is a good reminder of the multiple dimensions of drink-related harm . "
he added local authorities need to think as broadly as possible about projects to reduce alcohol use and incorporate issues such as sexual health .

almost half of participants in vienna , austria had drunk alcohol and had sex by the time they were 16 compared with 36 % in venice , italy , 37 % in palma , spain and 30 % in liverpool .
the same was true for those who took drugs under the age of 16 but there were variations in popularity of different drugs among different countries .
more than a quarter of youngsters taking cocaine said they used it to prolong sex and drug use in general was linked to having multiple partners .
' risky ' drunkenness and drug use were found to be strongly associated with an increase in risk taking behaviour and feeling regretful about having sex .
those who had been drunk in the past four weeks were more likely to have had five or more partners , sex without a condom and to have regretted sex after drink or drugs in the past 12 months .
cannabis , cocaine or ecstasy use was linked to similar consequences .
study leader professor mark bellis , director of the centre for public health at liverpool john moore 's university said : " millions of young europeans now take drugs and drink in ways which alter their sexual decisions and increase their chances of unsafe sex or sex that is later regretted .
" yet despite the negative consequences , we found many are deliberately taking these substances to achieve quite specific sexual effects . "
he added that strategies to reduce substance abuse and encourage safe sexual behaviour needed to take into account the fact that the two were inextricably linked .
simon blake , chief executive of brook , said : " when it comes to drugs and alcohol young people learn from us , the adults who help determine the culture in which young people are learning about sex , and learning about drugs and alcohol .
" sex and relationships education also needs to include more discussion about the association between alcohol , drugs and unsafe sex . "
frank sodeen from alcohol concern said : " the report is a good reminder of the multiple dimensions of drink-related harm . "
he added local authorities need to think as broadly as possible about projects to reduce alcohol use and incorporate issues such as sexual health .

yi , rangoon " my family is fine .
we have enough food for one month .
but i have to rebuild the destroyed parts of my house bit by bit .
i think i will have to wait one month for this because of the dirty water under and around my house and yard .
it means i ca n't prepare the ground for construction work the dirty water smells bad and it is hard to breathe .
we have no power but we can get a water supply from the tube well of the water seller .
there is nothing from the government for our entire ward .
most people find it difficult to get food and water daily .
but rangoon is now running public buses for transportation .
we are very worried about the delta area .
we are also very angry with the wicked junta .
they want to do nothing for our people . "
children 's home co-ordinator , rangoon : " we are helping one orphanage where the roof has blown away .
there are 38 orphans and staff living in the rain now with no-one to help them but us .
the children also need food aid and pure drinking water .
at another girls ' orphanage - the whole house has collapsed .
the roofing sheet was stolen by a thief and they urgently need to rebuild the house .
i know another orphanage house has collapsed .
they are rebuilding a temporary bamboo house to at least give shelter but they need food .
many other children 's homes need food aid .
most homes around rangoon have a lot of damage . "
aung , rangoon : " now our military junta has declared that the cyclone struck areas have returned to normal .
how can it be ?
after the storm there is still no power .
the authorities are giving little assistance , they are supplying a little rice but not enough for a household .
they do this to show off to the world that they are assisting the people .
buses can not operate much because of fuel shortages .
no medical teams are seen .
no security is given to people during night while the whole town is blacked out .
we could only connect the internet yesterday - the rest of the day it is cut off .
people have to rely on themselves .
i am fine now because i am staying in a place which has its own power and water supply .
but for the people in outskirts of rangoon there is real suffering .
the water supply is still scarce ; there is no power ; people 's houses which were destroyed by nargis have not been repaired yet .
food prices are going up sky high , there are fuel shortages , fuel prices are going up , cooking oil prices are high and even vegetable prices are climbing .
the big stores do n't dare open their doors to shoppers .
do the authorities think that the water can climb up to higher floors by itself ?
the poor people struck by nargis have nothing to eat , no money to buy anything .
the junta has provided them some rice and some cooking oil .
but the junta can not provide them with roofing and housing material . "
expatriate woman , rangoon : " our school has been closed as many people are without water or electricity .
some families have lost windows , roofs and houses .
i am amazed at how fast the streets have been cleared .
people were out in the streets with machetes , saws and brooms trying to clear the streets by saturday afternoon .
i have seen military in the main streets cutting trees that blocked roads , but have heard that many neighbourhoods have got no help .
the people here are survivors and have taken the initiative to clean up on their own .
a few food stores have begun to open but i hear shelves are beginning to empty .
there are few materials to repair the damage and what is around has doubled and tripled in price . "

yi , rangoon rangoon residents are coping with fuel shortages my family is fine .
we have enough food for one month .
but i have to rebuild the destroyed parts of my house bit by bit .
i think i will have to wait one month for this because of the dirty water under and around my house and yard .
it means i ca n't prepare the ground for construction work the dirty water smells bad and it is hard to breathe .
we have no power but we can get a water supply from the tube well of the water seller .
there is nothing from the government for our entire ward .
most people find it difficult to get food and water daily .
but rangoon is now running public buses for transportation .
we are very worried about the delta area .
we are also very angry with the wicked junta .
they want to do nothing for our people .
children 's home co-ordinator , rangoon : we are helping one orphanage where the roof has blown away .
there are 38 orphans and staff living in the rain now with no-one to help them but us .
the children also need food aid and pure drinking water .
at another girls ' orphanage - the whole house has collapsed .
the roofing sheet was stolen by a thief and they urgently need to rebuild the house .
i know another orphanage house has collapsed .
they are rebuilding a temporary bamboo house to at least give shelter but they need food .
many other children 's homes need food aid .
most homes around rangoon have a lot of damage .
aung , rangoon : now our military junta has declared that the cyclone struck areas have returned to normal .
how can it be ?
after the storm there is still no power .
the authorities are giving little assistance , they are supplying a little rice but not enough for a household .
they do this to show off to the world that they are assisting the people .
buses can not operate much because of fuel shortages .
no medical teams are seen .
no security is given to people during night while the whole town is blacked out .
we could only connect the internet yesterday - the rest of the day it is cut off .
people have to rely on themselves .
i am fine now because i am staying in a place which has its own power and water supply .
but for the people in outskirts of rangoon there is real suffering .
the water supply is still scarce ; there is no power ; people 's houses which were destroyed by nargis have not been repaired yet .
food prices are going up sky high , there are fuel shortages , fuel prices are going up , cooking oil prices are high and even vegetable prices are climbing .
the big stores do n't dare open their doors to shoppers .
do the authorities think that the water can climb up to higher floors by itself ?
the poor people struck by nargis have nothing to eat , no money to buy anything .
the junta has provided them some rice and some cooking oil .
but the junta can not provide them with roofing and housing material .
expatriate woman , rangoon : our school has been closed as many people are without water or electricity .
some families have lost windows , roofs and houses .
i am amazed at how fast the streets have been cleared .
people were out in the streets with machetes , saws and brooms trying to clear the streets by saturday afternoon .
i have seen military in the main streets cutting trees that blocked roads , but have heard that many neighbourhoods have got no help .
the people here are survivors and have taken the initiative to clean up on their own .
a few food stores have begun to open but i hear shelves are beginning to empty .
there are few materials to repair the damage and what is around has doubled and tripled in price .

a total of 62,000 saplings will be planted to extend the wood of cree reserve in dumfries and galloway .
it is part of a project which will eventually create 670 acres of new woodland in the area .
the south of scotland scheme is designed to expand the rare habitat for threatened species of animals and birds such as the black grouse .
funding for the scheme has come from petrol giants bp , which has worked with the royal society for the protection of birds , the forestry commission and the woodland trust .
the new trees will be planted at barclye farm near newton stewart , which the rspb bought two years ago for the project .
as well as being a large woodland area it is also host to species such as the red squirrel and birds such as the wood warbler , redstart and pied flycatcher .
' exceptional beauty ' this phase of the expansion will see 93 acres of the hill farm planted up with a range of trees .
eventually it will create a 12-mile " habitat network " between glentrool and newton stewart .
" this will help to enhance a place of exceptional beauty , and expand the patchwork of mature woodland , open glades , mossy hollows , craggy nooks and knolls leading down to the river cree , " said neil groves of the rspb .
he said the project could " plug the last big gap " in the cree valley community woodland trust vision .

the comments from google co-founder sergey brin and chief executive eric schmidt were made before the firm 's annual general meeting on thursday .
google and yahoo recently shared advertising for two weeks , but some analysts said the trial was more about stopping a microsoft bid for yahoo .
microsoft ended its interest in buying yahoo last weekend .
' shared values ' " we have been talking to yahoo and we are very excited to be working with them , " said mr brin before the agm .
" we share a lot of values with them . "
mr schmidt said the two week trial with yahoo had been " successful " .
" that 's a good basis to talk to yahoo some more , " he said .
human rights as expected , google defeated two contentious shareholder proposals at the agm .
however , mr brin decided to abstain on both votes .
the first wanted the company to create a special committee on human rights , while the second asked google to increase its opposition to censorship demands from countries such as china that wish to limit their citizens ' internet access .
while both votes were defeated , a breakdown of the vote has yet to be released .

zuzanna zommer 's body was found by her parents at their home in compton row , leeds , with her throat cut and skull fractured last october .
michael clark , 40 , of the same street , attacked zuzanna two months after her family arrived from poland .
he had sexually assaulted her and killed her .
the defendant will be sentenced at sheffield crown court on friday .
on 1 october 2007 , clark , who lived two doors from the zommer family had cut her throat and smashed her skull , apparently by stamping on her head .
solvent abuser jurors were told clark , who was convicted of rape in 1991 , had befriended the zommer family when they moved into his street .
but not long afterwards , his behaviour began to worry zuzanna 's father .
on the day she was killed , zuzanna 's parents had to find work in leeds city centre , leaving her at home .
solvent abuser clark later told the police he had an alibi , insisting he was in a post office collecting benefits at the time of the murder , but officers disproved it .
one of the knives used to kill zuzanna was found in a bin at her home along with a chocolate bar wrapper , which prosecutors said clark had eaten .
the court heard how clark was convicted in 1991 of raping a woman he met in a nightclub and how he had subjected that woman to a sexual assault .
' sexual and sadistic ' in 1998 he was convicted of indecent assault and affray after he attacked a woman who managed to escape from him by smashing a window .
in 2003 he was also found guilty of attacking a prostitute .
on thursday the jury of five women and seven men found clark guilty of one count of murder and another of assault by penetration .
the judge , mr justice king , said he would sentence clark on friday .
prosecutor adrian waterman qc , told the court he will be proposing the judge sentences clark on the basis the murder was " sexual , sadistic and involving a child " .

it said there will be more free legal advice for those at risk of repossession , along with specialist training for debt advice agencies .
figures published later are set to show more people facing the first stage of the repossession process .
however , experts said the current situation was a long way off the level of problems seen in the early 1990s .
fresh help on 22 april , the government announced that there would be more support for homeowners facing repossessions .
that pledge came after key figures from the mortgage industry met chancellor alistair darling and housing minister caroline flint at 11 downing street .
the limited package of measures are aimed particularly at the million-plus borrowers whose fixed-rate deals come to an end this year .
they are likely to face more expensive repayments and less availability of mortgage deals as a result of the credit squeeze .
in order to limit the impact , the government said a new debt advice service would be set up through the national housing advice service .
at the same time , specialist training will be available for citizen 's advice service and local authority staff , and lenders will be encouraged to give early advice to borrowers in difficulty .

the number of actual repossessions , across the uk and by private lenders only , is shown in figures from the council of mortgage lenders -lrb- cml -rrb- published twice a year .
the data for the first half of 2008 will be published in august .
the cml predicts that there will be 45,000 repossessions in 2008 , up from 27,100 in the previous year .
the cml says there are 11.8 million outstanding mortgages in the uk .

it said there will be more free legal advice for those at risk of repossession , along with specialist training for debt advice agencies .
figures published later are set to show more people facing the first stage of the repossession process .
however , experts said the current situation was a long way off the level of problems seen in the early 1990s .
fresh help on 22 april , the government announced that there would be more support for homeowners facing repossessions .
that pledge came after key figures from the mortgage industry met chancellor alistair darling and housing minister caroline flint at 11 downing street .
the limited package of measures are aimed particularly at the million-plus borrowers whose fixed-rate deals come to an end this year .
they are likely to face more expensive repayments and less availability of mortgage deals as a result of the credit squeeze .
in order to limit the impact , the government said a new debt advice service would be set up through the national housing advice service .
at the same time , specialist training will be available for citizen 's advice service and local authority staff , and lenders will be encouraged to give early advice to borrowers in difficulty .
new arrangements will also be available to allow access for householders facing repossessions to free legal representation at all county courts in england .
have your say the government are being urged to help those who are most irresponsible hugh , uk send us your comments " for the minority of owners who may need support and advice now , we want to ensure it is there for them in the right place and at the right time , " said ms flint .
" it is important to recognise we are dealing with an entirely different situation in the market from what was experienced in the early 1990s " .
" the fundamentals of the housing market remain strong with high employment , low interest rates , and long term demand for homes from first time buyers . "
rising numbers later on friday , the ministry of justice will publish figures on the number of mortgage possession claims - the first stage of the repossession process - for the first three months of the year .
the data is expected to show a rise in claims owing to the effects of the credit crunch on household finances .
housing minister caroline flint has been working with mortgage lenders figures from the ministry of justice show mortgage possession claims in england and wales by local authority and private mortgage lenders .
most of these do not end with a property being repossessed , mainly because the borrower presents the court with a case for not proceeding or the lender comes to an arrangement with the borrower .
the number of actual repossessions , across the uk and by private lenders only , is shown in figures from the council of mortgage lenders -lrb- cml -rrb- published twice a year .
the data for the first half of 2008 will be published in august .
the cml predicts that there will be 45,000 repossessions in 2008 , up from 27,100 in the previous year .
the cml says there are 11.8 million outstanding mortgages in the uk .

the independent new local government network -lrb- nlgn -rrb- says households in areas that accept incinerators should be rewarded with lower energy bills .
it also calls for financial incentives to boost recycling rather than penalty charges to cut waste .
but environment minister joan ruddock said the report contained " a number of inaccuracies and misconceptions " .
the nlgn warns tough decisions are needed if councils are to meet eu landfill targets and avoid huge costs in taxes and fines .
it recommends building 10 large-scale incinerators and as many as 200 smaller plants using anaerobic digestion to turn organic waste into biogas .
public resistance other european countries with higher recycling rates use incineration on a bigger scale to burn residual waste .
but while modern incinerators are much safer and can generate local heat and power , they frequently meet public resistance . "
it is clear that the government has to adopt a new approach to this challenge " chris leslie new local government network the nlgn suggests using £ 50 discounts on fuel bills for households in areas that give incinerators the go-ahead .
it also criticises " pay-as-you-throw " bin charges as unpopular and difficult to administer , though pilot schemes in five council areas are still planned for next year .
the think tank instead suggests community incentives such as grants to improve street lighting or children 's equipment for parks .
nlgn director chris leslie said : " by offering local communities financial incentives , residents would be able to benefit their locality as well as the wider environment .
financial incentives " with landfill tax increasing year on year and some authorities spending millions of pounds dealing with the problem of rubbish disposal , it is clear that the government has to adopt a new approach to this challenge . "
ms ruddock said the government already backed financial rewards to encourage recycling .
" it is our intention to allow five pilot schemes to incentivise recycling by giving rebates to those who recycle and only charging those who refuse to do so , " she said .
meanwhile , anaerobic digestion was the government 's preferred form of gaining energy from waste and grants were in place to boost its development .
paul bettison , of the local government association , said : " financial incentive schemes should be exactly what they say on the tin .
" any council that looks to introduce these measures will do so to promote recycling and reward local people who do their bit for the environment .
no resident need lose out provided they are prepared to recycle . "

mr johnson would no doubt like to take a bite out of the big apple 's £ 30bn annual budget , compared with £ 11.3bn at london 's city hall .
new york 's money comes in large part from the mayor 's unrestrained ability to raise revenue through taxation .
for his part , mr bloomberg may covet the conservative party london mayor 's power to implement key policies - such as congestion charging - without having to jump through legislative hoops .
mr bloomberg 's plan for a congestion charge in manhattan was rejected by new york state lawmakers in april 2008 , costing the city 's transport system a much-needed annual cash injection .
grass greener indeed , both men might come away from their friday meeting wondering if the mayoral grass is greener on the other side of the atlantic .
mayor-elect johnson built his campaign on addressing many of the intractable issues we 've been tackling in innovative ways in new york new york mayor michael bloomberg profile : michael bloomberg profile : boris johnson johnson to meet new york 's mayor in a straight contest over power and revenue , new york 's billionaire businessman and two-term mayor wins hands down .
he was first elected mayor in 2001 as a republican despite being a long-time democratic party supporter .
after winning re-election in 2005 , he left the republican party and changed his political status to unaffiliated .
his role , in a post which has been directly elected by new yorkers since 1834 , puts him in charge of all city services such as rubbish collection , social services , policing , fire and schools in the city of eight million people .
property taxes - the council tax equivalent - is set by city council led by the mayor , as is the real estate tax -lrb- similar to stamp duty in the uk -rrb- .
the monies raised stay within the city coffers to pay for local services .
the city of new york employs just shy of 370,000 people , compared with 700 directly employed by the greater london authority and the london assembly .
ceremonial tone in london , with a population of 7.5 million , the mayor 's office is reliant on policies set at westminster for the lion 's share of its budget and the ability to raise revenue is limited to the headline-grabbing congestion charge and work-place parking charges .
the very job description of london 's mayor , in place since former prime minister tony blair recreated the role after labour won the 1997 general election , has a ceremonial tone .
the mayor 's role is : " to work with other london bodies to promote economic development and wealth creation , social development , and the improvement of the environment . "
is the mayoral grass greener on the other side of the atlantic ?
compare that to the gravitas afforded to mr bloomberg 's job : " the mayor of new york city is the head of the executive branch of the government of new york city . "
yet mr bloomberg has been denied the high-profile victories that mr johnson 's predecessor , ken livingstone , enjoyed during his eight years as london 's mayor .
on top of the congestion charge rebuke , mr bloomberg 's power and cash flow could not convince legislators to approve a stadium in manhattan which might have boosted new york 's chances of landing the 2012 olympics ; games that are now high on mr johnson 's agenda .
mr bloomberg inherited a £ 3bn deficit from former mayor rudy giuliani amid the aftermath of the 11 september attacks and was forced to raise taxes upon his election in 2001 .
london 's economic boom has been longer and stronger .
even mr bloomberg posited last year that he worried that london was on the verge of overtaking new york as the world 's capital of finance , amid a climate of regulatory pressure that analysts said was driving business out .
although he has since stressed new york 's continuing strengths - and offered to share his top tips for success with mr johnson - it is expected that wall street will suffer more than the city of london when it comes to financial sector job losses amid the credit crunch .
key influence what london 's mayor might lack in power he perhaps gains in influence , given his ability to appoint key board members to the agencies that keep the city running , including the metropolitan police authority and transport for london .
he is also armed with strong planning approval and veto powers that hand him a direct say over which projects are built and what physical shape the city will take over the next four years .
for mr johnson , the reality that his powers are fewer and pockets not quite as deep as the new york mayor could also help bring more focus to the job at hand .
with a £ 450m london development agency budget within his grasp , he should be able to prioritise his campaign promises of improved public safety , better public transport , improved use of the thames for commuters , tackling youth crime and making key changes to the london plan to limit development of back garden space .
the london mayor also has the responsibility to set the agenda and the budget for affordable housing in the city - which in turn produced his promise to create 50,000 new units by the tight deadline of 2011 .
on a note of self-interest , mr johnson can take some comfort in the fact that his job pays more than his american counterpart , earning him £ 137,000 annually , compared to £ 98,000 for the job in new york , although the job stateside comes with the plush gracie mansion in uptown manhattan .
of course , with a personal fortune estimated to be in excess of £ 5bn , mr bloomberg opts for a salary of just $ 1 a year and pays all his own expenses .

mr johnson would no doubt like to take a bite out of the big apple 's £ 30bn annual budget , compared with £ 11.3bn at london 's city hall .
new york 's money comes in large part from the mayor 's unrestrained ability to raise revenue through taxation .
for his part , mr bloomberg may covet the conservative party london mayor 's power to implement key policies - such as congestion charging - without having to jump through legislative hoops .
mr bloomberg 's plan for a congestion charge in manhattan was rejected by new york state lawmakers in april 2008 , costing the city 's transport system a much-needed annual cash injection .
grass greener indeed , both men might come away from their friday meeting wondering if the mayoral grass is greener on the other side of the atlantic .
mayor-elect johnson built his campaign on addressing many of the intractable issues we 've been tackling in innovative ways in new york new york mayor michael bloomberg profile : michael bloomberg profile : boris johnson johnson to meet new york 's mayor in a straight contest over power and revenue , new york 's billionaire businessman and two-term mayor wins hands down .
he was first elected mayor in 2001 as a republican despite being a long-time democratic party supporter .
after winning re-election in 2005 , he left the republican party and changed his political status to unaffiliated .
his role , in a post which has been directly elected by new yorkers since 1834 , puts him in charge of all city services such as rubbish collection , social services , policing , fire and schools in the city of eight million people .
property taxes - the council tax equivalent - is set by city council led by the mayor , as is the real estate tax -lrb- similar to stamp duty in the uk -rrb- .
the monies raised stay within the city coffers to pay for local services .
the city of new york employs just shy of 370,000 people , compared with 700 directly employed by the greater london authority and the london assembly .
ceremonial tone in london , with a population of 7.5 million , the mayor 's office is reliant on policies set at westminster for the lion 's share of its budget and the ability to raise revenue is limited to the headline-grabbing congestion charge and work-place parking charges .
the very job description of london 's mayor , in place since former prime minister tony blair recreated the role after labour won the 1997 general election , has a ceremonial tone .
the mayor 's role is : " to work with other london bodies to promote economic development and wealth creation , social development , and the improvement of the environment . "
is the mayoral grass greener on the other side of the atlantic ?
compare that to the gravitas afforded to mr bloomberg 's job : " the mayor of new york city is the head of the executive branch of the government of new york city . "
yet mr bloomberg has been denied the high-profile victories that mr johnson 's predecessor , ken livingstone , enjoyed during his eight years as london 's mayor .
on top of the congestion charge rebuke , mr bloomberg 's power and cash flow could not convince legislators to approve a stadium in manhattan which might have boosted new york 's chances of landing the 2012 olympics ; games that are now high on mr johnson 's agenda .
mr bloomberg inherited a £ 3bn deficit from former mayor rudy giuliani amid the aftermath of the 11 september attacks and was forced to raise taxes upon his election in 2001 .
london 's economic boom has been longer and stronger .
even mr bloomberg posited last year that he worried that london was on the verge of overtaking new york as the world 's capital of finance , amid a climate of regulatory pressure that analysts said was driving business out .
although he has since stressed new york 's continuing strengths - and offered to share his top tips for success with mr johnson - it is expected that wall street will suffer more than the city of london when it comes to financial sector job losses amid the credit crunch .
key influence what london 's mayor might lack in power he perhaps gains in influence , given his ability to appoint key board members to the agencies that keep the city running , including the metropolitan police authority and transport for london .
he is also armed with strong planning approval and veto powers that hand him a direct say over which projects are built and what physical shape the city will take over the next four years .
for mr johnson , the reality that his powers are fewer and pockets not quite as deep as the new york mayor could also help bring more focus to the job at hand .

mr johnson would no doubt like to take a bite out of the big apple 's £ 30bn annual budget , compared with £ 11.3bn at london 's city hall .
new york 's money comes in large part from the mayor 's unrestrained ability to raise revenue through taxation .
for his part , mr bloomberg may covet the conservative party london mayor 's power to implement key policies - such as congestion charging - without having to jump through legislative hoops .
mr bloomberg 's plan for a congestion charge in manhattan was rejected by new york state lawmakers in april 2008 , costing the city 's transport system a much-needed annual cash injection .
grass greener indeed , both men might come away from their friday meeting wondering if the mayoral grass is greener on the other side of the atlantic .
mayor-elect johnson built his campaign on addressing many of the intractable issues we 've been tackling in innovative ways in new york new york mayor michael bloomberg profile : michael bloomberg profile : boris johnson johnson to meet new york 's mayor in a straight contest over power and revenue , new york 's billionaire businessman and two-term mayor wins hands down .
he was first elected mayor in 2001 as a republican despite being a long-time democratic party supporter .
after winning re-election in 2005 , he left the republican party and changed his political status to unaffiliated .
his role , in a post which has been directly elected by new yorkers since 1834 , puts him in charge of all city services such as rubbish collection , social services , policing , fire and schools in the city of eight million people .
property taxes - the council tax equivalent - is set by city council led by the mayor , as is the real estate tax -lrb- similar to stamp duty in the uk -rrb- .
the monies raised stay within the city coffers to pay for local services .
the city of new york employs just shy of 370,000 people , compared with 700 directly employed by the greater london authority and the london assembly .
ceremonial tone in london , with a population of 7.5 million , the mayor 's office is reliant on policies set at westminster for the lion 's share of its budget and the ability to raise revenue is limited to the headline-grabbing congestion charge and work-place parking charges .
the very job description of london 's mayor , in place since former prime minister tony blair recreated the role after labour won the 1997 general election , has a ceremonial tone .
the mayor 's role is : " to work with other london bodies to promote economic development and wealth creation , social development , and the improvement of the environment . "
is the mayoral grass greener on the other side of the atlantic ?
compare that to the gravitas afforded to mr bloomberg 's job : " the mayor of new york city is the head of the executive branch of the government of new york city . "
yet mr bloomberg has been denied the high-profile victories that mr johnson 's predecessor , ken livingstone , enjoyed during his eight years as london 's mayor .
on top of the congestion charge rebuke , mr bloomberg 's power and cash flow could not convince legislators to approve a stadium in manhattan which might have boosted new york 's chances of landing the 2012 olympics ; games that are now high on mr johnson 's agenda .
mr bloomberg inherited a £ 3bn deficit from former mayor rudy giuliani amid the aftermath of the 11 september attacks and was forced to raise taxes upon his election in 2001 .
london 's economic boom has been longer and stronger .
even mr bloomberg posited last year that he worried that london was on the verge of overtaking new york as the world 's capital of finance , amid a climate of regulatory pressure that analysts said was driving business out .
although he has since stressed new york 's continuing strengths - and offered to share his top tips for success with mr johnson - it is expected that wall street will suffer more than the city of london when it comes to financial sector job losses amid the credit crunch .
key influence what london 's mayor might lack in power he perhaps gains in influence , given his ability to appoint key board members to the agencies that keep the city running , including the metropolitan police authority and transport for london .
he is also armed with strong planning approval and veto powers that hand him a direct say over which projects are built and what physical shape the city will take over the next four years .
for mr johnson , the reality that his powers are fewer and pockets not quite as deep as the new york mayor could also help bring more focus to the job at hand .
with a £ 450m london development agency budget within his grasp , he should be able to prioritise his campaign promises of improved public safety , better public transport , improved use of the thames for commuters , tackling youth crime and making key changes to the london plan to limit development of back garden space .
the london mayor also has the responsibility to set the agenda and the budget for affordable housing in the city - which in turn produced his promise to create 50,000 new units by the tight deadline of 2011 .
on a note of self-interest , mr johnson can take some comfort in the fact that his job pays more than his american counterpart , earning him £ 137,000 annually , compared to £ 98,000 for the job in new york , although the job stateside comes with the plush gracie mansion in uptown manhattan .
of course , with a personal fortune estimated to be in excess of £ 5bn , mr bloomberg opts for a salary of just $ 1 a year and pays all his own expenses .
