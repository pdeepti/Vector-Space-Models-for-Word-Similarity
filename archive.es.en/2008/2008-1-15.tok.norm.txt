program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 15.01.2008 experts : political deal led to repatriation of french aid workers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether zoe 's ark aid workers were part of an adoption scam is disputed in france a french court has adapted the sentence of aid workers convicted of child trafficking in chad .
political deals behind closed doors , and not due process , made their return home possible in the first place , experts say . on monday , jan .
14 , six french aid workers convicted of kidnapping 103 children in the central african country of chad went before a court in the paris suburb of creteil . however , their punishment had already been decided last december : chad judges sentenced the charity workers to eight years of forced labor and a collective fine of 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 9.2 million -rrb- on charges of child trafficking for zoe 's ark , a humanitarian aid organization . due to the intervention of french president nicolas sarkozy , the group was repatriated to france two days after the chadian sentence was meted out . since france has the largest contingent in a multilateral peacekeeping operation in eastern chad , near the sudanese border , and even saved chadian president idriss deby 's regime from being overthrown by rebels , sarkozy was able to exercise some political leverage on behalf of the aid workers , said antoine comte , a french expert on extradition and criminal law . " the repatriation was a done political deal between two heads of state that was carried out behind closed doors and had nothing to do with due process , " he said . french translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no retrial of the repatriated aid workers but french judges were asked to adapt the prison sentence in accordance with the terms of a 1976 bilateral accord between france and chad , a former french colony .
translating the chadian sentence into french domestic legislation is not without its problems though , since france does not condemn its prisoners to forced labor .
so the creteil prosecutor , jean-jacques bosc , sought eight years imprisonment instead . " this case is not about a retrial on french territory , which would be a violation of international principles , " bosc said in a statement to journalists . the press office of the french justice ministry had also emphasized that the aid workers were not extradited home to stand trial , but were convicted criminals who were simply repatriated to serve out a foreign prison sentence in their own country . getting off lightly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children were not injured war orphans from darfur still , the aid workers will get off more lightly in france than in africa , other countries in the developing world , according to extradition experts .

political deals behind closed doors , and not due process , made their return home possible in the first place , experts say . on monday , jan .
14 , six french aid workers convicted of kidnapping 103 children in the central african country of chad went before a court in the paris suburb of creteil . however , their punishment had already been decided last december : chad judges sentenced the charity workers to eight years of forced labor and a collective fine of 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 9.2 million -rrb- on charges of child trafficking for zoe 's ark , a humanitarian aid organization . due to the intervention of french president nicolas sarkozy , the group was repatriated to france two days after the chadian sentence was meted out . since france has the largest contingent in a multilateral peacekeeping operation in eastern chad , near the sudanese border , and even saved chadian president idriss deby 's regime from being overthrown by rebels , sarkozy was able to exercise some political leverage on behalf of the aid workers , said antoine comte , a french expert on extradition and criminal law . " the repatriation was a done political deal between two heads of state that was carried out behind closed doors and had nothing to do with due process , " he said . french translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no retrial of the repatriated aid workers but french judges were asked to adapt the prison sentence in accordance with the terms of a 1976 bilateral accord between france and chad , a former french colony .
translating the chadian sentence into french domestic legislation is not without its problems though , since france does not condemn its prisoners to forced labor .
so the creteil prosecutor , jean-jacques bosc , sought eight years imprisonment instead . " this case is not about a retrial on french territory , which would be a violation of international principles , " bosc said in a statement to journalists . the press office of the french justice ministry had also emphasized that the aid workers were not extradited home to stand trial , but were convicted criminals who were simply repatriated to serve out a foreign prison sentence in their own country . getting off lightly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children were not injured war orphans from darfur still , the aid workers will get off more lightly in france than in africa , other countries in the developing world , according to extradition experts . " compared to europe , the prison conditions in africa , generally speaking , are horrendous , " said john r.w.d. jones , an extradition and war crimes lawyer at doughty street chambers in london .
" beating up prisoners is considered one of the perks of a prison guard 's job , the food is atrocious , and the conditions violate international human rights conventions . " france may try to translate the forced labor provision of the chadian law into harsher conditions by denying the prisoners home leave and library or exercise privileges enjoyed by others , added jones . but the problem is that the prisoners may be able to file a complaint with the european court of justice in strasbourg on the grounds that they are being denied the right to equal treatment relative to the rest of the incarcerated population , he explained . a question of politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the driving force behind the deal , comte says once back on french soil , how the prisoners are treated is no longer a legal , but a political or diplomatic issue with chad , which has no legal recourse if the prisoners are treated too well . " in all likelihood , the chadians will not necessarily want assurances that the aid workers are suffering enough in prison , but if it became public that the prisoners were being treated very leniently , that would be a humiliation for chad , " jones said .
" how this affair is handled may be more about diplomatic face-saving than about the treatment of individuals . " legal expert comte meanwhile said that the french president should have taken an altogether different route . " instead of negotiating with an african dictator , sarkozy should have used french influence to push chad into pursuing a democratic legal process in the first place , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 .
the sometimes controversial , but respected bishop is known to have had health problems last year . cardinal karl lehmann said he would resign from his post as german catholic church leader next month , after having led the country 's bishops for over 20 years . the 71-year-old has apparently been suffering from health problems , having been admitted to the hospital at the end of last year after complaining about his heart . he was unable to lead traditional christmas and new year 's services , but did return to celebrate the epiphany on jan .
6 in mainz 's cathedral , where he has been bishop since 1983 . on tuesday , jan .
15 , in his resignation letter , he wrote that now was the appropriate time to step down . " the recent appointments of new bishops has shown that it 's time for a changing of the guard , it 's time that a new generation takes over , " lehmann wrote . aachen 's bishop heinrich mussinghoff , who is also deputy chairman of the german bishops ' conference , thanked lehmann for his " unflagging service " for the catholic church , and paid tribute to him as " an excellent and reliable representative of the church and its message . " hans joachim meyer , of the central committee of german catholics , said of lehmann on tuesday : " he has set standards through his actions , which will not be forgotten . " considered to be less conservative than colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel -lrb- c -rrb- expressed good wishes to lehmann -lrb- r -rrb- on his 70th birthday in 2006 considered to be a relatively liberal catholic theologian , the cardinal is a close associate of pope benedict xvi , who is also german .
lehmann became deputy head of german bishops in 1985 and was appointed chairman in 1987 .
he has held that post longer than any other bishop . he is viewed as a moral authority in germany , and became a symbol for the catholic church in the country .
but he has not always appealed to everyone , something with which he has learned to come to terms . in an interview with public broadcaster südwestrundfunk -lrb- swr -rrb- , he said adapting to situations is important . " since i have been chairman of the catholic bishops ' conference in germany , i have learned that i must remain open during every type of discussion and that i must not alienate anyone , " he said .
" so rather than defending myself in certain situations in which it might have been called for , i just let it go . " indeed , some of his more conservative colleagues have been more than a little irked by his refusal to toe the traditional catholic line .
he tried , for instance , to be a mediator when catholic university professors protested against the vatican in 1989 . promoting dialogue between religions mediation has often been his role , also in inter-religious dialogue . nikolaus schneider , a leader within the protestant church , said about lehmann 's resignation : " he was and is a blessing , and not only for the roman-catholic church , but for all christians and for the entire country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal colleague joachim meisner has often been slammed for his ultra-conservative views kurt beck , the leader of germany 's social democratic party and premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , where mainz is located , said : " his influence went far beyond the religious circles , and was felt within the public at large . " beck noted lehmann 's ability as a brilliant theologian to reconcile situations through his humor and humane , down-to-earth approach . guido westerwelle , head of the liberal free democrats , called lehmann an " important moral authority . " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany regretted lehmann 's resignation , commenting that the bishop has been a reliable contact for jewish representatives . nonetheless , lehmann upset many muslims last year , when he spoke out against islam enjoying equal status to christianity in europe . cardinal lehmann said he would like to remain in the service of the archdiocese of mainz for several more years and would still like to contribute his knowledge in the german bishops ' conference in a non-leader role . he is still to lead the spring plenary meeting of bishops in würzburg in mid-february before stepping down . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officially , the certificate could only be used if gene technology was absent from the entire production process - milk from a cow , for example , which had been treated with medicine manufactured using genetically modified micro-organisms could not be labeled gm-free . the bundestag , germany 's parliament , is expected to approve the law next week , allowing it to be introduced in spring . watchdogs approve bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers demonstrate for the right to choose consumer watchdogs have hailed the move as a pragmatic solution .

a hamburg-based newspaper that reported last week about a computer company manager who said he had fired non-smokers now says the whole issue was a hoax . so much for investigative reporting .
the hamburg newspaper allowed itself to be duped by a computer company manager , who had said that he fired three non-smokers because they threatened disruptions after asking for a smoke-free environment . now , the hamburger morgenpost says the story was a hoax , even though it made national and international news - including , admittedly , on dw-world.de - when it " broke " last week . stephanie lamprecht , the journalist at the paper , said manager thomas joschko initially told her he had fired the three from his 10-person staff . likely thinking that where there 's smoke , there 's fire , lamprecht jumped on the story . " he said he 's a chain-smoker himself and said he was tired of smokers being hassled so much , " lamprecht told reuters news agency . " he said he was on a pro-smoker mission , " lamprecht went on .
she maintained that she had then checked some of the facts of his story last week after he called in his claim .
she also discovered that he was indeed the registered owner of a small company in büsum . hoax , or merely second thoughts ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german states have banned smoking in public places , other are on the way joschko apparently later admitted to the journalist that his original story was a hoax . the culprit of the hoax could not be reached this week by reuters for comment . but lamprecht has meanwhile tried to rectify the situation and get to the truth .
she said that she drove 120 km -lrb- 75 miles -rrb- from hamburg to büsum in northern germany on monday to try to confirm the story that has since become jaded . she said her paper planned to publish an updated version of the story sometime this week . meanwhile , lamprecht might just be thinking that she 's gotten her fingers burnt badly enough that she 's ready to switch occupations . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officially , the certificate could only be used if gene technology was absent from the entire production process - milk from a cow , for example , which had been treated with medicine manufactured using genetically modified micro-organisms could not be labeled gm-free . the bundestag , germany 's parliament , is expected to approve the law next week , allowing it to be introduced in spring . watchdogs approve bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers demonstrate for the right to choose consumer watchdogs have hailed the move as a pragmatic solution .
they say it provides farmers with greater motivation to avoid using genetically modified products such as corn and soya .
in the past , they were more likely not to go to the trouble , since they knew they would not be allowed to use the non-gm label anyway . " the new labeling will give consumers the choice to buy dairy products from animals that have not been fed with genetically modified plants , " said gerd billen from the federation of german consumer organizations in tuesday 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . " in future , the consumer will be in a position to make a political decision not to support gene technology in agriculture , " agreed thilo bode from foodwatch in the same article . experts also say that a rise in consumer demand for food carrying the new label might lead to an increase in demand for non-gm feed on the international market . misleading consumers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new labels will improve transparency however , food that is manufactured using genetically modified ingredients such as additives , vitamins and amino acids can be marked with the new labeling . this has prompted germany 's opposition to dismiss the proposed label as misleading , even though genetically modified additives may be used only when there is no alternative , they must comply with the eu 's organic regulations and may no longer contain any genetically modified micro-organisms . " this is a sneaky frontal attack on consumers and farmers who want to consume and produce non-gm products , " said renate künast from the green party . the move was announced in berlin on sunday , jan .

a hamburg-based newspaper that reported last week about a computer company manager who said he had fired non-smokers now says the whole issue was a hoax . so much for investigative reporting .
the hamburg newspaper allowed itself to be duped by a computer company manager , who had said that he fired three non-smokers because they threatened disruptions after asking for a smoke-free environment . now , the hamburger morgenpost says the story was a hoax , even though it made national and international news - including , admittedly , on dw-world.de - when it " broke " last week . stephanie lamprecht , the journalist at the paper , said manager thomas joschko initially told her he had fired the three from his 10-person staff . likely thinking that where there 's smoke , there 's fire , lamprecht jumped on the story . " he said he 's a chain-smoker himself and said he was tired of smokers being hassled so much , " lamprecht told reuters news agency . " he said he was on a pro-smoker mission , " lamprecht went on .
she maintained that she had then checked some of the facts of his story last week after he called in his claim .
she also discovered that he was indeed the registered owner of a small company in büsum . hoax , or merely second thoughts ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german states have banned smoking in public places , other are on the way joschko apparently later admitted to the journalist that his original story was a hoax . the culprit of the hoax could not be reached this week by reuters for comment . but lamprecht has meanwhile tried to rectify the situation and get to the truth .
she said that she drove 120 km -lrb- 75 miles -rrb- from hamburg to büsum in northern germany on monday to try to confirm the story that has since become jaded . she said her paper planned to publish an updated version of the story sometime this week . meanwhile , lamprecht might just be thinking that she 's gotten her fingers burnt badly enough that she 's ready to switch occupations . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" when the trip began , everyone was cheerful , " de graaf said to dpa .
" but the closer we got to bad arolsen , the quieter everyone became . " evers 's hands shake as he opens a package to find the brittle , yellowing id card marked " personsbewijs " in dutch inside and glimpses the photograph of a gaunt , serious-looking man .

" mixed feelings toward germans evers ' stepson , gerjo mulder , explained to dpa : " it 's beyond belief for him that people could be so cruel to one another here , in the middle of europe .
i ca n't grasp it myself .
i 'm trying to put myself in his shoes .
but i 'm just 35 . " asked whether he hates the germans , dutchman mulder said , " that 's all in the past , " but then adds : " except when we 're playing soccer against them . " viewing his dead brother 's concentration-camp registration card , willem dorgelo , said , " i keep trying to tell myself that it was n't ' the germans , ' it was adolf hitler .
well , i try anyway . " " they worked him to death , starved him , gave him no winter clothes .
he did n't survive , " he said , turning over a wallet in his hand that used to belong to a man who has been dead for 63 years . standing next to him , johan dorgelo , willem 's son , said : " i hardly have anything to remember my father by .

probably one of the most famous portraits in the world , leonardo da vinci 's mona lisa has long baffled the art critics - not least the question : who is she ?
german academics think they 've just found the answer . she might be around 500 years old , but she 's as beguiling as ever .
and now , we apparently know for a fact who she is .
an academic at heidelberg university is confident that the centuries-old mystery surrounding the identity of mona lisa has been solved .
according to veit probst , director of the heidelberg university library , she is " undoubtedly " lisa gherardini .
the wife of wealthy florentine merchant francesco del giocondo has long been seen as the most likely model - the painting dating back to the early 16th century is also known as " la gioconda " - but art historians have often debated whether the smiling woman might have been da vinci 's lover , his mother or even the artist himself .
over the years , other potential sitters for the portrait have included isabella of aragon and constanza d 'avalos , duchess of francavilla , a patron of leonardo and mistress of giuliano de medici .
definitive confirmation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidelberg university has put paid to the conspiracy theories but probst has now revealed that dated notes scribbled in the margins of a book at heidelberg university library by its owner in october 1503 , first found by armin schlechter , a manuscript expert , confirm once and for all that lisa del giocondo was indeed the model , and her husband most likely the man who commissioned the portrait .
nonetheless , the couple never owned the painting themselves .
in 1506 , leonardo took it with him to france , where he sold it to king francois i , who kept it at fontainebleau , where it remained until given to louis xiv .
reuters reported that the notes were made by a florentine city official , agostino vespucci , an acquaintance of the artist , in a collection of letters by the roman orator cicero .
the comments compare leonardo to the ancient greek artist apelles and say he was working on three paintings at the time , one of them a portrait of lisa del giocondo .
a breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : da vinci was part of the italian renaissance art experts have hailed the heidelberg discovery as a breakthrough and the earliest mention linking the merchant 's wife to the portrait , which hangs in the louvre in paris .
" there is no reason for any lingering doubts that this is another woman , " leipzig university art historian frank zöllner told a german radio station .
" one could even say that books written about all this in the past few years were unnecessary . "
the heidelberg notes were actually discovered by armin schlechter over two years ago in the library , a spokeswoman said .
although the findings had been printed in the library 's public catalog they had not been widely publicized and had received little attention until a german broadcaster decided to do some recording at the library , she said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the wife of wealthy florentine merchant francesco del giocondo has long been seen as the most likely model - the painting dating back to the early 16th century is also known as " la gioconda " - but art historians have often debated whether the smiling woman might have been da vinci 's lover , his mother or even the artist himself .

nonetheless , the couple never owned the painting themselves .
in 1506 , leonardo took it with him to france , where he sold it to king francois i , who kept it at fontainebleau , where it remained until given to louis xiv .
reuters reported that the notes were made by a florentine city official , agostino vespucci , an acquaintance of the artist , in a collection of letters by the roman orator cicero .
the comments compare leonardo to the ancient greek artist apelles and say he was working on three paintings at the time , one of them a portrait of lisa del giocondo .

according to veit probst , director of the heidelberg university library , she is " undoubtedly " lisa gherardini .
the wife of wealthy florentine merchant francesco del giocondo has long been seen as the most likely model - the painting dating back to the early 16th century is also known as " la gioconda " - but art historians have often debated whether the smiling woman might have been da vinci 's lover , his mother or even the artist himself .
over the years , other potential sitters for the portrait have included isabella of aragon and constanza d 'avalos , duchess of francavilla , a patron of leonardo and mistress of giuliano de medici .
definitive confirmation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidelberg university has put paid to the conspiracy theories but probst has now revealed that dated notes scribbled in the margins of a book at heidelberg university library by its owner in october 1503 , first found by armin schlechter , a manuscript expert , confirm once and for all that lisa del giocondo was indeed the model , and her husband most likely the man who commissioned the portrait .
nonetheless , the couple never owned the painting themselves .
in 1506 , leonardo took it with him to france , where he sold it to king francois i , who kept it at fontainebleau , where it remained until given to louis xiv .
reuters reported that the notes were made by a florentine city official , agostino vespucci , an acquaintance of the artist , in a collection of letters by the roman orator cicero .
the comments compare leonardo to the ancient greek artist apelles and say he was working on three paintings at the time , one of them a portrait of lisa del giocondo .
a breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : da vinci was part of the italian renaissance art experts have hailed the heidelberg discovery as a breakthrough and the earliest mention linking the merchant 's wife to the portrait , which hangs in the louvre in paris .
" there is no reason for any lingering doubts that this is another woman , " leipzig university art historian frank zöllner told a german radio station .
" one could even say that books written about all this in the past few years were unnecessary . "
the heidelberg notes were actually discovered by armin schlechter over two years ago in the library , a spokeswoman said .
although the findings had been printed in the library 's public catalog they had not been widely publicized and had received little attention until a german broadcaster decided to do some recording at the library , she said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 15.01.2008 experts : political deal led to repatriation of french aid workers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether zoe 's ark aid workers were part of an adoption scam is disputed in france a french court has adapted the sentence of aid workers convicted of child trafficking in chad .
political deals behind closed doors , and not due process , made their return home possible in the first place , experts say . on monday , jan .
14 , six french aid workers convicted of kidnapping 103 children in the central african country of chad went before a court in the paris suburb of creteil . however , their punishment had already been decided last december : chad judges sentenced the charity workers to eight years of forced labor and a collective fine of 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 9.2 million -rrb- on charges of child trafficking for zoe 's ark , a humanitarian aid organization . due to the intervention of french president nicolas sarkozy , the group was repatriated to france two days after the chadian sentence was meted out . since france has the largest contingent in a multilateral peacekeeping operation in eastern chad , near the sudanese border , and even saved chadian president idriss deby 's regime from being overthrown by rebels , sarkozy was able to exercise some political leverage on behalf of the aid workers , said antoine comte , a french expert on extradition and criminal law . " the repatriation was a done political deal between two heads of state that was carried out behind closed doors and had nothing to do with due process , " he said . french translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no retrial of the repatriated aid workers but french judges were asked to adapt the prison sentence in accordance with the terms of a 1976 bilateral accord between france and chad , a former french colony .
translating the chadian sentence into french domestic legislation is not without its problems though , since france does not condemn its prisoners to forced labor .
so the creteil prosecutor , jean-jacques bosc , sought eight years imprisonment instead . " this case is not about a retrial on french territory , which would be a violation of international principles , " bosc said in a statement to journalists . the press office of the french justice ministry had also emphasized that the aid workers were not extradited home to stand trial , but were convicted criminals who were simply repatriated to serve out a foreign prison sentence in their own country . getting off lightly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children were not injured war orphans from darfur still , the aid workers will get off more lightly in france than in africa , other countries in the developing world , according to extradition experts . " compared to europe , the prison conditions in africa , generally speaking , are horrendous , " said john r.w.d. jones , an extradition and war crimes lawyer at doughty street chambers in london .
" beating up prisoners is considered one of the perks of a prison guard 's job , the food is atrocious , and the conditions violate international human rights conventions . " france may try to translate the forced labor provision of the chadian law into harsher conditions by denying the prisoners home leave and library or exercise privileges enjoyed by others , added jones . but the problem is that the prisoners may be able to file a complaint with the european court of justice in strasbourg on the grounds that they are being denied the right to equal treatment relative to the rest of the incarcerated population , he explained . a question of politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the driving force behind the deal , comte says once back on french soil , how the prisoners are treated is no longer a legal , but a political or diplomatic issue with chad , which has no legal recourse if the prisoners are treated too well . " in all likelihood , the chadians will not necessarily want assurances that the aid workers are suffering enough in prison , but if it became public that the prisoners were being treated very leniently , that would be a humiliation for chad , " jones said .
" how this affair is handled may be more about diplomatic face-saving than about the treatment of individuals . " legal expert comte meanwhile said that the french president should have taken an altogether different route . " instead of negotiating with an african dictator , sarkozy should have used french influence to push chad into pursuing a democratic legal process in the first place , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , six french aid workers convicted of kidnapping 103 children in the central african country of chad went before a court in the paris suburb of creteil . however , their punishment had already been decided last december : chad judges sentenced the charity workers to eight years of forced labor and a collective fine of 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 9.2 million -rrb- on charges of child trafficking for zoe 's ark , a humanitarian aid organization . due to the intervention of french president nicolas sarkozy , the group was repatriated to france two days after the chadian sentence was meted out . since france has the largest contingent in a multilateral peacekeeping operation in eastern chad , near the sudanese border , and even saved chadian president idriss deby 's regime from being overthrown by rebels , sarkozy was able to exercise some political leverage on behalf of the aid workers , said antoine comte , a french expert on extradition and criminal law . " the repatriation was a done political deal between two heads of state that was carried out behind closed doors and had nothing to do with due process , " he said . french translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no retrial of the repatriated aid workers but french judges were asked to adapt the prison sentence in accordance with the terms of a 1976 bilateral accord between france and chad , a former french colony .
translating the chadian sentence into french domestic legislation is not without its problems though , since france does not condemn its prisoners to forced labor .
so the creteil prosecutor , jean-jacques bosc , sought eight years imprisonment instead . " this case is not about a retrial on french territory , which would be a violation of international principles , " bosc said in a statement to journalists . the press office of the french justice ministry had also emphasized that the aid workers were not extradited home to stand trial , but were convicted criminals who were simply repatriated to serve out a foreign prison sentence in their own country . getting off lightly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children were not injured war orphans from darfur still , the aid workers will get off more lightly in france than in africa , other countries in the developing world , according to extradition experts . " compared to europe , the prison conditions in africa , generally speaking , are horrendous , " said john r.w.d. jones , an extradition and war crimes lawyer at doughty street chambers in london .
" beating up prisoners is considered one of the perks of a prison guard 's job , the food is atrocious , and the conditions violate international human rights conventions . " france may try to translate the forced labor provision of the chadian law into harsher conditions by denying the prisoners home leave and library or exercise privileges enjoyed by others , added jones . but the problem is that the prisoners may be able to file a complaint with the european court of justice in strasbourg on the grounds that they are being denied the right to equal treatment relative to the rest of the incarcerated population , he explained . a question of politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the driving force behind the deal , comte says once back on french soil , how the prisoners are treated is no longer a legal , but a political or diplomatic issue with chad , which has no legal recourse if the prisoners are treated too well . " in all likelihood , the chadians will not necessarily want assurances that the aid workers are suffering enough in prison , but if it became public that the prisoners were being treated very leniently , that would be a humiliation for chad , " jones said .
" how this affair is handled may be more about diplomatic face-saving than about the treatment of individuals . " legal expert comte meanwhile said that the french president should have taken an altogether different route . " instead of negotiating with an african dictator , sarkozy should have used french influence to push chad into pursuing a democratic legal process in the first place , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political deals behind closed doors , and not due process , made their return home possible in the first place , experts say . on monday , jan .
14 , six french aid workers convicted of kidnapping 103 children in the central african country of chad went before a court in the paris suburb of creteil . however , their punishment had already been decided last december : chad judges sentenced the charity workers to eight years of forced labor and a collective fine of 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 9.2 million -rrb- on charges of child trafficking for zoe 's ark , a humanitarian aid organization . due to the intervention of french president nicolas sarkozy , the group was repatriated to france two days after the chadian sentence was meted out . since france has the largest contingent in a multilateral peacekeeping operation in eastern chad , near the sudanese border , and even saved chadian president idriss deby 's regime from being overthrown by rebels , sarkozy was able to exercise some political leverage on behalf of the aid workers , said antoine comte , a french expert on extradition and criminal law . " the repatriation was a done political deal between two heads of state that was carried out behind closed doors and had nothing to do with due process , " he said . french translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no retrial of the repatriated aid workers but french judges were asked to adapt the prison sentence in accordance with the terms of a 1976 bilateral accord between france and chad , a former french colony .
translating the chadian sentence into french domestic legislation is not without its problems though , since france does not condemn its prisoners to forced labor .
so the creteil prosecutor , jean-jacques bosc , sought eight years imprisonment instead . " this case is not about a retrial on french territory , which would be a violation of international principles , " bosc said in a statement to journalists . the press office of the french justice ministry had also emphasized that the aid workers were not extradited home to stand trial , but were convicted criminals who were simply repatriated to serve out a foreign prison sentence in their own country . getting off lightly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children were not injured war orphans from darfur still , the aid workers will get off more lightly in france than in africa , other countries in the developing world , according to extradition experts . " compared to europe , the prison conditions in africa , generally speaking , are horrendous , " said john r.w.d. jones , an extradition and war crimes lawyer at doughty street chambers in london .
" beating up prisoners is considered one of the perks of a prison guard 's job , the food is atrocious , and the conditions violate international human rights conventions . " france may try to translate the forced labor provision of the chadian law into harsher conditions by denying the prisoners home leave and library or exercise privileges enjoyed by others , added jones . but the problem is that the prisoners may be able to file a complaint with the european court of justice in strasbourg on the grounds that they are being denied the right to equal treatment relative to the rest of the incarcerated population , he explained . a question of politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the driving force behind the deal , comte says once back on french soil , how the prisoners are treated is no longer a legal , but a political or diplomatic issue with chad , which has no legal recourse if the prisoners are treated too well .

18 .
the sometimes controversial , but respected bishop is known to have had health problems last year . cardinal karl lehmann said he would resign from his post as german catholic church leader next month , after having led the country 's bishops for over 20 years . the 71-year-old has apparently been suffering from health problems , having been admitted to the hospital at the end of last year after complaining about his heart . he was unable to lead traditional christmas and new year 's services , but did return to celebrate the epiphany on jan .
6 in mainz 's cathedral , where he has been bishop since 1983 . on tuesday , jan .
15 , in his resignation letter , he wrote that now was the appropriate time to step down . " the recent appointments of new bishops has shown that it 's time for a changing of the guard , it 's time that a new generation takes over , " lehmann wrote . aachen 's bishop heinrich mussinghoff , who is also deputy chairman of the german bishops ' conference , thanked lehmann for his " unflagging service " for the catholic church , and paid tribute to him as " an excellent and reliable representative of the church and its message . " hans joachim meyer , of the central committee of german catholics , said of lehmann on tuesday : " he has set standards through his actions , which will not be forgotten . " considered to be less conservative than colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel -lrb- c -rrb- expressed good wishes to lehmann -lrb- r -rrb- on his 70th birthday in 2006 considered to be a relatively liberal catholic theologian , the cardinal is a close associate of pope benedict xvi , who is also german .
lehmann became deputy head of german bishops in 1985 and was appointed chairman in 1987 .
he has held that post longer than any other bishop . he is viewed as a moral authority in germany , and became a symbol for the catholic church in the country .
but he has not always appealed to everyone , something with which he has learned to come to terms . in an interview with public broadcaster südwestrundfunk -lrb- swr -rrb- , he said adapting to situations is important . " since i have been chairman of the catholic bishops ' conference in germany , i have learned that i must remain open during every type of discussion and that i must not alienate anyone , " he said .
" so rather than defending myself in certain situations in which it might have been called for , i just let it go . " indeed , some of his more conservative colleagues have been more than a little irked by his refusal to toe the traditional catholic line .
he tried , for instance , to be a mediator when catholic university professors protested against the vatican in 1989 . promoting dialogue between religions mediation has often been his role , also in inter-religious dialogue . nikolaus schneider , a leader within the protestant church , said about lehmann 's resignation : " he was and is a blessing , and not only for the roman-catholic church , but for all christians and for the entire country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal colleague joachim meisner has often been slammed for his ultra-conservative views kurt beck , the leader of germany 's social democratic party and premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , where mainz is located , said : " his influence went far beyond the religious circles , and was felt within the public at large . " beck noted lehmann 's ability as a brilliant theologian to reconcile situations through his humor and humane , down-to-earth approach . guido westerwelle , head of the liberal free democrats , called lehmann an " important moral authority . " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany regretted lehmann 's resignation , commenting that the bishop has been a reliable contact for jewish representatives . nonetheless , lehmann upset many muslims last year , when he spoke out against islam enjoying equal status to christianity in europe . cardinal lehmann said he would like to remain in the service of the archdiocese of mainz for several more years and would still like to contribute his knowledge in the german bishops ' conference in a non-leader role . he is still to lead the spring plenary meeting of bishops in würzburg in mid-february before stepping down . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 .
the sometimes controversial , but respected bishop is known to have had health problems last year . cardinal karl lehmann said he would resign from his post as german catholic church leader next month , after having led the country 's bishops for over 20 years . the 71-year-old has apparently been suffering from health problems , having been admitted to the hospital at the end of last year after complaining about his heart . he was unable to lead traditional christmas and new year 's services , but did return to celebrate the epiphany on jan .
6 in mainz 's cathedral , where he has been bishop since 1983 . on tuesday , jan .
15 , in his resignation letter , he wrote that now was the appropriate time to step down . " the recent appointments of new bishops has shown that it 's time for a changing of the guard , it 's time that a new generation takes over , " lehmann wrote . aachen 's bishop heinrich mussinghoff , who is also deputy chairman of the german bishops ' conference , thanked lehmann for his " unflagging service " for the catholic church , and paid tribute to him as " an excellent and reliable representative of the church and its message . " hans joachim meyer , of the central committee of german catholics , said of lehmann on tuesday : " he has set standards through his actions , which will not be forgotten . " considered to be less conservative than colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel -lrb- c -rrb- expressed good wishes to lehmann -lrb- r -rrb- on his 70th birthday in 2006 considered to be a relatively liberal catholic theologian , the cardinal is a close associate of pope benedict xvi , who is also german .
lehmann became deputy head of german bishops in 1985 and was appointed chairman in 1987 .
he has held that post longer than any other bishop . he is viewed as a moral authority in germany , and became a symbol for the catholic church in the country .
but he has not always appealed to everyone , something with which he has learned to come to terms . in an interview with public broadcaster südwestrundfunk -lrb- swr -rrb- , he said adapting to situations is important . " since i have been chairman of the catholic bishops ' conference in germany , i have learned that i must remain open during every type of discussion and that i must not alienate anyone , " he said .
" so rather than defending myself in certain situations in which it might have been called for , i just let it go . " indeed , some of his more conservative colleagues have been more than a little irked by his refusal to toe the traditional catholic line .
he tried , for instance , to be a mediator when catholic university professors protested against the vatican in 1989 . promoting dialogue between religions mediation has often been his role , also in inter-religious dialogue . nikolaus schneider , a leader within the protestant church , said about lehmann 's resignation : " he was and is a blessing , and not only for the roman-catholic church , but for all christians and for the entire country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal colleague joachim meisner has often been slammed for his ultra-conservative views kurt beck , the leader of germany 's social democratic party and premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , where mainz is located , said : " his influence went far beyond the religious circles , and was felt within the public at large . " beck noted lehmann 's ability as a brilliant theologian to reconcile situations through his humor and humane , down-to-earth approach . guido westerwelle , head of the liberal free democrats , called lehmann an " important moral authority . " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany regretted lehmann 's resignation , commenting that the bishop has been a reliable contact for jewish representatives . nonetheless , lehmann upset many muslims last year , when he spoke out against islam enjoying equal status to christianity in europe . cardinal lehmann said he would like to remain in the service of the archdiocese of mainz for several more years and would still like to contribute his knowledge in the german bishops ' conference in a non-leader role . he is still to lead the spring plenary meeting of bishops in würzburg in mid-february before stepping down . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the recent appointments of new bishops has shown that it 's time for a changing of the guard , it 's time that a new generation takes over , " lehmann wrote . aachen 's bishop heinrich mussinghoff , who is also deputy chairman of the german bishops ' conference , thanked lehmann for his " unflagging service " for the catholic church , and paid tribute to him as " an excellent and reliable representative of the church and its message . " hans joachim meyer , of the central committee of german catholics , said of lehmann on tuesday : " he has set standards through his actions , which will not be forgotten . " considered to be less conservative than colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel -lrb- c -rrb- expressed good wishes to lehmann -lrb- r -rrb- on his 70th birthday in 2006 considered to be a relatively liberal catholic theologian , the cardinal is a close associate of pope benedict xvi , who is also german .
lehmann became deputy head of german bishops in 1985 and was appointed chairman in 1987 .
he has held that post longer than any other bishop . he is viewed as a moral authority in germany , and became a symbol for the catholic church in the country .
but he has not always appealed to everyone , something with which he has learned to come to terms . in an interview with public broadcaster südwestrundfunk -lrb- swr -rrb- , he said adapting to situations is important . " since i have been chairman of the catholic bishops ' conference in germany , i have learned that i must remain open during every type of discussion and that i must not alienate anyone , " he said .
" so rather than defending myself in certain situations in which it might have been called for , i just let it go . " indeed , some of his more conservative colleagues have been more than a little irked by his refusal to toe the traditional catholic line .
he tried , for instance , to be a mediator when catholic university professors protested against the vatican in 1989 . promoting dialogue between religions mediation has often been his role , also in inter-religious dialogue . nikolaus schneider , a leader within the protestant church , said about lehmann 's resignation : " he was and is a blessing , and not only for the roman-catholic church , but for all christians and for the entire country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal colleague joachim meisner has often been slammed for his ultra-conservative views kurt beck , the leader of germany 's social democratic party and premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , where mainz is located , said : " his influence went far beyond the religious circles , and was felt within the public at large . " beck noted lehmann 's ability as a brilliant theologian to reconcile situations through his humor and humane , down-to-earth approach . guido westerwelle , head of the liberal free democrats , called lehmann an " important moral authority . " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany regretted lehmann 's resignation , commenting that the bishop has been a reliable contact for jewish representatives . nonetheless , lehmann upset many muslims last year , when he spoke out against islam enjoying equal status to christianity in europe . cardinal lehmann said he would like to remain in the service of the archdiocese of mainz for several more years and would still like to contribute his knowledge in the german bishops ' conference in a non-leader role . he is still to lead the spring plenary meeting of bishops in würzburg in mid-february before stepping down . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a hamburg-based newspaper that reported last week about a computer company manager who said he had fired non-smokers now says the whole issue was a hoax . so much for investigative reporting .
the hamburg newspaper allowed itself to be duped by a computer company manager , who had said that he fired three non-smokers because they threatened disruptions after asking for a smoke-free environment . now , the hamburger morgenpost says the story was a hoax , even though it made national and international news - including , admittedly , on dw-world.de - when it " broke " last week . stephanie lamprecht , the journalist at the paper , said manager thomas joschko initially told her he had fired the three from his 10-person staff . likely thinking that where there 's smoke , there 's fire , lamprecht jumped on the story . " he said he 's a chain-smoker himself and said he was tired of smokers being hassled so much , " lamprecht told reuters news agency . " he said he was on a pro-smoker mission , " lamprecht went on .
she maintained that she had then checked some of the facts of his story last week after he called in his claim .
she also discovered that he was indeed the registered owner of a small company in büsum . hoax , or merely second thoughts ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german states have banned smoking in public places , other are on the way joschko apparently later admitted to the journalist that his original story was a hoax . the culprit of the hoax could not be reached this week by reuters for comment . but lamprecht has meanwhile tried to rectify the situation and get to the truth .
she said that she drove 120 km -lrb- 75 miles -rrb- from hamburg to büsum in northern germany on monday to try to confirm the story that has since become jaded . she said her paper planned to publish an updated version of the story sometime this week . meanwhile , lamprecht might just be thinking that she 's gotten her fingers burnt badly enough that she 's ready to switch occupations . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

probably one of the most famous portraits in the world , leonardo da vinci 's mona lisa has long baffled the art critics - not least the question : who is she ?
german academics think they 've just found the answer . she might be around 500 years old , but she 's as beguiling as ever .
and now , we apparently know for a fact who she is .
an academic at heidelberg university is confident that the centuries-old mystery surrounding the identity of mona lisa has been solved .
according to veit probst , director of the heidelberg university library , she is " undoubtedly " lisa gherardini .
the wife of wealthy florentine merchant francesco del giocondo has long been seen as the most likely model - the painting dating back to the early 16th century is also known as " la gioconda " - but art historians have often debated whether the smiling woman might have been da vinci 's lover , his mother or even the artist himself .
over the years , other potential sitters for the portrait have included isabella of aragon and constanza d 'avalos , duchess of francavilla , a patron of leonardo and mistress of giuliano de medici .
definitive confirmation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidelberg university has put paid to the conspiracy theories but probst has now revealed that dated notes scribbled in the margins of a book at heidelberg university library by its owner in october 1503 , first found by armin schlechter , a manuscript expert , confirm once and for all that lisa del giocondo was indeed the model , and her husband most likely the man who commissioned the portrait .
nonetheless , the couple never owned the painting themselves .
in 1506 , leonardo took it with him to france , where he sold it to king francois i , who kept it at fontainebleau , where it remained until given to louis xiv .
reuters reported that the notes were made by a florentine city official , agostino vespucci , an acquaintance of the artist , in a collection of letters by the roman orator cicero .
the comments compare leonardo to the ancient greek artist apelles and say he was working on three paintings at the time , one of them a portrait of lisa del giocondo .
a breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : da vinci was part of the italian renaissance art experts have hailed the heidelberg discovery as a breakthrough and the earliest mention linking the merchant 's wife to the portrait , which hangs in the louvre in paris .
" there is no reason for any lingering doubts that this is another woman , " leipzig university art historian frank zöllner told a german radio station .
" one could even say that books written about all this in the past few years were unnecessary . "
the heidelberg notes were actually discovered by armin schlechter over two years ago in the library , a spokeswoman said .

but government officials already cautioned that it wo n't stay like that for long . in 2007 , the german government received 70 million euros -lrb- $ 103 million -rrb- more than it spent , according to figures released by federal statistical office -lrb- destatis -rrb- in wiesbaden on tuesday , jan .
15 . last year , the budget deficit ran at 1.6 percent , or nearly 37 million euros . during the period 2002-2005 , the government had breached a european union-mandated limit of 3 percent of gdp , but brussels suspended its deficit procedures against germany in june last year . the increase in value-added tax from 16 percent to 19 percent at the start of 2007 was partly responsible for the balanced budget . for the coming year , however , the german government expects the deficit to grow again , as recent business tax and unemployment insurance reforms will result in reduced tax takings . solid economic growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's growth is primarily export driven the destatis figures showed the german economy grew by 2.5 percent last year .
this was down on 2006 which experienced 2.9 percent growth - the fastest expansion since the turn of the decade . exports and investment were the main drivers of germany ’ s growth in 2007 .
destatis said german exports , a traditional strong point , grew by 8.3 percent last year and accounted for more than half of the growth in gdp . slow down expected the statistics office has not yet published fourth quarter figures , but german industrial production , exports and retail sales declined in november , suggesting the economy is losing momentum . the outlook for 2008 in the eurozone ’ s biggest economy appears less rosy , with oil trading close to record prices , the euro 's strength against the us dollar raising fears over the competitiveness of exports , and concern still strong over the fallout from the us subprime housing credit crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dollar has been falling against the euro economy minister michael glos recently has said that he plans to revise downward the government 's 2008 growth forecast of 2 percent , although he has not specified a new figure . falling investor confidence meanwhile , german investor confidence has hit its lowest point in 15 years , according to a much-watched survey conducted by the mannheim based zew center for economic research .
zew said its economic sentiment indicator , based on surveys of 270 analysts , fell by 4.4 percent and are now at minus 41.6 points - a figure which is considerably under the average of 31 points . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but government officials already cautioned that it wo n't stay like that for long . in 2007 , the german government received 70 million euros -lrb- $ 103 million -rrb- more than it spent , according to figures released by federal statistical office -lrb- destatis -rrb- in wiesbaden on tuesday , jan .
15 . last year , the budget deficit ran at 1.6 percent , or nearly 37 million euros . during the period 2002-2005 , the government had breached a european union-mandated limit of 3 percent of gdp , but brussels suspended its deficit procedures against germany in june last year . the increase in value-added tax from 16 percent to 19 percent at the start of 2007 was partly responsible for the balanced budget . for the coming year , however , the german government expects the deficit to grow again , as recent business tax and unemployment insurance reforms will result in reduced tax takings . solid economic growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's growth is primarily export driven the destatis figures showed the german economy grew by 2.5 percent last year .

destatis said german exports , a traditional strong point , grew by 8.3 percent last year and accounted for more than half of the growth in gdp . slow down expected the statistics office has not yet published fourth quarter figures , but german industrial production , exports and retail sales declined in november , suggesting the economy is losing momentum . the outlook for 2008 in the eurozone ’ s biggest economy appears less rosy , with oil trading close to record prices , the euro 's strength against the us dollar raising fears over the competitiveness of exports , and concern still strong over the fallout from the us subprime housing credit crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dollar has been falling against the euro economy minister michael glos recently has said that he plans to revise downward the government 's 2008 growth forecast of 2 percent , although he has not specified a new figure . falling investor confidence meanwhile , german investor confidence has hit its lowest point in 15 years , according to a much-watched survey conducted by the mannheim based zew center for economic research .

political deals behind closed doors , and not due process , made their return home possible in the first place , experts say . on monday , jan .
14 , six french aid workers convicted of kidnapping 103 children in the central african country of chad went before a court in the paris suburb of creteil . however , their punishment had already been decided last december : chad judges sentenced the charity workers to eight years of forced labor and a collective fine of 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 9.2 million -rrb- on charges of child trafficking for zoe 's ark , a humanitarian aid organization . due to the intervention of french president nicolas sarkozy , the group was repatriated to france two days after the chadian sentence was meted out . since france has the largest contingent in a multilateral peacekeeping operation in eastern chad , near the sudanese border , and even saved chadian president idriss deby 's regime from being overthrown by rebels , sarkozy was able to exercise some political leverage on behalf of the aid workers , said antoine comte , a french expert on extradition and criminal law . " the repatriation was a done political deal between two heads of state that was carried out behind closed doors and had nothing to do with due process , " he said . french translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no retrial of the repatriated aid workers but french judges were asked to adapt the prison sentence in accordance with the terms of a 1976 bilateral accord between france and chad , a former french colony .
translating the chadian sentence into french domestic legislation is not without its problems though , since france does not condemn its prisoners to forced labor .
so the creteil prosecutor , jean-jacques bosc , sought eight years imprisonment instead . " this case is not about a retrial on french territory , which would be a violation of international principles , " bosc said in a statement to journalists . the press office of the french justice ministry had also emphasized that the aid workers were not extradited home to stand trial , but were convicted criminals who were simply repatriated to serve out a foreign prison sentence in their own country . getting off lightly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children were not injured war orphans from darfur still , the aid workers will get off more lightly in france than in africa , other countries in the developing world , according to extradition experts . " compared to europe , the prison conditions in africa , generally speaking , are horrendous , " said john r.w.d. jones , an extradition and war crimes lawyer at doughty street chambers in london .
" beating up prisoners is considered one of the perks of a prison guard 's job , the food is atrocious , and the conditions violate international human rights conventions . " france may try to translate the forced labor provision of the chadian law into harsher conditions by denying the prisoners home leave and library or exercise privileges enjoyed by others , added jones . but the problem is that the prisoners may be able to file a complaint with the european court of justice in strasbourg on the grounds that they are being denied the right to equal treatment relative to the rest of the incarcerated population , he explained . a question of politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the driving force behind the deal , comte says once back on french soil , how the prisoners are treated is no longer a legal , but a political or diplomatic issue with chad , which has no legal recourse if the prisoners are treated too well . " in all likelihood , the chadians will not necessarily want assurances that the aid workers are suffering enough in prison , but if it became public that the prisoners were being treated very leniently , that would be a humiliation for chad , " jones said .
" how this affair is handled may be more about diplomatic face-saving than about the treatment of individuals . " legal expert comte meanwhile said that the french president should have taken an altogether different route . " instead of negotiating with an african dictator , sarkozy should have used french influence to push chad into pursuing a democratic legal process in the first place , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 . the personal effects have been locked up in red cross archives in bad arolsen , in central germany , for decades . viewing the items evokes ghosts from the past , said gerrit jan evers , who learned just a few weeks ago that the effects had been discovered . " so many died .
and now , 63 years later , i 'm here holding my father 's identity card in my hand , " evers told dpa news agency . the items include an old pocket watch with cracked , yellow glass and its case , a scratched-up lock and key and a photograph with writing on the back that is hard to discern . the nazis had kept all the items packed in boxes , which were then confiscated by the allies at the end of the war . files on over 17 million people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the victims ' descendents are speechless when they view the personal effects the red cross ' own international tracing service supervises the archive of captured files on some 17.5 million non-germans persecuted by the nazis or displaced during world war ii . within the files , personal letters , jewelry and other private papers are sometimes found .
the red cross staff then notifies next of kin and sends the items to them .
monday was the first time relatives came themselves to collect items at the bad arolsen archive . evert de graaf , a dutch historian , explained the history to dpa : " evers 's father was caught up in a wave of arrests by the nazis , " he said .
" after a resistance attack on german soldiers , they sent about 600 dutch people to the concentration camps on oct .
1-2 , 1944 . " de graaf and his colleagues are collaborating with the red cross to investigate what happened to the victims . " we found files on 80 of them , and an envelope containing personal effects was attached to eight of them , " the historian said . mood becomes sober and reflective on monday , six months later , the eight families traveled to bad arolsen in a chartered bus to collect the personal effects . " when the trip began , everyone was cheerful , " de graaf said to dpa .
" but the closer we got to bad arolsen , the quieter everyone became . " evers 's hands shake as he opens a package to find the brittle , yellowing id card marked " personsbewijs " in dutch inside and glimpses the photograph of a gaunt , serious-looking man . " that 's my father , " he says softly . evers is named after his father but has no recollection of him other than his mother 's anecdotes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international tracing service helps families track the fate of their victimized relatives gerrit evers senior died of exhaustion in december 1944 at neuengamme concentration camp , near hamburg .
three weeks later , his son was born in the netherlands . stifling his emotions , evers puts away the card and murmurs , " so many people . " mixed feelings toward germans evers ' stepson , gerjo mulder , explained to dpa : " it 's beyond belief for him that people could be so cruel to one another here , in the middle of europe .
i ca n't grasp it myself .
i 'm trying to put myself in his shoes .
but i 'm just 35 . " asked whether he hates the germans , dutchman mulder said , " that 's all in the past , " but then adds : " except when we 're playing soccer against them . " viewing his dead brother 's concentration-camp registration card , willem dorgelo , said , " i keep trying to tell myself that it was n't ' the germans , ' it was adolf hitler .
well , i try anyway . " " they worked him to death , starved him , gave him no winter clothes .
he did n't survive , " he said , turning over a wallet in his hand that used to belong to a man who has been dead for 63 years . standing next to him , johan dorgelo , willem 's son , said : " i hardly have anything to remember my father by .

officially , the certificate could only be used if gene technology was absent from the entire production process - milk from a cow , for example , which had been treated with medicine manufactured using genetically modified micro-organisms could not be labeled gm-free . the bundestag , germany 's parliament , is expected to approve the law next week , allowing it to be introduced in spring . watchdogs approve bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers demonstrate for the right to choose consumer watchdogs have hailed the move as a pragmatic solution .
they say it provides farmers with greater motivation to avoid using genetically modified products such as corn and soya .
in the past , they were more likely not to go to the trouble , since they knew they would not be allowed to use the non-gm label anyway . " the new labeling will give consumers the choice to buy dairy products from animals that have not been fed with genetically modified plants , " said gerd billen from the federation of german consumer organizations in tuesday 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . " in future , the consumer will be in a position to make a political decision not to support gene technology in agriculture , " agreed thilo bode from foodwatch in the same article . experts also say that a rise in consumer demand for food carrying the new label might lead to an increase in demand for non-gm feed on the international market . misleading consumers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new labels will improve transparency however , food that is manufactured using genetically modified ingredients such as additives , vitamins and amino acids can be marked with the new labeling . this has prompted germany 's opposition to dismiss the proposed label as misleading , even though genetically modified additives may be used only when there is no alternative , they must comply with the eu 's organic regulations and may no longer contain any genetically modified micro-organisms . " this is a sneaky frontal attack on consumers and farmers who want to consume and produce non-gm products , " said renate künast from the green party . the move was announced in berlin on sunday , jan .
13 , the same day the us said it would temporarily hold fire on sanctions on european union goods in a last-ditch attempt to resolve a bitter trade dispute over genetically modified crops . the eu missed a world trade organization deadline friday to comply with a decision against eu restrictions on some genetically modified organisms . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the sometimes controversial , but respected bishop is known to have had health problems last year . cardinal karl lehmann said he would resign from his post as german catholic church leader next month , after having led the country 's bishops for over 20 years . the 71-year-old has apparently been suffering from health problems , having been admitted to the hospital at the end of last year after complaining about his heart . he was unable to lead traditional christmas and new year 's services , but did return to celebrate the epiphany on jan .
6 in mainz 's cathedral , where he has been bishop since 1983 . on tuesday , jan .
15 , in his resignation letter , he wrote that now was the appropriate time to step down . " the recent appointments of new bishops has shown that it 's time for a changing of the guard , it 's time that a new generation takes over , " lehmann wrote . aachen 's bishop heinrich mussinghoff , who is also deputy chairman of the german bishops ' conference , thanked lehmann for his " unflagging service " for the catholic church , and paid tribute to him as " an excellent and reliable representative of the church and its message .

lehmann became deputy head of german bishops in 1985 and was appointed chairman in 1987 .
he has held that post longer than any other bishop . he is viewed as a moral authority in germany , and became a symbol for the catholic church in the country .
but he has not always appealed to everyone , something with which he has learned to come to terms . in an interview with public broadcaster südwestrundfunk -lrb- swr -rrb- , he said adapting to situations is important . " since i have been chairman of the catholic bishops ' conference in germany , i have learned that i must remain open during every type of discussion and that i must not alienate anyone , " he said .
" so rather than defending myself in certain situations in which it might have been called for , i just let it go . " indeed , some of his more conservative colleagues have been more than a little irked by his refusal to toe the traditional catholic line .
he tried , for instance , to be a mediator when catholic university professors protested against the vatican in 1989 . promoting dialogue between religions mediation has often been his role , also in inter-religious dialogue . nikolaus schneider , a leader within the protestant church , said about lehmann 's resignation : " he was and is a blessing , and not only for the roman-catholic church , but for all christians and for the entire country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal colleague joachim meisner has often been slammed for his ultra-conservative views kurt beck , the leader of germany 's social democratic party and premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , where mainz is located , said : " his influence went far beyond the religious circles , and was felt within the public at large .

probably one of the most famous portraits in the world , leonardo da vinci 's mona lisa has long baffled the art critics - not least the question : who is she ?
german academics think they 've just found the answer . she might be around 500 years old , but she 's as beguiling as ever .
and now , we apparently know for a fact who she is .
an academic at heidelberg university is confident that the centuries-old mystery surrounding the identity of mona lisa has been solved .
according to veit probst , director of the heidelberg university library , she is " undoubtedly " lisa gherardini .
the wife of wealthy florentine merchant francesco del giocondo has long been seen as the most likely model - the painting dating back to the early 16th century is also known as " la gioconda " - but art historians have often debated whether the smiling woman might have been da vinci 's lover , his mother or even the artist himself .
over the years , other potential sitters for the portrait have included isabella of aragon and constanza d 'avalos , duchess of francavilla , a patron of leonardo and mistress of giuliano de medici .
definitive confirmation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidelberg university has put paid to the conspiracy theories but probst has now revealed that dated notes scribbled in the margins of a book at heidelberg university library by its owner in october 1503 , first found by armin schlechter , a manuscript expert , confirm once and for all that lisa del giocondo was indeed the model , and her husband most likely the man who commissioned the portrait .
nonetheless , the couple never owned the painting themselves .
in 1506 , leonardo took it with him to france , where he sold it to king francois i , who kept it at fontainebleau , where it remained until given to louis xiv .
reuters reported that the notes were made by a florentine city official , agostino vespucci , an acquaintance of the artist , in a collection of letters by the roman orator cicero .
the comments compare leonardo to the ancient greek artist apelles and say he was working on three paintings at the time , one of them a portrait of lisa del giocondo .
a breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : da vinci was part of the italian renaissance art experts have hailed the heidelberg discovery as a breakthrough and the earliest mention linking the merchant 's wife to the portrait , which hangs in the louvre in paris .
" there is no reason for any lingering doubts that this is another woman , " leipzig university art historian frank zöllner told a german radio station .
" one could even say that books written about all this in the past few years were unnecessary . "
the heidelberg notes were actually discovered by armin schlechter over two years ago in the library , a spokeswoman said .
although the findings had been printed in the library 's public catalog they had not been widely publicized and had received little attention until a german broadcaster decided to do some recording at the library , she said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

probably one of the most famous portraits in the world , leonardo da vinci 's mona lisa has long baffled the art critics - not least the question : who is she ?
german academics think they 've just found the answer . she might be around 500 years old , but she 's as beguiling as ever .
and now , we apparently know for a fact who she is .
an academic at heidelberg university is confident that the centuries-old mystery surrounding the identity of mona lisa has been solved .
according to veit probst , director of the heidelberg university library , she is " undoubtedly " lisa gherardini .
the wife of wealthy florentine merchant francesco del giocondo has long been seen as the most likely model - the painting dating back to the early 16th century is also known as " la gioconda " - but art historians have often debated whether the smiling woman might have been da vinci 's lover , his mother or even the artist himself .
over the years , other potential sitters for the portrait have included isabella of aragon and constanza d 'avalos , duchess of francavilla , a patron of leonardo and mistress of giuliano de medici .
definitive confirmation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidelberg university has put paid to the conspiracy theories but probst has now revealed that dated notes scribbled in the margins of a book at heidelberg university library by its owner in october 1503 , first found by armin schlechter , a manuscript expert , confirm once and for all that lisa del giocondo was indeed the model , and her husband most likely the man who commissioned the portrait .
nonetheless , the couple never owned the painting themselves .
in 1506 , leonardo took it with him to france , where he sold it to king francois i , who kept it at fontainebleau , where it remained until given to louis xiv .
reuters reported that the notes were made by a florentine city official , agostino vespucci , an acquaintance of the artist , in a collection of letters by the roman orator cicero .
the comments compare leonardo to the ancient greek artist apelles and say he was working on three paintings at the time , one of them a portrait of lisa del giocondo .
a breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : da vinci was part of the italian renaissance art experts have hailed the heidelberg discovery as a breakthrough and the earliest mention linking the merchant 's wife to the portrait , which hangs in the louvre in paris .
" there is no reason for any lingering doubts that this is another woman , " leipzig university art historian frank zöllner told a german radio station .
" one could even say that books written about all this in the past few years were unnecessary . "
the heidelberg notes were actually discovered by armin schlechter over two years ago in the library , a spokeswoman said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 15.01.2008 berlin agrees on new gm labeling law - but how strict is it ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the new law , 300 meters -lrb- 985 feet -rrb- must seperate organic and gm crops with a view to creating greater transparency for consumers , germany is to introduce a special label for food that has not been genetically modified , such as products from animals that have not been fed biotech grains . deputy agriculture minister gert lindemann said the new " non-gm " label will apply not only to non-genetically-modified crops but to eggs , meat and milk from animals that were raised without biotech feed . for the last four years , german food manufacturers have had the option of labeling food containing traces of gm technology , although few have made use of it because of legal uncertainties .
officially , the certificate could only be used if gene technology was absent from the entire production process - milk from a cow , for example , which had been treated with medicine manufactured using genetically modified micro-organisms could not be labeled gm-free . the bundestag , germany 's parliament , is expected to approve the law next week , allowing it to be introduced in spring . watchdogs approve bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers demonstrate for the right to choose consumer watchdogs have hailed the move as a pragmatic solution .
they say it provides farmers with greater motivation to avoid using genetically modified products such as corn and soya .
in the past , they were more likely not to go to the trouble , since they knew they would not be allowed to use the non-gm label anyway . " the new labeling will give consumers the choice to buy dairy products from animals that have not been fed with genetically modified plants , " said gerd billen from the federation of german consumer organizations in tuesday 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . " in future , the consumer will be in a position to make a political decision not to support gene technology in agriculture , " agreed thilo bode from foodwatch in the same article . experts also say that a rise in consumer demand for food carrying the new label might lead to an increase in demand for non-gm feed on the international market . misleading consumers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new labels will improve transparency however , food that is manufactured using genetically modified ingredients such as additives , vitamins and amino acids can be marked with the new labeling . this has prompted germany 's opposition to dismiss the proposed label as misleading , even though genetically modified additives may be used only when there is no alternative , they must comply with the eu 's organic regulations and may no longer contain any genetically modified micro-organisms . " this is a sneaky frontal attack on consumers and farmers who want to consume and produce non-gm products , " said renate künast from the green party . the move was announced in berlin on sunday , jan .
13 , the same day the us said it would temporarily hold fire on sanctions on european union goods in a last-ditch attempt to resolve a bitter trade dispute over genetically modified crops . the eu missed a world trade organization deadline friday to comply with a decision against eu restrictions on some genetically modified organisms . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but government officials already cautioned that it wo n't stay like that for long . in 2007 , the german government received 70 million euros -lrb- $ 103 million -rrb- more than it spent , according to figures released by federal statistical office -lrb- destatis -rrb- in wiesbaden on tuesday , jan .
15 . last year , the budget deficit ran at 1.6 percent , or nearly 37 million euros . during the period 2002-2005 , the government had breached a european union-mandated limit of 3 percent of gdp , but brussels suspended its deficit procedures against germany in june last year . the increase in value-added tax from 16 percent to 19 percent at the start of 2007 was partly responsible for the balanced budget . for the coming year , however , the german government expects the deficit to grow again , as recent business tax and unemployment insurance reforms will result in reduced tax takings . solid economic growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's growth is primarily export driven the destatis figures showed the german economy grew by 2.5 percent last year .
this was down on 2006 which experienced 2.9 percent growth - the fastest expansion since the turn of the decade . exports and investment were the main drivers of germany ’ s growth in 2007 .
destatis said german exports , a traditional strong point , grew by 8.3 percent last year and accounted for more than half of the growth in gdp . slow down expected the statistics office has not yet published fourth quarter figures , but german industrial production , exports and retail sales declined in november , suggesting the economy is losing momentum . the outlook for 2008 in the eurozone ’ s biggest economy appears less rosy , with oil trading close to record prices , the euro 's strength against the us dollar raising fears over the competitiveness of exports , and concern still strong over the fallout from the us subprime housing credit crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dollar has been falling against the euro economy minister michael glos recently has said that he plans to revise downward the government 's 2008 growth forecast of 2 percent , although he has not specified a new figure . falling investor confidence meanwhile , german investor confidence has hit its lowest point in 15 years , according to a much-watched survey conducted by the mannheim based zew center for economic research .
zew said its economic sentiment indicator , based on surveys of 270 analysts , fell by 4.4 percent and are now at minus 41.6 points - a figure which is considerably under the average of 31 points . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 .
most would-be ticket buyers are expected to go away empty-handed . similar to the lottery setup for the 2006 world cup , soccer fans will enter an online drawing for the 14,400 tickets put up for sale by the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
the ticket window on the dfb web site -lrb- www.dfb.de -rrb- opens tuesday at 10 a.m.
-lrb- 9 a.m.
gmt -rrb- and closes at midnight on feb .
12 . prospective ticket buyers can register their names and payment details to purchase a maximum of four tickets .
ticket winners are scheduled to be drawn at the end of february .
anyone interested in seeing a germany game - not only germans - can enter the dfb 's ticket lottery . the soccer organization said it was keeping 30 percent of its tickets for the june 7 to june 29 tournament for dignitaries , dfb officials , sponsors and players . " everyone will understand that we have to serve our committees , the bundesliga clubs , state soccer associations , sponsors and national team players from this really very small allotment of tickets , " dfb general secretary wolfgang niersbach said in a statement on monday . small stadiums limit seating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tournament 's stadia have been criticized as being too small should germany advance to the tournament 's knock-out stage , the country will receive 22,000 more tickets , of which 70 percent would be made available to the public . expecting a good showing from the german team , one of the tournament 's favorites , the dfb is selling vouchers for knock-out stage matches , which will be exchanged for tickets if germany advances . some 5,722 tickets are available for 45 euros -lrb- $ 66 -rrb- for the first-round matches against poland and croatia on june 8 and june 12 at klagenfurt , and 10,321 for the clash against austria in vienna on june 16 .
the highest-priced ticket for the final match in vienna is 550 euros .
all tickets are subject to a 5 percent ticketing fee and 20 euro charge for shipping and handling . the limited capacity of stadia hosting germany 's games has been criticized in the german press .
the klagenfurt stadium holds 30,000 people while the vienna stadium has a capacity of 50,000 . " a lot of disappointment " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lottery is german soccer fans ' last chance for euro 2008 tickets " it is unfortunate , but we do not have any influence on ticket allocation , " dfb president theo zwanziger said , adding it was determined by uefa , europe 's governing soccer body .
" i know that there is going to be a lot of disappointment . " the daily mass-market bild newspaper complained in an editorial on sunday that the dfb was keeping too many tickets for itself . " ninety-nine percent of german supporters who will apply to buy a ticket will go away empty-handed to the delight of the black market , where tickets at 850 euros are already available , " the paper wrote .
" and that leads to the question : is -lsb- soccer -rsb- now just for the rich ? " national soccer federations , including the dfb , receive tickets only to european championship matches involving their country .
tickets for matches involving other teams were put on sale last year on the uefa web site and are already sold out . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" everyone will understand that we have to serve our committees , the bundesliga clubs , state soccer associations , sponsors and national team players from this really very small allotment of tickets , " dfb general secretary wolfgang niersbach said in a statement on monday . small stadiums limit seating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tournament 's stadia have been criticized as being too small should germany advance to the tournament 's knock-out stage , the country will receive 22,000 more tickets , of which 70 percent would be made available to the public . expecting a good showing from the german team , one of the tournament 's favorites , the dfb is selling vouchers for knock-out stage matches , which will be exchanged for tickets if germany advances . some 5,722 tickets are available for 45 euros -lrb- $ 66 -rrb- for the first-round matches against poland and croatia on june 8 and june 12 at klagenfurt , and 10,321 for the clash against austria in vienna on june 16 .
the highest-priced ticket for the final match in vienna is 550 euros .
all tickets are subject to a 5 percent ticketing fee and 20 euro charge for shipping and handling . the limited capacity of stadia hosting germany 's games has been criticized in the german press .
the klagenfurt stadium holds 30,000 people while the vienna stadium has a capacity of 50,000 . " a lot of disappointment " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lottery is german soccer fans ' last chance for euro 2008 tickets " it is unfortunate , but we do not have any influence on ticket allocation , " dfb president theo zwanziger said , adding it was determined by uefa , europe 's governing soccer body .
" i know that there is going to be a lot of disappointment . " the daily mass-market bild newspaper complained in an editorial on sunday that the dfb was keeping too many tickets for itself . " ninety-nine percent of german supporters who will apply to buy a ticket will go away empty-handed to the delight of the black market , where tickets at 850 euros are already available , " the paper wrote .
" and that leads to the question : is -lsb- soccer -rsb- now just for the rich ? " national soccer federations , including the dfb , receive tickets only to european championship matches involving their country .
tickets for matches involving other teams were put on sale last year on the uefa web site and are already sold out . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political deals behind closed doors , and not due process , made their return home possible in the first place , experts say . on monday , jan .
14 , six french aid workers convicted of kidnapping 103 children in the central african country of chad went before a court in the paris suburb of creteil . however , their punishment had already been decided last december : chad judges sentenced the charity workers to eight years of forced labor and a collective fine of 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 9.2 million -rrb- on charges of child trafficking for zoe 's ark , a humanitarian aid organization . due to the intervention of french president nicolas sarkozy , the group was repatriated to france two days after the chadian sentence was meted out . since france has the largest contingent in a multilateral peacekeeping operation in eastern chad , near the sudanese border , and even saved chadian president idriss deby 's regime from being overthrown by rebels , sarkozy was able to exercise some political leverage on behalf of the aid workers , said antoine comte , a french expert on extradition and criminal law . " the repatriation was a done political deal between two heads of state that was carried out behind closed doors and had nothing to do with due process , " he said . french translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no retrial of the repatriated aid workers but french judges were asked to adapt the prison sentence in accordance with the terms of a 1976 bilateral accord between france and chad , a former french colony .
translating the chadian sentence into french domestic legislation is not without its problems though , since france does not condemn its prisoners to forced labor .
so the creteil prosecutor , jean-jacques bosc , sought eight years imprisonment instead . " this case is not about a retrial on french territory , which would be a violation of international principles , " bosc said in a statement to journalists . the press office of the french justice ministry had also emphasized that the aid workers were not extradited home to stand trial , but were convicted criminals who were simply repatriated to serve out a foreign prison sentence in their own country . getting off lightly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children were not injured war orphans from darfur still , the aid workers will get off more lightly in france than in africa , other countries in the developing world , according to extradition experts . " compared to europe , the prison conditions in africa , generally speaking , are horrendous , " said john r.w.d. jones , an extradition and war crimes lawyer at doughty street chambers in london .
" beating up prisoners is considered one of the perks of a prison guard 's job , the food is atrocious , and the conditions violate international human rights conventions . " france may try to translate the forced labor provision of the chadian law into harsher conditions by denying the prisoners home leave and library or exercise privileges enjoyed by others , added jones . but the problem is that the prisoners may be able to file a complaint with the european court of justice in strasbourg on the grounds that they are being denied the right to equal treatment relative to the rest of the incarcerated population , he explained . a question of politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the driving force behind the deal , comte says once back on french soil , how the prisoners are treated is no longer a legal , but a political or diplomatic issue with chad , which has no legal recourse if the prisoners are treated too well . " in all likelihood , the chadians will not necessarily want assurances that the aid workers are suffering enough in prison , but if it became public that the prisoners were being treated very leniently , that would be a humiliation for chad , " jones said .
" how this affair is handled may be more about diplomatic face-saving than about the treatment of individuals . " legal expert comte meanwhile said that the french president should have taken an altogether different route . " instead of negotiating with an african dictator , sarkozy should have used french influence to push chad into pursuing a democratic legal process in the first place , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political deals behind closed doors , and not due process , made their return home possible in the first place , experts say . on monday , jan .
14 , six french aid workers convicted of kidnapping 103 children in the central african country of chad went before a court in the paris suburb of creteil . however , their punishment had already been decided last december : chad judges sentenced the charity workers to eight years of forced labor and a collective fine of 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 9.2 million -rrb- on charges of child trafficking for zoe 's ark , a humanitarian aid organization . due to the intervention of french president nicolas sarkozy , the group was repatriated to france two days after the chadian sentence was meted out . since france has the largest contingent in a multilateral peacekeeping operation in eastern chad , near the sudanese border , and even saved chadian president idriss deby 's regime from being overthrown by rebels , sarkozy was able to exercise some political leverage on behalf of the aid workers , said antoine comte , a french expert on extradition and criminal law . " the repatriation was a done political deal between two heads of state that was carried out behind closed doors and had nothing to do with due process , " he said . french translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no retrial of the repatriated aid workers but french judges were asked to adapt the prison sentence in accordance with the terms of a 1976 bilateral accord between france and chad , a former french colony .
translating the chadian sentence into french domestic legislation is not without its problems though , since france does not condemn its prisoners to forced labor .
so the creteil prosecutor , jean-jacques bosc , sought eight years imprisonment instead . " this case is not about a retrial on french territory , which would be a violation of international principles , " bosc said in a statement to journalists . the press office of the french justice ministry had also emphasized that the aid workers were not extradited home to stand trial , but were convicted criminals who were simply repatriated to serve out a foreign prison sentence in their own country . getting off lightly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children were not injured war orphans from darfur still , the aid workers will get off more lightly in france than in africa , other countries in the developing world , according to extradition experts . " compared to europe , the prison conditions in africa , generally speaking , are horrendous , " said john r.w.d. jones , an extradition and war crimes lawyer at doughty street chambers in london .
" beating up prisoners is considered one of the perks of a prison guard 's job , the food is atrocious , and the conditions violate international human rights conventions . " france may try to translate the forced labor provision of the chadian law into harsher conditions by denying the prisoners home leave and library or exercise privileges enjoyed by others , added jones . but the problem is that the prisoners may be able to file a complaint with the european court of justice in strasbourg on the grounds that they are being denied the right to equal treatment relative to the rest of the incarcerated population , he explained . a question of politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the driving force behind the deal , comte says once back on french soil , how the prisoners are treated is no longer a legal , but a political or diplomatic issue with chad , which has no legal recourse if the prisoners are treated too well . " in all likelihood , the chadians will not necessarily want assurances that the aid workers are suffering enough in prison , but if it became public that the prisoners were being treated very leniently , that would be a humiliation for chad , " jones said .
" how this affair is handled may be more about diplomatic face-saving than about the treatment of individuals . " legal expert comte meanwhile said that the french president should have taken an altogether different route . " instead of negotiating with an african dictator , sarkozy should have used french influence to push chad into pursuing a democratic legal process in the first place , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but government officials already cautioned that it wo n't stay like that for long . in 2007 , the german government received 70 million euros -lrb- $ 103 million -rrb- more than it spent , according to figures released by federal statistical office -lrb- destatis -rrb- in wiesbaden on tuesday , jan .
15 . last year , the budget deficit ran at 1.6 percent , or nearly 37 million euros . during the period 2002-2005 , the government had breached a european union-mandated limit of 3 percent of gdp , but brussels suspended its deficit procedures against germany in june last year . the increase in value-added tax from 16 percent to 19 percent at the start of 2007 was partly responsible for the balanced budget . for the coming year , however , the german government expects the deficit to grow again , as recent business tax and unemployment insurance reforms will result in reduced tax takings . solid economic growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's growth is primarily export driven the destatis figures showed the german economy grew by 2.5 percent last year .
this was down on 2006 which experienced 2.9 percent growth - the fastest expansion since the turn of the decade . exports and investment were the main drivers of germany ’ s growth in 2007 .
destatis said german exports , a traditional strong point , grew by 8.3 percent last year and accounted for more than half of the growth in gdp . slow down expected the statistics office has not yet published fourth quarter figures , but german industrial production , exports and retail sales declined in november , suggesting the economy is losing momentum . the outlook for 2008 in the eurozone ’ s biggest economy appears less rosy , with oil trading close to record prices , the euro 's strength against the us dollar raising fears over the competitiveness of exports , and concern still strong over the fallout from the us subprime housing credit crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dollar has been falling against the euro economy minister michael glos recently has said that he plans to revise downward the government 's 2008 growth forecast of 2 percent , although he has not specified a new figure . falling investor confidence meanwhile , german investor confidence has hit its lowest point in 15 years , according to a much-watched survey conducted by the mannheim based zew center for economic research .
zew said its economic sentiment indicator , based on surveys of 270 analysts , fell by 4.4 percent and are now at minus 41.6 points - a figure which is considerably under the average of 31 points . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 . the personal effects have been locked up in red cross archives in bad arolsen , in central germany , for decades . viewing the items evokes ghosts from the past , said gerrit jan evers , who learned just a few weeks ago that the effects had been discovered . " so many died .
and now , 63 years later , i 'm here holding my father 's identity card in my hand , " evers told dpa news agency . the items include an old pocket watch with cracked , yellow glass and its case , a scratched-up lock and key and a photograph with writing on the back that is hard to discern . the nazis had kept all the items packed in boxes , which were then confiscated by the allies at the end of the war . files on over 17 million people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the victims ' descendents are speechless when they view the personal effects the red cross ' own international tracing service supervises the archive of captured files on some 17.5 million non-germans persecuted by the nazis or displaced during world war ii . within the files , personal letters , jewelry and other private papers are sometimes found .
the red cross staff then notifies next of kin and sends the items to them .
monday was the first time relatives came themselves to collect items at the bad arolsen archive . evert de graaf , a dutch historian , explained the history to dpa : " evers 's father was caught up in a wave of arrests by the nazis , " he said .
" after a resistance attack on german soldiers , they sent about 600 dutch people to the concentration camps on oct .
1-2 , 1944 . " de graaf and his colleagues are collaborating with the red cross to investigate what happened to the victims . " we found files on 80 of them , and an envelope containing personal effects was attached to eight of them , " the historian said . mood becomes sober and reflective on monday , six months later , the eight families traveled to bad arolsen in a chartered bus to collect the personal effects . " when the trip began , everyone was cheerful , " de graaf said to dpa .
" but the closer we got to bad arolsen , the quieter everyone became . " evers 's hands shake as he opens a package to find the brittle , yellowing id card marked " personsbewijs " in dutch inside and glimpses the photograph of a gaunt , serious-looking man . " that 's my father , " he says softly . evers is named after his father but has no recollection of him other than his mother 's anecdotes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international tracing service helps families track the fate of their victimized relatives gerrit evers senior died of exhaustion in december 1944 at neuengamme concentration camp , near hamburg .
three weeks later , his son was born in the netherlands . stifling his emotions , evers puts away the card and murmurs , " so many people . " mixed feelings toward germans evers ' stepson , gerjo mulder , explained to dpa : " it 's beyond belief for him that people could be so cruel to one another here , in the middle of europe .
i ca n't grasp it myself .
i 'm trying to put myself in his shoes .
but i 'm just 35 . " asked whether he hates the germans , dutchman mulder said , " that 's all in the past , " but then adds : " except when we 're playing soccer against them . " viewing his dead brother 's concentration-camp registration card , willem dorgelo , said , " i keep trying to tell myself that it was n't ' the germans , ' it was adolf hitler .
well , i try anyway . " " they worked him to death , starved him , gave him no winter clothes .
he did n't survive , " he said , turning over a wallet in his hand that used to belong to a man who has been dead for 63 years . standing next to him , johan dorgelo , willem 's son , said : " i hardly have anything to remember my father by .

" when the trip began , everyone was cheerful , " de graaf said to dpa .
" but the closer we got to bad arolsen , the quieter everyone became . " evers 's hands shake as he opens a package to find the brittle , yellowing id card marked " personsbewijs " in dutch inside and glimpses the photograph of a gaunt , serious-looking man .

a hamburg-based newspaper that reported last week about a computer company manager who said he had fired non-smokers now says the whole issue was a hoax . so much for investigative reporting .
the hamburg newspaper allowed itself to be duped by a computer company manager , who had said that he fired three non-smokers because they threatened disruptions after asking for a smoke-free environment . now , the hamburger morgenpost says the story was a hoax , even though it made national and international news - including , admittedly , on dw-world.de - when it " broke " last week . stephanie lamprecht , the journalist at the paper , said manager thomas joschko initially told her he had fired the three from his 10-person staff . likely thinking that where there 's smoke , there 's fire , lamprecht jumped on the story . " he said he 's a chain-smoker himself and said he was tired of smokers being hassled so much , " lamprecht told reuters news agency . " he said he was on a pro-smoker mission , " lamprecht went on .
she maintained that she had then checked some of the facts of his story last week after he called in his claim .
she also discovered that he was indeed the registered owner of a small company in büsum . hoax , or merely second thoughts ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german states have banned smoking in public places , other are on the way joschko apparently later admitted to the journalist that his original story was a hoax . the culprit of the hoax could not be reached this week by reuters for comment . but lamprecht has meanwhile tried to rectify the situation and get to the truth .
she said that she drove 120 km -lrb- 75 miles -rrb- from hamburg to büsum in northern germany on monday to try to confirm the story that has since become jaded . she said her paper planned to publish an updated version of the story sometime this week . meanwhile , lamprecht might just be thinking that she 's gotten her fingers burnt badly enough that she 's ready to switch occupations . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

probably one of the most famous portraits in the world , leonardo da vinci 's mona lisa has long baffled the art critics - not least the question : who is she ?
german academics think they 've just found the answer . she might be around 500 years old , but she 's as beguiling as ever .
and now , we apparently know for a fact who she is .
an academic at heidelberg university is confident that the centuries-old mystery surrounding the identity of mona lisa has been solved .
according to veit probst , director of the heidelberg university library , she is " undoubtedly " lisa gherardini .
the wife of wealthy florentine merchant francesco del giocondo has long been seen as the most likely model - the painting dating back to the early 16th century is also known as " la gioconda " - but art historians have often debated whether the smiling woman might have been da vinci 's lover , his mother or even the artist himself .
over the years , other potential sitters for the portrait have included isabella of aragon and constanza d 'avalos , duchess of francavilla , a patron of leonardo and mistress of giuliano de medici .
definitive confirmation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidelberg university has put paid to the conspiracy theories but probst has now revealed that dated notes scribbled in the margins of a book at heidelberg university library by its owner in october 1503 , first found by armin schlechter , a manuscript expert , confirm once and for all that lisa del giocondo was indeed the model , and her husband most likely the man who commissioned the portrait .
nonetheless , the couple never owned the painting themselves .
in 1506 , leonardo took it with him to france , where he sold it to king francois i , who kept it at fontainebleau , where it remained until given to louis xiv .
reuters reported that the notes were made by a florentine city official , agostino vespucci , an acquaintance of the artist , in a collection of letters by the roman orator cicero .
the comments compare leonardo to the ancient greek artist apelles and say he was working on three paintings at the time , one of them a portrait of lisa del giocondo .
a breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : da vinci was part of the italian renaissance art experts have hailed the heidelberg discovery as a breakthrough and the earliest mention linking the merchant 's wife to the portrait , which hangs in the louvre in paris .
" there is no reason for any lingering doubts that this is another woman , " leipzig university art historian frank zöllner told a german radio station .
" one could even say that books written about all this in the past few years were unnecessary . "
the heidelberg notes were actually discovered by armin schlechter over two years ago in the library , a spokeswoman said .
although the findings had been printed in the library 's public catalog they had not been widely publicized and had received little attention until a german broadcaster decided to do some recording at the library , she said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

probably one of the most famous portraits in the world , leonardo da vinci 's mona lisa has long baffled the art critics - not least the question : who is she ?
german academics think they 've just found the answer . she might be around 500 years old , but she 's as beguiling as ever .
and now , we apparently know for a fact who she is .
an academic at heidelberg university is confident that the centuries-old mystery surrounding the identity of mona lisa has been solved .
according to veit probst , director of the heidelberg university library , she is " undoubtedly " lisa gherardini .
the wife of wealthy florentine merchant francesco del giocondo has long been seen as the most likely model - the painting dating back to the early 16th century is also known as " la gioconda " - but art historians have often debated whether the smiling woman might have been da vinci 's lover , his mother or even the artist himself .
over the years , other potential sitters for the portrait have included isabella of aragon and constanza d 'avalos , duchess of francavilla , a patron of leonardo and mistress of giuliano de medici .
definitive confirmation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidelberg university has put paid to the conspiracy theories but probst has now revealed that dated notes scribbled in the margins of a book at heidelberg university library by its owner in october 1503 , first found by armin schlechter , a manuscript expert , confirm once and for all that lisa del giocondo was indeed the model , and her husband most likely the man who commissioned the portrait .
nonetheless , the couple never owned the painting themselves .
in 1506 , leonardo took it with him to france , where he sold it to king francois i , who kept it at fontainebleau , where it remained until given to louis xiv .
reuters reported that the notes were made by a florentine city official , agostino vespucci , an acquaintance of the artist , in a collection of letters by the roman orator cicero .
the comments compare leonardo to the ancient greek artist apelles and say he was working on three paintings at the time , one of them a portrait of lisa del giocondo .
a breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : da vinci was part of the italian renaissance art experts have hailed the heidelberg discovery as a breakthrough and the earliest mention linking the merchant 's wife to the portrait , which hangs in the louvre in paris .
" there is no reason for any lingering doubts that this is another woman , " leipzig university art historian frank zöllner told a german radio station .
" one could even say that books written about all this in the past few years were unnecessary . "
the heidelberg notes were actually discovered by armin schlechter over two years ago in the library , a spokeswoman said .

15 .
most would-be ticket buyers are expected to go away empty-handed . similar to the lottery setup for the 2006 world cup , soccer fans will enter an online drawing for the 14,400 tickets put up for sale by the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
the ticket window on the dfb web site -lrb- www.dfb.de -rrb- opens tuesday at 10 a.m.
-lrb- 9 a.m.
gmt -rrb- and closes at midnight on feb .
12 . prospective ticket buyers can register their names and payment details to purchase a maximum of four tickets .
ticket winners are scheduled to be drawn at the end of february .
anyone interested in seeing a germany game - not only germans - can enter the dfb 's ticket lottery . the soccer organization said it was keeping 30 percent of its tickets for the june 7 to june 29 tournament for dignitaries , dfb officials , sponsors and players . " everyone will understand that we have to serve our committees , the bundesliga clubs , state soccer associations , sponsors and national team players from this really very small allotment of tickets , " dfb general secretary wolfgang niersbach said in a statement on monday . small stadiums limit seating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tournament 's stadia have been criticized as being too small should germany advance to the tournament 's knock-out stage , the country will receive 22,000 more tickets , of which 70 percent would be made available to the public . expecting a good showing from the german team , one of the tournament 's favorites , the dfb is selling vouchers for knock-out stage matches , which will be exchanged for tickets if germany advances . some 5,722 tickets are available for 45 euros -lrb- $ 66 -rrb- for the first-round matches against poland and croatia on june 8 and june 12 at klagenfurt , and 10,321 for the clash against austria in vienna on june 16 .
the highest-priced ticket for the final match in vienna is 550 euros .
all tickets are subject to a 5 percent ticketing fee and 20 euro charge for shipping and handling . the limited capacity of stadia hosting germany 's games has been criticized in the german press .
the klagenfurt stadium holds 30,000 people while the vienna stadium has a capacity of 50,000 . " a lot of disappointment " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lottery is german soccer fans ' last chance for euro 2008 tickets " it is unfortunate , but we do not have any influence on ticket allocation , " dfb president theo zwanziger said , adding it was determined by uefa , europe 's governing soccer body .
" i know that there is going to be a lot of disappointment . " the daily mass-market bild newspaper complained in an editorial on sunday that the dfb was keeping too many tickets for itself . " ninety-nine percent of german supporters who will apply to buy a ticket will go away empty-handed to the delight of the black market , where tickets at 850 euros are already available , " the paper wrote .
" and that leads to the question : is -lsb- soccer -rsb- now just for the rich ? " national soccer federations , including the dfb , receive tickets only to european championship matches involving their country .
tickets for matches involving other teams were put on sale last year on the uefa web site and are already sold out . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 15.01.2008 berlin agrees on new gm labeling law - but how strict is it ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the new law , 300 meters -lrb- 985 feet -rrb- must seperate organic and gm crops with a view to creating greater transparency for consumers , germany is to introduce a special label for food that has not been genetically modified , such as products from animals that have not been fed biotech grains . deputy agriculture minister gert lindemann said the new " non-gm " label will apply not only to non-genetically-modified crops but to eggs , meat and milk from animals that were raised without biotech feed . for the last four years , german food manufacturers have had the option of labeling food containing traces of gm technology , although few have made use of it because of legal uncertainties .
officially , the certificate could only be used if gene technology was absent from the entire production process - milk from a cow , for example , which had been treated with medicine manufactured using genetically modified micro-organisms could not be labeled gm-free . the bundestag , germany 's parliament , is expected to approve the law next week , allowing it to be introduced in spring . watchdogs approve bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers demonstrate for the right to choose consumer watchdogs have hailed the move as a pragmatic solution .
they say it provides farmers with greater motivation to avoid using genetically modified products such as corn and soya .
in the past , they were more likely not to go to the trouble , since they knew they would not be allowed to use the non-gm label anyway . " the new labeling will give consumers the choice to buy dairy products from animals that have not been fed with genetically modified plants , " said gerd billen from the federation of german consumer organizations in tuesday 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . " in future , the consumer will be in a position to make a political decision not to support gene technology in agriculture , " agreed thilo bode from foodwatch in the same article . experts also say that a rise in consumer demand for food carrying the new label might lead to an increase in demand for non-gm feed on the international market . misleading consumers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new labels will improve transparency however , food that is manufactured using genetically modified ingredients such as additives , vitamins and amino acids can be marked with the new labeling . this has prompted germany 's opposition to dismiss the proposed label as misleading , even though genetically modified additives may be used only when there is no alternative , they must comply with the eu 's organic regulations and may no longer contain any genetically modified micro-organisms . " this is a sneaky frontal attack on consumers and farmers who want to consume and produce non-gm products , " said renate künast from the green party . the move was announced in berlin on sunday , jan .
13 , the same day the us said it would temporarily hold fire on sanctions on european union goods in a last-ditch attempt to resolve a bitter trade dispute over genetically modified crops . the eu missed a world trade organization deadline friday to comply with a decision against eu restrictions on some genetically modified organisms . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

probably one of the most famous portraits in the world , leonardo da vinci 's mona lisa has long baffled the art critics - not least the question : who is she ?
german academics think they 've just found the answer . she might be around 500 years old , but she 's as beguiling as ever .
and now , we apparently know for a fact who she is .
an academic at heidelberg university is confident that the centuries-old mystery surrounding the identity of mona lisa has been solved .
according to veit probst , director of the heidelberg university library , she is " undoubtedly " lisa gherardini .
the wife of wealthy florentine merchant francesco del giocondo has long been seen as the most likely model - the painting dating back to the early 16th century is also known as " la gioconda " - but art historians have often debated whether the smiling woman might have been da vinci 's lover , his mother or even the artist himself .
over the years , other potential sitters for the portrait have included isabella of aragon and constanza d 'avalos , duchess of francavilla , a patron of leonardo and mistress of giuliano de medici .
definitive confirmation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidelberg university has put paid to the conspiracy theories but probst has now revealed that dated notes scribbled in the margins of a book at heidelberg university library by its owner in october 1503 , first found by armin schlechter , a manuscript expert , confirm once and for all that lisa del giocondo was indeed the model , and her husband most likely the man who commissioned the portrait .
nonetheless , the couple never owned the painting themselves .
in 1506 , leonardo took it with him to france , where he sold it to king francois i , who kept it at fontainebleau , where it remained until given to louis xiv .
reuters reported that the notes were made by a florentine city official , agostino vespucci , an acquaintance of the artist , in a collection of letters by the roman orator cicero .
the comments compare leonardo to the ancient greek artist apelles and say he was working on three paintings at the time , one of them a portrait of lisa del giocondo .
a breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : da vinci was part of the italian renaissance art experts have hailed the heidelberg discovery as a breakthrough and the earliest mention linking the merchant 's wife to the portrait , which hangs in the louvre in paris .
" there is no reason for any lingering doubts that this is another woman , " leipzig university art historian frank zöllner told a german radio station .
" one could even say that books written about all this in the past few years were unnecessary . "
the heidelberg notes were actually discovered by armin schlechter over two years ago in the library , a spokeswoman said .

probably one of the most famous portraits in the world , leonardo da vinci 's mona lisa has long baffled the art critics - not least the question : who is she ?
german academics think they 've just found the answer . she might be around 500 years old , but she 's as beguiling as ever .
and now , we apparently know for a fact who she is .
an academic at heidelberg university is confident that the centuries-old mystery surrounding the identity of mona lisa has been solved .
according to veit probst , director of the heidelberg university library , she is " undoubtedly " lisa gherardini .
the wife of wealthy florentine merchant francesco del giocondo has long been seen as the most likely model - the painting dating back to the early 16th century is also known as " la gioconda " - but art historians have often debated whether the smiling woman might have been da vinci 's lover , his mother or even the artist himself .
over the years , other potential sitters for the portrait have included isabella of aragon and constanza d 'avalos , duchess of francavilla , a patron of leonardo and mistress of giuliano de medici .
definitive confirmation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidelberg university has put paid to the conspiracy theories but probst has now revealed that dated notes scribbled in the margins of a book at heidelberg university library by its owner in october 1503 , first found by armin schlechter , a manuscript expert , confirm once and for all that lisa del giocondo was indeed the model , and her husband most likely the man who commissioned the portrait .
nonetheless , the couple never owned the painting themselves .
in 1506 , leonardo took it with him to france , where he sold it to king francois i , who kept it at fontainebleau , where it remained until given to louis xiv .
reuters reported that the notes were made by a florentine city official , agostino vespucci , an acquaintance of the artist , in a collection of letters by the roman orator cicero .
the comments compare leonardo to the ancient greek artist apelles and say he was working on three paintings at the time , one of them a portrait of lisa del giocondo .
a breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : da vinci was part of the italian renaissance art experts have hailed the heidelberg discovery as a breakthrough and the earliest mention linking the merchant 's wife to the portrait , which hangs in the louvre in paris .
" there is no reason for any lingering doubts that this is another woman , " leipzig university art historian frank zöllner told a german radio station .
" one could even say that books written about all this in the past few years were unnecessary . "
the heidelberg notes were actually discovered by armin schlechter over two years ago in the library , a spokeswoman said .

15 . the personal effects have been locked up in red cross archives in bad arolsen , in central germany , for decades . viewing the items evokes ghosts from the past , said gerrit jan evers , who learned just a few weeks ago that the effects had been discovered . " so many died .
and now , 63 years later , i 'm here holding my father 's identity card in my hand , " evers told dpa news agency . the items include an old pocket watch with cracked , yellow glass and its case , a scratched-up lock and key and a photograph with writing on the back that is hard to discern . the nazis had kept all the items packed in boxes , which were then confiscated by the allies at the end of the war . files on over 17 million people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the victims ' descendents are speechless when they view the personal effects the red cross ' own international tracing service supervises the archive of captured files on some 17.5 million non-germans persecuted by the nazis or displaced during world war ii . within the files , personal letters , jewelry and other private papers are sometimes found .
the red cross staff then notifies next of kin and sends the items to them .
monday was the first time relatives came themselves to collect items at the bad arolsen archive . evert de graaf , a dutch historian , explained the history to dpa : " evers 's father was caught up in a wave of arrests by the nazis , " he said .
" after a resistance attack on german soldiers , they sent about 600 dutch people to the concentration camps on oct .
1-2 , 1944 . " de graaf and his colleagues are collaborating with the red cross to investigate what happened to the victims . " we found files on 80 of them , and an envelope containing personal effects was attached to eight of them , " the historian said . mood becomes sober and reflective on monday , six months later , the eight families traveled to bad arolsen in a chartered bus to collect the personal effects . " when the trip began , everyone was cheerful , " de graaf said to dpa .
" but the closer we got to bad arolsen , the quieter everyone became .

18 .
the sometimes controversial , but respected bishop is known to have had health problems last year . cardinal karl lehmann said he would resign from his post as german catholic church leader next month , after having led the country 's bishops for over 20 years . the 71-year-old has apparently been suffering from health problems , having been admitted to the hospital at the end of last year after complaining about his heart . he was unable to lead traditional christmas and new year 's services , but did return to celebrate the epiphany on jan .
6 in mainz 's cathedral , where he has been bishop since 1983 . on tuesday , jan .
15 , in his resignation letter , he wrote that now was the appropriate time to step down . " the recent appointments of new bishops has shown that it 's time for a changing of the guard , it 's time that a new generation takes over , " lehmann wrote . aachen 's bishop heinrich mussinghoff , who is also deputy chairman of the german bishops ' conference , thanked lehmann for his " unflagging service " for the catholic church , and paid tribute to him as " an excellent and reliable representative of the church and its message . " hans joachim meyer , of the central committee of german catholics , said of lehmann on tuesday : " he has set standards through his actions , which will not be forgotten . " considered to be less conservative than colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel -lrb- c -rrb- expressed good wishes to lehmann -lrb- r -rrb- on his 70th birthday in 2006 considered to be a relatively liberal catholic theologian , the cardinal is a close associate of pope benedict xvi , who is also german .
lehmann became deputy head of german bishops in 1985 and was appointed chairman in 1987 .
he has held that post longer than any other bishop . he is viewed as a moral authority in germany , and became a symbol for the catholic church in the country .
but he has not always appealed to everyone , something with which he has learned to come to terms . in an interview with public broadcaster südwestrundfunk -lrb- swr -rrb- , he said adapting to situations is important . " since i have been chairman of the catholic bishops ' conference in germany , i have learned that i must remain open during every type of discussion and that i must not alienate anyone , " he said .
" so rather than defending myself in certain situations in which it might have been called for , i just let it go . " indeed , some of his more conservative colleagues have been more than a little irked by his refusal to toe the traditional catholic line .
he tried , for instance , to be a mediator when catholic university professors protested against the vatican in 1989 . promoting dialogue between religions mediation has often been his role , also in inter-religious dialogue . nikolaus schneider , a leader within the protestant church , said about lehmann 's resignation : " he was and is a blessing , and not only for the roman-catholic church , but for all christians and for the entire country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal colleague joachim meisner has often been slammed for his ultra-conservative views kurt beck , the leader of germany 's social democratic party and premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , where mainz is located , said : " his influence went far beyond the religious circles , and was felt within the public at large . " beck noted lehmann 's ability as a brilliant theologian to reconcile situations through his humor and humane , down-to-earth approach . guido westerwelle , head of the liberal free democrats , called lehmann an " important moral authority . " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany regretted lehmann 's resignation , commenting that the bishop has been a reliable contact for jewish representatives . nonetheless , lehmann upset many muslims last year , when he spoke out against islam enjoying equal status to christianity in europe . cardinal lehmann said he would like to remain in the service of the archdiocese of mainz for several more years and would still like to contribute his knowledge in the german bishops ' conference in a non-leader role . he is still to lead the spring plenary meeting of bishops in würzburg in mid-february before stepping down . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he tried , for instance , to be a mediator when catholic university professors protested against the vatican in 1989 . promoting dialogue between religions mediation has often been his role , also in inter-religious dialogue . nikolaus schneider , a leader within the protestant church , said about lehmann 's resignation : " he was and is a blessing , and not only for the roman-catholic church , but for all christians and for the entire country .

most would-be ticket buyers are expected to go away empty-handed . similar to the lottery setup for the 2006 world cup , soccer fans will enter an online drawing for the 14,400 tickets put up for sale by the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .

gmt -rrb- and closes at midnight on feb .
12 . prospective ticket buyers can register their names and payment details to purchase a maximum of four tickets .
ticket winners are scheduled to be drawn at the end of february .
anyone interested in seeing a germany game - not only germans - can enter the dfb 's ticket lottery . the soccer organization said it was keeping 30 percent of its tickets for the june 7 to june 29 tournament for dignitaries , dfb officials , sponsors and players . " everyone will understand that we have to serve our committees , the bundesliga clubs , state soccer associations , sponsors and national team players from this really very small allotment of tickets , " dfb general secretary wolfgang niersbach said in a statement on monday . small stadiums limit seating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tournament 's stadia have been criticized as being too small should germany advance to the tournament 's knock-out stage , the country will receive 22,000 more tickets , of which 70 percent would be made available to the public . expecting a good showing from the german team , one of the tournament 's favorites , the dfb is selling vouchers for knock-out stage matches , which will be exchanged for tickets if germany advances . some 5,722 tickets are available for 45 euros -lrb- $ 66 -rrb- for the first-round matches against poland and croatia on june 8 and june 12 at klagenfurt , and 10,321 for the clash against austria in vienna on june 16 .
the highest-priced ticket for the final match in vienna is 550 euros .
all tickets are subject to a 5 percent ticketing fee and 20 euro charge for shipping and handling . the limited capacity of stadia hosting germany 's games has been criticized in the german press .
the klagenfurt stadium holds 30,000 people while the vienna stadium has a capacity of 50,000 . " a lot of disappointment " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lottery is german soccer fans ' last chance for euro 2008 tickets " it is unfortunate , but we do not have any influence on ticket allocation , " dfb president theo zwanziger said , adding it was determined by uefa , europe 's governing soccer body .
" i know that there is going to be a lot of disappointment . " the daily mass-market bild newspaper complained in an editorial on sunday that the dfb was keeping too many tickets for itself . " ninety-nine percent of german supporters who will apply to buy a ticket will go away empty-handed to the delight of the black market , where tickets at 850 euros are already available , " the paper wrote .
" and that leads to the question : is -lsb- soccer -rsb- now just for the rich ? " national soccer federations , including the dfb , receive tickets only to european championship matches involving their country .

15 . the personal effects have been locked up in red cross archives in bad arolsen , in central germany , for decades . viewing the items evokes ghosts from the past , said gerrit jan evers , who learned just a few weeks ago that the effects had been discovered . " so many died .
and now , 63 years later , i 'm here holding my father 's identity card in my hand , " evers told dpa news agency . the items include an old pocket watch with cracked , yellow glass and its case , a scratched-up lock and key and a photograph with writing on the back that is hard to discern . the nazis had kept all the items packed in boxes , which were then confiscated by the allies at the end of the war . files on over 17 million people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the victims ' descendents are speechless when they view the personal effects the red cross ' own international tracing service supervises the archive of captured files on some 17.5 million non-germans persecuted by the nazis or displaced during world war ii . within the files , personal letters , jewelry and other private papers are sometimes found .
the red cross staff then notifies next of kin and sends the items to them .
monday was the first time relatives came themselves to collect items at the bad arolsen archive . evert de graaf , a dutch historian , explained the history to dpa : " evers 's father was caught up in a wave of arrests by the nazis , " he said .
" after a resistance attack on german soldiers , they sent about 600 dutch people to the concentration camps on oct .
1-2 , 1944 . " de graaf and his colleagues are collaborating with the red cross to investigate what happened to the victims . " we found files on 80 of them , and an envelope containing personal effects was attached to eight of them , " the historian said . mood becomes sober and reflective on monday , six months later , the eight families traveled to bad arolsen in a chartered bus to collect the personal effects . " when the trip began , everyone was cheerful , " de graaf said to dpa .
" but the closer we got to bad arolsen , the quieter everyone became . " evers 's hands shake as he opens a package to find the brittle , yellowing id card marked " personsbewijs " in dutch inside and glimpses the photograph of a gaunt , serious-looking man . " that 's my father , " he says softly . evers is named after his father but has no recollection of him other than his mother 's anecdotes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international tracing service helps families track the fate of their victimized relatives gerrit evers senior died of exhaustion in december 1944 at neuengamme concentration camp , near hamburg .
three weeks later , his son was born in the netherlands . stifling his emotions , evers puts away the card and murmurs , " so many people . " mixed feelings toward germans evers ' stepson , gerjo mulder , explained to dpa : " it 's beyond belief for him that people could be so cruel to one another here , in the middle of europe .
i ca n't grasp it myself .
i 'm trying to put myself in his shoes .
but i 'm just 35 . " asked whether he hates the germans , dutchman mulder said , " that 's all in the past , " but then adds : " except when we 're playing soccer against them . " viewing his dead brother 's concentration-camp registration card , willem dorgelo , said , " i keep trying to tell myself that it was n't ' the germans , ' it was adolf hitler .
well , i try anyway . " " they worked him to death , starved him , gave him no winter clothes .
he did n't survive , " he said , turning over a wallet in his hand that used to belong to a man who has been dead for 63 years . standing next to him , johan dorgelo , willem 's son , said : " i hardly have anything to remember my father by .

he tried , for instance , to be a mediator when catholic university professors protested against the vatican in 1989 . promoting dialogue between religions mediation has often been his role , also in inter-religious dialogue . nikolaus schneider , a leader within the protestant church , said about lehmann 's resignation : " he was and is a blessing , and not only for the roman-catholic church , but for all christians and for the entire country .

" charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany regretted lehmann 's resignation , commenting that the bishop has been a reliable contact for jewish representatives . nonetheless , lehmann upset many muslims last year , when he spoke out against islam enjoying equal status to christianity in europe . cardinal lehmann said he would like to remain in the service of the archdiocese of mainz for several more years and would still like to contribute his knowledge in the german bishops ' conference in a non-leader role . he is still to lead the spring plenary meeting of bishops in würzburg in mid-february before stepping down . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 . the personal effects have been locked up in red cross archives in bad arolsen , in central germany , for decades . viewing the items evokes ghosts from the past , said gerrit jan evers , who learned just a few weeks ago that the effects had been discovered . " so many died .
and now , 63 years later , i 'm here holding my father 's identity card in my hand , " evers told dpa news agency . the items include an old pocket watch with cracked , yellow glass and its case , a scratched-up lock and key and a photograph with writing on the back that is hard to discern . the nazis had kept all the items packed in boxes , which were then confiscated by the allies at the end of the war . files on over 17 million people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the victims ' descendents are speechless when they view the personal effects the red cross ' own international tracing service supervises the archive of captured files on some 17.5 million non-germans persecuted by the nazis or displaced during world war ii . within the files , personal letters , jewelry and other private papers are sometimes found .
the red cross staff then notifies next of kin and sends the items to them .
monday was the first time relatives came themselves to collect items at the bad arolsen archive . evert de graaf , a dutch historian , explained the history to dpa : " evers 's father was caught up in a wave of arrests by the nazis , " he said .
" after a resistance attack on german soldiers , they sent about 600 dutch people to the concentration camps on oct .
1-2 , 1944 . " de graaf and his colleagues are collaborating with the red cross to investigate what happened to the victims . " we found files on 80 of them , and an envelope containing personal effects was attached to eight of them , " the historian said . mood becomes sober and reflective on monday , six months later , the eight families traveled to bad arolsen in a chartered bus to collect the personal effects . " when the trip began , everyone was cheerful , " de graaf said to dpa .
" but the closer we got to bad arolsen , the quieter everyone became . " evers 's hands shake as he opens a package to find the brittle , yellowing id card marked " personsbewijs " in dutch inside and glimpses the photograph of a gaunt , serious-looking man . " that 's my father , " he says softly . evers is named after his father but has no recollection of him other than his mother 's anecdotes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international tracing service helps families track the fate of their victimized relatives gerrit evers senior died of exhaustion in december 1944 at neuengamme concentration camp , near hamburg .
three weeks later , his son was born in the netherlands . stifling his emotions , evers puts away the card and murmurs , " so many people . " mixed feelings toward germans evers ' stepson , gerjo mulder , explained to dpa : " it 's beyond belief for him that people could be so cruel to one another here , in the middle of europe .
i ca n't grasp it myself .
i 'm trying to put myself in his shoes .
but i 'm just 35 . " asked whether he hates the germans , dutchman mulder said , " that 's all in the past , " but then adds : " except when we 're playing soccer against them . " viewing his dead brother 's concentration-camp registration card , willem dorgelo , said , " i keep trying to tell myself that it was n't ' the germans , ' it was adolf hitler .
well , i try anyway . " " they worked him to death , starved him , gave him no winter clothes .
he did n't survive , " he said , turning over a wallet in his hand that used to belong to a man who has been dead for 63 years . standing next to him , johan dorgelo , willem 's son , said : " i hardly have anything to remember my father by .

a hamburg-based newspaper that reported last week about a computer company manager who said he had fired non-smokers now says the whole issue was a hoax . so much for investigative reporting .
the hamburg newspaper allowed itself to be duped by a computer company manager , who had said that he fired three non-smokers because they threatened disruptions after asking for a smoke-free environment . now , the hamburger morgenpost says the story was a hoax , even though it made national and international news - including , admittedly , on dw-world.de - when it " broke " last week . stephanie lamprecht , the journalist at the paper , said manager thomas joschko initially told her he had fired the three from his 10-person staff . likely thinking that where there 's smoke , there 's fire , lamprecht jumped on the story . " he said he 's a chain-smoker himself and said he was tired of smokers being hassled so much , " lamprecht told reuters news agency . " he said he was on a pro-smoker mission , " lamprecht went on .
she maintained that she had then checked some of the facts of his story last week after he called in his claim .
she also discovered that he was indeed the registered owner of a small company in büsum . hoax , or merely second thoughts ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german states have banned smoking in public places , other are on the way joschko apparently later admitted to the journalist that his original story was a hoax . the culprit of the hoax could not be reached this week by reuters for comment . but lamprecht has meanwhile tried to rectify the situation and get to the truth .
she said that she drove 120 km -lrb- 75 miles -rrb- from hamburg to büsum in northern germany on monday to try to confirm the story that has since become jaded . she said her paper planned to publish an updated version of the story sometime this week . meanwhile , lamprecht might just be thinking that she 's gotten her fingers burnt badly enough that she 's ready to switch occupations . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political deals behind closed doors , and not due process , made their return home possible in the first place , experts say . on monday , jan .
14 , six french aid workers convicted of kidnapping 103 children in the central african country of chad went before a court in the paris suburb of creteil . however , their punishment had already been decided last december : chad judges sentenced the charity workers to eight years of forced labor and a collective fine of 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 9.2 million -rrb- on charges of child trafficking for zoe 's ark , a humanitarian aid organization . due to the intervention of french president nicolas sarkozy , the group was repatriated to france two days after the chadian sentence was meted out . since france has the largest contingent in a multilateral peacekeeping operation in eastern chad , near the sudanese border , and even saved chadian president idriss deby 's regime from being overthrown by rebels , sarkozy was able to exercise some political leverage on behalf of the aid workers , said antoine comte , a french expert on extradition and criminal law . " the repatriation was a done political deal between two heads of state that was carried out behind closed doors and had nothing to do with due process , " he said . french translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no retrial of the repatriated aid workers but french judges were asked to adapt the prison sentence in accordance with the terms of a 1976 bilateral accord between france and chad , a former french colony .
translating the chadian sentence into french domestic legislation is not without its problems though , since france does not condemn its prisoners to forced labor .
so the creteil prosecutor , jean-jacques bosc , sought eight years imprisonment instead . " this case is not about a retrial on french territory , which would be a violation of international principles , " bosc said in a statement to journalists . the press office of the french justice ministry had also emphasized that the aid workers were not extradited home to stand trial , but were convicted criminals who were simply repatriated to serve out a foreign prison sentence in their own country . getting off lightly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children were not injured war orphans from darfur still , the aid workers will get off more lightly in france than in africa , other countries in the developing world , according to extradition experts . " compared to europe , the prison conditions in africa , generally speaking , are horrendous , " said john r.w.d. jones , an extradition and war crimes lawyer at doughty street chambers in london .
" beating up prisoners is considered one of the perks of a prison guard 's job , the food is atrocious , and the conditions violate international human rights conventions . " france may try to translate the forced labor provision of the chadian law into harsher conditions by denying the prisoners home leave and library or exercise privileges enjoyed by others , added jones . but the problem is that the prisoners may be able to file a complaint with the european court of justice in strasbourg on the grounds that they are being denied the right to equal treatment relative to the rest of the incarcerated population , he explained . a question of politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the driving force behind the deal , comte says once back on french soil , how the prisoners are treated is no longer a legal , but a political or diplomatic issue with chad , which has no legal recourse if the prisoners are treated too well . " in all likelihood , the chadians will not necessarily want assurances that the aid workers are suffering enough in prison , but if it became public that the prisoners were being treated very leniently , that would be a humiliation for chad , " jones said .
" how this affair is handled may be more about diplomatic face-saving than about the treatment of individuals . " legal expert comte meanwhile said that the french president should have taken an altogether different route . " instead of negotiating with an african dictator , sarkozy should have used french influence to push chad into pursuing a democratic legal process in the first place , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this case is not about a retrial on french territory , which would be a violation of international principles , " bosc said in a statement to journalists . the press office of the french justice ministry had also emphasized that the aid workers were not extradited home to stand trial , but were convicted criminals who were simply repatriated to serve out a foreign prison sentence in their own country . getting off lightly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children were not injured war orphans from darfur still , the aid workers will get off more lightly in france than in africa , other countries in the developing world , according to extradition experts . " compared to europe , the prison conditions in africa , generally speaking , are horrendous , " said john r.w.d. jones , an extradition and war crimes lawyer at doughty street chambers in london .
" beating up prisoners is considered one of the perks of a prison guard 's job , the food is atrocious , and the conditions violate international human rights conventions . " france may try to translate the forced labor provision of the chadian law into harsher conditions by denying the prisoners home leave and library or exercise privileges enjoyed by others , added jones . but the problem is that the prisoners may be able to file a complaint with the european court of justice in strasbourg on the grounds that they are being denied the right to equal treatment relative to the rest of the incarcerated population , he explained . a question of politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the driving force behind the deal , comte says once back on french soil , how the prisoners are treated is no longer a legal , but a political or diplomatic issue with chad , which has no legal recourse if the prisoners are treated too well . " in all likelihood , the chadians will not necessarily want assurances that the aid workers are suffering enough in prison , but if it became public that the prisoners were being treated very leniently , that would be a humiliation for chad , " jones said .
" how this affair is handled may be more about diplomatic face-saving than about the treatment of individuals . " legal expert comte meanwhile said that the french president should have taken an altogether different route . " instead of negotiating with an african dictator , sarkozy should have used french influence to push chad into pursuing a democratic legal process in the first place , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 . the personal effects have been locked up in red cross archives in bad arolsen , in central germany , for decades . viewing the items evokes ghosts from the past , said gerrit jan evers , who learned just a few weeks ago that the effects had been discovered . " so many died .
and now , 63 years later , i 'm here holding my father 's identity card in my hand , " evers told dpa news agency . the items include an old pocket watch with cracked , yellow glass and its case , a scratched-up lock and key and a photograph with writing on the back that is hard to discern . the nazis had kept all the items packed in boxes , which were then confiscated by the allies at the end of the war . files on over 17 million people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the victims ' descendents are speechless when they view the personal effects the red cross ' own international tracing service supervises the archive of captured files on some 17.5 million non-germans persecuted by the nazis or displaced during world war ii . within the files , personal letters , jewelry and other private papers are sometimes found .
the red cross staff then notifies next of kin and sends the items to them .
monday was the first time relatives came themselves to collect items at the bad arolsen archive . evert de graaf , a dutch historian , explained the history to dpa : " evers 's father was caught up in a wave of arrests by the nazis , " he said .
" after a resistance attack on german soldiers , they sent about 600 dutch people to the concentration camps on oct .
1-2 , 1944 . " de graaf and his colleagues are collaborating with the red cross to investigate what happened to the victims . " we found files on 80 of them , and an envelope containing personal effects was attached to eight of them , " the historian said . mood becomes sober and reflective on monday , six months later , the eight families traveled to bad arolsen in a chartered bus to collect the personal effects . " when the trip began , everyone was cheerful , " de graaf said to dpa .
" but the closer we got to bad arolsen , the quieter everyone became . " evers 's hands shake as he opens a package to find the brittle , yellowing id card marked " personsbewijs " in dutch inside and glimpses the photograph of a gaunt , serious-looking man . " that 's my father , " he says softly . evers is named after his father but has no recollection of him other than his mother 's anecdotes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international tracing service helps families track the fate of their victimized relatives gerrit evers senior died of exhaustion in december 1944 at neuengamme concentration camp , near hamburg .
three weeks later , his son was born in the netherlands . stifling his emotions , evers puts away the card and murmurs , " so many people . " mixed feelings toward germans evers ' stepson , gerjo mulder , explained to dpa : " it 's beyond belief for him that people could be so cruel to one another here , in the middle of europe .
i ca n't grasp it myself .
i 'm trying to put myself in his shoes .
but i 'm just 35 . " asked whether he hates the germans , dutchman mulder said , " that 's all in the past , " but then adds : " except when we 're playing soccer against them . " viewing his dead brother 's concentration-camp registration card , willem dorgelo , said , " i keep trying to tell myself that it was n't ' the germans , ' it was adolf hitler .
well , i try anyway . " " they worked him to death , starved him , gave him no winter clothes .
he did n't survive , " he said , turning over a wallet in his hand that used to belong to a man who has been dead for 63 years . standing next to him , johan dorgelo , willem 's son , said : " i hardly have anything to remember my father by .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 15.01.2008 experts : political deal led to repatriation of french aid workers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether zoe 's ark aid workers were part of an adoption scam is disputed in france a french court has adapted the sentence of aid workers convicted of child trafficking in chad .
political deals behind closed doors , and not due process , made their return home possible in the first place , experts say . on monday , jan .
14 , six french aid workers convicted of kidnapping 103 children in the central african country of chad went before a court in the paris suburb of creteil . however , their punishment had already been decided last december : chad judges sentenced the charity workers to eight years of forced labor and a collective fine of 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 9.2 million -rrb- on charges of child trafficking for zoe 's ark , a humanitarian aid organization . due to the intervention of french president nicolas sarkozy , the group was repatriated to france two days after the chadian sentence was meted out . since france has the largest contingent in a multilateral peacekeeping operation in eastern chad , near the sudanese border , and even saved chadian president idriss deby 's regime from being overthrown by rebels , sarkozy was able to exercise some political leverage on behalf of the aid workers , said antoine comte , a french expert on extradition and criminal law . " the repatriation was a done political deal between two heads of state that was carried out behind closed doors and had nothing to do with due process , " he said . french translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no retrial of the repatriated aid workers but french judges were asked to adapt the prison sentence in accordance with the terms of a 1976 bilateral accord between france and chad , a former french colony .
translating the chadian sentence into french domestic legislation is not without its problems though , since france does not condemn its prisoners to forced labor .
so the creteil prosecutor , jean-jacques bosc , sought eight years imprisonment instead . " this case is not about a retrial on french territory , which would be a violation of international principles , " bosc said in a statement to journalists . the press office of the french justice ministry had also emphasized that the aid workers were not extradited home to stand trial , but were convicted criminals who were simply repatriated to serve out a foreign prison sentence in their own country . getting off lightly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children were not injured war orphans from darfur still , the aid workers will get off more lightly in france than in africa , other countries in the developing world , according to extradition experts .

political deals behind closed doors , and not due process , made their return home possible in the first place , experts say . on monday , jan .
14 , six french aid workers convicted of kidnapping 103 children in the central african country of chad went before a court in the paris suburb of creteil . however , their punishment had already been decided last december : chad judges sentenced the charity workers to eight years of forced labor and a collective fine of 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 9.2 million -rrb- on charges of child trafficking for zoe 's ark , a humanitarian aid organization . due to the intervention of french president nicolas sarkozy , the group was repatriated to france two days after the chadian sentence was meted out . since france has the largest contingent in a multilateral peacekeeping operation in eastern chad , near the sudanese border , and even saved chadian president idriss deby 's regime from being overthrown by rebels , sarkozy was able to exercise some political leverage on behalf of the aid workers , said antoine comte , a french expert on extradition and criminal law . " the repatriation was a done political deal between two heads of state that was carried out behind closed doors and had nothing to do with due process , " he said . french translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no retrial of the repatriated aid workers but french judges were asked to adapt the prison sentence in accordance with the terms of a 1976 bilateral accord between france and chad , a former french colony .
translating the chadian sentence into french domestic legislation is not without its problems though , since france does not condemn its prisoners to forced labor .
so the creteil prosecutor , jean-jacques bosc , sought eight years imprisonment instead . " this case is not about a retrial on french territory , which would be a violation of international principles , " bosc said in a statement to journalists . the press office of the french justice ministry had also emphasized that the aid workers were not extradited home to stand trial , but were convicted criminals who were simply repatriated to serve out a foreign prison sentence in their own country . getting off lightly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children were not injured war orphans from darfur still , the aid workers will get off more lightly in france than in africa , other countries in the developing world , according to extradition experts . " compared to europe , the prison conditions in africa , generally speaking , are horrendous , " said john r.w.d. jones , an extradition and war crimes lawyer at doughty street chambers in london .
" beating up prisoners is considered one of the perks of a prison guard 's job , the food is atrocious , and the conditions violate international human rights conventions . " france may try to translate the forced labor provision of the chadian law into harsher conditions by denying the prisoners home leave and library or exercise privileges enjoyed by others , added jones . but the problem is that the prisoners may be able to file a complaint with the european court of justice in strasbourg on the grounds that they are being denied the right to equal treatment relative to the rest of the incarcerated population , he explained . a question of politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the driving force behind the deal , comte says once back on french soil , how the prisoners are treated is no longer a legal , but a political or diplomatic issue with chad , which has no legal recourse if the prisoners are treated too well . " in all likelihood , the chadians will not necessarily want assurances that the aid workers are suffering enough in prison , but if it became public that the prisoners were being treated very leniently , that would be a humiliation for chad , " jones said .
" how this affair is handled may be more about diplomatic face-saving than about the treatment of individuals . " legal expert comte meanwhile said that the french president should have taken an altogether different route . " instead of negotiating with an african dictator , sarkozy should have used french influence to push chad into pursuing a democratic legal process in the first place , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political deals behind closed doors , and not due process , made their return home possible in the first place , experts say . on monday , jan .
14 , six french aid workers convicted of kidnapping 103 children in the central african country of chad went before a court in the paris suburb of creteil . however , their punishment had already been decided last december : chad judges sentenced the charity workers to eight years of forced labor and a collective fine of 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 9.2 million -rrb- on charges of child trafficking for zoe 's ark , a humanitarian aid organization . due to the intervention of french president nicolas sarkozy , the group was repatriated to france two days after the chadian sentence was meted out . since france has the largest contingent in a multilateral peacekeeping operation in eastern chad , near the sudanese border , and even saved chadian president idriss deby 's regime from being overthrown by rebels , sarkozy was able to exercise some political leverage on behalf of the aid workers , said antoine comte , a french expert on extradition and criminal law . " the repatriation was a done political deal between two heads of state that was carried out behind closed doors and had nothing to do with due process , " he said . french translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no retrial of the repatriated aid workers but french judges were asked to adapt the prison sentence in accordance with the terms of a 1976 bilateral accord between france and chad , a former french colony .
translating the chadian sentence into french domestic legislation is not without its problems though , since france does not condemn its prisoners to forced labor .
so the creteil prosecutor , jean-jacques bosc , sought eight years imprisonment instead . " this case is not about a retrial on french territory , which would be a violation of international principles , " bosc said in a statement to journalists . the press office of the french justice ministry had also emphasized that the aid workers were not extradited home to stand trial , but were convicted criminals who were simply repatriated to serve out a foreign prison sentence in their own country . getting off lightly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children were not injured war orphans from darfur still , the aid workers will get off more lightly in france than in africa , other countries in the developing world , according to extradition experts . " compared to europe , the prison conditions in africa , generally speaking , are horrendous , " said john r.w.d. jones , an extradition and war crimes lawyer at doughty street chambers in london .
" beating up prisoners is considered one of the perks of a prison guard 's job , the food is atrocious , and the conditions violate international human rights conventions . " france may try to translate the forced labor provision of the chadian law into harsher conditions by denying the prisoners home leave and library or exercise privileges enjoyed by others , added jones . but the problem is that the prisoners may be able to file a complaint with the european court of justice in strasbourg on the grounds that they are being denied the right to equal treatment relative to the rest of the incarcerated population , he explained . a question of politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the driving force behind the deal , comte says once back on french soil , how the prisoners are treated is no longer a legal , but a political or diplomatic issue with chad , which has no legal recourse if the prisoners are treated too well . " in all likelihood , the chadians will not necessarily want assurances that the aid workers are suffering enough in prison , but if it became public that the prisoners were being treated very leniently , that would be a humiliation for chad , " jones said .
" how this affair is handled may be more about diplomatic face-saving than about the treatment of individuals . " legal expert comte meanwhile said that the french president should have taken an altogether different route . " instead of negotiating with an african dictator , sarkozy should have used french influence to push chad into pursuing a democratic legal process in the first place , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the recent appointments of new bishops has shown that it 's time for a changing of the guard , it 's time that a new generation takes over , " lehmann wrote . aachen 's bishop heinrich mussinghoff , who is also deputy chairman of the german bishops ' conference , thanked lehmann for his " unflagging service " for the catholic church , and paid tribute to him as " an excellent and reliable representative of the church and its message . " hans joachim meyer , of the central committee of german catholics , said of lehmann on tuesday : " he has set standards through his actions , which will not be forgotten . " considered to be less conservative than colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel -lrb- c -rrb- expressed good wishes to lehmann -lrb- r -rrb- on his 70th birthday in 2006 considered to be a relatively liberal catholic theologian , the cardinal is a close associate of pope benedict xvi , who is also german .
lehmann became deputy head of german bishops in 1985 and was appointed chairman in 1987 .
he has held that post longer than any other bishop . he is viewed as a moral authority in germany , and became a symbol for the catholic church in the country .
but he has not always appealed to everyone , something with which he has learned to come to terms . in an interview with public broadcaster südwestrundfunk -lrb- swr -rrb- , he said adapting to situations is important . " since i have been chairman of the catholic bishops ' conference in germany , i have learned that i must remain open during every type of discussion and that i must not alienate anyone , " he said .
" so rather than defending myself in certain situations in which it might have been called for , i just let it go . " indeed , some of his more conservative colleagues have been more than a little irked by his refusal to toe the traditional catholic line .
he tried , for instance , to be a mediator when catholic university professors protested against the vatican in 1989 . promoting dialogue between religions mediation has often been his role , also in inter-religious dialogue . nikolaus schneider , a leader within the protestant church , said about lehmann 's resignation : " he was and is a blessing , and not only for the roman-catholic church , but for all christians and for the entire country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal colleague joachim meisner has often been slammed for his ultra-conservative views kurt beck , the leader of germany 's social democratic party and premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , where mainz is located , said : " his influence went far beyond the religious circles , and was felt within the public at large . " beck noted lehmann 's ability as a brilliant theologian to reconcile situations through his humor and humane , down-to-earth approach . guido westerwelle , head of the liberal free democrats , called lehmann an " important moral authority . " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany regretted lehmann 's resignation , commenting that the bishop has been a reliable contact for jewish representatives . nonetheless , lehmann upset many muslims last year , when he spoke out against islam enjoying equal status to christianity in europe . cardinal lehmann said he would like to remain in the service of the archdiocese of mainz for several more years and would still like to contribute his knowledge in the german bishops ' conference in a non-leader role . he is still to lead the spring plenary meeting of bishops in würzburg in mid-february before stepping down . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political deals behind closed doors , and not due process , made their return home possible in the first place , experts say . on monday , jan .
14 , six french aid workers convicted of kidnapping 103 children in the central african country of chad went before a court in the paris suburb of creteil . however , their punishment had already been decided last december : chad judges sentenced the charity workers to eight years of forced labor and a collective fine of 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 9.2 million -rrb- on charges of child trafficking for zoe 's ark , a humanitarian aid organization . due to the intervention of french president nicolas sarkozy , the group was repatriated to france two days after the chadian sentence was meted out . since france has the largest contingent in a multilateral peacekeeping operation in eastern chad , near the sudanese border , and even saved chadian president idriss deby 's regime from being overthrown by rebels , sarkozy was able to exercise some political leverage on behalf of the aid workers , said antoine comte , a french expert on extradition and criminal law . " the repatriation was a done political deal between two heads of state that was carried out behind closed doors and had nothing to do with due process , " he said . french translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no retrial of the repatriated aid workers but french judges were asked to adapt the prison sentence in accordance with the terms of a 1976 bilateral accord between france and chad , a former french colony .
translating the chadian sentence into french domestic legislation is not without its problems though , since france does not condemn its prisoners to forced labor .
so the creteil prosecutor , jean-jacques bosc , sought eight years imprisonment instead . " this case is not about a retrial on french territory , which would be a violation of international principles , " bosc said in a statement to journalists . the press office of the french justice ministry had also emphasized that the aid workers were not extradited home to stand trial , but were convicted criminals who were simply repatriated to serve out a foreign prison sentence in their own country . getting off lightly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children were not injured war orphans from darfur still , the aid workers will get off more lightly in france than in africa , other countries in the developing world , according to extradition experts . " compared to europe , the prison conditions in africa , generally speaking , are horrendous , " said john r.w.d. jones , an extradition and war crimes lawyer at doughty street chambers in london .
" beating up prisoners is considered one of the perks of a prison guard 's job , the food is atrocious , and the conditions violate international human rights conventions . " france may try to translate the forced labor provision of the chadian law into harsher conditions by denying the prisoners home leave and library or exercise privileges enjoyed by others , added jones . but the problem is that the prisoners may be able to file a complaint with the european court of justice in strasbourg on the grounds that they are being denied the right to equal treatment relative to the rest of the incarcerated population , he explained . a question of politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the driving force behind the deal , comte says once back on french soil , how the prisoners are treated is no longer a legal , but a political or diplomatic issue with chad , which has no legal recourse if the prisoners are treated too well . " in all likelihood , the chadians will not necessarily want assurances that the aid workers are suffering enough in prison , but if it became public that the prisoners were being treated very leniently , that would be a humiliation for chad , " jones said .
" how this affair is handled may be more about diplomatic face-saving than about the treatment of individuals . " legal expert comte meanwhile said that the french president should have taken an altogether different route . " instead of negotiating with an african dictator , sarkozy should have used french influence to push chad into pursuing a democratic legal process in the first place , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political deals behind closed doors , and not due process , made their return home possible in the first place , experts say . on monday , jan .
14 , six french aid workers convicted of kidnapping 103 children in the central african country of chad went before a court in the paris suburb of creteil . however , their punishment had already been decided last december : chad judges sentenced the charity workers to eight years of forced labor and a collective fine of 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 9.2 million -rrb- on charges of child trafficking for zoe 's ark , a humanitarian aid organization . due to the intervention of french president nicolas sarkozy , the group was repatriated to france two days after the chadian sentence was meted out . since france has the largest contingent in a multilateral peacekeeping operation in eastern chad , near the sudanese border , and even saved chadian president idriss deby 's regime from being overthrown by rebels , sarkozy was able to exercise some political leverage on behalf of the aid workers , said antoine comte , a french expert on extradition and criminal law . " the repatriation was a done political deal between two heads of state that was carried out behind closed doors and had nothing to do with due process , " he said . french translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no retrial of the repatriated aid workers but french judges were asked to adapt the prison sentence in accordance with the terms of a 1976 bilateral accord between france and chad , a former french colony .
translating the chadian sentence into french domestic legislation is not without its problems though , since france does not condemn its prisoners to forced labor .
so the creteil prosecutor , jean-jacques bosc , sought eight years imprisonment instead . " this case is not about a retrial on french territory , which would be a violation of international principles , " bosc said in a statement to journalists . the press office of the french justice ministry had also emphasized that the aid workers were not extradited home to stand trial , but were convicted criminals who were simply repatriated to serve out a foreign prison sentence in their own country . getting off lightly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children were not injured war orphans from darfur still , the aid workers will get off more lightly in france than in africa , other countries in the developing world , according to extradition experts . " compared to europe , the prison conditions in africa , generally speaking , are horrendous , " said john r.w.d. jones , an extradition and war crimes lawyer at doughty street chambers in london .
" beating up prisoners is considered one of the perks of a prison guard 's job , the food is atrocious , and the conditions violate international human rights conventions . " france may try to translate the forced labor provision of the chadian law into harsher conditions by denying the prisoners home leave and library or exercise privileges enjoyed by others , added jones . but the problem is that the prisoners may be able to file a complaint with the european court of justice in strasbourg on the grounds that they are being denied the right to equal treatment relative to the rest of the incarcerated population , he explained . a question of politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the driving force behind the deal , comte says once back on french soil , how the prisoners are treated is no longer a legal , but a political or diplomatic issue with chad , which has no legal recourse if the prisoners are treated too well . " in all likelihood , the chadians will not necessarily want assurances that the aid workers are suffering enough in prison , but if it became public that the prisoners were being treated very leniently , that would be a humiliation for chad , " jones said .
" how this affair is handled may be more about diplomatic face-saving than about the treatment of individuals . " legal expert comte meanwhile said that the french president should have taken an altogether different route . " instead of negotiating with an african dictator , sarkozy should have used french influence to push chad into pursuing a democratic legal process in the first place , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 15.01.2008 berlin agrees on new gm labeling law - but how strict is it ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the new law , 300 meters -lrb- 985 feet -rrb- must seperate organic and gm crops with a view to creating greater transparency for consumers , germany is to introduce a special label for food that has not been genetically modified , such as products from animals that have not been fed biotech grains . deputy agriculture minister gert lindemann said the new " non-gm " label will apply not only to non-genetically-modified crops but to eggs , meat and milk from animals that were raised without biotech feed . for the last four years , german food manufacturers have had the option of labeling food containing traces of gm technology , although few have made use of it because of legal uncertainties .
officially , the certificate could only be used if gene technology was absent from the entire production process - milk from a cow , for example , which had been treated with medicine manufactured using genetically modified micro-organisms could not be labeled gm-free . the bundestag , germany 's parliament , is expected to approve the law next week , allowing it to be introduced in spring . watchdogs approve bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers demonstrate for the right to choose consumer watchdogs have hailed the move as a pragmatic solution .
they say it provides farmers with greater motivation to avoid using genetically modified products such as corn and soya .
in the past , they were more likely not to go to the trouble , since they knew they would not be allowed to use the non-gm label anyway . " the new labeling will give consumers the choice to buy dairy products from animals that have not been fed with genetically modified plants , " said gerd billen from the federation of german consumer organizations in tuesday 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .

probably one of the most famous portraits in the world , leonardo da vinci 's mona lisa has long baffled the art critics - not least the question : who is she ?
german academics think they 've just found the answer . she might be around 500 years old , but she 's as beguiling as ever .
and now , we apparently know for a fact who she is .
an academic at heidelberg university is confident that the centuries-old mystery surrounding the identity of mona lisa has been solved .
according to veit probst , director of the heidelberg university library , she is " undoubtedly " lisa gherardini .
the wife of wealthy florentine merchant francesco del giocondo has long been seen as the most likely model - the painting dating back to the early 16th century is also known as " la gioconda " - but art historians have often debated whether the smiling woman might have been da vinci 's lover , his mother or even the artist himself .
over the years , other potential sitters for the portrait have included isabella of aragon and constanza d 'avalos , duchess of francavilla , a patron of leonardo and mistress of giuliano de medici .
definitive confirmation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidelberg university has put paid to the conspiracy theories but probst has now revealed that dated notes scribbled in the margins of a book at heidelberg university library by its owner in october 1503 , first found by armin schlechter , a manuscript expert , confirm once and for all that lisa del giocondo was indeed the model , and her husband most likely the man who commissioned the portrait .
nonetheless , the couple never owned the painting themselves .
in 1506 , leonardo took it with him to france , where he sold it to king francois i , who kept it at fontainebleau , where it remained until given to louis xiv .
reuters reported that the notes were made by a florentine city official , agostino vespucci , an acquaintance of the artist , in a collection of letters by the roman orator cicero .
the comments compare leonardo to the ancient greek artist apelles and say he was working on three paintings at the time , one of them a portrait of lisa del giocondo .
a breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : da vinci was part of the italian renaissance art experts have hailed the heidelberg discovery as a breakthrough and the earliest mention linking the merchant 's wife to the portrait , which hangs in the louvre in paris .

" one could even say that books written about all this in the past few years were unnecessary . "
the heidelberg notes were actually discovered by armin schlechter over two years ago in the library , a spokeswoman said .

18 .
the sometimes controversial , but respected bishop is known to have had health problems last year . cardinal karl lehmann said he would resign from his post as german catholic church leader next month , after having led the country 's bishops for over 20 years . the 71-year-old has apparently been suffering from health problems , having been admitted to the hospital at the end of last year after complaining about his heart . he was unable to lead traditional christmas and new year 's services , but did return to celebrate the epiphany on jan .
6 in mainz 's cathedral , where he has been bishop since 1983 . on tuesday , jan .
15 , in his resignation letter , he wrote that now was the appropriate time to step down . " the recent appointments of new bishops has shown that it 's time for a changing of the guard , it 's time that a new generation takes over , " lehmann wrote . aachen 's bishop heinrich mussinghoff , who is also deputy chairman of the german bishops ' conference , thanked lehmann for his " unflagging service " for the catholic church , and paid tribute to him as " an excellent and reliable representative of the church and its message . " hans joachim meyer , of the central committee of german catholics , said of lehmann on tuesday : " he has set standards through his actions , which will not be forgotten . " considered to be less conservative than colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel -lrb- c -rrb- expressed good wishes to lehmann -lrb- r -rrb- on his 70th birthday in 2006 considered to be a relatively liberal catholic theologian , the cardinal is a close associate of pope benedict xvi , who is also german .
lehmann became deputy head of german bishops in 1985 and was appointed chairman in 1987 .
he has held that post longer than any other bishop . he is viewed as a moral authority in germany , and became a symbol for the catholic church in the country .
but he has not always appealed to everyone , something with which he has learned to come to terms . in an interview with public broadcaster südwestrundfunk -lrb- swr -rrb- , he said adapting to situations is important . " since i have been chairman of the catholic bishops ' conference in germany , i have learned that i must remain open during every type of discussion and that i must not alienate anyone , " he said .
" so rather than defending myself in certain situations in which it might have been called for , i just let it go . " indeed , some of his more conservative colleagues have been more than a little irked by his refusal to toe the traditional catholic line .
he tried , for instance , to be a mediator when catholic university professors protested against the vatican in 1989 . promoting dialogue between religions mediation has often been his role , also in inter-religious dialogue . nikolaus schneider , a leader within the protestant church , said about lehmann 's resignation : " he was and is a blessing , and not only for the roman-catholic church , but for all christians and for the entire country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal colleague joachim meisner has often been slammed for his ultra-conservative views kurt beck , the leader of germany 's social democratic party and premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , where mainz is located , said : " his influence went far beyond the religious circles , and was felt within the public at large . " beck noted lehmann 's ability as a brilliant theologian to reconcile situations through his humor and humane , down-to-earth approach . guido westerwelle , head of the liberal free democrats , called lehmann an " important moral authority . " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany regretted lehmann 's resignation , commenting that the bishop has been a reliable contact for jewish representatives . nonetheless , lehmann upset many muslims last year , when he spoke out against islam enjoying equal status to christianity in europe . cardinal lehmann said he would like to remain in the service of the archdiocese of mainz for several more years and would still like to contribute his knowledge in the german bishops ' conference in a non-leader role . he is still to lead the spring plenary meeting of bishops in würzburg in mid-february before stepping down . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 15.01.2008 german experts solve mona lisa mystery once and for all großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is she , and why is she smiling ?
probably one of the most famous portraits in the world , leonardo da vinci 's mona lisa has long baffled the art critics - not least the question : who is she ?
german academics think they 've just found the answer . she might be around 500 years old , but she 's as beguiling as ever .
and now , we apparently know for a fact who she is .
an academic at heidelberg university is confident that the centuries-old mystery surrounding the identity of mona lisa has been solved .
according to veit probst , director of the heidelberg university library , she is " undoubtedly " lisa gherardini .
the wife of wealthy florentine merchant francesco del giocondo has long been seen as the most likely model - the painting dating back to the early 16th century is also known as " la gioconda " - but art historians have often debated whether the smiling woman might have been da vinci 's lover , his mother or even the artist himself .
over the years , other potential sitters for the portrait have included isabella of aragon and constanza d 'avalos , duchess of francavilla , a patron of leonardo and mistress of giuliano de medici .
definitive confirmation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidelberg university has put paid to the conspiracy theories but probst has now revealed that dated notes scribbled in the margins of a book at heidelberg university library by its owner in october 1503 , first found by armin schlechter , a manuscript expert , confirm once and for all that lisa del giocondo was indeed the model , and her husband most likely the man who commissioned the portrait .
nonetheless , the couple never owned the painting themselves .
in 1506 , leonardo took it with him to france , where he sold it to king francois i , who kept it at fontainebleau , where it remained until given to louis xiv .
reuters reported that the notes were made by a florentine city official , agostino vespucci , an acquaintance of the artist , in a collection of letters by the roman orator cicero .
the comments compare leonardo to the ancient greek artist apelles and say he was working on three paintings at the time , one of them a portrait of lisa del giocondo .
a breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : da vinci was part of the italian renaissance art experts have hailed the heidelberg discovery as a breakthrough and the earliest mention linking the merchant 's wife to the portrait , which hangs in the louvre in paris .
" there is no reason for any lingering doubts that this is another woman , " leipzig university art historian frank zöllner told a german radio station .
" one could even say that books written about all this in the past few years were unnecessary . "
the heidelberg notes were actually discovered by armin schlechter over two years ago in the library , a spokeswoman said .
although the findings had been printed in the library 's public catalog they had not been widely publicized and had received little attention until a german broadcaster decided to do some recording at the library , she said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 .
the sometimes controversial , but respected bishop is known to have had health problems last year . cardinal karl lehmann said he would resign from his post as german catholic church leader next month , after having led the country 's bishops for over 20 years . the 71-year-old has apparently been suffering from health problems , having been admitted to the hospital at the end of last year after complaining about his heart . he was unable to lead traditional christmas and new year 's services , but did return to celebrate the epiphany on jan .
6 in mainz 's cathedral , where he has been bishop since 1983 . on tuesday , jan .
15 , in his resignation letter , he wrote that now was the appropriate time to step down . " the recent appointments of new bishops has shown that it 's time for a changing of the guard , it 's time that a new generation takes over , " lehmann wrote . aachen 's bishop heinrich mussinghoff , who is also deputy chairman of the german bishops ' conference , thanked lehmann for his " unflagging service " for the catholic church , and paid tribute to him as " an excellent and reliable representative of the church and its message . " hans joachim meyer , of the central committee of german catholics , said of lehmann on tuesday : " he has set standards through his actions , which will not be forgotten . " considered to be less conservative than colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel -lrb- c -rrb- expressed good wishes to lehmann -lrb- r -rrb- on his 70th birthday in 2006 considered to be a relatively liberal catholic theologian , the cardinal is a close associate of pope benedict xvi , who is also german .
lehmann became deputy head of german bishops in 1985 and was appointed chairman in 1987 .
he has held that post longer than any other bishop . he is viewed as a moral authority in germany , and became a symbol for the catholic church in the country .
but he has not always appealed to everyone , something with which he has learned to come to terms . in an interview with public broadcaster südwestrundfunk -lrb- swr -rrb- , he said adapting to situations is important . " since i have been chairman of the catholic bishops ' conference in germany , i have learned that i must remain open during every type of discussion and that i must not alienate anyone , " he said .
" so rather than defending myself in certain situations in which it might have been called for , i just let it go . " indeed , some of his more conservative colleagues have been more than a little irked by his refusal to toe the traditional catholic line .
he tried , for instance , to be a mediator when catholic university professors protested against the vatican in 1989 . promoting dialogue between religions mediation has often been his role , also in inter-religious dialogue . nikolaus schneider , a leader within the protestant church , said about lehmann 's resignation : " he was and is a blessing , and not only for the roman-catholic church , but for all christians and for the entire country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal colleague joachim meisner has often been slammed for his ultra-conservative views kurt beck , the leader of germany 's social democratic party and premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , where mainz is located , said : " his influence went far beyond the religious circles , and was felt within the public at large . " beck noted lehmann 's ability as a brilliant theologian to reconcile situations through his humor and humane , down-to-earth approach . guido westerwelle , head of the liberal free democrats , called lehmann an " important moral authority . " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany regretted lehmann 's resignation , commenting that the bishop has been a reliable contact for jewish representatives . nonetheless , lehmann upset many muslims last year , when he spoke out against islam enjoying equal status to christianity in europe . cardinal lehmann said he would like to remain in the service of the archdiocese of mainz for several more years and would still like to contribute his knowledge in the german bishops ' conference in a non-leader role . he is still to lead the spring plenary meeting of bishops in würzburg in mid-february before stepping down . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most would-be ticket buyers are expected to go away empty-handed . similar to the lottery setup for the 2006 world cup , soccer fans will enter an online drawing for the 14,400 tickets put up for sale by the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .

12 . prospective ticket buyers can register their names and payment details to purchase a maximum of four tickets .
ticket winners are scheduled to be drawn at the end of february .
anyone interested in seeing a germany game - not only germans - can enter the dfb 's ticket lottery . the soccer organization said it was keeping 30 percent of its tickets for the june 7 to june 29 tournament for dignitaries , dfb officials , sponsors and players . " everyone will understand that we have to serve our committees , the bundesliga clubs , state soccer associations , sponsors and national team players from this really very small allotment of tickets , " dfb general secretary wolfgang niersbach said in a statement on monday . small stadiums limit seating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tournament 's stadia have been criticized as being too small should germany advance to the tournament 's knock-out stage , the country will receive 22,000 more tickets , of which 70 percent would be made available to the public . expecting a good showing from the german team , one of the tournament 's favorites , the dfb is selling vouchers for knock-out stage matches , which will be exchanged for tickets if germany advances . some 5,722 tickets are available for 45 euros -lrb- $ 66 -rrb- for the first-round matches against poland and croatia on june 8 and june 12 at klagenfurt , and 10,321 for the clash against austria in vienna on june 16 .
the highest-priced ticket for the final match in vienna is 550 euros .
all tickets are subject to a 5 percent ticketing fee and 20 euro charge for shipping and handling . the limited capacity of stadia hosting germany 's games has been criticized in the german press .
the klagenfurt stadium holds 30,000 people while the vienna stadium has a capacity of 50,000 . " a lot of disappointment " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lottery is german soccer fans ' last chance for euro 2008 tickets " it is unfortunate , but we do not have any influence on ticket allocation , " dfb president theo zwanziger said , adding it was determined by uefa , europe 's governing soccer body .
" i know that there is going to be a lot of disappointment . " the daily mass-market bild newspaper complained in an editorial on sunday that the dfb was keeping too many tickets for itself . " ninety-nine percent of german supporters who will apply to buy a ticket will go away empty-handed to the delight of the black market , where tickets at 850 euros are already available , " the paper wrote .
" and that leads to the question : is -lsb- soccer -rsb- now just for the rich ? " national soccer federations , including the dfb , receive tickets only to european championship matches involving their country .

it is not clear what effect the ruling will have , as japan does not recognise australia 's antarctic claim .
but it is likely to raise tensions between the two nations , which are far apart on the issue of whaling .
the japanese fleet plans to kill about 900 minke whales and 50 fin whales by mid-april as part of what it describes as a scientific research programme .
but australia and other nations say the research goals could be achieved using non-lethal methods and call the programme a front for commercial whaling .

the judgement , however , is unlikely to end the whaling .

the federal court said japan had broken domestic law by killing whales in australian waters off antarctica .
it is not clear what effect the ruling will have , as japan does not recognise australia 's antarctic claim .
but it is likely to raise tensions between the two nations , which are far apart on the issue of whaling .
the japanese fleet plans to kill about 900 minke whales and 50 fin whales by mid-april as part of what it describes as a scientific research programme .
but australia and other nations say the research goals could be achieved using non-lethal methods and call the programme a front for commercial whaling .
the case , initially brought in 2004 by the humane society against ship operator kyodo senpaku kaisha , was delayed for several years because of fears it could cause a diplomatic row .
whale sanctuary at the court in sydney , justice james allsop ruled that the fleet had broken australia 's environment protection act and issued an injunction ordering it to stop whaling .
" the court orders that the respondent be restrained from killing , injuring , taking or interfering with any antarctic minke whale , fin whale or humpback whale in the australian whale sanctuary , " he said in his ruling .
the judgement , however , is unlikely to end the whaling .
japan does not recognise australia 's antarctic claim or its declaration of a whale sanctuary in the area .
tokyo has said in the past that it will ignore any injunction resulting from the case .
the court also has no jurisdiction outside australia and justice allsop said it was unlikely that his ruling could be enforced .
australia 's environment minister peter garrett said that he was still considering the decision , but emphasised that surveillance operations were in place .
an australian patrol ship and an aircraft have already been sent south to assemble photographic and video material of the fleet for a possible legal challenge in international courts .
ships from environmental group greenpeace and the more radical sea shepherd are also trailing the fleet in a bid to disrupt the hunt .
they say they have forced the main factory ship , the nisshin maru , out of the whaling zone , temporarily preventing the fleet from hunting .
japanese whaling officials have condemned the two groups , blaming them for past collisions and describing their activities as illegal harassment .

the 3m factory in gorseinon makes tapes , adhesives and aerosols but said it has experienced a decline in demand .
this was not a " temporary blip " said a manager who blamed rising costs for raw materials and a change in the markets .
the fact the factory had survived more than 50 years was a sign , he hoped , it could " rise again " to this challenge .
no similar review is planned at 3m 's other welsh factory in bridgend which manufactures microbiology products for the food and environmental industry .
employees at 3m gorseinon , which opened in 1952 , were briefed on the challenges facing the site on monday , said a statement from the company .
unions are also in talks with management .
certainly the employees we have here are absolutely superb and we 've managed to overcome many problems in the past jim loft , human resources manager john bowers , plant manager , said : " we are experiencing a decline in demand for our products and this has forced us to consider the medium to longer term future of the plant .
" whilst we have identified some produce areas we believe will be sustainable over the longer term , there are also significant parts of the business facing real challenges going forward . "
jim loft , human resources manager , said a major part of the factory 's product range was made for manufacturers of disposable nappies .
products include paper and adhesive items he said : " we 're being squeezed at the moment in these markets by both rises in costs for raw materials and energy as well as we 're seeing a movement in the markets that 's taking the manufacturers onto different nappy constructions .
" and that means that our products are n't being used by them in the same volumes . "
' peaks and troughs ' asked whether he could rule out closure , he said they were less concerned about some areas of the plant than others but they were not ruling anything out or in at this stage .
but , he added : " i 've certainly seen many changes here and we 've responded and risen to the challenges , certain peaks and troughs as we 've gone ... a very long time , over 50 years the plant has been here .
" i 'd like to think that that is a sign that we can rise again to this particular challenge .
" certainly the employees we have here are absolutely superb and we 've managed to overcome many problems in the past .
" so that leads me down the path of hoping that this significant business issue is something that we can work our way through together . "
mr loft said they would initially deal with the short-term issue of the fall in volume and then work with the union groups to address longer-term issues .
he hoped that in around a month , they would have something " more significant " to tell employees .
the gorseinon plant is the american company 's oldest manufacturing facility outside the us .

the proposals also include establishing three new outreach service points , two in chepstow and one in caldicot .
a six week public consultation on the plans has been launched .
the latest announcement follows a closure list of 31 post offices in cardiff , bridgend , vale of glamorgan and valleys issued last october .
the plans will leave 126 post offices in the newport and gwent valleys but the company insists more than 99.6 % of the area 's population will either see no change , or will remain within a mile of an alternative branch .
meanwhile , a partnership with newsagent wh smith has safeguarded the future of services in cwmbran .
communities steve geraty , post office ltd 's network development manager for wales , said closing any branch was always very difficult .
" the newport and gwent valleys are diverse in nature - from the densely populated urban areas of newport , cwmbran and caerphilly to the former industrial valleys including the towns of ebbw vale and tredegar to rural monmouthshire .

the plans are part of a wider restructuring of post office services throughout the uk , as part of changes in technology and " changing lifestyles . " .
about 2,500 post offices - a fifth of those left in the uk - are to close by 2009 .

although he had recently shown signs of improvement , his doctors said that " anything could happen " .
the 86-year-old was rushed to hospital in jakarta on 4 january suffering from anaemia and low blood pressure .
suharto ruled indonesia with an iron fist for 32 years until popular protests forced him out in 1998 .
over the past 10 years , he and his family have been forced to deny allegations that they siphoned off billions of dollars while in power .
rise and fall of suharto born in java , june 1921 comes to power in 1965 after alleged communist coup attempt formally replaces sukarno as president in march 1967 modernisation programmes in the 70s and 80s raise living standards east timor invaded in late 1975 asian economic crisis of the 1990s hits indonesian economy spiralling prices and discontent force him to resign in may 1998 judges rule he is unfit to stand trial for corruption in 2000 transparency international says he tops the world all-time corruption table in march 2004 life in pictures suharto suffered multiple organ failure on friday and doctors have said they are amazed by his strength .
he has developed pneumonia in one of his lungs and the blood infection sepsis .
muhammad munawar , a cardiologist treating suharto , earlier told domestic radio that anything could happen .
" every minute we must observe developments and frankly , these can go up and down , " he said .
suharto has had a series of high-profile visitors in hospital , including malaysia 's former prime minister mahathir mohamad .
suharto supporters credit him with leading his country from poverty to relative prosperity , but he is also accused of repression and responsibility for severe human rights abuses , as well as corruption .
however , he never faced trial on any of these allegations - his lawyers argued that he was too ill .
he has been in and out of hospital in recent years with a series of strokes and other illnesses .

" it looks like samsung has moved to improve its product mix and cut costs faster than the market had expected , " said kim young-il , fund manager at hanwha investment trust management .
the investigations into the samsung group began last week after former samsung lawyer kim yong-chul said the company had bribed prosecutors , judges and government officials .

mark ronson started out producing rappers on his drum machine the british-born star , who grew up in new york , produced the best-selling album in the uk last year , amy winehouse 's back to black .
ronson talks about the huge success of his covers album version , how he has dealt with the fame that goes with it and his latest single from the album , just .
your cover of radiohead track just was first released in 2006 .
why are you re-releasing it again ?
in england you can release the same single twice .
the first time it came out it was on an indie label .
it 's pretty much my favourite record and the one that started the whole album really .
it was my first " eureka ! " album , it was really cool to take these songs i love and arrange them .
what are your plans for performing at the brit awards ?
we 're just working out exactly what we 're going to do , there are lots of special moments i hear from what other people are doing so i want to make sure it 's great .
it 's a really big deal , the first thing of this level that we 've been asked to do so i want to make it good .
do you have any plans to work with amy winehouse again ?
i guess i 'm like a leech - i suck energy from the bands i 'm working with mark ronson i 'd love to work with her again when she 's ready to record .
i 'm finishing a daniel merriweather album right now .
the rumble strips are coming on the road with us and hopefully we 'll get to work on the record .
what do you think of amy 's new hairdo ?
i have n't seen it but i had a short hairdo and dyed it blonde when i was 17 .
i do n't think anyone 's seen those pictures !
what about robbie williams ?
i went to his house in la and listened to some amazing new songs but we have n't set a time to work .
i 'd love to work with him though , he 's an amazing songwriter .
any other projects coming up you want to tell us about ?
i 'm going to spend most of this year producing records .
there 's some other things i do n't want to mention yet as i do n't want to jinx it .
what about another record of your own ?
i 'm not going to do another covers album .
it 's enough , i 've covered all my favourite songs .
it would be like scraping the bottom of the barrel .
i 'm sure other people will start doing it now .
even though i started making my own record before working with amy and lily -lrb- allen -rrb- , working with them gave me a lot of inspiration for my own album .
i thrive on that , i guess i 'm like a leech .
i suck energy from the bands i 'm working with .
how did you go about choosing the covers and the artists for version ?
i just chose my favourite songs .
i did n't have a record deal at the time so it was just people i knew , or if i was working on their record , like amy and lily .
it was really organic .
i did n't have the money to go after people .
they were just happy accidents .
do you worry about getting negative feedback from fans who do n't approve of you altering classic tracks ?
you do get negative feedback from serious fans because we 're talking about some of the best bands ever , like the jam and radiohead .
but when i first did the record , i did n't think anyone would hear it and that it would just be part of my dj set .
and coming from a dj-ing culture , you 're always remixing , always changing and evolving music for your set .
so i would n't think twice about re-interpreting a song no matter who it is by .
how do you deal with the fame you have recently encountered ?
i live in new york , they do n't have the same ' walk down the street and get recognised ' thing like here .
not that it really happens that much here ...
i kind of like that .
there are some people that want to be famous for the sake of it but that 's not something that interests me .
do you ever wish you had been the frontman of a band rather than more behind the scenes ?
the best part of doing the tour shows is playing with the band .
dj-ing is such a lone experience , whereas you have this support system -lrb- on tour -rrb- .
when we 're touring i feel like i 'm in a great band .
how did you get into producing ?
i just started producing rappers on my drum machine , which was given to me by my step-dad who is a musician -lrb- mick jones of foreigner -rrb- .
are you surprised about the way everything has taken off for you in the last year ?
yeah , it 's really funny we 're here two years later shooting a video for a song that i did in my bedroom .
it 's bizarre but i understand that i 've caught a bit of a moment in time , coming off amy and lily being such huge figures here and being involved in that .
it 's cool .
mark ronson 's new single is released on 18 february .

i have n't seen it but i had a short hairdo and dyed it blonde when i was 17 .
i do n't think anyone 's seen those pictures !
what about robbie williams ?
i went to his house in la and listened to some amazing new songs but we have n't set a time to work .
i 'd love to work with him though , he 's an amazing songwriter .
any other projects coming up you want to tell us about ?
i 'm going to spend most of this year producing records .
there 's some other things i do n't want to mention yet as i do n't want to jinx it .
what about another record of your own ?
i 'm not going to do another covers album .
it 's enough , i 've covered all my favourite songs .
it would be like scraping the bottom of the barrel .
i 'm sure other people will start doing it now .
even though i started making my own record before working with amy and lily -lrb- allen -rrb- , working with them gave me a lot of inspiration for my own album .
i thrive on that , i guess i 'm like a leech .
i suck energy from the bands i 'm working with .
how did you go about choosing the covers and the artists for version ?
i just chose my favourite songs .
i did n't have a record deal at the time so it was just people i knew , or if i was working on their record , like amy and lily .
it was really organic .
i did n't have the money to go after people .
they were just happy accidents .
do you worry about getting negative feedback from fans who do n't approve of you altering classic tracks ?
you do get negative feedback from serious fans because we 're talking about some of the best bands ever , like the jam and radiohead .
but when i first did the record , i did n't think anyone would hear it and that it would just be part of my dj set .
and coming from a dj-ing culture , you 're always remixing , always changing and evolving music for your set .
so i would n't think twice about re-interpreting a song no matter who it is by .
how do you deal with the fame you have recently encountered ?
i live in new york , they do n't have the same ' walk down the street and get recognised ' thing like here .
not that it really happens that much here ...
i kind of like that .
there are some people that want to be famous for the sake of it but that 's not something that interests me .
do you ever wish you had been the frontman of a band rather than more behind the scenes ?
the best part of doing the tour shows is playing with the band .
dj-ing is such a lone experience , whereas you have this support system -lrb- on tour -rrb- .
when we 're touring i feel like i 'm in a great band .
how did you get into producing ?
i just started producing rappers on my drum machine , which was given to me by my step-dad who is a musician -lrb- mick jones of foreigner -rrb- .
are you surprised about the way everything has taken off for you in the last year ?
yeah , it 's really funny we 're here two years later shooting a video for a song that i did in my bedroom .
it 's bizarre but i understand that i 've caught a bit of a moment in time , coming off amy and lily being such huge figures here and being involved in that .
it 's cool .

mark ronson started out producing rappers on his drum machine the british-born star , who grew up in new york , produced the best-selling album in the uk last year , amy winehouse 's back to black .
ronson talks about the huge success of his covers album version , how he has dealt with the fame that goes with it and his latest single from the album , just .
your cover of radiohead track just was first released in 2006 .
why are you re-releasing it again ?
in england you can release the same single twice .
the first time it came out it was on an indie label .
it 's pretty much my favourite record and the one that started the whole album really .
it was my first " eureka ! " album , it was really cool to take these songs i love and arrange them .
what are your plans for performing at the brit awards ?
we 're just working out exactly what we 're going to do , there are lots of special moments i hear from what other people are doing so i want to make sure it 's great .
it 's a really big deal , the first thing of this level that we 've been asked to do so i want to make it good .
do you have any plans to work with amy winehouse again ?
i guess i 'm like a leech - i suck energy from the bands i 'm working with mark ronson i 'd love to work with her again when she 's ready to record .
i 'm finishing a daniel merriweather album right now .
the rumble strips are coming on the road with us and hopefully we 'll get to work on the record .
what do you think of amy 's new hairdo ?
i have n't seen it but i had a short hairdo and dyed it blonde when i was 17 .
i do n't think anyone 's seen those pictures !
what about robbie williams ?
i went to his house in la and listened to some amazing new songs but we have n't set a time to work .
i 'd love to work with him though , he 's an amazing songwriter .
any other projects coming up you want to tell us about ?
i 'm going to spend most of this year producing records .
there 's some other things i do n't want to mention yet as i do n't want to jinx it .
what about another record of your own ?
i 'm not going to do another covers album .
it 's enough , i 've covered all my favourite songs .
it would be like scraping the bottom of the barrel .
i 'm sure other people will start doing it now .
even though i started making my own record before working with amy and lily -lrb- allen -rrb- , working with them gave me a lot of inspiration for my own album .
i thrive on that , i guess i 'm like a leech .
i suck energy from the bands i 'm working with .
how did you go about choosing the covers and the artists for version ?
i just chose my favourite songs .
i did n't have a record deal at the time so it was just people i knew , or if i was working on their record , like amy and lily .
it was really organic .
i did n't have the money to go after people .
they were just happy accidents .
do you worry about getting negative feedback from fans who do n't approve of you altering classic tracks ?
you do get negative feedback from serious fans because we 're talking about some of the best bands ever , like the jam and radiohead .
but when i first did the record , i did n't think anyone would hear it and that it would just be part of my dj set .
and coming from a dj-ing culture , you 're always remixing , always changing and evolving music for your set .
so i would n't think twice about re-interpreting a song no matter who it is by .
how do you deal with the fame you have recently encountered ?
i live in new york , they do n't have the same ' walk down the street and get recognised ' thing like here .
not that it really happens that much here ...
i kind of like that .
there are some people that want to be famous for the sake of it but that 's not something that interests me .
do you ever wish you had been the frontman of a band rather than more behind the scenes ?
the best part of doing the tour shows is playing with the band .
dj-ing is such a lone experience , whereas you have this support system -lrb- on tour -rrb- .
when we 're touring i feel like i 'm in a great band .
how did you get into producing ?
i just started producing rappers on my drum machine , which was given to me by my step-dad who is a musician -lrb- mick jones of foreigner -rrb- .
are you surprised about the way everything has taken off for you in the last year ?
yeah , it 's really funny we 're here two years later shooting a video for a song that i did in my bedroom .
it 's bizarre but i understand that i 've caught a bit of a moment in time , coming off amy and lily being such huge figures here and being involved in that .
it 's cool .
mark ronson 's new single is released on 18 february .

but when i first did the record , i did n't think anyone would hear it and that it would just be part of my dj set .
and coming from a dj-ing culture , you 're always remixing , always changing and evolving music for your set .
so i would n't think twice about re-interpreting a song no matter who it is by .
how do you deal with the fame you have recently encountered ?
i live in new york , they do n't have the same ' walk down the street and get recognised ' thing like here .
not that it really happens that much here ...
i kind of like that .
there are some people that want to be famous for the sake of it but that 's not something that interests me .
do you ever wish you had been the frontman of a band rather than more behind the scenes ?
the best part of doing the tour shows is playing with the band .
dj-ing is such a lone experience , whereas you have this support system -lrb- on tour -rrb- .
when we 're touring i feel like i 'm in a great band .
how did you get into producing ?
i just started producing rappers on my drum machine , which was given to me by my step-dad who is a musician -lrb- mick jones of foreigner -rrb- .
are you surprised about the way everything has taken off for you in the last year ?
yeah , it 's really funny we 're here two years later shooting a video for a song that i did in my bedroom .
it 's bizarre but i understand that i 've caught a bit of a moment in time , coming off amy and lily being such huge figures here and being involved in that .
it 's cool .

like any other fan of the site they update their status , message each other , upload and tag photos , and link to their friends .
what they are not aware of is that they are being monitored by researchers , who are almost overwhelmed by the amount of data they can gather about tastes , preferences and relationships .
sociologists at the university of california , los angeles -lrb- ucla -rrb- , and harvard university in the united states are using the social networking site for academic research .
" we 're harvesting information from facebook .
we have all the information on an entire class of students .
we are gathering that data and transforming it into a dataset that can be easily used for all kinds of analysis " said andreas wimmer , professor of sociology at ucla .
" it 's a wealth of data on who relates to whom , and who becomes friends with whom , that is quite unprecedented .
compared to the usual survey data it 's a huge leap forward in terms of the precision with which relationships are recorded , " he said .
facebook users can set privacy controls , to limit who can see their profiles .
but researchers say that currently most of the students they are looking at have n't chosen to make their sites private , and therefore they are knowingly making details of their lives public .
" there 's just a phenomenal amount of work being done that takes advantage of what i would call this passive , massive , data collection effort " said professor nicholas christakis from harvard university .
he told the digital planet programme on the bbc world service that as well as facebook , scientists are gathering data from all sorts of online activity .
" there are lots of people who are taking advantage of the fact that we leave digital traces nowadays .
people have been mining all kinds of data .
for example they 've been looking at telephone networks , instant messaging networks , blog postings .
some people have machine-readings of hundreds of millions of blog entries .
" there is even a website that tries to track how people are feeling in different parts of the world - looking at whether there are there hotspots of sadness , anger or happiness in different areas " he continued .
facebook is particularly useful to sociologists because of the way members accurately record relationships .
friends can add applications to compare tastes in everything from films to music to books .
that can help researchers establish whether people tend to form relationships with others who are similar to themselves .
the study looking at the entire class of students is scheduled to run for four years .
early results are helping to shed light on how people make friends .
" if you look at the entire picture of who is hanging out with whom - or what are the principles of group formation in this college , then you see that the most important thing is co-residence , who people who have been thrown together with in the same dorm " said prof wimmer .
" it seems that since this ' opportunity ' structure matters so much , what this college and a lot of others are doing , is mixing people from different backgrounds - racial , social-economic etc - in their dorms and their residences .
it really helps to establish ties across these various divides . "
longer term the researchers believe the increased understanding of the way relationships form could help identify students who are n't fitting in , and who are perhaps at a greater risk of suicide .

what they are not aware of is that they are being monitored by researchers , who are almost overwhelmed by the amount of data they can gather about tastes , preferences and relationships .
sociologists at the university of california , los angeles -lrb- ucla -rrb- , and harvard university in the united states are using the social networking site for academic research .
" we 're harvesting information from facebook .
we have all the information on an entire class of students .
we are gathering that data and transforming it into a dataset that can be easily used for all kinds of analysis " said andreas wimmer , professor of sociology at ucla .
the social sites help map who knows whom and what they do " it 's a wealth of data on who relates to whom , and who becomes friends with whom , that is quite unprecedented .
compared to the usual survey data it 's a huge leap forward in terms of the precision with which relationships are recorded , " he said .
facebook users can set privacy controls , to limit who can see their profiles .
but researchers say that currently most of the students they are looking at have n't chosen to make their sites private , and therefore they are knowingly making details of their lives public .
" there 's just a phenomenal amount of work being done that takes advantage of what i would call this passive , massive , data collection effort " said professor nicholas christakis from harvard university .
he told the digital planet programme on the bbc world service that as well as facebook , scientists are gathering data from all sorts of online activity .
" there are lots of people who are taking advantage of the fact that we leave digital traces nowadays .
people have been mining all kinds of data .
for example they 've been looking at telephone networks , instant messaging networks , blog postings .
some people have machine-readings of hundreds of millions of blog entries .
the research could help spot students who are at risk " there is even a website that tries to track how people are feeling in different parts of the world - looking at whether there are there hotspots of sadness , anger or happiness in different areas " he continued .
facebook is particularly useful to sociologists because of the way members accurately record relationships .
friends can add applications to compare tastes in everything from films to music to books .
that can help researchers establish whether people tend to form relationships with others who are similar to themselves .
the study looking at the entire class of students is scheduled to run for four years .
early results are helping to shed light on how people make friends .

" it seems that since this ' opportunity ' structure matters so much , what this college and a lot of others are doing , is mixing people from different backgrounds - racial , social-economic etc - in their dorms and their residences .
it really helps to establish ties across these various divides . "

superior court commissioner scott gordon left in place a ruling that bars spears from visiting her sons .
he issued the original order after ms spears was involved in a stand-off with police when she refused to return the children to ex-husband kevin federline .
ms spears , 26 , showed up at the hearing and was photographed by the paparazzi , but left before entering the courtroom .
another hearing was scheduled for 19 february .
' grave situation ' mr gordon heard a day of testimony from mr federline and witnesses to the three-hour police stand-off at the troubled pop star 's home earlier this month .
police were summoned on 3 january when ms spears became distraught and refused to return sean preston , two , and jayden james , one , to her ex-husband 's representatives after a monitored visit .
she was taken away on a stretcher and hospitalised for two days .
mr gordon ruled that an emergency order he issued on 4 january suspending her visitation rights and giving custody to mr federline would remain in effect .
" the word victory is not something mr federline or his counsel would ascribe to this .
there is no joy .
this is a grave situation for all , " mr federline 's lawyer , mark vincent kaplan , said outside the courthouse .
although mr federline thought the ruling was correct , mr kaplan said , " his goal , his hope for the future is at some point he will be able to parent the children with the participation of their mother . "
neither ms spears nor mr federline were required to attend the hearing , but mr federline arrived early .
ms spears did not arrive until early afternoon but left after being mobbed by photographers .
ms spears married mr federline in 2004 and filed for divorce in 2006 .
