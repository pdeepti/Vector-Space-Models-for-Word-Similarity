street art is something else - whether screens , murals , sculptures or installations - it has this fascinating wealth of forms , all rooted in the concept of ' urban art ' and influenced by avant-garde movements such as fluxus , pop art and conceptual art . " joining the establishment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition is pulling in the crowds unlike other cities which have demonized its urban artists , kuepper insists street art today is an integral staple of the berlin cultural scene and long regarded as hip . hollywood idols angelina jolie and brad pitt are great fans of street art .
a few months ago at they splashed out some 290,000 euros -lrb- $ 458,000 -rrb- for a stencil work by england artist banksy , considered one of the big names of the street art scene . kuepper says " street art " is gaining increasing global attention from the established art market , with work by its top exponents starting to break auction house records . el tono from spain is one of the participants in berlin .
the fact that he and his compatriot nano 4818 have been exhibiting at the tate modern 's street art show in london is proof for kuepper of the " staggering development and widespread notoriety of the anarchic art movement . " criminalized bildunterschrift : many artists work under pseudonyms most street artists hide their real identities behind pseudonyms - partly due to continuing criminalization of the art form in some regions .
in free-wheeling berlin , however , officials take a much more relaxed view . german artist el bocho takes to the berlin streets at night , carrying his hand-painted posters which he pastes on walls and abandoned properties .
sometimes he 's also seen attaching his cleverly designed tiles to buildings in the central mitte , prenzlauer berg and friedrichshain districts . el bocho says he 's never encountered problems with the law although he sometimes gets stopped by policemen asking what he 's doing wandering the streets at night . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

al-maliki will be in berlin on tuesday , july 22 , and is to meet german chancellor angela merkel .
" iraq needs germany on its side , " alaa al ashimy , iraqi ambassador to germany , said in an interview with deutsche welle .
european companies have long been eyeing opportunities in oil-rich iraq .
the european union is negotiating an energy pact with iraq , part of the bloc 's efforts to reduce dependence on russian oil and gas .
iraq has the world 's third largest proven reserves of oil and in june opened key producing fields to foreign investment .
" we 're talking to siemens , daimler and german firms involved in farming , oil and gas , " al-dabbagh said .
lucrative contracts beckon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-maliki , right , shakes with glos in baghdad last week , germany 's economy minister , michael glos , said one such company , wintershall , had a " big chance " of winning oil exploration rights in iraq .
it is part of chemicals group basf .
" i hope that it and other firms get more involved in extracting crude oil in iraq , " said glos on his way back from baghdad .
he was the first german cabinet minister to visit iraq since the us invasion of the country in 2003 .
asked if the time was ripe to invest in iraq , glos said : " i think so .
i felt in iraq that prime minister maliki has won the trust of the different ethnic groups .
it seems to me that he has managed to largely suppress the terrorists . "
a state-owned coach-assembly factory in the town of iskandariyah , about 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- south of the iraqi capital baghdad , is an example of those plants where the iraqi authorities would like to see german skills and money at work .
using dated machinery , only 450 people work now at a site that used to employ nearly 3,500 in its heyday under the late president saddam hussein .
baghdad has suggested to german carmaker daimler that it could be turning out gleaming mercedes-benz buses and trucks .
security remains a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide bombings are still a reality in iraq but iskandariyah is an edgy place .
in recent years , it was part of a zone of kidnappings and assassinations known as the death triangle , and german executives admit that they worry they could still be seized and held to ransom by criminals .
the german foreign ministry advises nationals to leave iraq immediately and not to trust the security forces whose capabilities are " limited " and loyalties " uncertain . "
those warnings have annoyed iraqi politicians , who insist the outlook is more positive .
al hashimy also said he thought government security warnings would n't keep germany from getting more involved in his country .
" the germans are patient and sceptical ; they think carefully before they make a decision .
but once they 've decided , then they act on their decision , and that 's the situation we 've reached now in 2008 , " he told deutsche welle .
as for the security warnings , glos himself took no chances during his visit .
he wore a bullet-proof vest and stayed in safe zones , though he later told the german daily die welt in an interview , " my impression is that the security situation is improving . "
a meeting with the pope from germany , al-maliki will travel to italy , which sent 3,000 troops to iraq after the us-led invasion in 2003 , but has since withdrawn them .
dabbagh said al-maliki would also meet pope benedict and brief him on the government 's measures to spread tolerance and national reconciliation among iraqis .

al-maliki will be in berlin on tuesday , july 22 , and is to meet german chancellor angela merkel .
" iraq needs germany on its side , " alaa al ashimy , iraqi ambassador to germany , said in an interview with deutsche welle .
european companies have long been eyeing opportunities in oil-rich iraq .
the european union is negotiating an energy pact with iraq , part of the bloc 's efforts to reduce dependence on russian oil and gas .
iraq has the world 's third largest proven reserves of oil and in june opened key producing fields to foreign investment .
" we 're talking to siemens , daimler and german firms involved in farming , oil and gas , " al-dabbagh said .
lucrative contracts beckon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-maliki , right , shakes with glos in baghdad last week , germany 's economy minister , michael glos , said one such company , wintershall , had a " big chance " of winning oil exploration rights in iraq .
it is part of chemicals group basf .
" i hope that it and other firms get more involved in extracting crude oil in iraq , " said glos on his way back from baghdad .
he was the first german cabinet minister to visit iraq since the us invasion of the country in 2003 .
asked if the time was ripe to invest in iraq , glos said : " i think so .
i felt in iraq that prime minister maliki has won the trust of the different ethnic groups .
it seems to me that he has managed to largely suppress the terrorists . "
a state-owned coach-assembly factory in the town of iskandariyah , about 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- south of the iraqi capital baghdad , is an example of those plants where the iraqi authorities would like to see german skills and money at work .
using dated machinery , only 450 people work now at a site that used to employ nearly 3,500 in its heyday under the late president saddam hussein .
baghdad has suggested to german carmaker daimler that it could be turning out gleaming mercedes-benz buses and trucks .
security remains a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide bombings are still a reality in iraq but iskandariyah is an edgy place .
in recent years , it was part of a zone of kidnappings and assassinations known as the death triangle , and german executives admit that they worry they could still be seized and held to ransom by criminals .
the german foreign ministry advises nationals to leave iraq immediately and not to trust the security forces whose capabilities are " limited " and loyalties " uncertain . "
those warnings have annoyed iraqi politicians , who insist the outlook is more positive .
al hashimy also said he thought government security warnings would n't keep germany from getting more involved in his country .
" the germans are patient and sceptical ; they think carefully before they make a decision .
but once they 've decided , then they act on their decision , and that 's the situation we 've reached now in 2008 , " he told deutsche welle .
as for the security warnings , glos himself took no chances during his visit .
he wore a bullet-proof vest and stayed in safe zones , though he later told the german daily die welt in an interview , " my impression is that the security situation is improving . "
a meeting with the pope from germany , al-maliki will travel to italy , which sent 3,000 troops to iraq after the us-led invasion in 2003 , but has since withdrawn them .
dabbagh said al-maliki would also meet pope benedict and brief him on the government 's measures to spread tolerance and national reconciliation among iraqis .
the pope has often called for an end to violence in iraq . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" obamania " in germany is now in full swing as the country awaits a political rock star . for monika staffel , wearing an " obama for president " button is nothing unusual , even though she 's a german citizen and wo n't be voting in the us presidential election this november .
this election is too important to stay on the sidelines , she said . " we are waiting urgently for change because bush has caused a lot of damage in the world , “ the 46-year-old from western germany said after visiting a stand two american obama supporters had set up in berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square . " now we want to know more about obama 's positions and we 're very sad that we ca n't be here in berlin on the 24th to listen to his speech , " she added .
" but we 'll be following it very closely in the media . " staffel reflects the views of many germans who are enthusiastic supporters of the presumptive democratic candidate , and are eagerly awaiting his appearance this thursday in berlin , when he will make a speech in front of berlin 's victory column . if the us presidential election were decided by german voters , obama could probably cut back on his breakneck campaign schedule .
a survey released by the pew research center showed that germans prefer the senator from illinois over the republican candidate , john mccain , by a 49 percent margin . building excitement " there is a great passion for a new america in europe and barack obama is the object of that adulation , " said robin hemingway , the founder of americans in berlin-brandenburg for obama , a group whose aim is to register as many americans as possible before the november elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrats abroad has been working to get americans in germany registered to vote while the excitement about obama has been bubbling for months , " obamania " has moved into high gear especially after the presumptive candidate announced his overseas trip with a stop in berlin . hemingway , 67 , said he has been contacted by people who are coming to berlin this week from german cities like frankfurt and rostock and places further afield such as prague and budapest .
they are not just american expats , he said , many germans are making the trip , too . " germans accept him like a rock-star , " he said .
" it 's like he made their favorite album and they want to come and see him .
i 've never seen that here before . " the group democrats abroad reports record high interest levels among americans .
over the last six months , its membership rolls have doubled , the organization said .
the berlin chapter said americans from the netherland and switzerland were coming to the speech , and to volunteer .
the chapter has been calling for members to help out with its voter registration drive at the event . location , location for weeks , germany has been consumed with the question of where obama will speak .
when the campaign requested having him talk in front of berlin 's brandenburg gate , chancellor angela merkel expressed reservations , fearing perhaps such a location would look like an endorsement of the democratic nominee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory column is now more often associated with fun of some sort - like the love parade other locations were floated and members of obama 's team were reported to be in berlin last week scouting out alternatives .
the decision to choose the victory column , a 226-foot pillar topped by a gold angel , has itself opened up a small controversy , with some politicians complaining that the site recalls germany 's nazi past and prussia 's militaristic tradition . the monument was built in 1864 to commemorate prussia 's victory over denmark .
it was later moved by adolf hitler from its site near to reichstag to its current position about one mile west in the middle of the tiergarten park . but many berliners today probably associate it more with having a good time , since for years it was the destination of the love parade techno party .
it is also where berlin 's gay and lesbian pride event , christopher street day , is held . it 's the party link that is more likely going through german minds for the event this thursday .
huge crowds are expected , especially since the speech is being likened by many to john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " performance in 1963 . several hundred city police officers will be on duty for the event , but estimates on the number of people expected to come listen to obama are hard to come by .
the tagesspiegel daily quotes an official as saying the city expects between " 10,000 and one million . " euphoria now , disappointment later ? even though a recent series of interviews with germans in central berlin failed to find one single mccain backer , the support for obama in germany does not come without some reservations .
the current euphoria could be short-lived when germans see that all of obama 's foreign policies are not to their liking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama stopped in afghanistan during this overseas trip , hoping to burnish his foreign policy credentials " he is young , dynamic , and has a lot of good ideas , " said marion violett , 55 , who was visiting berlin from duesseldorf .
" but this decision about afghanistan and putting more troops in there , that i ca n't understand and i do n't like at all . " still , if she could , she would vote for obama over mccain .
besides , she says , she does n't know much about the republican candidate . " in germany , every twist and turn obama makes is followed closely , " she said .
" but mccain is n't present in the media here at all . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

al-maliki will be in berlin on tuesday , july 22 , and is to meet german chancellor angela merkel .
" iraq needs germany on its side , " alaa al ashimy , iraqi ambassador to germany , said in an interview with deutsche welle .
european companies have long been eyeing opportunities in oil-rich iraq .
the european union is negotiating an energy pact with iraq , part of the bloc 's efforts to reduce dependence on russian oil and gas .
iraq has the world 's third largest proven reserves of oil and in june opened key producing fields to foreign investment .
" we 're talking to siemens , daimler and german firms involved in farming , oil and gas , " al-dabbagh said .
lucrative contracts beckon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-maliki , right , shakes with glos in baghdad last week , germany 's economy minister , michael glos , said one such company , wintershall , had a " big chance " of winning oil exploration rights in iraq .
it is part of chemicals group basf .
" i hope that it and other firms get more involved in extracting crude oil in iraq , " said glos on his way back from baghdad .
he was the first german cabinet minister to visit iraq since the us invasion of the country in 2003 .
asked if the time was ripe to invest in iraq , glos said : " i think so .
i felt in iraq that prime minister maliki has won the trust of the different ethnic groups .
it seems to me that he has managed to largely suppress the terrorists . "
a state-owned coach-assembly factory in the town of iskandariyah , about 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- south of the iraqi capital baghdad , is an example of those plants where the iraqi authorities would like to see german skills and money at work .
using dated machinery , only 450 people work now at a site that used to employ nearly 3,500 in its heyday under the late president saddam hussein .
baghdad has suggested to german carmaker daimler that it could be turning out gleaming mercedes-benz buses and trucks .
security remains a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide bombings are still a reality in iraq but iskandariyah is an edgy place .
in recent years , it was part of a zone of kidnappings and assassinations known as the death triangle , and german executives admit that they worry they could still be seized and held to ransom by criminals .
the german foreign ministry advises nationals to leave iraq immediately and not to trust the security forces whose capabilities are " limited " and loyalties " uncertain . "
those warnings have annoyed iraqi politicians , who insist the outlook is more positive .
al hashimy also said he thought government security warnings would n't keep germany from getting more involved in his country .
" the germans are patient and sceptical ; they think carefully before they make a decision .
but once they 've decided , then they act on their decision , and that 's the situation we 've reached now in 2008 , " he told deutsche welle .
as for the security warnings , glos himself took no chances during his visit .
he wore a bullet-proof vest and stayed in safe zones , though he later told the german daily die welt in an interview , " my impression is that the security situation is improving . "
a meeting with the pope from germany , al-maliki will travel to italy , which sent 3,000 troops to iraq after the us-led invasion in 2003 , but has since withdrawn them .
dabbagh said al-maliki would also meet pope benedict and brief him on the government 's measures to spread tolerance and national reconciliation among iraqis .
the pope has often called for an end to violence in iraq . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 21.07.2008 iraqi leader to visit germany to drum up foreign investment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european firms have long been eyeing the opportunities that oil-rich iraq offers iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki is to visit germany and italy this week to encourage european investment in his country , a government spokesman said , adding that iraq is now safe for business . iraqi government spokesman , ali al-dabbagh said al-maliki 's visit aimed to boost baghdad 's ties with european nations and encourage them to start investing in iraq where violence levels have fallen to a four-year low .
al-maliki will be in berlin on tuesday , july 22 , and is to meet german chancellor angela merkel .
" iraq needs germany on its side , " alaa al ashimy , iraqi ambassador to germany , said in an interview with deutsche welle .
european companies have long been eyeing opportunities in oil-rich iraq .
the european union is negotiating an energy pact with iraq , part of the bloc 's efforts to reduce dependence on russian oil and gas .
iraq has the world 's third largest proven reserves of oil and in june opened key producing fields to foreign investment .
" we 're talking to siemens , daimler and german firms involved in farming , oil and gas , " al-dabbagh said .
lucrative contracts beckon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-maliki , right , shakes with glos in baghdad last week , germany 's economy minister , michael glos , said one such company , wintershall , had a " big chance " of winning oil exploration rights in iraq .
it is part of chemicals group basf .
" i hope that it and other firms get more involved in extracting crude oil in iraq , " said glos on his way back from baghdad .
he was the first german cabinet minister to visit iraq since the us invasion of the country in 2003 .
asked if the time was ripe to invest in iraq , glos said : " i think so .
i felt in iraq that prime minister maliki has won the trust of the different ethnic groups .
it seems to me that he has managed to largely suppress the terrorists . "
a state-owned coach-assembly factory in the town of iskandariyah , about 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- south of the iraqi capital baghdad , is an example of those plants where the iraqi authorities would like to see german skills and money at work .
using dated machinery , only 450 people work now at a site that used to employ nearly 3,500 in its heyday under the late president saddam hussein .
baghdad has suggested to german carmaker daimler that it could be turning out gleaming mercedes-benz buses and trucks .
security remains a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide bombings are still a reality in iraq but iskandariyah is an edgy place .
in recent years , it was part of a zone of kidnappings and assassinations known as the death triangle , and german executives admit that they worry they could still be seized and held to ransom by criminals .
the german foreign ministry advises nationals to leave iraq immediately and not to trust the security forces whose capabilities are " limited " and loyalties " uncertain . "
those warnings have annoyed iraqi politicians , who insist the outlook is more positive .
al hashimy also said he thought government security warnings would n't keep germany from getting more involved in his country .
" the germans are patient and sceptical ; they think carefully before they make a decision .
but once they 've decided , then they act on their decision , and that 's the situation we 've reached now in 2008 , " he told deutsche welle .
as for the security warnings , glos himself took no chances during his visit .
he wore a bullet-proof vest and stayed in safe zones , though he later told the german daily die welt in an interview , " my impression is that the security situation is improving . "
a meeting with the pope from germany , al-maliki will travel to italy , which sent 3,000 troops to iraq after the us-led invasion in 2003 , but has since withdrawn them .
dabbagh said al-maliki would also meet pope benedict and brief him on the government 's measures to spread tolerance and national reconciliation among iraqis .
the pope has often called for an end to violence in iraq . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" cowen said that ireland was at the start of a process of analysis and consultation and that a way would be found to " resolve the current difficulties " in a manner satisfactory to all 27 member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen said ireland needed time to move forward " we have to see how the concerns of those who voted no may or may not be addressed , he said , adding that he would stay in close contact with the french leader and that they would hold another meeting in september before cowen reported back to the european council in october . " we are not here to find a solution , but to make a statement of solidarity , " cowen said , stressing that time was needed to find the way forward . the french president said he " respected the outcome of the irish referendum , " but welcomed the fact that the ratification process was continuing in other member states and emphasized his commitment to the treaty . he said that he trusted cowen to find a solution to the problem . treaty opponents give sarkozy clear message after his meeting with sarkozy at government buildings earlier on monday , opposition fine gael leader enda kenny said he had " forcibly put it " to the french leader that " the issue of holding a second referendum was not going down well with the irish people . " leader of the labor party eamon gilmore said he told sarkozy that the lisbon treaty was dead and could not be put back to the irish people . " it did n't happen in france and why should it happen in ireland ? " he asked . gilmore told the french president that the " current impasse over the rejection of the treaty would not be resolved before next summer 's european elections . " protests in central dublin marked the visit from sarkozy , who is acting head of the eu since france took over the presidency on july 1 . over 200 fishermen protested at government buildings after handing out free fish in the center of dublin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen handed out free fish in an appeal for eu aid according to spokesman david kirwan , the fishermen wanted to send " a clear signal to sarkozy that fishermen were instrumental in securing a no vote in the lisbon reform treaty . "
unless fishermen received immediate aid , they would call for a no vote in any re-run of the referendum , he said . the irish farmers ' association president padraig walshe led a demonstration against the policies of european union trade commissioner , peter mandelson . walshe , who was part of a group who met sarkozy at the french embassy , said he would warn the french president that if the world trade organization deal currently on the table in geneva went ahead , it would " profoundly damage support in rural ireland for any future lisbon referendum . " some farmers outside government buildings had painted their tractors in the colors of the french flag to signal their solidarity with sarkozy despite their concerns about the wto talks .
one protestor was led away by irish police after throwing eggs at sarkozy as he arrived for his meeting with cowen . both sides meet at french embassy sarkozy also held round-table talks at the french embassy with groups who oppose and support the lisbon treaty . david begg , general secretary of the irish congress of trade unions , who attended the meeting , said that he " was n't willing to accept the view that because ireland had voted no , that was the end of it . " the visit was dogged by controversy after sarkozy privately told members of his union for a popular movement party -lrb- ump -rrb- this week that " the irish must vote again . " voters in ireland rejected the treaty to streamline the eu in a referendum june 12 . public forum cancelled due to french reservations the arrangements for the meeting at the embassy had also caused a diplomatic incident after labor party leader eamon gilmore declined an invitation to take part in the meeting at the french embassy .
he described the format allowing each participant to make a three-minute presentation to sarkozy as being " pointless " and showing a degree of " arrogance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libertas leader declan ganley on the campaign trail sarkozy 's visit , however , was extended at the last minute to accommodate one-to-one meetings with the two main opposition leaders . plans to hold a meeting in a public forum were scrapped , reportedly owing to the reservations of french officials , leading one irish analyst to describe the holding of the meeting at the french embassy as a " cold war tactic " of meeting " dissidents on home ground . " a representative of sinn fein , the only irish parliamentary party to campaign for a no vote , also took part in the round-table talks .
sinn fein leader gerry adams emphasized that there would be " no re-run of the referendum . " declan ganley , the leader of libertas , which spearheaded the no campaign in ireland , also took part in the meeting at the french embassy , but said that there were too many people apologizing for the no vote in attendance . the treaty requires the approval of all 27 eu member states before it can be ratified . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

interest has been so overwhelming that the show has been extended to the end of august . the dank and musty walls of the former friedrichshoehe brewery in the youthful district of friedrichshain are currently plastered with garish , exotic and edgy art works , attracting visitors from all over europe . " some of the work is exciting , " said gina mellazini , a 19-year-old art student on holiday from bologna , " though not all of it rings a bell with me . " according to curator jochen kuepper , 70 percent of the art on display was created over a 72-hour period . " not until artists had completed their three-day projects were the public allowed in to see the results , " he said . cartoon-like figures hug one of the flaking walls .
on another , a bare-chested man with a resigned facial expression carries a naked , seemingly lifeless , woman in his arms . berlin , street art capital bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vandalism , or enhancing the urban environment ?
nowadays , berlin rates as one of the best locations for street art and graffiti .
take a ride on an overhead commuter train , and graffiti accompanies you on both sides for miles and miles of your journey . " the whole city is a canvas , " kuepper said .
" it has so many walls , so many atmospheric buildings .
berlin 's become a magnet for artists who produce their art on concrete surfaces . " but what is the difference between street art and graffiti ? " many people started with graffiti , " kuepper said .
" the idea that you use the spray can in public spaces stems from graffiti , but now this wild form has grown boring and is n't understandable anymore . " " that 's why graffiti never reaches the galleries .
street art is something else - whether screens , murals , sculptures or installations - it has this fascinating wealth of forms , all rooted in the concept of ' urban art ' and influenced by avant-garde movements such as fluxus , pop art and conceptual art . " joining the establishment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition is pulling in the crowds unlike other cities which have demonized its urban artists , kuepper insists street art today is an integral staple of the berlin cultural scene and long regarded as hip . hollywood idols angelina jolie and brad pitt are great fans of street art .
a few months ago at they splashed out some 290,000 euros -lrb- $ 458,000 -rrb- for a stencil work by england artist banksy , considered one of the big names of the street art scene . kuepper says " street art " is gaining increasing global attention from the established art market , with work by its top exponents starting to break auction house records . el tono from spain is one of the participants in berlin .
the fact that he and his compatriot nano 4818 have been exhibiting at the tate modern 's street art show in london is proof for kuepper of the " staggering development and widespread notoriety of the anarchic art movement . " criminalized bildunterschrift : many artists work under pseudonyms most street artists hide their real identities behind pseudonyms - partly due to continuing criminalization of the art form in some regions .
in free-wheeling berlin , however , officials take a much more relaxed view . german artist el bocho takes to the berlin streets at night , carrying his hand-painted posters which he pastes on walls and abandoned properties .
sometimes he 's also seen attaching his cleverly designed tiles to buildings in the central mitte , prenzlauer berg and friedrichshain districts . el bocho says he 's never encountered problems with the law although he sometimes gets stopped by policemen asking what he 's doing wandering the streets at night . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she did express support for an association agreement , however . during her short stay in kyiv , the german chancellor said that ukraine would likely sign a so-called stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- before the french eu presidency expires at the end of this year . the deal is expected to top the agenda of an eu-ukraine summit taking place in september . while an saa is an important step toward membership in the 27-member european union , merkel urged ukrainians " not to confuse this with conditions for joining the eu , " pointing out that the bloc 's capacity for expansion was limited . during her day of talks with president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko , merkel said that ukraine was an important partner for germany and that germany would offer kyiv support in pursuing its reform plans . merkel keeps quiet on nato ukraine 's sehodnia newspaper had reported ahead of monday 's talks that the german leader was likely to leave the issue of nato-membership on the back burner , which indeed she did , calling it " a matter between ukraine and the nato member states . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been hesitant about preparing ukrainian membership in nato however , at a nato summit in april , merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy had opposed efforts by poland and the baltic states to set a specific timetable for eventual ukrainian membership in the alliance . ukrainian media attacked merkel and sarkozy , saying paris and berlin feared a russian shut-off of natural gas supplies more than they supported bringing democratic ukraine into nato . russia has been outspoken in its opposition to the nato aspirations of ukraine 's government , and threatened military and economic retaliation were ukraine ever to join the alliance . merkel on monday made an indirect reference to the kremlin , saying that " other countries that are not nato members , and who do not have any relationship to this question -lrb- of ukrainian membership -rrb- should not discuss or consider it . " in december , nato is slated to discuss possible first steps toward ukraine 's membership in the alliance . securing a stable energy supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is an important transit country for westward-bound russian gas the need for kyiv to sign a long-term agreement with moscow guaranteeing stable natural gas deliveries to europe via ukrainian pipelines was another top discussion point . ukraine is critical to the security of europe 's energy import network , as most of russia 's westward-running oil and gas pipelines pass through the country . president yushchenko promised to fulfill ukraine 's commitment to reliably deliver gas from russia , but also warned of " political blackmail " from russia and others in light of upcoming price negotiations . in past years , kyiv and moscow have disagreed repeatedly on gas and oil shipment terms , leading to a two-day cut-off of russian gas to europe in january 2006 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" cowen said that ireland was at the start of a process of analysis and consultation and that a way would be found to " resolve the current difficulties " in a manner satisfactory to all 27 member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen said ireland needed time to move forward " we have to see how the concerns of those who voted no may or may not be addressed , he said , adding that he would stay in close contact with the french leader and that they would hold another meeting in september before cowen reported back to the european council in october . " we are not here to find a solution , but to make a statement of solidarity , " cowen said , stressing that time was needed to find the way forward . the french president said he " respected the outcome of the irish referendum , " but welcomed the fact that the ratification process was continuing in other member states and emphasized his commitment to the treaty . he said that he trusted cowen to find a solution to the problem . treaty opponents give sarkozy clear message after his meeting with sarkozy at government buildings earlier on monday , opposition fine gael leader enda kenny said he had " forcibly put it " to the french leader that " the issue of holding a second referendum was not going down well with the irish people . " leader of the labor party eamon gilmore said he told sarkozy that the lisbon treaty was dead and could not be put back to the irish people . " it did n't happen in france and why should it happen in ireland ? " he asked . gilmore told the french president that the " current impasse over the rejection of the treaty would not be resolved before next summer 's european elections . " protests in central dublin marked the visit from sarkozy , who is acting head of the eu since france took over the presidency on july 1 . over 200 fishermen protested at government buildings after handing out free fish in the center of dublin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen handed out free fish in an appeal for eu aid according to spokesman david kirwan , the fishermen wanted to send " a clear signal to sarkozy that fishermen were instrumental in securing a no vote in the lisbon reform treaty . "
unless fishermen received immediate aid , they would call for a no vote in any re-run of the referendum , he said . the irish farmers ' association president padraig walshe led a demonstration against the policies of european union trade commissioner , peter mandelson . walshe , who was part of a group who met sarkozy at the french embassy , said he would warn the french president that if the world trade organization deal currently on the table in geneva went ahead , it would " profoundly damage support in rural ireland for any future lisbon referendum . " some farmers outside government buildings had painted their tractors in the colors of the french flag to signal their solidarity with sarkozy despite their concerns about the wto talks .
one protestor was led away by irish police after throwing eggs at sarkozy as he arrived for his meeting with cowen . both sides meet at french embassy sarkozy also held round-table talks at the french embassy with groups who oppose and support the lisbon treaty . david begg , general secretary of the irish congress of trade unions , who attended the meeting , said that he " was n't willing to accept the view that because ireland had voted no , that was the end of it . " the visit was dogged by controversy after sarkozy privately told members of his union for a popular movement party -lrb- ump -rrb- this week that " the irish must vote again . " voters in ireland rejected the treaty to streamline the eu in a referendum june 12 . public forum cancelled due to french reservations the arrangements for the meeting at the embassy had also caused a diplomatic incident after labor party leader eamon gilmore declined an invitation to take part in the meeting at the french embassy .
he described the format allowing each participant to make a three-minute presentation to sarkozy as being " pointless " and showing a degree of " arrogance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libertas leader declan ganley on the campaign trail sarkozy 's visit , however , was extended at the last minute to accommodate one-to-one meetings with the two main opposition leaders . plans to hold a meeting in a public forum were scrapped , reportedly owing to the reservations of french officials , leading one irish analyst to describe the holding of the meeting at the french embassy as a " cold war tactic " of meeting " dissidents on home ground . " a representative of sinn fein , the only irish parliamentary party to campaign for a no vote , also took part in the round-table talks .
sinn fein leader gerry adams emphasized that there would be " no re-run of the referendum . " declan ganley , the leader of libertas , which spearheaded the no campaign in ireland , also took part in the meeting at the french embassy , but said that there were too many people apologizing for the no vote in attendance . the treaty requires the approval of all 27 eu member states before it can be ratified . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" cowen said that ireland was at the start of a process of analysis and consultation and that a way would be found to " resolve the current difficulties " in a manner satisfactory to all 27 member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen said ireland needed time to move forward " we have to see how the concerns of those who voted no may or may not be addressed , he said , adding that he would stay in close contact with the french leader and that they would hold another meeting in september before cowen reported back to the european council in october . " we are not here to find a solution , but to make a statement of solidarity , " cowen said , stressing that time was needed to find the way forward . the french president said he " respected the outcome of the irish referendum , " but welcomed the fact that the ratification process was continuing in other member states and emphasized his commitment to the treaty . he said that he trusted cowen to find a solution to the problem . treaty opponents give sarkozy clear message after his meeting with sarkozy at government buildings earlier on monday , opposition fine gael leader enda kenny said he had " forcibly put it " to the french leader that " the issue of holding a second referendum was not going down well with the irish people . " leader of the labor party eamon gilmore said he told sarkozy that the lisbon treaty was dead and could not be put back to the irish people . " it did n't happen in france and why should it happen in ireland ? " he asked . gilmore told the french president that the " current impasse over the rejection of the treaty would not be resolved before next summer 's european elections . " protests in central dublin marked the visit from sarkozy , who is acting head of the eu since france took over the presidency on july 1 . over 200 fishermen protested at government buildings after handing out free fish in the center of dublin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen handed out free fish in an appeal for eu aid according to spokesman david kirwan , the fishermen wanted to send " a clear signal to sarkozy that fishermen were instrumental in securing a no vote in the lisbon reform treaty . "
unless fishermen received immediate aid , they would call for a no vote in any re-run of the referendum , he said . the irish farmers ' association president padraig walshe led a demonstration against the policies of european union trade commissioner , peter mandelson . walshe , who was part of a group who met sarkozy at the french embassy , said he would warn the french president that if the world trade organization deal currently on the table in geneva went ahead , it would " profoundly damage support in rural ireland for any future lisbon referendum . " some farmers outside government buildings had painted their tractors in the colors of the french flag to signal their solidarity with sarkozy despite their concerns about the wto talks .
one protestor was led away by irish police after throwing eggs at sarkozy as he arrived for his meeting with cowen . both sides meet at french embassy sarkozy also held round-table talks at the french embassy with groups who oppose and support the lisbon treaty . david begg , general secretary of the irish congress of trade unions , who attended the meeting , said that he " was n't willing to accept the view that because ireland had voted no , that was the end of it . " the visit was dogged by controversy after sarkozy privately told members of his union for a popular movement party -lrb- ump -rrb- this week that " the irish must vote again . " voters in ireland rejected the treaty to streamline the eu in a referendum june 12 . public forum cancelled due to french reservations the arrangements for the meeting at the embassy had also caused a diplomatic incident after labor party leader eamon gilmore declined an invitation to take part in the meeting at the french embassy .
he described the format allowing each participant to make a three-minute presentation to sarkozy as being " pointless " and showing a degree of " arrogance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libertas leader declan ganley on the campaign trail sarkozy 's visit , however , was extended at the last minute to accommodate one-to-one meetings with the two main opposition leaders . plans to hold a meeting in a public forum were scrapped , reportedly owing to the reservations of french officials , leading one irish analyst to describe the holding of the meeting at the french embassy as a " cold war tactic " of meeting " dissidents on home ground .

" cowen said that ireland was at the start of a process of analysis and consultation and that a way would be found to " resolve the current difficulties " in a manner satisfactory to all 27 member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen said ireland needed time to move forward " we have to see how the concerns of those who voted no may or may not be addressed , he said , adding that he would stay in close contact with the french leader and that they would hold another meeting in september before cowen reported back to the european council in october . " we are not here to find a solution , but to make a statement of solidarity , " cowen said , stressing that time was needed to find the way forward . the french president said he " respected the outcome of the irish referendum , " but welcomed the fact that the ratification process was continuing in other member states and emphasized his commitment to the treaty . he said that he trusted cowen to find a solution to the problem . treaty opponents give sarkozy clear message after his meeting with sarkozy at government buildings earlier on monday , opposition fine gael leader enda kenny said he had " forcibly put it " to the french leader that " the issue of holding a second referendum was not going down well with the irish people . " leader of the labor party eamon gilmore said he told sarkozy that the lisbon treaty was dead and could not be put back to the irish people . " it did n't happen in france and why should it happen in ireland ? " he asked . gilmore told the french president that the " current impasse over the rejection of the treaty would not be resolved before next summer 's european elections . " protests in central dublin marked the visit from sarkozy , who is acting head of the eu since france took over the presidency on july 1 . over 200 fishermen protested at government buildings after handing out free fish in the center of dublin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen handed out free fish in an appeal for eu aid according to spokesman david kirwan , the fishermen wanted to send " a clear signal to sarkozy that fishermen were instrumental in securing a no vote in the lisbon reform treaty . "
unless fishermen received immediate aid , they would call for a no vote in any re-run of the referendum , he said . the irish farmers ' association president padraig walshe led a demonstration against the policies of european union trade commissioner , peter mandelson . walshe , who was part of a group who met sarkozy at the french embassy , said he would warn the french president that if the world trade organization deal currently on the table in geneva went ahead , it would " profoundly damage support in rural ireland for any future lisbon referendum . " some farmers outside government buildings had painted their tractors in the colors of the french flag to signal their solidarity with sarkozy despite their concerns about the wto talks .
one protestor was led away by irish police after throwing eggs at sarkozy as he arrived for his meeting with cowen . both sides meet at french embassy sarkozy also held round-table talks at the french embassy with groups who oppose and support the lisbon treaty . david begg , general secretary of the irish congress of trade unions , who attended the meeting , said that he " was n't willing to accept the view that because ireland had voted no , that was the end of it . " the visit was dogged by controversy after sarkozy privately told members of his union for a popular movement party -lrb- ump -rrb- this week that " the irish must vote again . " voters in ireland rejected the treaty to streamline the eu in a referendum june 12 . public forum cancelled due to french reservations the arrangements for the meeting at the embassy had also caused a diplomatic incident after labor party leader eamon gilmore declined an invitation to take part in the meeting at the french embassy .

"
interest has been so overwhelming that the show has been extended to the end of august . the dank and musty walls of the former friedrichshoehe brewery in the youthful district of friedrichshain are currently plastered with garish , exotic and edgy art works , attracting visitors from all over europe . " some of the work is exciting , " said gina mellazini , a 19-year-old art student on holiday from bologna , " though not all of it rings a bell with me . " according to curator jochen kuepper , 70 percent of the art on display was created over a 72-hour period . " not until artists had completed their three-day projects were the public allowed in to see the results , " he said . cartoon-like figures hug one of the flaking walls .
on another , a bare-chested man with a resigned facial expression carries a naked , seemingly lifeless , woman in his arms . berlin , street art capital bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vandalism , or enhancing the urban environment ?
nowadays , berlin rates as one of the best locations for street art and graffiti .
take a ride on an overhead commuter train , and graffiti accompanies you on both sides for miles and miles of your journey . " the whole city is a canvas , " kuepper said .
" it has so many walls , so many atmospheric buildings .
berlin 's become a magnet for artists who produce their art on concrete surfaces . " but what is the difference between street art and graffiti ? " many people started with graffiti , " kuepper said .
" the idea that you use the spray can in public spaces stems from graffiti , but now this wild form has grown boring and is n't understandable anymore . " " that 's why graffiti never reaches the galleries .

al-maliki will be in berlin on tuesday , july 22 , and is to meet german chancellor angela merkel .
" iraq needs germany on its side , " alaa al ashimy , iraqi ambassador to germany , said in an interview with deutsche welle .
european companies have long been eyeing opportunities in oil-rich iraq .
the european union is negotiating an energy pact with iraq , part of the bloc 's efforts to reduce dependence on russian oil and gas .
iraq has the world 's third largest proven reserves of oil and in june opened key producing fields to foreign investment .
" we 're talking to siemens , daimler and german firms involved in farming , oil and gas , " al-dabbagh said .
lucrative contracts beckon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-maliki , right , shakes with glos in baghdad last week , germany 's economy minister , michael glos , said one such company , wintershall , had a " big chance " of winning oil exploration rights in iraq .
it is part of chemicals group basf .
" i hope that it and other firms get more involved in extracting crude oil in iraq , " said glos on his way back from baghdad .
he was the first german cabinet minister to visit iraq since the us invasion of the country in 2003 .
asked if the time was ripe to invest in iraq , glos said : " i think so .
i felt in iraq that prime minister maliki has won the trust of the different ethnic groups .
it seems to me that he has managed to largely suppress the terrorists . "
a state-owned coach-assembly factory in the town of iskandariyah , about 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- south of the iraqi capital baghdad , is an example of those plants where the iraqi authorities would like to see german skills and money at work .
using dated machinery , only 450 people work now at a site that used to employ nearly 3,500 in its heyday under the late president saddam hussein .
baghdad has suggested to german carmaker daimler that it could be turning out gleaming mercedes-benz buses and trucks .
security remains a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide bombings are still a reality in iraq but iskandariyah is an edgy place .
in recent years , it was part of a zone of kidnappings and assassinations known as the death triangle , and german executives admit that they worry they could still be seized and held to ransom by criminals .
the german foreign ministry advises nationals to leave iraq immediately and not to trust the security forces whose capabilities are " limited " and loyalties " uncertain . "
those warnings have annoyed iraqi politicians , who insist the outlook is more positive .
al hashimy also said he thought government security warnings would n't keep germany from getting more involved in his country .
" the germans are patient and sceptical ; they think carefully before they make a decision .
but once they 've decided , then they act on their decision , and that 's the situation we 've reached now in 2008 , " he told deutsche welle .
as for the security warnings , glos himself took no chances during his visit .
he wore a bullet-proof vest and stayed in safe zones , though he later told the german daily die welt in an interview , " my impression is that the security situation is improving . "
a meeting with the pope from germany , al-maliki will travel to italy , which sent 3,000 troops to iraq after the us-led invasion in 2003 , but has since withdrawn them .
dabbagh said al-maliki would also meet pope benedict and brief him on the government 's measures to spread tolerance and national reconciliation among iraqis .

she did express support for an association agreement , however . during her short stay in kyiv , the german chancellor said that ukraine would likely sign a so-called stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- before the french eu presidency expires at the end of this year . the deal is expected to top the agenda of an eu-ukraine summit taking place in september . while an saa is an important step toward membership in the 27-member european union , merkel urged ukrainians " not to confuse this with conditions for joining the eu , " pointing out that the bloc 's capacity for expansion was limited . during her day of talks with president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko , merkel said that ukraine was an important partner for germany and that germany would offer kyiv support in pursuing its reform plans . merkel keeps quiet on nato ukraine 's sehodnia newspaper had reported ahead of monday 's talks that the german leader was likely to leave the issue of nato-membership on the back burner , which indeed she did , calling it " a matter between ukraine and the nato member states . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been hesitant about preparing ukrainian membership in nato however , at a nato summit in april , merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy had opposed efforts by poland and the baltic states to set a specific timetable for eventual ukrainian membership in the alliance . ukrainian media attacked merkel and sarkozy , saying paris and berlin feared a russian shut-off of natural gas supplies more than they supported bringing democratic ukraine into nato . russia has been outspoken in its opposition to the nato aspirations of ukraine 's government , and threatened military and economic retaliation were ukraine ever to join the alliance . merkel on monday made an indirect reference to the kremlin , saying that " other countries that are not nato members , and who do not have any relationship to this question -lrb- of ukrainian membership -rrb- should not discuss or consider it . " in december , nato is slated to discuss possible first steps toward ukraine 's membership in the alliance . securing a stable energy supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is an important transit country for westward-bound russian gas the need for kyiv to sign a long-term agreement with moscow guaranteeing stable natural gas deliveries to europe via ukrainian pipelines was another top discussion point . ukraine is critical to the security of europe 's energy import network , as most of russia 's westward-running oil and gas pipelines pass through the country . president yushchenko promised to fulfill ukraine 's commitment to reliably deliver gas from russia , but also warned of " political blackmail " from russia and others in light of upcoming price negotiations . in past years , kyiv and moscow have disagreed repeatedly on gas and oil shipment terms , leading to a two-day cut-off of russian gas to europe in january 2006 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

al-maliki will be in berlin on tuesday , july 22 , and is to meet german chancellor angela merkel .
" iraq needs germany on its side , " alaa al ashimy , iraqi ambassador to germany , said in an interview with deutsche welle .
european companies have long been eyeing opportunities in oil-rich iraq .
the european union is negotiating an energy pact with iraq , part of the bloc 's efforts to reduce dependence on russian oil and gas .
iraq has the world 's third largest proven reserves of oil and in june opened key producing fields to foreign investment .
" we 're talking to siemens , daimler and german firms involved in farming , oil and gas , " al-dabbagh said .
lucrative contracts beckon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-maliki , right , shakes with glos in baghdad last week , germany 's economy minister , michael glos , said one such company , wintershall , had a " big chance " of winning oil exploration rights in iraq .
it is part of chemicals group basf .
" i hope that it and other firms get more involved in extracting crude oil in iraq , " said glos on his way back from baghdad .
he was the first german cabinet minister to visit iraq since the us invasion of the country in 2003 .
asked if the time was ripe to invest in iraq , glos said : " i think so .
i felt in iraq that prime minister maliki has won the trust of the different ethnic groups .
it seems to me that he has managed to largely suppress the terrorists . "
a state-owned coach-assembly factory in the town of iskandariyah , about 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- south of the iraqi capital baghdad , is an example of those plants where the iraqi authorities would like to see german skills and money at work .
using dated machinery , only 450 people work now at a site that used to employ nearly 3,500 in its heyday under the late president saddam hussein .
baghdad has suggested to german carmaker daimler that it could be turning out gleaming mercedes-benz buses and trucks .
security remains a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide bombings are still a reality in iraq but iskandariyah is an edgy place .
in recent years , it was part of a zone of kidnappings and assassinations known as the death triangle , and german executives admit that they worry they could still be seized and held to ransom by criminals .
the german foreign ministry advises nationals to leave iraq immediately and not to trust the security forces whose capabilities are " limited " and loyalties " uncertain . "
those warnings have annoyed iraqi politicians , who insist the outlook is more positive .
al hashimy also said he thought government security warnings would n't keep germany from getting more involved in his country .
" the germans are patient and sceptical ; they think carefully before they make a decision .
but once they 've decided , then they act on their decision , and that 's the situation we 've reached now in 2008 , " he told deutsche welle .
as for the security warnings , glos himself took no chances during his visit .
he wore a bullet-proof vest and stayed in safe zones , though he later told the german daily die welt in an interview , " my impression is that the security situation is improving . "
a meeting with the pope from germany , al-maliki will travel to italy , which sent 3,000 troops to iraq after the us-led invasion in 2003 , but has since withdrawn them .
dabbagh said al-maliki would also meet pope benedict and brief him on the government 's measures to spread tolerance and national reconciliation among iraqis .

" the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta will intervene towards the release of the two german construction staff of the firm julius berger , who were ambushed and kidnapped for ransom in rivers state , " the group said in an e-mail to afp , the news agency reported on monday , july 21 .
mend said it was making contacts with the abductors who seized the germans in the volatile oil-rich region on july 11 .
the incident led the company to suspend its operations in the niger delta , the heart of oil production in the world 's eighth largest exporter .
julius berger is currently rebuilding the main east-west road across the niger delta and is one of nigeria 's biggest private sector employers , with more than 16,000 employees .
located and identified some 15 unidentified gunmen kidnapped the two employees of nigeria 's biggest construction firm julius berger , a unit of germany 's bilfinger berger , near the city of port harcourt .
they had been travelling in a convoy of armored jeeps .
" mend has located and identified the culprits and will begin negotiating with the kidnappers in the hope for a safe and unconditional release of the captives , " said the group .
apparently , it took the decision because the men were not part of the energy sector but were helping to build infrastructure in the niger delta region .
unrest mend claims to be fighting for greater control of the region 's oil wealth by local people and first emerged in january 2006 .
since then it has led a campaign of violence against oil facilities , perpetrating a series of violent attacks on the oil industry and kidnapping hundreds of local and expatriate workers in the restive region .
almost all have been released unharmed .
several foreign firms , including french tire company michelin and oil servicing firm wilbros , have left the region because of security problems .
the unrest has reduced nigeria 's oil output by a quarter , causing it to lose its position as africa 's biggest oil producer to angola , according to april figures from the organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta will intervene towards the release of the two german construction staff of the firm julius berger , who were ambushed and kidnapped for ransom in rivers state , " the group said in an e-mail to afp , the news agency reported on monday , july 21 .
mend said it was making contacts with the abductors who seized the germans in the volatile oil-rich region on july 11 .
the incident led the company to suspend its operations in the niger delta , the heart of oil production in the world 's eighth largest exporter .
julius berger is currently rebuilding the main east-west road across the niger delta and is one of nigeria 's biggest private sector employers , with more than 16,000 employees .
located and identified some 15 unidentified gunmen kidnapped the two employees of nigeria 's biggest construction firm julius berger , a unit of germany 's bilfinger berger , near the city of port harcourt .
they had been travelling in a convoy of armored jeeps .
" mend has located and identified the culprits and will begin negotiating with the kidnappers in the hope for a safe and unconditional release of the captives , " said the group .
apparently , it took the decision because the men were not part of the energy sector but were helping to build infrastructure in the niger delta region .
unrest mend claims to be fighting for greater control of the region 's oil wealth by local people and first emerged in january 2006 .
since then it has led a campaign of violence against oil facilities , perpetrating a series of violent attacks on the oil industry and kidnapping hundreds of local and expatriate workers in the restive region .
almost all have been released unharmed .
several foreign firms , including french tire company michelin and oil servicing firm wilbros , have left the region because of security problems .
the unrest has reduced nigeria 's oil output by a quarter , causing it to lose its position as africa 's biggest oil producer to angola , according to april figures from the organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she did express support for an association agreement , however . during her short stay in kyiv , the german chancellor said that ukraine would likely sign a so-called stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- before the french eu presidency expires at the end of this year . the deal is expected to top the agenda of an eu-ukraine summit taking place in september . while an saa is an important step toward membership in the 27-member european union , merkel urged ukrainians " not to confuse this with conditions for joining the eu , " pointing out that the bloc 's capacity for expansion was limited . during her day of talks with president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko , merkel said that ukraine was an important partner for germany and that germany would offer kyiv support in pursuing its reform plans . merkel keeps quiet on nato ukraine 's sehodnia newspaper had reported ahead of monday 's talks that the german leader was likely to leave the issue of nato-membership on the back burner , which indeed she did , calling it " a matter between ukraine and the nato member states . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been hesitant about preparing ukrainian membership in nato however , at a nato summit in april , merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy had opposed efforts by poland and the baltic states to set a specific timetable for eventual ukrainian membership in the alliance . ukrainian media attacked merkel and sarkozy , saying paris and berlin feared a russian shut-off of natural gas supplies more than they supported bringing democratic ukraine into nato . russia has been outspoken in its opposition to the nato aspirations of ukraine 's government , and threatened military and economic retaliation were ukraine ever to join the alliance . merkel on monday made an indirect reference to the kremlin , saying that " other countries that are not nato members , and who do not have any relationship to this question -lrb- of ukrainian membership -rrb- should not discuss or consider it . " in december , nato is slated to discuss possible first steps toward ukraine 's membership in the alliance . securing a stable energy supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is an important transit country for westward-bound russian gas the need for kyiv to sign a long-term agreement with moscow guaranteeing stable natural gas deliveries to europe via ukrainian pipelines was another top discussion point . ukraine is critical to the security of europe 's energy import network , as most of russia 's westward-running oil and gas pipelines pass through the country . president yushchenko promised to fulfill ukraine 's commitment to reliably deliver gas from russia , but also warned of " political blackmail " from russia and others in light of upcoming price negotiations . in past years , kyiv and moscow have disagreed repeatedly on gas and oil shipment terms , leading to a two-day cut-off of russian gas to europe in january 2006 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

al-maliki will be in berlin on tuesday , july 22 , and is to meet german chancellor angela merkel .
" iraq needs germany on its side , " alaa al ashimy , iraqi ambassador to germany , said in an interview with deutsche welle .
european companies have long been eyeing opportunities in oil-rich iraq .
the european union is negotiating an energy pact with iraq , part of the bloc 's efforts to reduce dependence on russian oil and gas .
iraq has the world 's third largest proven reserves of oil and in june opened key producing fields to foreign investment .
" we 're talking to siemens , daimler and german firms involved in farming , oil and gas , " al-dabbagh said .
lucrative contracts beckon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-maliki , right , shakes with glos in baghdad last week , germany 's economy minister , michael glos , said one such company , wintershall , had a " big chance " of winning oil exploration rights in iraq .
it is part of chemicals group basf .
" i hope that it and other firms get more involved in extracting crude oil in iraq , " said glos on his way back from baghdad .
he was the first german cabinet minister to visit iraq since the us invasion of the country in 2003 .
asked if the time was ripe to invest in iraq , glos said : " i think so .
i felt in iraq that prime minister maliki has won the trust of the different ethnic groups .
it seems to me that he has managed to largely suppress the terrorists . "
a state-owned coach-assembly factory in the town of iskandariyah , about 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- south of the iraqi capital baghdad , is an example of those plants where the iraqi authorities would like to see german skills and money at work .
using dated machinery , only 450 people work now at a site that used to employ nearly 3,500 in its heyday under the late president saddam hussein .
baghdad has suggested to german carmaker daimler that it could be turning out gleaming mercedes-benz buses and trucks .
security remains a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide bombings are still a reality in iraq but iskandariyah is an edgy place .
in recent years , it was part of a zone of kidnappings and assassinations known as the death triangle , and german executives admit that they worry they could still be seized and held to ransom by criminals .
the german foreign ministry advises nationals to leave iraq immediately and not to trust the security forces whose capabilities are " limited " and loyalties " uncertain . "
those warnings have annoyed iraqi politicians , who insist the outlook is more positive .
al hashimy also said he thought government security warnings would n't keep germany from getting more involved in his country .
" the germans are patient and sceptical ; they think carefully before they make a decision .
but once they 've decided , then they act on their decision , and that 's the situation we 've reached now in 2008 , " he told deutsche welle .
as for the security warnings , glos himself took no chances during his visit .
he wore a bullet-proof vest and stayed in safe zones , though he later told the german daily die welt in an interview , " my impression is that the security situation is improving . "
a meeting with the pope from germany , al-maliki will travel to italy , which sent 3,000 troops to iraq after the us-led invasion in 2003 , but has since withdrawn them .
dabbagh said al-maliki would also meet pope benedict and brief him on the government 's measures to spread tolerance and national reconciliation among iraqis .

" obamania " in germany is now in full swing as the country awaits a political rock star . for monika staffel , wearing an " obama for president " button is nothing unusual , even though she 's a german citizen and wo n't be voting in the us presidential election this november .
this election is too important to stay on the sidelines , she said . " we are waiting urgently for change because bush has caused a lot of damage in the world , “ the 46-year-old from western germany said after visiting a stand two american obama supporters had set up in berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square . " now we want to know more about obama 's positions and we 're very sad that we ca n't be here in berlin on the 24th to listen to his speech , " she added .
" but we 'll be following it very closely in the media . " staffel reflects the views of many germans who are enthusiastic supporters of the presumptive democratic candidate , and are eagerly awaiting his appearance this thursday in berlin , when he will make a speech in front of berlin 's victory column . if the us presidential election were decided by german voters , obama could probably cut back on his breakneck campaign schedule .
a survey released by the pew research center showed that germans prefer the senator from illinois over the republican candidate , john mccain , by a 49 percent margin . building excitement " there is a great passion for a new america in europe and barack obama is the object of that adulation , " said robin hemingway , the founder of americans in berlin-brandenburg for obama , a group whose aim is to register as many americans as possible before the november elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrats abroad has been working to get americans in germany registered to vote while the excitement about obama has been bubbling for months , " obamania " has moved into high gear especially after the presumptive candidate announced his overseas trip with a stop in berlin . hemingway , 67 , said he has been contacted by people who are coming to berlin this week from german cities like frankfurt and rostock and places further afield such as prague and budapest .
they are not just american expats , he said , many germans are making the trip , too . " germans accept him like a rock-star , " he said .
" it 's like he made their favorite album and they want to come and see him .
i 've never seen that here before . " the group democrats abroad reports record high interest levels among americans .
over the last six months , its membership rolls have doubled , the organization said .
the berlin chapter said americans from the netherland and switzerland were coming to the speech , and to volunteer .
the chapter has been calling for members to help out with its voter registration drive at the event . location , location for weeks , germany has been consumed with the question of where obama will speak .
when the campaign requested having him talk in front of berlin 's brandenburg gate , chancellor angela merkel expressed reservations , fearing perhaps such a location would look like an endorsement of the democratic nominee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory column is now more often associated with fun of some sort - like the love parade other locations were floated and members of obama 's team were reported to be in berlin last week scouting out alternatives .
the decision to choose the victory column , a 226-foot pillar topped by a gold angel , has itself opened up a small controversy , with some politicians complaining that the site recalls germany 's nazi past and prussia 's militaristic tradition . the monument was built in 1864 to commemorate prussia 's victory over denmark .
it was later moved by adolf hitler from its site near to reichstag to its current position about one mile west in the middle of the tiergarten park . but many berliners today probably associate it more with having a good time , since for years it was the destination of the love parade techno party .
it is also where berlin 's gay and lesbian pride event , christopher street day , is held . it 's the party link that is more likely going through german minds for the event this thursday .
huge crowds are expected , especially since the speech is being likened by many to john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " performance in 1963 . several hundred city police officers will be on duty for the event , but estimates on the number of people expected to come listen to obama are hard to come by .
the tagesspiegel daily quotes an official as saying the city expects between " 10,000 and one million . " euphoria now , disappointment later ? even though a recent series of interviews with germans in central berlin failed to find one single mccain backer , the support for obama in germany does not come without some reservations .
the current euphoria could be short-lived when germans see that all of obama 's foreign policies are not to their liking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama stopped in afghanistan during this overseas trip , hoping to burnish his foreign policy credentials " he is young , dynamic , and has a lot of good ideas , " said marion violett , 55 , who was visiting berlin from duesseldorf .
" but this decision about afghanistan and putting more troops in there , that i ca n't understand and i do n't like at all . " still , if she could , she would vote for obama over mccain .
besides , she says , she does n't know much about the republican candidate . " in germany , every twist and turn obama makes is followed closely , " she said .
" but mccain is n't present in the media here at all . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta will intervene towards the release of the two german construction staff of the firm julius berger , who were ambushed and kidnapped for ransom in rivers state , " the group said in an e-mail to afp , the news agency reported on monday , july 21 .
mend said it was making contacts with the abductors who seized the germans in the volatile oil-rich region on july 11 .
the incident led the company to suspend its operations in the niger delta , the heart of oil production in the world 's eighth largest exporter .
julius berger is currently rebuilding the main east-west road across the niger delta and is one of nigeria 's biggest private sector employers , with more than 16,000 employees .
located and identified some 15 unidentified gunmen kidnapped the two employees of nigeria 's biggest construction firm julius berger , a unit of germany 's bilfinger berger , near the city of port harcourt .
they had been travelling in a convoy of armored jeeps .
" mend has located and identified the culprits and will begin negotiating with the kidnappers in the hope for a safe and unconditional release of the captives , " said the group .
apparently , it took the decision because the men were not part of the energy sector but were helping to build infrastructure in the niger delta region .
unrest mend claims to be fighting for greater control of the region 's oil wealth by local people and first emerged in january 2006 .
since then it has led a campaign of violence against oil facilities , perpetrating a series of violent attacks on the oil industry and kidnapping hundreds of local and expatriate workers in the restive region .
almost all have been released unharmed .
several foreign firms , including french tire company michelin and oil servicing firm wilbros , have left the region because of security problems .
the unrest has reduced nigeria 's oil output by a quarter , causing it to lose its position as africa 's biggest oil producer to angola , according to april figures from the organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" obamania " in germany is now in full swing as the country awaits a political rock star . for monika staffel , wearing an " obama for president " button is nothing unusual , even though she 's a german citizen and wo n't be voting in the us presidential election this november .
this election is too important to stay on the sidelines , she said . " we are waiting urgently for change because bush has caused a lot of damage in the world , “ the 46-year-old from western germany said after visiting a stand two american obama supporters had set up in berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square . " now we want to know more about obama 's positions and we 're very sad that we ca n't be here in berlin on the 24th to listen to his speech , " she added .
" but we 'll be following it very closely in the media . " staffel reflects the views of many germans who are enthusiastic supporters of the presumptive democratic candidate , and are eagerly awaiting his appearance this thursday in berlin , when he will make a speech in front of berlin 's victory column . if the us presidential election were decided by german voters , obama could probably cut back on his breakneck campaign schedule .
a survey released by the pew research center showed that germans prefer the senator from illinois over the republican candidate , john mccain , by a 49 percent margin . building excitement " there is a great passion for a new america in europe and barack obama is the object of that adulation , " said robin hemingway , the founder of americans in berlin-brandenburg for obama , a group whose aim is to register as many americans as possible before the november elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrats abroad has been working to get americans in germany registered to vote while the excitement about obama has been bubbling for months , " obamania " has moved into high gear especially after the presumptive candidate announced his overseas trip with a stop in berlin . hemingway , 67 , said he has been contacted by people who are coming to berlin this week from german cities like frankfurt and rostock and places further afield such as prague and budapest .

it was later moved by adolf hitler from its site near to reichstag to its current position about one mile west in the middle of the tiergarten park . but many berliners today probably associate it more with having a good time , since for years it was the destination of the love parade techno party .
it is also where berlin 's gay and lesbian pride event , christopher street day , is held . it 's the party link that is more likely going through german minds for the event this thursday .
huge crowds are expected , especially since the speech is being likened by many to john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " performance in 1963 . several hundred city police officers will be on duty for the event , but estimates on the number of people expected to come listen to obama are hard to come by .
the tagesspiegel daily quotes an official as saying the city expects between " 10,000 and one million .

" cowen said that ireland was at the start of a process of analysis and consultation and that a way would be found to " resolve the current difficulties " in a manner satisfactory to all 27 member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen said ireland needed time to move forward " we have to see how the concerns of those who voted no may or may not be addressed , he said , adding that he would stay in close contact with the french leader and that they would hold another meeting in september before cowen reported back to the european council in october . " we are not here to find a solution , but to make a statement of solidarity , " cowen said , stressing that time was needed to find the way forward . the french president said he " respected the outcome of the irish referendum , " but welcomed the fact that the ratification process was continuing in other member states and emphasized his commitment to the treaty . he said that he trusted cowen to find a solution to the problem . treaty opponents give sarkozy clear message after his meeting with sarkozy at government buildings earlier on monday , opposition fine gael leader enda kenny said he had " forcibly put it " to the french leader that " the issue of holding a second referendum was not going down well with the irish people . " leader of the labor party eamon gilmore said he told sarkozy that the lisbon treaty was dead and could not be put back to the irish people . " it did n't happen in france and why should it happen in ireland ? " he asked . gilmore told the french president that the " current impasse over the rejection of the treaty would not be resolved before next summer 's european elections . " protests in central dublin marked the visit from sarkozy , who is acting head of the eu since france took over the presidency on july 1 . over 200 fishermen protested at government buildings after handing out free fish in the center of dublin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen handed out free fish in an appeal for eu aid according to spokesman david kirwan , the fishermen wanted to send " a clear signal to sarkozy that fishermen were instrumental in securing a no vote in the lisbon reform treaty . "
unless fishermen received immediate aid , they would call for a no vote in any re-run of the referendum , he said . the irish farmers ' association president padraig walshe led a demonstration against the policies of european union trade commissioner , peter mandelson . walshe , who was part of a group who met sarkozy at the french embassy , said he would warn the french president that if the world trade organization deal currently on the table in geneva went ahead , it would " profoundly damage support in rural ireland for any future lisbon referendum . " some farmers outside government buildings had painted their tractors in the colors of the french flag to signal their solidarity with sarkozy despite their concerns about the wto talks .
one protestor was led away by irish police after throwing eggs at sarkozy as he arrived for his meeting with cowen . both sides meet at french embassy sarkozy also held round-table talks at the french embassy with groups who oppose and support the lisbon treaty . david begg , general secretary of the irish congress of trade unions , who attended the meeting , said that he " was n't willing to accept the view that because ireland had voted no , that was the end of it . " the visit was dogged by controversy after sarkozy privately told members of his union for a popular movement party -lrb- ump -rrb- this week that " the irish must vote again . " voters in ireland rejected the treaty to streamline the eu in a referendum june 12 . public forum cancelled due to french reservations the arrangements for the meeting at the embassy had also caused a diplomatic incident after labor party leader eamon gilmore declined an invitation to take part in the meeting at the french embassy .
he described the format allowing each participant to make a three-minute presentation to sarkozy as being " pointless " and showing a degree of " arrogance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libertas leader declan ganley on the campaign trail sarkozy 's visit , however , was extended at the last minute to accommodate one-to-one meetings with the two main opposition leaders . plans to hold a meeting in a public forum were scrapped , reportedly owing to the reservations of french officials , leading one irish analyst to describe the holding of the meeting at the french embassy as a " cold war tactic " of meeting " dissidents on home ground . " a representative of sinn fein , the only irish parliamentary party to campaign for a no vote , also took part in the round-table talks .
sinn fein leader gerry adams emphasized that there would be " no re-run of the referendum . " declan ganley , the leader of libertas , which spearheaded the no campaign in ireland , also took part in the meeting at the french embassy , but said that there were too many people apologizing for the no vote in attendance . the treaty requires the approval of all 27 eu member states before it can be ratified . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" obamania " in germany is now in full swing as the country awaits a political rock star . for monika staffel , wearing an " obama for president " button is nothing unusual , even though she 's a german citizen and wo n't be voting in the us presidential election this november .
this election is too important to stay on the sidelines , she said . " we are waiting urgently for change because bush has caused a lot of damage in the world , “ the 46-year-old from western germany said after visiting a stand two american obama supporters had set up in berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square . " now we want to know more about obama 's positions and we 're very sad that we ca n't be here in berlin on the 24th to listen to his speech , " she added .
" but we 'll be following it very closely in the media . " staffel reflects the views of many germans who are enthusiastic supporters of the presumptive democratic candidate , and are eagerly awaiting his appearance this thursday in berlin , when he will make a speech in front of berlin 's victory column . if the us presidential election were decided by german voters , obama could probably cut back on his breakneck campaign schedule .
a survey released by the pew research center showed that germans prefer the senator from illinois over the republican candidate , john mccain , by a 49 percent margin . building excitement " there is a great passion for a new america in europe and barack obama is the object of that adulation , " said robin hemingway , the founder of americans in berlin-brandenburg for obama , a group whose aim is to register as many americans as possible before the november elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrats abroad has been working to get americans in germany registered to vote while the excitement about obama has been bubbling for months , " obamania " has moved into high gear especially after the presumptive candidate announced his overseas trip with a stop in berlin . hemingway , 67 , said he has been contacted by people who are coming to berlin this week from german cities like frankfurt and rostock and places further afield such as prague and budapest .
they are not just american expats , he said , many germans are making the trip , too . " germans accept him like a rock-star , " he said .
" it 's like he made their favorite album and they want to come and see him .
i 've never seen that here before . " the group democrats abroad reports record high interest levels among americans .
over the last six months , its membership rolls have doubled , the organization said .
the berlin chapter said americans from the netherland and switzerland were coming to the speech , and to volunteer .
the chapter has been calling for members to help out with its voter registration drive at the event . location , location for weeks , germany has been consumed with the question of where obama will speak .
when the campaign requested having him talk in front of berlin 's brandenburg gate , chancellor angela merkel expressed reservations , fearing perhaps such a location would look like an endorsement of the democratic nominee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory column is now more often associated with fun of some sort - like the love parade other locations were floated and members of obama 's team were reported to be in berlin last week scouting out alternatives .
the decision to choose the victory column , a 226-foot pillar topped by a gold angel , has itself opened up a small controversy , with some politicians complaining that the site recalls germany 's nazi past and prussia 's militaristic tradition . the monument was built in 1864 to commemorate prussia 's victory over denmark .
it was later moved by adolf hitler from its site near to reichstag to its current position about one mile west in the middle of the tiergarten park . but many berliners today probably associate it more with having a good time , since for years it was the destination of the love parade techno party .
it is also where berlin 's gay and lesbian pride event , christopher street day , is held . it 's the party link that is more likely going through german minds for the event this thursday .
huge crowds are expected , especially since the speech is being likened by many to john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " performance in 1963 . several hundred city police officers will be on duty for the event , but estimates on the number of people expected to come listen to obama are hard to come by .
the tagesspiegel daily quotes an official as saying the city expects between " 10,000 and one million . " euphoria now , disappointment later ? even though a recent series of interviews with germans in central berlin failed to find one single mccain backer , the support for obama in germany does not come without some reservations .
the current euphoria could be short-lived when germans see that all of obama 's foreign policies are not to their liking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama stopped in afghanistan during this overseas trip , hoping to burnish his foreign policy credentials " he is young , dynamic , and has a lot of good ideas , " said marion violett , 55 , who was visiting berlin from duesseldorf .
" but this decision about afghanistan and putting more troops in there , that i ca n't understand and i do n't like at all . " still , if she could , she would vote for obama over mccain .
besides , she says , she does n't know much about the republican candidate . " in germany , every twist and turn obama makes is followed closely , " she said .
" but mccain is n't present in the media here at all . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

al-maliki will be in berlin on tuesday , july 22 , and is to meet german chancellor angela merkel .
" iraq needs germany on its side , " alaa al ashimy , iraqi ambassador to germany , said in an interview with deutsche welle .
european companies have long been eyeing opportunities in oil-rich iraq .
the european union is negotiating an energy pact with iraq , part of the bloc 's efforts to reduce dependence on russian oil and gas .
iraq has the world 's third largest proven reserves of oil and in june opened key producing fields to foreign investment .
" we 're talking to siemens , daimler and german firms involved in farming , oil and gas , " al-dabbagh said .
lucrative contracts beckon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-maliki , right , shakes with glos in baghdad last week , germany 's economy minister , michael glos , said one such company , wintershall , had a " big chance " of winning oil exploration rights in iraq .
it is part of chemicals group basf .
" i hope that it and other firms get more involved in extracting crude oil in iraq , " said glos on his way back from baghdad .
he was the first german cabinet minister to visit iraq since the us invasion of the country in 2003 .
asked if the time was ripe to invest in iraq , glos said : " i think so .
i felt in iraq that prime minister maliki has won the trust of the different ethnic groups .
it seems to me that he has managed to largely suppress the terrorists . "
a state-owned coach-assembly factory in the town of iskandariyah , about 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- south of the iraqi capital baghdad , is an example of those plants where the iraqi authorities would like to see german skills and money at work .
using dated machinery , only 450 people work now at a site that used to employ nearly 3,500 in its heyday under the late president saddam hussein .
baghdad has suggested to german carmaker daimler that it could be turning out gleaming mercedes-benz buses and trucks .
security remains a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide bombings are still a reality in iraq but iskandariyah is an edgy place .
in recent years , it was part of a zone of kidnappings and assassinations known as the death triangle , and german executives admit that they worry they could still be seized and held to ransom by criminals .
the german foreign ministry advises nationals to leave iraq immediately and not to trust the security forces whose capabilities are " limited " and loyalties " uncertain . "
those warnings have annoyed iraqi politicians , who insist the outlook is more positive .
al hashimy also said he thought government security warnings would n't keep germany from getting more involved in his country .
" the germans are patient and sceptical ; they think carefully before they make a decision .
but once they 've decided , then they act on their decision , and that 's the situation we 've reached now in 2008 , " he told deutsche welle .
as for the security warnings , glos himself took no chances during his visit .
he wore a bullet-proof vest and stayed in safe zones , though he later told the german daily die welt in an interview , " my impression is that the security situation is improving . "
a meeting with the pope from germany , al-maliki will travel to italy , which sent 3,000 troops to iraq after the us-led invasion in 2003 , but has since withdrawn them .
dabbagh said al-maliki would also meet pope benedict and brief him on the government 's measures to spread tolerance and national reconciliation among iraqis .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been hesitant about preparing ukrainian membership in nato however , at a nato summit in april , merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy had opposed efforts by poland and the baltic states to set a specific timetable for eventual ukrainian membership in the alliance . ukrainian media attacked merkel and sarkozy , saying paris and berlin feared a russian shut-off of natural gas supplies more than they supported bringing democratic ukraine into nato . russia has been outspoken in its opposition to the nato aspirations of ukraine 's government , and threatened military and economic retaliation were ukraine ever to join the alliance . merkel on monday made an indirect reference to the kremlin , saying that " other countries that are not nato members , and who do not have any relationship to this question -lrb- of ukrainian membership -rrb- should not discuss or consider it . " in december , nato is slated to discuss possible first steps toward ukraine 's membership in the alliance . securing a stable energy supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is an important transit country for westward-bound russian gas the need for kyiv to sign a long-term agreement with moscow guaranteeing stable natural gas deliveries to europe via ukrainian pipelines was another top discussion point . ukraine is critical to the security of europe 's energy import network , as most of russia 's westward-running oil and gas pipelines pass through the country . president yushchenko promised to fulfill ukraine 's commitment to reliably deliver gas from russia , but also warned of " political blackmail " from russia and others in light of upcoming price negotiations . in past years , kyiv and moscow have disagreed repeatedly on gas and oil shipment terms , leading to a two-day cut-off of russian gas to europe in january 2006 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta will intervene towards the release of the two german construction staff of the firm julius berger , who were ambushed and kidnapped for ransom in rivers state , " the group said in an e-mail to afp , the news agency reported on monday , july 21 .
mend said it was making contacts with the abductors who seized the germans in the volatile oil-rich region on july 11 .
the incident led the company to suspend its operations in the niger delta , the heart of oil production in the world 's eighth largest exporter .
julius berger is currently rebuilding the main east-west road across the niger delta and is one of nigeria 's biggest private sector employers , with more than 16,000 employees .
located and identified some 15 unidentified gunmen kidnapped the two employees of nigeria 's biggest construction firm julius berger , a unit of germany 's bilfinger berger , near the city of port harcourt .
they had been travelling in a convoy of armored jeeps .
" mend has located and identified the culprits and will begin negotiating with the kidnappers in the hope for a safe and unconditional release of the captives , " said the group .
apparently , it took the decision because the men were not part of the energy sector but were helping to build infrastructure in the niger delta region .
unrest mend claims to be fighting for greater control of the region 's oil wealth by local people and first emerged in january 2006 .
since then it has led a campaign of violence against oil facilities , perpetrating a series of violent attacks on the oil industry and kidnapping hundreds of local and expatriate workers in the restive region .
almost all have been released unharmed .
several foreign firms , including french tire company michelin and oil servicing firm wilbros , have left the region because of security problems .
the unrest has reduced nigeria 's oil output by a quarter , causing it to lose its position as africa 's biggest oil producer to angola , according to april figures from the organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 21.07.2008 german chancellor puts the brakes on ukraine 's eu hopes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko said germany was a role model for ukraine in its quest for eu membership in ukraine for the first time on monday , july 21 , german chancellor angela merkel dampened the country 's hopes for a quick path to eu membership .
she did express support for an association agreement , however . during her short stay in kyiv , the german chancellor said that ukraine would likely sign a so-called stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- before the french eu presidency expires at the end of this year . the deal is expected to top the agenda of an eu-ukraine summit taking place in september . while an saa is an important step toward membership in the 27-member european union , merkel urged ukrainians " not to confuse this with conditions for joining the eu , " pointing out that the bloc 's capacity for expansion was limited . during her day of talks with president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko , merkel said that ukraine was an important partner for germany and that germany would offer kyiv support in pursuing its reform plans . merkel keeps quiet on nato ukraine 's sehodnia newspaper had reported ahead of monday 's talks that the german leader was likely to leave the issue of nato-membership on the back burner , which indeed she did , calling it " a matter between ukraine and the nato member states . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been hesitant about preparing ukrainian membership in nato however , at a nato summit in april , merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy had opposed efforts by poland and the baltic states to set a specific timetable for eventual ukrainian membership in the alliance . ukrainian media attacked merkel and sarkozy , saying paris and berlin feared a russian shut-off of natural gas supplies more than they supported bringing democratic ukraine into nato . russia has been outspoken in its opposition to the nato aspirations of ukraine 's government , and threatened military and economic retaliation were ukraine ever to join the alliance . merkel on monday made an indirect reference to the kremlin , saying that " other countries that are not nato members , and who do not have any relationship to this question -lrb- of ukrainian membership -rrb- should not discuss or consider it . " in december , nato is slated to discuss possible first steps toward ukraine 's membership in the alliance . securing a stable energy supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is an important transit country for westward-bound russian gas the need for kyiv to sign a long-term agreement with moscow guaranteeing stable natural gas deliveries to europe via ukrainian pipelines was another top discussion point . ukraine is critical to the security of europe 's energy import network , as most of russia 's westward-running oil and gas pipelines pass through the country . president yushchenko promised to fulfill ukraine 's commitment to reliably deliver gas from russia , but also warned of " political blackmail " from russia and others in light of upcoming price negotiations . in past years , kyiv and moscow have disagreed repeatedly on gas and oil shipment terms , leading to a two-day cut-off of russian gas to europe in january 2006 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 21.07.2008 iraqi leader to visit germany to drum up foreign investment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european firms have long been eyeing the opportunities that oil-rich iraq offers iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki is to visit germany and italy this week to encourage european investment in his country , a government spokesman said , adding that iraq is now safe for business . iraqi government spokesman , ali al-dabbagh said al-maliki 's visit aimed to boost baghdad 's ties with european nations and encourage them to start investing in iraq where violence levels have fallen to a four-year low .
al-maliki will be in berlin on tuesday , july 22 , and is to meet german chancellor angela merkel .
" iraq needs germany on its side , " alaa al ashimy , iraqi ambassador to germany , said in an interview with deutsche welle .
european companies have long been eyeing opportunities in oil-rich iraq .
the european union is negotiating an energy pact with iraq , part of the bloc 's efforts to reduce dependence on russian oil and gas .
iraq has the world 's third largest proven reserves of oil and in june opened key producing fields to foreign investment .
" we 're talking to siemens , daimler and german firms involved in farming , oil and gas , " al-dabbagh said .
lucrative contracts beckon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-maliki , right , shakes with glos in baghdad last week , germany 's economy minister , michael glos , said one such company , wintershall , had a " big chance " of winning oil exploration rights in iraq .
it is part of chemicals group basf .
" i hope that it and other firms get more involved in extracting crude oil in iraq , " said glos on his way back from baghdad .
he was the first german cabinet minister to visit iraq since the us invasion of the country in 2003 .
asked if the time was ripe to invest in iraq , glos said : " i think so .
i felt in iraq that prime minister maliki has won the trust of the different ethnic groups .
it seems to me that he has managed to largely suppress the terrorists . "
a state-owned coach-assembly factory in the town of iskandariyah , about 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- south of the iraqi capital baghdad , is an example of those plants where the iraqi authorities would like to see german skills and money at work .
using dated machinery , only 450 people work now at a site that used to employ nearly 3,500 in its heyday under the late president saddam hussein .
baghdad has suggested to german carmaker daimler that it could be turning out gleaming mercedes-benz buses and trucks .
security remains a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide bombings are still a reality in iraq but iskandariyah is an edgy place .
in recent years , it was part of a zone of kidnappings and assassinations known as the death triangle , and german executives admit that they worry they could still be seized and held to ransom by criminals .
the german foreign ministry advises nationals to leave iraq immediately and not to trust the security forces whose capabilities are " limited " and loyalties " uncertain . "
those warnings have annoyed iraqi politicians , who insist the outlook is more positive .
al hashimy also said he thought government security warnings would n't keep germany from getting more involved in his country .
" the germans are patient and sceptical ; they think carefully before they make a decision .
but once they 've decided , then they act on their decision , and that 's the situation we 've reached now in 2008 , " he told deutsche welle .
as for the security warnings , glos himself took no chances during his visit .
he wore a bullet-proof vest and stayed in safe zones , though he later told the german daily die welt in an interview , " my impression is that the security situation is improving . "
a meeting with the pope from germany , al-maliki will travel to italy , which sent 3,000 troops to iraq after the us-led invasion in 2003 , but has since withdrawn them .
dabbagh said al-maliki would also meet pope benedict and brief him on the government 's measures to spread tolerance and national reconciliation among iraqis .

al-maliki will be in berlin on tuesday , july 22 , and is to meet german chancellor angela merkel .
" iraq needs germany on its side , " alaa al ashimy , iraqi ambassador to germany , said in an interview with deutsche welle .
european companies have long been eyeing opportunities in oil-rich iraq .
the european union is negotiating an energy pact with iraq , part of the bloc 's efforts to reduce dependence on russian oil and gas .
iraq has the world 's third largest proven reserves of oil and in june opened key producing fields to foreign investment .
" we 're talking to siemens , daimler and german firms involved in farming , oil and gas , " al-dabbagh said .
lucrative contracts beckon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-maliki , right , shakes with glos in baghdad last week , germany 's economy minister , michael glos , said one such company , wintershall , had a " big chance " of winning oil exploration rights in iraq .
it is part of chemicals group basf .
" i hope that it and other firms get more involved in extracting crude oil in iraq , " said glos on his way back from baghdad .
he was the first german cabinet minister to visit iraq since the us invasion of the country in 2003 .
asked if the time was ripe to invest in iraq , glos said : " i think so .
i felt in iraq that prime minister maliki has won the trust of the different ethnic groups .
it seems to me that he has managed to largely suppress the terrorists . "
a state-owned coach-assembly factory in the town of iskandariyah , about 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- south of the iraqi capital baghdad , is an example of those plants where the iraqi authorities would like to see german skills and money at work .
using dated machinery , only 450 people work now at a site that used to employ nearly 3,500 in its heyday under the late president saddam hussein .
baghdad has suggested to german carmaker daimler that it could be turning out gleaming mercedes-benz buses and trucks .
security remains a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide bombings are still a reality in iraq but iskandariyah is an edgy place .
in recent years , it was part of a zone of kidnappings and assassinations known as the death triangle , and german executives admit that they worry they could still be seized and held to ransom by criminals .
the german foreign ministry advises nationals to leave iraq immediately and not to trust the security forces whose capabilities are " limited " and loyalties " uncertain . "
those warnings have annoyed iraqi politicians , who insist the outlook is more positive .
al hashimy also said he thought government security warnings would n't keep germany from getting more involved in his country .
" the germans are patient and sceptical ; they think carefully before they make a decision .
but once they 've decided , then they act on their decision , and that 's the situation we 've reached now in 2008 , " he told deutsche welle .
as for the security warnings , glos himself took no chances during his visit .
he wore a bullet-proof vest and stayed in safe zones , though he later told the german daily die welt in an interview , " my impression is that the security situation is improving . "
a meeting with the pope from germany , al-maliki will travel to italy , which sent 3,000 troops to iraq after the us-led invasion in 2003 , but has since withdrawn them .
dabbagh said al-maliki would also meet pope benedict and brief him on the government 's measures to spread tolerance and national reconciliation among iraqis .
the pope has often called for an end to violence in iraq . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta will intervene towards the release of the two german construction staff of the firm julius berger , who were ambushed and kidnapped for ransom in rivers state , " the group said in an e-mail to afp , the news agency reported on monday , july 21 .
mend said it was making contacts with the abductors who seized the germans in the volatile oil-rich region on july 11 .
the incident led the company to suspend its operations in the niger delta , the heart of oil production in the world 's eighth largest exporter .
julius berger is currently rebuilding the main east-west road across the niger delta and is one of nigeria 's biggest private sector employers , with more than 16,000 employees .
located and identified some 15 unidentified gunmen kidnapped the two employees of nigeria 's biggest construction firm julius berger , a unit of germany 's bilfinger berger , near the city of port harcourt .
they had been travelling in a convoy of armored jeeps .
" mend has located and identified the culprits and will begin negotiating with the kidnappers in the hope for a safe and unconditional release of the captives , " said the group .
apparently , it took the decision because the men were not part of the energy sector but were helping to build infrastructure in the niger delta region .
unrest mend claims to be fighting for greater control of the region 's oil wealth by local people and first emerged in january 2006 .
since then it has led a campaign of violence against oil facilities , perpetrating a series of violent attacks on the oil industry and kidnapping hundreds of local and expatriate workers in the restive region .
almost all have been released unharmed .
several foreign firms , including french tire company michelin and oil servicing firm wilbros , have left the region because of security problems .
the unrest has reduced nigeria 's oil output by a quarter , causing it to lose its position as africa 's biggest oil producer to angola , according to april figures from the organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

street art is something else - whether screens , murals , sculptures or installations - it has this fascinating wealth of forms , all rooted in the concept of ' urban art ' and influenced by avant-garde movements such as fluxus , pop art and conceptual art . " joining the establishment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition is pulling in the crowds unlike other cities which have demonized its urban artists , kuepper insists street art today is an integral staple of the berlin cultural scene and long regarded as hip . hollywood idols angelina jolie and brad pitt are great fans of street art .
a few months ago at they splashed out some 290,000 euros -lrb- $ 458,000 -rrb- for a stencil work by england artist banksy , considered one of the big names of the street art scene . kuepper says " street art " is gaining increasing global attention from the established art market , with work by its top exponents starting to break auction house records . el tono from spain is one of the participants in berlin .
the fact that he and his compatriot nano 4818 have been exhibiting at the tate modern 's street art show in london is proof for kuepper of the " staggering development and widespread notoriety of the anarchic art movement . " criminalized bildunterschrift : many artists work under pseudonyms most street artists hide their real identities behind pseudonyms - partly due to continuing criminalization of the art form in some regions .
in free-wheeling berlin , however , officials take a much more relaxed view . german artist el bocho takes to the berlin streets at night , carrying his hand-painted posters which he pastes on walls and abandoned properties .
sometimes he 's also seen attaching his cleverly designed tiles to buildings in the central mitte , prenzlauer berg and friedrichshain districts . el bocho says he 's never encountered problems with the law although he sometimes gets stopped by policemen asking what he 's doing wandering the streets at night . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" obamania " in germany is now in full swing as the country awaits a political rock star . for monika staffel , wearing an " obama for president " button is nothing unusual , even though she 's a german citizen and wo n't be voting in the us presidential election this november .
this election is too important to stay on the sidelines , she said . " we are waiting urgently for change because bush has caused a lot of damage in the world , “ the 46-year-old from western germany said after visiting a stand two american obama supporters had set up in berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square . " now we want to know more about obama 's positions and we 're very sad that we ca n't be here in berlin on the 24th to listen to his speech , " she added .
" but we 'll be following it very closely in the media . " staffel reflects the views of many germans who are enthusiastic supporters of the presumptive democratic candidate , and are eagerly awaiting his appearance this thursday in berlin , when he will make a speech in front of berlin 's victory column . if the us presidential election were decided by german voters , obama could probably cut back on his breakneck campaign schedule .
a survey released by the pew research center showed that germans prefer the senator from illinois over the republican candidate , john mccain , by a 49 percent margin . building excitement " there is a great passion for a new america in europe and barack obama is the object of that adulation , " said robin hemingway , the founder of americans in berlin-brandenburg for obama , a group whose aim is to register as many americans as possible before the november elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrats abroad has been working to get americans in germany registered to vote while the excitement about obama has been bubbling for months , " obamania " has moved into high gear especially after the presumptive candidate announced his overseas trip with a stop in berlin . hemingway , 67 , said he has been contacted by people who are coming to berlin this week from german cities like frankfurt and rostock and places further afield such as prague and budapest .
they are not just american expats , he said , many germans are making the trip , too . " germans accept him like a rock-star , " he said .
" it 's like he made their favorite album and they want to come and see him .
i 've never seen that here before . " the group democrats abroad reports record high interest levels among americans .
over the last six months , its membership rolls have doubled , the organization said .
the berlin chapter said americans from the netherland and switzerland were coming to the speech , and to volunteer .
the chapter has been calling for members to help out with its voter registration drive at the event . location , location for weeks , germany has been consumed with the question of where obama will speak .
when the campaign requested having him talk in front of berlin 's brandenburg gate , chancellor angela merkel expressed reservations , fearing perhaps such a location would look like an endorsement of the democratic nominee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory column is now more often associated with fun of some sort - like the love parade other locations were floated and members of obama 's team were reported to be in berlin last week scouting out alternatives .
the decision to choose the victory column , a 226-foot pillar topped by a gold angel , has itself opened up a small controversy , with some politicians complaining that the site recalls germany 's nazi past and prussia 's militaristic tradition . the monument was built in 1864 to commemorate prussia 's victory over denmark .
it was later moved by adolf hitler from its site near to reichstag to its current position about one mile west in the middle of the tiergarten park . but many berliners today probably associate it more with having a good time , since for years it was the destination of the love parade techno party .
it is also where berlin 's gay and lesbian pride event , christopher street day , is held . it 's the party link that is more likely going through german minds for the event this thursday .
huge crowds are expected , especially since the speech is being likened by many to john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " performance in 1963 . several hundred city police officers will be on duty for the event , but estimates on the number of people expected to come listen to obama are hard to come by .
the tagesspiegel daily quotes an official as saying the city expects between " 10,000 and one million . " euphoria now , disappointment later ? even though a recent series of interviews with germans in central berlin failed to find one single mccain backer , the support for obama in germany does not come without some reservations .
the current euphoria could be short-lived when germans see that all of obama 's foreign policies are not to their liking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama stopped in afghanistan during this overseas trip , hoping to burnish his foreign policy credentials " he is young , dynamic , and has a lot of good ideas , " said marion violett , 55 , who was visiting berlin from duesseldorf .
" but this decision about afghanistan and putting more troops in there , that i ca n't understand and i do n't like at all . " still , if she could , she would vote for obama over mccain .
besides , she says , she does n't know much about the republican candidate . " in germany , every twist and turn obama makes is followed closely , " she said .
" but mccain is n't present in the media here at all . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a survey released by the pew research center showed that germans prefer the senator from illinois over the republican candidate , john mccain , by a 49 percent margin . building excitement " there is a great passion for a new america in europe and barack obama is the object of that adulation , " said robin hemingway , the founder of americans in berlin-brandenburg for obama , a group whose aim is to register as many americans as possible before the november elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrats abroad has been working to get americans in germany registered to vote while the excitement about obama has been bubbling for months , " obamania " has moved into high gear especially after the presumptive candidate announced his overseas trip with a stop in berlin . hemingway , 67 , said he has been contacted by people who are coming to berlin this week from german cities like frankfurt and rostock and places further afield such as prague and budapest .
they are not just american expats , he said , many germans are making the trip , too . " germans accept him like a rock-star , " he said .
" it 's like he made their favorite album and they want to come and see him .
i 've never seen that here before . " the group democrats abroad reports record high interest levels among americans .
over the last six months , its membership rolls have doubled , the organization said .
the berlin chapter said americans from the netherland and switzerland were coming to the speech , and to volunteer .
the chapter has been calling for members to help out with its voter registration drive at the event . location , location for weeks , germany has been consumed with the question of where obama will speak .
when the campaign requested having him talk in front of berlin 's brandenburg gate , chancellor angela merkel expressed reservations , fearing perhaps such a location would look like an endorsement of the democratic nominee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory column is now more often associated with fun of some sort - like the love parade other locations were floated and members of obama 's team were reported to be in berlin last week scouting out alternatives .
the decision to choose the victory column , a 226-foot pillar topped by a gold angel , has itself opened up a small controversy , with some politicians complaining that the site recalls germany 's nazi past and prussia 's militaristic tradition . the monument was built in 1864 to commemorate prussia 's victory over denmark .
it was later moved by adolf hitler from its site near to reichstag to its current position about one mile west in the middle of the tiergarten park . but many berliners today probably associate it more with having a good time , since for years it was the destination of the love parade techno party .
it is also where berlin 's gay and lesbian pride event , christopher street day , is held . it 's the party link that is more likely going through german minds for the event this thursday .
huge crowds are expected , especially since the speech is being likened by many to john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " performance in 1963 . several hundred city police officers will be on duty for the event , but estimates on the number of people expected to come listen to obama are hard to come by .
the tagesspiegel daily quotes an official as saying the city expects between " 10,000 and one million . " euphoria now , disappointment later ? even though a recent series of interviews with germans in central berlin failed to find one single mccain backer , the support for obama in germany does not come without some reservations .
the current euphoria could be short-lived when germans see that all of obama 's foreign policies are not to their liking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama stopped in afghanistan during this overseas trip , hoping to burnish his foreign policy credentials " he is young , dynamic , and has a lot of good ideas , " said marion violett , 55 , who was visiting berlin from duesseldorf .
" but this decision about afghanistan and putting more troops in there , that i ca n't understand and i do n't like at all . " still , if she could , she would vote for obama over mccain .
besides , she says , she does n't know much about the republican candidate . " in germany , every twist and turn obama makes is followed closely , " she said .
" but mccain is n't present in the media here at all . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" obamania " in germany is now in full swing as the country awaits a political rock star . for monika staffel , wearing an " obama for president " button is nothing unusual , even though she 's a german citizen and wo n't be voting in the us presidential election this november .
this election is too important to stay on the sidelines , she said . " we are waiting urgently for change because bush has caused a lot of damage in the world , “ the 46-year-old from western germany said after visiting a stand two american obama supporters had set up in berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square . " now we want to know more about obama 's positions and we 're very sad that we ca n't be here in berlin on the 24th to listen to his speech , " she added .
" but we 'll be following it very closely in the media . " staffel reflects the views of many germans who are enthusiastic supporters of the presumptive democratic candidate , and are eagerly awaiting his appearance this thursday in berlin , when he will make a speech in front of berlin 's victory column . if the us presidential election were decided by german voters , obama could probably cut back on his breakneck campaign schedule .
a survey released by the pew research center showed that germans prefer the senator from illinois over the republican candidate , john mccain , by a 49 percent margin . building excitement " there is a great passion for a new america in europe and barack obama is the object of that adulation , " said robin hemingway , the founder of americans in berlin-brandenburg for obama , a group whose aim is to register as many americans as possible before the november elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrats abroad has been working to get americans in germany registered to vote while the excitement about obama has been bubbling for months , " obamania " has moved into high gear especially after the presumptive candidate announced his overseas trip with a stop in berlin . hemingway , 67 , said he has been contacted by people who are coming to berlin this week from german cities like frankfurt and rostock and places further afield such as prague and budapest .
they are not just american expats , he said , many germans are making the trip , too . " germans accept him like a rock-star , " he said .
" it 's like he made their favorite album and they want to come and see him .
i 've never seen that here before . " the group democrats abroad reports record high interest levels among americans .
over the last six months , its membership rolls have doubled , the organization said .
the berlin chapter said americans from the netherland and switzerland were coming to the speech , and to volunteer .
the chapter has been calling for members to help out with its voter registration drive at the event . location , location for weeks , germany has been consumed with the question of where obama will speak .
when the campaign requested having him talk in front of berlin 's brandenburg gate , chancellor angela merkel expressed reservations , fearing perhaps such a location would look like an endorsement of the democratic nominee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory column is now more often associated with fun of some sort - like the love parade other locations were floated and members of obama 's team were reported to be in berlin last week scouting out alternatives .
the decision to choose the victory column , a 226-foot pillar topped by a gold angel , has itself opened up a small controversy , with some politicians complaining that the site recalls germany 's nazi past and prussia 's militaristic tradition . the monument was built in 1864 to commemorate prussia 's victory over denmark .
it was later moved by adolf hitler from its site near to reichstag to its current position about one mile west in the middle of the tiergarten park . but many berliners today probably associate it more with having a good time , since for years it was the destination of the love parade techno party .
it is also where berlin 's gay and lesbian pride event , christopher street day , is held . it 's the party link that is more likely going through german minds for the event this thursday .
huge crowds are expected , especially since the speech is being likened by many to john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " performance in 1963 . several hundred city police officers will be on duty for the event , but estimates on the number of people expected to come listen to obama are hard to come by .
the tagesspiegel daily quotes an official as saying the city expects between " 10,000 and one million . " euphoria now , disappointment later ? even though a recent series of interviews with germans in central berlin failed to find one single mccain backer , the support for obama in germany does not come without some reservations .
the current euphoria could be short-lived when germans see that all of obama 's foreign policies are not to their liking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama stopped in afghanistan during this overseas trip , hoping to burnish his foreign policy credentials " he is young , dynamic , and has a lot of good ideas , " said marion violett , 55 , who was visiting berlin from duesseldorf .
" but this decision about afghanistan and putting more troops in there , that i ca n't understand and i do n't like at all . " still , if she could , she would vote for obama over mccain .
besides , she says , she does n't know much about the republican candidate . " in germany , every twist and turn obama makes is followed closely , " she said .
" but mccain is n't present in the media here at all . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta will intervene towards the release of the two german construction staff of the firm julius berger , who were ambushed and kidnapped for ransom in rivers state , " the group said in an e-mail to afp , the news agency reported on monday , july 21 .
mend said it was making contacts with the abductors who seized the germans in the volatile oil-rich region on july 11 .
the incident led the company to suspend its operations in the niger delta , the heart of oil production in the world 's eighth largest exporter .
julius berger is currently rebuilding the main east-west road across the niger delta and is one of nigeria 's biggest private sector employers , with more than 16,000 employees .
located and identified some 15 unidentified gunmen kidnapped the two employees of nigeria 's biggest construction firm julius berger , a unit of germany 's bilfinger berger , near the city of port harcourt .
they had been travelling in a convoy of armored jeeps .
" mend has located and identified the culprits and will begin negotiating with the kidnappers in the hope for a safe and unconditional release of the captives , " said the group .
apparently , it took the decision because the men were not part of the energy sector but were helping to build infrastructure in the niger delta region .
unrest mend claims to be fighting for greater control of the region 's oil wealth by local people and first emerged in january 2006 .
since then it has led a campaign of violence against oil facilities , perpetrating a series of violent attacks on the oil industry and kidnapping hundreds of local and expatriate workers in the restive region .
almost all have been released unharmed .
several foreign firms , including french tire company michelin and oil servicing firm wilbros , have left the region because of security problems .
the unrest has reduced nigeria 's oil output by a quarter , causing it to lose its position as africa 's biggest oil producer to angola , according to april figures from the organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" cowen said that ireland was at the start of a process of analysis and consultation and that a way would be found to " resolve the current difficulties " in a manner satisfactory to all 27 member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen said ireland needed time to move forward " we have to see how the concerns of those who voted no may or may not be addressed , he said , adding that he would stay in close contact with the french leader and that they would hold another meeting in september before cowen reported back to the european council in october . " we are not here to find a solution , but to make a statement of solidarity , " cowen said , stressing that time was needed to find the way forward . the french president said he " respected the outcome of the irish referendum , " but welcomed the fact that the ratification process was continuing in other member states and emphasized his commitment to the treaty . he said that he trusted cowen to find a solution to the problem . treaty opponents give sarkozy clear message after his meeting with sarkozy at government buildings earlier on monday , opposition fine gael leader enda kenny said he had " forcibly put it " to the french leader that " the issue of holding a second referendum was not going down well with the irish people . " leader of the labor party eamon gilmore said he told sarkozy that the lisbon treaty was dead and could not be put back to the irish people . " it did n't happen in france and why should it happen in ireland ? " he asked . gilmore told the french president that the " current impasse over the rejection of the treaty would not be resolved before next summer 's european elections . " protests in central dublin marked the visit from sarkozy , who is acting head of the eu since france took over the presidency on july 1 . over 200 fishermen protested at government buildings after handing out free fish in the center of dublin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen handed out free fish in an appeal for eu aid according to spokesman david kirwan , the fishermen wanted to send " a clear signal to sarkozy that fishermen were instrumental in securing a no vote in the lisbon reform treaty . "
unless fishermen received immediate aid , they would call for a no vote in any re-run of the referendum , he said . the irish farmers ' association president padraig walshe led a demonstration against the policies of european union trade commissioner , peter mandelson . walshe , who was part of a group who met sarkozy at the french embassy , said he would warn the french president that if the world trade organization deal currently on the table in geneva went ahead , it would " profoundly damage support in rural ireland for any future lisbon referendum . " some farmers outside government buildings had painted their tractors in the colors of the french flag to signal their solidarity with sarkozy despite their concerns about the wto talks .
one protestor was led away by irish police after throwing eggs at sarkozy as he arrived for his meeting with cowen . both sides meet at french embassy sarkozy also held round-table talks at the french embassy with groups who oppose and support the lisbon treaty . david begg , general secretary of the irish congress of trade unions , who attended the meeting , said that he " was n't willing to accept the view that because ireland had voted no , that was the end of it . " the visit was dogged by controversy after sarkozy privately told members of his union for a popular movement party -lrb- ump -rrb- this week that " the irish must vote again . " voters in ireland rejected the treaty to streamline the eu in a referendum june 12 . public forum cancelled due to french reservations the arrangements for the meeting at the embassy had also caused a diplomatic incident after labor party leader eamon gilmore declined an invitation to take part in the meeting at the french embassy .
he described the format allowing each participant to make a three-minute presentation to sarkozy as being " pointless " and showing a degree of " arrogance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libertas leader declan ganley on the campaign trail sarkozy 's visit , however , was extended at the last minute to accommodate one-to-one meetings with the two main opposition leaders . plans to hold a meeting in a public forum were scrapped , reportedly owing to the reservations of french officials , leading one irish analyst to describe the holding of the meeting at the french embassy as a " cold war tactic " of meeting " dissidents on home ground .

" we are not here to find a solution , but to make a statement of solidarity , " cowen said , stressing that time was needed to find the way forward . the french president said he " respected the outcome of the irish referendum , " but welcomed the fact that the ratification process was continuing in other member states and emphasized his commitment to the treaty . he said that he trusted cowen to find a solution to the problem . treaty opponents give sarkozy clear message after his meeting with sarkozy at government buildings earlier on monday , opposition fine gael leader enda kenny said he had " forcibly put it " to the french leader that " the issue of holding a second referendum was not going down well with the irish people .

al-maliki will be in berlin on tuesday , july 22 , and is to meet german chancellor angela merkel .
" iraq needs germany on its side , " alaa al ashimy , iraqi ambassador to germany , said in an interview with deutsche welle .
european companies have long been eyeing opportunities in oil-rich iraq .
the european union is negotiating an energy pact with iraq , part of the bloc 's efforts to reduce dependence on russian oil and gas .
iraq has the world 's third largest proven reserves of oil and in june opened key producing fields to foreign investment .
" we 're talking to siemens , daimler and german firms involved in farming , oil and gas , " al-dabbagh said .
lucrative contracts beckon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-maliki , right , shakes with glos in baghdad last week , germany 's economy minister , michael glos , said one such company , wintershall , had a " big chance " of winning oil exploration rights in iraq .
it is part of chemicals group basf .
" i hope that it and other firms get more involved in extracting crude oil in iraq , " said glos on his way back from baghdad .
he was the first german cabinet minister to visit iraq since the us invasion of the country in 2003 .
asked if the time was ripe to invest in iraq , glos said : " i think so .
i felt in iraq that prime minister maliki has won the trust of the different ethnic groups .
it seems to me that he has managed to largely suppress the terrorists . "
a state-owned coach-assembly factory in the town of iskandariyah , about 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- south of the iraqi capital baghdad , is an example of those plants where the iraqi authorities would like to see german skills and money at work .
using dated machinery , only 450 people work now at a site that used to employ nearly 3,500 in its heyday under the late president saddam hussein .
baghdad has suggested to german carmaker daimler that it could be turning out gleaming mercedes-benz buses and trucks .
security remains a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide bombings are still a reality in iraq but iskandariyah is an edgy place .
in recent years , it was part of a zone of kidnappings and assassinations known as the death triangle , and german executives admit that they worry they could still be seized and held to ransom by criminals .
the german foreign ministry advises nationals to leave iraq immediately and not to trust the security forces whose capabilities are " limited " and loyalties " uncertain . "
those warnings have annoyed iraqi politicians , who insist the outlook is more positive .
al hashimy also said he thought government security warnings would n't keep germany from getting more involved in his country .
" the germans are patient and sceptical ; they think carefully before they make a decision .
but once they 've decided , then they act on their decision , and that 's the situation we 've reached now in 2008 , " he told deutsche welle .
as for the security warnings , glos himself took no chances during his visit .
he wore a bullet-proof vest and stayed in safe zones , though he later told the german daily die welt in an interview , " my impression is that the security situation is improving . "
a meeting with the pope from germany , al-maliki will travel to italy , which sent 3,000 troops to iraq after the us-led invasion in 2003 , but has since withdrawn them .
dabbagh said al-maliki would also meet pope benedict and brief him on the government 's measures to spread tolerance and national reconciliation among iraqis .
the pope has often called for an end to violence in iraq . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i hope that it and other firms get more involved in extracting crude oil in iraq , " said glos on his way back from baghdad .
he was the first german cabinet minister to visit iraq since the us invasion of the country in 2003 .
asked if the time was ripe to invest in iraq , glos said : " i think so .
i felt in iraq that prime minister maliki has won the trust of the different ethnic groups .

a state-owned coach-assembly factory in the town of iskandariyah , about 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- south of the iraqi capital baghdad , is an example of those plants where the iraqi authorities would like to see german skills and money at work .

those warnings have annoyed iraqi politicians , who insist the outlook is more positive .
al hashimy also said he thought government security warnings would n't keep germany from getting more involved in his country .
" the germans are patient and sceptical ; they think carefully before they make a decision .
but once they 've decided , then they act on their decision , and that 's the situation we 've reached now in 2008 , " he told deutsche welle .

she did express support for an association agreement , however . during her short stay in kyiv , the german chancellor said that ukraine would likely sign a so-called stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- before the french eu presidency expires at the end of this year . the deal is expected to top the agenda of an eu-ukraine summit taking place in september . while an saa is an important step toward membership in the 27-member european union , merkel urged ukrainians " not to confuse this with conditions for joining the eu , " pointing out that the bloc 's capacity for expansion was limited . during her day of talks with president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko , merkel said that ukraine was an important partner for germany and that germany would offer kyiv support in pursuing its reform plans . merkel keeps quiet on nato ukraine 's sehodnia newspaper had reported ahead of monday 's talks that the german leader was likely to leave the issue of nato-membership on the back burner , which indeed she did , calling it " a matter between ukraine and the nato member states . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been hesitant about preparing ukrainian membership in nato however , at a nato summit in april , merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy had opposed efforts by poland and the baltic states to set a specific timetable for eventual ukrainian membership in the alliance . ukrainian media attacked merkel and sarkozy , saying paris and berlin feared a russian shut-off of natural gas supplies more than they supported bringing democratic ukraine into nato . russia has been outspoken in its opposition to the nato aspirations of ukraine 's government , and threatened military and economic retaliation were ukraine ever to join the alliance . merkel on monday made an indirect reference to the kremlin , saying that " other countries that are not nato members , and who do not have any relationship to this question -lrb- of ukrainian membership -rrb- should not discuss or consider it . " in december , nato is slated to discuss possible first steps toward ukraine 's membership in the alliance . securing a stable energy supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is an important transit country for westward-bound russian gas the need for kyiv to sign a long-term agreement with moscow guaranteeing stable natural gas deliveries to europe via ukrainian pipelines was another top discussion point . ukraine is critical to the security of europe 's energy import network , as most of russia 's westward-running oil and gas pipelines pass through the country . president yushchenko promised to fulfill ukraine 's commitment to reliably deliver gas from russia , but also warned of " political blackmail " from russia and others in light of upcoming price negotiations . in past years , kyiv and moscow have disagreed repeatedly on gas and oil shipment terms , leading to a two-day cut-off of russian gas to europe in january 2006 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" obamania " in germany is now in full swing as the country awaits a political rock star . for monika staffel , wearing an " obama for president " button is nothing unusual , even though she 's a german citizen and wo n't be voting in the us presidential election this november .
this election is too important to stay on the sidelines , she said . " we are waiting urgently for change because bush has caused a lot of damage in the world , “ the 46-year-old from western germany said after visiting a stand two american obama supporters had set up in berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square . " now we want to know more about obama 's positions and we 're very sad that we ca n't be here in berlin on the 24th to listen to his speech , " she added .
" but we 'll be following it very closely in the media . " staffel reflects the views of many germans who are enthusiastic supporters of the presumptive democratic candidate , and are eagerly awaiting his appearance this thursday in berlin , when he will make a speech in front of berlin 's victory column . if the us presidential election were decided by german voters , obama could probably cut back on his breakneck campaign schedule .
a survey released by the pew research center showed that germans prefer the senator from illinois over the republican candidate , john mccain , by a 49 percent margin . building excitement " there is a great passion for a new america in europe and barack obama is the object of that adulation , " said robin hemingway , the founder of americans in berlin-brandenburg for obama , a group whose aim is to register as many americans as possible before the november elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrats abroad has been working to get americans in germany registered to vote while the excitement about obama has been bubbling for months , " obamania " has moved into high gear especially after the presumptive candidate announced his overseas trip with a stop in berlin . hemingway , 67 , said he has been contacted by people who are coming to berlin this week from german cities like frankfurt and rostock and places further afield such as prague and budapest .
they are not just american expats , he said , many germans are making the trip , too . " germans accept him like a rock-star , " he said .
" it 's like he made their favorite album and they want to come and see him .
i 've never seen that here before . " the group democrats abroad reports record high interest levels among americans .
over the last six months , its membership rolls have doubled , the organization said .
the berlin chapter said americans from the netherland and switzerland were coming to the speech , and to volunteer .
the chapter has been calling for members to help out with its voter registration drive at the event . location , location for weeks , germany has been consumed with the question of where obama will speak .
when the campaign requested having him talk in front of berlin 's brandenburg gate , chancellor angela merkel expressed reservations , fearing perhaps such a location would look like an endorsement of the democratic nominee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory column is now more often associated with fun of some sort - like the love parade other locations were floated and members of obama 's team were reported to be in berlin last week scouting out alternatives .
the decision to choose the victory column , a 226-foot pillar topped by a gold angel , has itself opened up a small controversy , with some politicians complaining that the site recalls germany 's nazi past and prussia 's militaristic tradition . the monument was built in 1864 to commemorate prussia 's victory over denmark .
it was later moved by adolf hitler from its site near to reichstag to its current position about one mile west in the middle of the tiergarten park . but many berliners today probably associate it more with having a good time , since for years it was the destination of the love parade techno party .
it is also where berlin 's gay and lesbian pride event , christopher street day , is held . it 's the party link that is more likely going through german minds for the event this thursday .
huge crowds are expected , especially since the speech is being likened by many to john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " performance in 1963 . several hundred city police officers will be on duty for the event , but estimates on the number of people expected to come listen to obama are hard to come by .
the tagesspiegel daily quotes an official as saying the city expects between " 10,000 and one million . " euphoria now , disappointment later ? even though a recent series of interviews with germans in central berlin failed to find one single mccain backer , the support for obama in germany does not come without some reservations .
the current euphoria could be short-lived when germans see that all of obama 's foreign policies are not to their liking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama stopped in afghanistan during this overseas trip , hoping to burnish his foreign policy credentials " he is young , dynamic , and has a lot of good ideas , " said marion violett , 55 , who was visiting berlin from duesseldorf .
" but this decision about afghanistan and putting more troops in there , that i ca n't understand and i do n't like at all . " still , if she could , she would vote for obama over mccain .
besides , she says , she does n't know much about the republican candidate . " in germany , every twist and turn obama makes is followed closely , " she said .
" but mccain is n't present in the media here at all . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been hesitant about preparing ukrainian membership in nato however , at a nato summit in april , merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy had opposed efforts by poland and the baltic states to set a specific timetable for eventual ukrainian membership in the alliance . ukrainian media attacked merkel and sarkozy , saying paris and berlin feared a russian shut-off of natural gas supplies more than they supported bringing democratic ukraine into nato . russia has been outspoken in its opposition to the nato aspirations of ukraine 's government , and threatened military and economic retaliation were ukraine ever to join the alliance . merkel on monday made an indirect reference to the kremlin , saying that " other countries that are not nato members , and who do not have any relationship to this question -lrb- of ukrainian membership -rrb- should not discuss or consider it . " in december , nato is slated to discuss possible first steps toward ukraine 's membership in the alliance . securing a stable energy supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is an important transit country for westward-bound russian gas the need for kyiv to sign a long-term agreement with moscow guaranteeing stable natural gas deliveries to europe via ukrainian pipelines was another top discussion point . ukraine is critical to the security of europe 's energy import network , as most of russia 's westward-running oil and gas pipelines pass through the country . president yushchenko promised to fulfill ukraine 's commitment to reliably deliver gas from russia , but also warned of " political blackmail " from russia and others in light of upcoming price negotiations . in past years , kyiv and moscow have disagreed repeatedly on gas and oil shipment terms , leading to a two-day cut-off of russian gas to europe in january 2006 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

al-maliki will be in berlin on tuesday , july 22 , and is to meet german chancellor angela merkel .
" iraq needs germany on its side , " alaa al ashimy , iraqi ambassador to germany , said in an interview with deutsche welle .
european companies have long been eyeing opportunities in oil-rich iraq .
the european union is negotiating an energy pact with iraq , part of the bloc 's efforts to reduce dependence on russian oil and gas .
iraq has the world 's third largest proven reserves of oil and in june opened key producing fields to foreign investment .
" we 're talking to siemens , daimler and german firms involved in farming , oil and gas , " al-dabbagh said .
lucrative contracts beckon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-maliki , right , shakes with glos in baghdad last week , germany 's economy minister , michael glos , said one such company , wintershall , had a " big chance " of winning oil exploration rights in iraq .
it is part of chemicals group basf .
" i hope that it and other firms get more involved in extracting crude oil in iraq , " said glos on his way back from baghdad .
he was the first german cabinet minister to visit iraq since the us invasion of the country in 2003 .
asked if the time was ripe to invest in iraq , glos said : " i think so .
i felt in iraq that prime minister maliki has won the trust of the different ethnic groups .
it seems to me that he has managed to largely suppress the terrorists . "
a state-owned coach-assembly factory in the town of iskandariyah , about 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- south of the iraqi capital baghdad , is an example of those plants where the iraqi authorities would like to see german skills and money at work .
using dated machinery , only 450 people work now at a site that used to employ nearly 3,500 in its heyday under the late president saddam hussein .
baghdad has suggested to german carmaker daimler that it could be turning out gleaming mercedes-benz buses and trucks .
security remains a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide bombings are still a reality in iraq but iskandariyah is an edgy place .
in recent years , it was part of a zone of kidnappings and assassinations known as the death triangle , and german executives admit that they worry they could still be seized and held to ransom by criminals .
the german foreign ministry advises nationals to leave iraq immediately and not to trust the security forces whose capabilities are " limited " and loyalties " uncertain . "
those warnings have annoyed iraqi politicians , who insist the outlook is more positive .
al hashimy also said he thought government security warnings would n't keep germany from getting more involved in his country .
" the germans are patient and sceptical ; they think carefully before they make a decision .

al-maliki will be in berlin on tuesday , july 22 , and is to meet german chancellor angela merkel .
" iraq needs germany on its side , " alaa al ashimy , iraqi ambassador to germany , said in an interview with deutsche welle .
european companies have long been eyeing opportunities in oil-rich iraq .
the european union is negotiating an energy pact with iraq , part of the bloc 's efforts to reduce dependence on russian oil and gas .
iraq has the world 's third largest proven reserves of oil and in june opened key producing fields to foreign investment .
" we 're talking to siemens , daimler and german firms involved in farming , oil and gas , " al-dabbagh said .
lucrative contracts beckon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-maliki , right , shakes with glos in baghdad last week , germany 's economy minister , michael glos , said one such company , wintershall , had a " big chance " of winning oil exploration rights in iraq .
it is part of chemicals group basf .
" i hope that it and other firms get more involved in extracting crude oil in iraq , " said glos on his way back from baghdad .
he was the first german cabinet minister to visit iraq since the us invasion of the country in 2003 .
asked if the time was ripe to invest in iraq , glos said : " i think so .
i felt in iraq that prime minister maliki has won the trust of the different ethnic groups .
it seems to me that he has managed to largely suppress the terrorists . "
a state-owned coach-assembly factory in the town of iskandariyah , about 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- south of the iraqi capital baghdad , is an example of those plants where the iraqi authorities would like to see german skills and money at work .
using dated machinery , only 450 people work now at a site that used to employ nearly 3,500 in its heyday under the late president saddam hussein .
baghdad has suggested to german carmaker daimler that it could be turning out gleaming mercedes-benz buses and trucks .
security remains a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide bombings are still a reality in iraq but iskandariyah is an edgy place .
in recent years , it was part of a zone of kidnappings and assassinations known as the death triangle , and german executives admit that they worry they could still be seized and held to ransom by criminals .
the german foreign ministry advises nationals to leave iraq immediately and not to trust the security forces whose capabilities are " limited " and loyalties " uncertain . "
those warnings have annoyed iraqi politicians , who insist the outlook is more positive .
al hashimy also said he thought government security warnings would n't keep germany from getting more involved in his country .
" the germans are patient and sceptical ; they think carefully before they make a decision .
but once they 've decided , then they act on their decision , and that 's the situation we 've reached now in 2008 , " he told deutsche welle .
as for the security warnings , glos himself took no chances during his visit .
he wore a bullet-proof vest and stayed in safe zones , though he later told the german daily die welt in an interview , " my impression is that the security situation is improving . "
a meeting with the pope from germany , al-maliki will travel to italy , which sent 3,000 troops to iraq after the us-led invasion in 2003 , but has since withdrawn them .

" it did n't happen in france and why should it happen in ireland ? " he asked . gilmore told the french president that the " current impasse over the rejection of the treaty would not be resolved before next summer 's european elections .

" cowen said that ireland was at the start of a process of analysis and consultation and that a way would be found to " resolve the current difficulties " in a manner satisfactory to all 27 member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen said ireland needed time to move forward " we have to see how the concerns of those who voted no may or may not be addressed , he said , adding that he would stay in close contact with the french leader and that they would hold another meeting in september before cowen reported back to the european council in october . " we are not here to find a solution , but to make a statement of solidarity , " cowen said , stressing that time was needed to find the way forward . the french president said he " respected the outcome of the irish referendum , " but welcomed the fact that the ratification process was continuing in other member states and emphasized his commitment to the treaty . he said that he trusted cowen to find a solution to the problem . treaty opponents give sarkozy clear message after his meeting with sarkozy at government buildings earlier on monday , opposition fine gael leader enda kenny said he had " forcibly put it " to the french leader that " the issue of holding a second referendum was not going down well with the irish people . " leader of the labor party eamon gilmore said he told sarkozy that the lisbon treaty was dead and could not be put back to the irish people . " it did n't happen in france and why should it happen in ireland ? " he asked . gilmore told the french president that the " current impasse over the rejection of the treaty would not be resolved before next summer 's european elections .

unless fishermen received immediate aid , they would call for a no vote in any re-run of the referendum , he said . the irish farmers ' association president padraig walshe led a demonstration against the policies of european union trade commissioner , peter mandelson . walshe , who was part of a group who met sarkozy at the french embassy , said he would warn the french president that if the world trade organization deal currently on the table in geneva went ahead , it would " profoundly damage support in rural ireland for any future lisbon referendum . " some farmers outside government buildings had painted their tractors in the colors of the french flag to signal their solidarity with sarkozy despite their concerns about the wto talks .
one protestor was led away by irish police after throwing eggs at sarkozy as he arrived for his meeting with cowen . both sides meet at french embassy sarkozy also held round-table talks at the french embassy with groups who oppose and support the lisbon treaty . david begg , general secretary of the irish congress of trade unions , who attended the meeting , said that he " was n't willing to accept the view that because ireland had voted no , that was the end of it .

" voters in ireland rejected the treaty to streamline the eu in a referendum june 12 . public forum cancelled due to french reservations the arrangements for the meeting at the embassy had also caused a diplomatic incident after labor party leader eamon gilmore declined an invitation to take part in the meeting at the french embassy .

" obamania " in germany is now in full swing as the country awaits a political rock star . for monika staffel , wearing an " obama for president " button is nothing unusual , even though she 's a german citizen and wo n't be voting in the us presidential election this november .
this election is too important to stay on the sidelines , she said . " we are waiting urgently for change because bush has caused a lot of damage in the world , “ the 46-year-old from western germany said after visiting a stand two american obama supporters had set up in berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square . " now we want to know more about obama 's positions and we 're very sad that we ca n't be here in berlin on the 24th to listen to his speech , " she added .
" but we 'll be following it very closely in the media . " staffel reflects the views of many germans who are enthusiastic supporters of the presumptive democratic candidate , and are eagerly awaiting his appearance this thursday in berlin , when he will make a speech in front of berlin 's victory column . if the us presidential election were decided by german voters , obama could probably cut back on his breakneck campaign schedule .
a survey released by the pew research center showed that germans prefer the senator from illinois over the republican candidate , john mccain , by a 49 percent margin . building excitement " there is a great passion for a new america in europe and barack obama is the object of that adulation , " said robin hemingway , the founder of americans in berlin-brandenburg for obama , a group whose aim is to register as many americans as possible before the november elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrats abroad has been working to get americans in germany registered to vote while the excitement about obama has been bubbling for months , " obamania " has moved into high gear especially after the presumptive candidate announced his overseas trip with a stop in berlin . hemingway , 67 , said he has been contacted by people who are coming to berlin this week from german cities like frankfurt and rostock and places further afield such as prague and budapest .
they are not just american expats , he said , many germans are making the trip , too . " germans accept him like a rock-star , " he said .
" it 's like he made their favorite album and they want to come and see him .
i 've never seen that here before . " the group democrats abroad reports record high interest levels among americans .
over the last six months , its membership rolls have doubled , the organization said .
the berlin chapter said americans from the netherland and switzerland were coming to the speech , and to volunteer .
the chapter has been calling for members to help out with its voter registration drive at the event . location , location for weeks , germany has been consumed with the question of where obama will speak .
when the campaign requested having him talk in front of berlin 's brandenburg gate , chancellor angela merkel expressed reservations , fearing perhaps such a location would look like an endorsement of the democratic nominee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory column is now more often associated with fun of some sort - like the love parade other locations were floated and members of obama 's team were reported to be in berlin last week scouting out alternatives .
the decision to choose the victory column , a 226-foot pillar topped by a gold angel , has itself opened up a small controversy , with some politicians complaining that the site recalls germany 's nazi past and prussia 's militaristic tradition . the monument was built in 1864 to commemorate prussia 's victory over denmark .
it was later moved by adolf hitler from its site near to reichstag to its current position about one mile west in the middle of the tiergarten park . but many berliners today probably associate it more with having a good time , since for years it was the destination of the love parade techno party .
it is also where berlin 's gay and lesbian pride event , christopher street day , is held . it 's the party link that is more likely going through german minds for the event this thursday .
huge crowds are expected , especially since the speech is being likened by many to john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " performance in 1963 . several hundred city police officers will be on duty for the event , but estimates on the number of people expected to come listen to obama are hard to come by .
the tagesspiegel daily quotes an official as saying the city expects between " 10,000 and one million . " euphoria now , disappointment later ? even though a recent series of interviews with germans in central berlin failed to find one single mccain backer , the support for obama in germany does not come without some reservations .

" obamania " in germany is now in full swing as the country awaits a political rock star . for monika staffel , wearing an " obama for president " button is nothing unusual , even though she 's a german citizen and wo n't be voting in the us presidential election this november .
this election is too important to stay on the sidelines , she said . " we are waiting urgently for change because bush has caused a lot of damage in the world , “ the 46-year-old from western germany said after visiting a stand two american obama supporters had set up in berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square . " now we want to know more about obama 's positions and we 're very sad that we ca n't be here in berlin on the 24th to listen to his speech , " she added .
" but we 'll be following it very closely in the media . " staffel reflects the views of many germans who are enthusiastic supporters of the presumptive democratic candidate , and are eagerly awaiting his appearance this thursday in berlin , when he will make a speech in front of berlin 's victory column . if the us presidential election were decided by german voters , obama could probably cut back on his breakneck campaign schedule .
a survey released by the pew research center showed that germans prefer the senator from illinois over the republican candidate , john mccain , by a 49 percent margin . building excitement " there is a great passion for a new america in europe and barack obama is the object of that adulation , " said robin hemingway , the founder of americans in berlin-brandenburg for obama , a group whose aim is to register as many americans as possible before the november elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrats abroad has been working to get americans in germany registered to vote while the excitement about obama has been bubbling for months , " obamania " has moved into high gear especially after the presumptive candidate announced his overseas trip with a stop in berlin . hemingway , 67 , said he has been contacted by people who are coming to berlin this week from german cities like frankfurt and rostock and places further afield such as prague and budapest .
they are not just american expats , he said , many germans are making the trip , too . " germans accept him like a rock-star , " he said .
" it 's like he made their favorite album and they want to come and see him .
i 've never seen that here before . " the group democrats abroad reports record high interest levels among americans .
over the last six months , its membership rolls have doubled , the organization said .
the berlin chapter said americans from the netherland and switzerland were coming to the speech , and to volunteer .
the chapter has been calling for members to help out with its voter registration drive at the event . location , location for weeks , germany has been consumed with the question of where obama will speak .
when the campaign requested having him talk in front of berlin 's brandenburg gate , chancellor angela merkel expressed reservations , fearing perhaps such a location would look like an endorsement of the democratic nominee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory column is now more often associated with fun of some sort - like the love parade other locations were floated and members of obama 's team were reported to be in berlin last week scouting out alternatives .
the decision to choose the victory column , a 226-foot pillar topped by a gold angel , has itself opened up a small controversy , with some politicians complaining that the site recalls germany 's nazi past and prussia 's militaristic tradition . the monument was built in 1864 to commemorate prussia 's victory over denmark .
it was later moved by adolf hitler from its site near to reichstag to its current position about one mile west in the middle of the tiergarten park . but many berliners today probably associate it more with having a good time , since for years it was the destination of the love parade techno party .
it is also where berlin 's gay and lesbian pride event , christopher street day , is held . it 's the party link that is more likely going through german minds for the event this thursday .
huge crowds are expected , especially since the speech is being likened by many to john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " performance in 1963 . several hundred city police officers will be on duty for the event , but estimates on the number of people expected to come listen to obama are hard to come by .
the tagesspiegel daily quotes an official as saying the city expects between " 10,000 and one million . " euphoria now , disappointment later ? even though a recent series of interviews with germans in central berlin failed to find one single mccain backer , the support for obama in germany does not come without some reservations .
the current euphoria could be short-lived when germans see that all of obama 's foreign policies are not to their liking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama stopped in afghanistan during this overseas trip , hoping to burnish his foreign policy credentials " he is young , dynamic , and has a lot of good ideas , " said marion violett , 55 , who was visiting berlin from duesseldorf .
" but this decision about afghanistan and putting more troops in there , that i ca n't understand and i do n't like at all . " still , if she could , she would vote for obama over mccain .
besides , she says , she does n't know much about the republican candidate . " in germany , every twist and turn obama makes is followed closely , " she said .
" but mccain is n't present in the media here at all . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

al-maliki will be in berlin on tuesday , july 22 , and is to meet german chancellor angela merkel .
" iraq needs germany on its side , " alaa al ashimy , iraqi ambassador to germany , said in an interview with deutsche welle .
european companies have long been eyeing opportunities in oil-rich iraq .
the european union is negotiating an energy pact with iraq , part of the bloc 's efforts to reduce dependence on russian oil and gas .
iraq has the world 's third largest proven reserves of oil and in june opened key producing fields to foreign investment .
" we 're talking to siemens , daimler and german firms involved in farming , oil and gas , " al-dabbagh said .
lucrative contracts beckon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-maliki , right , shakes with glos in baghdad last week , germany 's economy minister , michael glos , said one such company , wintershall , had a " big chance " of winning oil exploration rights in iraq .
it is part of chemicals group basf .
" i hope that it and other firms get more involved in extracting crude oil in iraq , " said glos on his way back from baghdad .
he was the first german cabinet minister to visit iraq since the us invasion of the country in 2003 .
asked if the time was ripe to invest in iraq , glos said : " i think so .
i felt in iraq that prime minister maliki has won the trust of the different ethnic groups .
it seems to me that he has managed to largely suppress the terrorists . "
a state-owned coach-assembly factory in the town of iskandariyah , about 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- south of the iraqi capital baghdad , is an example of those plants where the iraqi authorities would like to see german skills and money at work .
using dated machinery , only 450 people work now at a site that used to employ nearly 3,500 in its heyday under the late president saddam hussein .
baghdad has suggested to german carmaker daimler that it could be turning out gleaming mercedes-benz buses and trucks .
security remains a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide bombings are still a reality in iraq but iskandariyah is an edgy place .
in recent years , it was part of a zone of kidnappings and assassinations known as the death triangle , and german executives admit that they worry they could still be seized and held to ransom by criminals .
the german foreign ministry advises nationals to leave iraq immediately and not to trust the security forces whose capabilities are " limited " and loyalties " uncertain . "
those warnings have annoyed iraqi politicians , who insist the outlook is more positive .
al hashimy also said he thought government security warnings would n't keep germany from getting more involved in his country .
" the germans are patient and sceptical ; they think carefully before they make a decision .
but once they 've decided , then they act on their decision , and that 's the situation we 've reached now in 2008 , " he told deutsche welle .
as for the security warnings , glos himself took no chances during his visit .
he wore a bullet-proof vest and stayed in safe zones , though he later told the german daily die welt in an interview , " my impression is that the security situation is improving . "
a meeting with the pope from germany , al-maliki will travel to italy , which sent 3,000 troops to iraq after the us-led invasion in 2003 , but has since withdrawn them .
dabbagh said al-maliki would also meet pope benedict and brief him on the government 's measures to spread tolerance and national reconciliation among iraqis .

"
interest has been so overwhelming that the show has been extended to the end of august . the dank and musty walls of the former friedrichshoehe brewery in the youthful district of friedrichshain are currently plastered with garish , exotic and edgy art works , attracting visitors from all over europe . " some of the work is exciting , " said gina mellazini , a 19-year-old art student on holiday from bologna , " though not all of it rings a bell with me . " according to curator jochen kuepper , 70 percent of the art on display was created over a 72-hour period . " not until artists had completed their three-day projects were the public allowed in to see the results , " he said . cartoon-like figures hug one of the flaking walls .

nowadays , berlin rates as one of the best locations for street art and graffiti .
take a ride on an overhead commuter train , and graffiti accompanies you on both sides for miles and miles of your journey . " the whole city is a canvas , " kuepper said .
" it has so many walls , so many atmospheric buildings .
berlin 's become a magnet for artists who produce their art on concrete surfaces . " but what is the difference between street art and graffiti ? " many people started with graffiti , " kuepper said .
" the idea that you use the spray can in public spaces stems from graffiti , but now this wild form has grown boring and is n't understandable anymore . " " that 's why graffiti never reaches the galleries .
street art is something else - whether screens , murals , sculptures or installations - it has this fascinating wealth of forms , all rooted in the concept of ' urban art ' and influenced by avant-garde movements such as fluxus , pop art and conceptual art . " joining the establishment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition is pulling in the crowds unlike other cities which have demonized its urban artists , kuepper insists street art today is an integral staple of the berlin cultural scene and long regarded as hip . hollywood idols angelina jolie and brad pitt are great fans of street art .
a few months ago at they splashed out some 290,000 euros -lrb- $ 458,000 -rrb- for a stencil work by england artist banksy , considered one of the big names of the street art scene . kuepper says " street art " is gaining increasing global attention from the established art market , with work by its top exponents starting to break auction house records . el tono from spain is one of the participants in berlin .
the fact that he and his compatriot nano 4818 have been exhibiting at the tate modern 's street art show in london is proof for kuepper of the " staggering development and widespread notoriety of the anarchic art movement . " criminalized bildunterschrift : many artists work under pseudonyms most street artists hide their real identities behind pseudonyms - partly due to continuing criminalization of the art form in some regions .
in free-wheeling berlin , however , officials take a much more relaxed view . german artist el bocho takes to the berlin streets at night , carrying his hand-painted posters which he pastes on walls and abandoned properties .
sometimes he 's also seen attaching his cleverly designed tiles to buildings in the central mitte , prenzlauer berg and friedrichshain districts . el bocho says he 's never encountered problems with the law although he sometimes gets stopped by policemen asking what he 's doing wandering the streets at night . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

al-maliki will be in berlin on tuesday , july 22 , and is to meet german chancellor angela merkel .
" iraq needs germany on its side , " alaa al ashimy , iraqi ambassador to germany , said in an interview with deutsche welle .
european companies have long been eyeing opportunities in oil-rich iraq .
the european union is negotiating an energy pact with iraq , part of the bloc 's efforts to reduce dependence on russian oil and gas .
iraq has the world 's third largest proven reserves of oil and in june opened key producing fields to foreign investment .
" we 're talking to siemens , daimler and german firms involved in farming , oil and gas , " al-dabbagh said .
lucrative contracts beckon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-maliki , right , shakes with glos in baghdad last week , germany 's economy minister , michael glos , said one such company , wintershall , had a " big chance " of winning oil exploration rights in iraq .
it is part of chemicals group basf .
" i hope that it and other firms get more involved in extracting crude oil in iraq , " said glos on his way back from baghdad .
he was the first german cabinet minister to visit iraq since the us invasion of the country in 2003 .
asked if the time was ripe to invest in iraq , glos said : " i think so .
i felt in iraq that prime minister maliki has won the trust of the different ethnic groups .
it seems to me that he has managed to largely suppress the terrorists . "
a state-owned coach-assembly factory in the town of iskandariyah , about 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- south of the iraqi capital baghdad , is an example of those plants where the iraqi authorities would like to see german skills and money at work .
using dated machinery , only 450 people work now at a site that used to employ nearly 3,500 in its heyday under the late president saddam hussein .
baghdad has suggested to german carmaker daimler that it could be turning out gleaming mercedes-benz buses and trucks .
security remains a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide bombings are still a reality in iraq but iskandariyah is an edgy place .
in recent years , it was part of a zone of kidnappings and assassinations known as the death triangle , and german executives admit that they worry they could still be seized and held to ransom by criminals .
the german foreign ministry advises nationals to leave iraq immediately and not to trust the security forces whose capabilities are " limited " and loyalties " uncertain . "
those warnings have annoyed iraqi politicians , who insist the outlook is more positive .
al hashimy also said he thought government security warnings would n't keep germany from getting more involved in his country .
" the germans are patient and sceptical ; they think carefully before they make a decision .
but once they 've decided , then they act on their decision , and that 's the situation we 've reached now in 2008 , " he told deutsche welle .
as for the security warnings , glos himself took no chances during his visit .
he wore a bullet-proof vest and stayed in safe zones , though he later told the german daily die welt in an interview , " my impression is that the security situation is improving . "
a meeting with the pope from germany , al-maliki will travel to italy , which sent 3,000 troops to iraq after the us-led invasion in 2003 , but has since withdrawn them .
dabbagh said al-maliki would also meet pope benedict and brief him on the government 's measures to spread tolerance and national reconciliation among iraqis .
the pope has often called for an end to violence in iraq . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tischendorf , a religious scholar from leipzig , discovered the manuscript and persuaded the sinai monks to let him take part of it and later to give the bulk to russia . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" obamania " in germany is now in full swing as the country awaits a political rock star . for monika staffel , wearing an " obama for president " button is nothing unusual , even though she 's a german citizen and wo n't be voting in the us presidential election this november .
this election is too important to stay on the sidelines , she said . " we are waiting urgently for change because bush has caused a lot of damage in the world , “ the 46-year-old from western germany said after visiting a stand two american obama supporters had set up in berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square . " now we want to know more about obama 's positions and we 're very sad that we ca n't be here in berlin on the 24th to listen to his speech , " she added .
" but we 'll be following it very closely in the media . " staffel reflects the views of many germans who are enthusiastic supporters of the presumptive democratic candidate , and are eagerly awaiting his appearance this thursday in berlin , when he will make a speech in front of berlin 's victory column . if the us presidential election were decided by german voters , obama could probably cut back on his breakneck campaign schedule .
a survey released by the pew research center showed that germans prefer the senator from illinois over the republican candidate , john mccain , by a 49 percent margin . building excitement " there is a great passion for a new america in europe and barack obama is the object of that adulation , " said robin hemingway , the founder of americans in berlin-brandenburg for obama , a group whose aim is to register as many americans as possible before the november elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrats abroad has been working to get americans in germany registered to vote while the excitement about obama has been bubbling for months , " obamania " has moved into high gear especially after the presumptive candidate announced his overseas trip with a stop in berlin . hemingway , 67 , said he has been contacted by people who are coming to berlin this week from german cities like frankfurt and rostock and places further afield such as prague and budapest .
they are not just american expats , he said , many germans are making the trip , too . " germans accept him like a rock-star , " he said .
" it 's like he made their favorite album and they want to come and see him .
i 've never seen that here before . " the group democrats abroad reports record high interest levels among americans .
over the last six months , its membership rolls have doubled , the organization said .
the berlin chapter said americans from the netherland and switzerland were coming to the speech , and to volunteer .
the chapter has been calling for members to help out with its voter registration drive at the event . location , location for weeks , germany has been consumed with the question of where obama will speak .
when the campaign requested having him talk in front of berlin 's brandenburg gate , chancellor angela merkel expressed reservations , fearing perhaps such a location would look like an endorsement of the democratic nominee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory column is now more often associated with fun of some sort - like the love parade other locations were floated and members of obama 's team were reported to be in berlin last week scouting out alternatives .
the decision to choose the victory column , a 226-foot pillar topped by a gold angel , has itself opened up a small controversy , with some politicians complaining that the site recalls germany 's nazi past and prussia 's militaristic tradition . the monument was built in 1864 to commemorate prussia 's victory over denmark .
it was later moved by adolf hitler from its site near to reichstag to its current position about one mile west in the middle of the tiergarten park . but many berliners today probably associate it more with having a good time , since for years it was the destination of the love parade techno party .
it is also where berlin 's gay and lesbian pride event , christopher street day , is held . it 's the party link that is more likely going through german minds for the event this thursday .
huge crowds are expected , especially since the speech is being likened by many to john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " performance in 1963 . several hundred city police officers will be on duty for the event , but estimates on the number of people expected to come listen to obama are hard to come by .
the tagesspiegel daily quotes an official as saying the city expects between " 10,000 and one million . " euphoria now , disappointment later ? even though a recent series of interviews with germans in central berlin failed to find one single mccain backer , the support for obama in germany does not come without some reservations .
the current euphoria could be short-lived when germans see that all of obama 's foreign policies are not to their liking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama stopped in afghanistan during this overseas trip , hoping to burnish his foreign policy credentials " he is young , dynamic , and has a lot of good ideas , " said marion violett , 55 , who was visiting berlin from duesseldorf .
" but this decision about afghanistan and putting more troops in there , that i ca n't understand and i do n't like at all . " still , if she could , she would vote for obama over mccain .
besides , she says , she does n't know much about the republican candidate . " in germany , every twist and turn obama makes is followed closely , " she said .
" but mccain is n't present in the media here at all . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

al-maliki will be in berlin on tuesday , july 22 , and is to meet german chancellor angela merkel .
" iraq needs germany on its side , " alaa al ashimy , iraqi ambassador to germany , said in an interview with deutsche welle .
european companies have long been eyeing opportunities in oil-rich iraq .
the european union is negotiating an energy pact with iraq , part of the bloc 's efforts to reduce dependence on russian oil and gas .
iraq has the world 's third largest proven reserves of oil and in june opened key producing fields to foreign investment .
" we 're talking to siemens , daimler and german firms involved in farming , oil and gas , " al-dabbagh said .
lucrative contracts beckon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-maliki , right , shakes with glos in baghdad last week , germany 's economy minister , michael glos , said one such company , wintershall , had a " big chance " of winning oil exploration rights in iraq .
it is part of chemicals group basf .
" i hope that it and other firms get more involved in extracting crude oil in iraq , " said glos on his way back from baghdad .
he was the first german cabinet minister to visit iraq since the us invasion of the country in 2003 .
asked if the time was ripe to invest in iraq , glos said : " i think so .
i felt in iraq that prime minister maliki has won the trust of the different ethnic groups .
it seems to me that he has managed to largely suppress the terrorists . "
a state-owned coach-assembly factory in the town of iskandariyah , about 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- south of the iraqi capital baghdad , is an example of those plants where the iraqi authorities would like to see german skills and money at work .
using dated machinery , only 450 people work now at a site that used to employ nearly 3,500 in its heyday under the late president saddam hussein .
baghdad has suggested to german carmaker daimler that it could be turning out gleaming mercedes-benz buses and trucks .
security remains a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide bombings are still a reality in iraq but iskandariyah is an edgy place .
in recent years , it was part of a zone of kidnappings and assassinations known as the death triangle , and german executives admit that they worry they could still be seized and held to ransom by criminals .
the german foreign ministry advises nationals to leave iraq immediately and not to trust the security forces whose capabilities are " limited " and loyalties " uncertain . "
those warnings have annoyed iraqi politicians , who insist the outlook is more positive .
al hashimy also said he thought government security warnings would n't keep germany from getting more involved in his country .
" the germans are patient and sceptical ; they think carefully before they make a decision .
but once they 've decided , then they act on their decision , and that 's the situation we 've reached now in 2008 , " he told deutsche welle .
as for the security warnings , glos himself took no chances during his visit .
he wore a bullet-proof vest and stayed in safe zones , though he later told the german daily die welt in an interview , " my impression is that the security situation is improving . "
a meeting with the pope from germany , al-maliki will travel to italy , which sent 3,000 troops to iraq after the us-led invasion in 2003 , but has since withdrawn them .
dabbagh said al-maliki would also meet pope benedict and brief him on the government 's measures to spread tolerance and national reconciliation among iraqis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 21.07.2008 sarkozy : no " miracle " in eu treaty talks with irish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy took some heat from the irish after meeting with the irish prime minister brian cowen , french president nicolas sarkozy said there was " no miracle solution " to the impasse caused by the irish rejection of the european union 's lisbon treaty in june . sarkozy , speaking at a joint press conference with cowen , said he respected the vote of the irish people and denied meddling in irish affairs . the french president remained " convinced that with time the european union would find a way forward . " cowen said that ireland was at the start of a process of analysis and consultation and that a way would be found to " resolve the current difficulties " in a manner satisfactory to all 27 member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen said ireland needed time to move forward " we have to see how the concerns of those who voted no may or may not be addressed , he said , adding that he would stay in close contact with the french leader and that they would hold another meeting in september before cowen reported back to the european council in october . " we are not here to find a solution , but to make a statement of solidarity , " cowen said , stressing that time was needed to find the way forward . the french president said he " respected the outcome of the irish referendum , " but welcomed the fact that the ratification process was continuing in other member states and emphasized his commitment to the treaty . he said that he trusted cowen to find a solution to the problem . treaty opponents give sarkozy clear message after his meeting with sarkozy at government buildings earlier on monday , opposition fine gael leader enda kenny said he had " forcibly put it " to the french leader that " the issue of holding a second referendum was not going down well with the irish people . " leader of the labor party eamon gilmore said he told sarkozy that the lisbon treaty was dead and could not be put back to the irish people . " it did n't happen in france and why should it happen in ireland ? " he asked . gilmore told the french president that the " current impasse over the rejection of the treaty would not be resolved before next summer 's european elections . " protests in central dublin marked the visit from sarkozy , who is acting head of the eu since france took over the presidency on july 1 . over 200 fishermen protested at government buildings after handing out free fish in the center of dublin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen handed out free fish in an appeal for eu aid according to spokesman david kirwan , the fishermen wanted to send " a clear signal to sarkozy that fishermen were instrumental in securing a no vote in the lisbon reform treaty . "
unless fishermen received immediate aid , they would call for a no vote in any re-run of the referendum , he said . the irish farmers ' association president padraig walshe led a demonstration against the policies of european union trade commissioner , peter mandelson . walshe , who was part of a group who met sarkozy at the french embassy , said he would warn the french president that if the world trade organization deal currently on the table in geneva went ahead , it would " profoundly damage support in rural ireland for any future lisbon referendum . " some farmers outside government buildings had painted their tractors in the colors of the french flag to signal their solidarity with sarkozy despite their concerns about the wto talks .
one protestor was led away by irish police after throwing eggs at sarkozy as he arrived for his meeting with cowen . both sides meet at french embassy sarkozy also held round-table talks at the french embassy with groups who oppose and support the lisbon treaty . david begg , general secretary of the irish congress of trade unions , who attended the meeting , said that he " was n't willing to accept the view that because ireland had voted no , that was the end of it . " the visit was dogged by controversy after sarkozy privately told members of his union for a popular movement party -lrb- ump -rrb- this week that " the irish must vote again . " voters in ireland rejected the treaty to streamline the eu in a referendum june 12 . public forum cancelled due to french reservations the arrangements for the meeting at the embassy had also caused a diplomatic incident after labor party leader eamon gilmore declined an invitation to take part in the meeting at the french embassy .
he described the format allowing each participant to make a three-minute presentation to sarkozy as being " pointless " and showing a degree of " arrogance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libertas leader declan ganley on the campaign trail sarkozy 's visit , however , was extended at the last minute to accommodate one-to-one meetings with the two main opposition leaders . plans to hold a meeting in a public forum were scrapped , reportedly owing to the reservations of french officials , leading one irish analyst to describe the holding of the meeting at the french embassy as a " cold war tactic " of meeting " dissidents on home ground . " a representative of sinn fein , the only irish parliamentary party to campaign for a no vote , also took part in the round-table talks .

but the sinai bible offers unique evidence of what greek-speaking christians read around the year 350 . the university , which owns 43 parchment sheets of the codex , has teamed up with the british library in london , which bought 347 sheets in 1933 from the soviet union , to release the online version . later the web site will include six sheets that are kept in st. petersburg , russia , and 38 sheets still in st. katherine 's monastery in the sinai peninsula , so that all 390 sheets along with a transcript and translations can be inspected by anyone . the text is written four columns to a sheet in uncial script with no spaces between the words .
tischendorf , a religious scholar from leipzig , discovered the manuscript and persuaded the sinai monks to let him take part of it and later to give the bulk to russia . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" euphoria now , disappointment later ? even though a recent series of interviews with germans in central berlin failed to find one single mccain backer , the support for obama in germany does not come without some reservations .
the current euphoria could be short-lived when germans see that all of obama 's foreign policies are not to their liking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama stopped in afghanistan during this overseas trip , hoping to burnish his foreign policy credentials " he is young , dynamic , and has a lot of good ideas , " said marion violett , 55 , who was visiting berlin from duesseldorf .
" but this decision about afghanistan and putting more troops in there , that i ca n't understand and i do n't like at all . " still , if she could , she would vote for obama over mccain .
besides , she says , she does n't know much about the republican candidate . " in germany , every twist and turn obama makes is followed closely , " she said .
" but mccain is n't present in the media here at all . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
interest has been so overwhelming that the show has been extended to the end of august . the dank and musty walls of the former friedrichshoehe brewery in the youthful district of friedrichshain are currently plastered with garish , exotic and edgy art works , attracting visitors from all over europe . " some of the work is exciting , " said gina mellazini , a 19-year-old art student on holiday from bologna , " though not all of it rings a bell with me . " according to curator jochen kuepper , 70 percent of the art on display was created over a 72-hour period . " not until artists had completed their three-day projects were the public allowed in to see the results , " he said . cartoon-like figures hug one of the flaking walls .
on another , a bare-chested man with a resigned facial expression carries a naked , seemingly lifeless , woman in his arms . berlin , street art capital bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vandalism , or enhancing the urban environment ?
nowadays , berlin rates as one of the best locations for street art and graffiti .
take a ride on an overhead commuter train , and graffiti accompanies you on both sides for miles and miles of your journey . " the whole city is a canvas , " kuepper said .
" it has so many walls , so many atmospheric buildings .
berlin 's become a magnet for artists who produce their art on concrete surfaces . " but what is the difference between street art and graffiti ? " many people started with graffiti , " kuepper said .
" the idea that you use the spray can in public spaces stems from graffiti , but now this wild form has grown boring and is n't understandable anymore . " " that 's why graffiti never reaches the galleries .
street art is something else - whether screens , murals , sculptures or installations - it has this fascinating wealth of forms , all rooted in the concept of ' urban art ' and influenced by avant-garde movements such as fluxus , pop art and conceptual art . " joining the establishment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition is pulling in the crowds unlike other cities which have demonized its urban artists , kuepper insists street art today is an integral staple of the berlin cultural scene and long regarded as hip . hollywood idols angelina jolie and brad pitt are great fans of street art .
a few months ago at they splashed out some 290,000 euros -lrb- $ 458,000 -rrb- for a stencil work by england artist banksy , considered one of the big names of the street art scene . kuepper says " street art " is gaining increasing global attention from the established art market , with work by its top exponents starting to break auction house records . el tono from spain is one of the participants in berlin .
the fact that he and his compatriot nano 4818 have been exhibiting at the tate modern 's street art show in london is proof for kuepper of the " staggering development and widespread notoriety of the anarchic art movement . " criminalized bildunterschrift : many artists work under pseudonyms most street artists hide their real identities behind pseudonyms - partly due to continuing criminalization of the art form in some regions .
in free-wheeling berlin , however , officials take a much more relaxed view . german artist el bocho takes to the berlin streets at night , carrying his hand-painted posters which he pastes on walls and abandoned properties .
sometimes he 's also seen attaching his cleverly designed tiles to buildings in the central mitte , prenzlauer berg and friedrichshain districts . el bocho says he 's never encountered problems with the law although he sometimes gets stopped by policemen asking what he 's doing wandering the streets at night . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these include venues admitting under-18s , promoting alcohol with cut-price offers and serving people who are " blatantly intoxicated " .
the study , drawn up by auditors kpmg , concludes that the industry 's voluntary code is " not fit for purpose " .
the home office said it would introduce legislation if standards were not met .
' encouraged drunkenness ' to prepare the report , a team of researchers visited nearly 600 pubs , bars , nightclubs , off-licences and supermarkets in england over a five-day period .
practices observed " frequently " by the survey teams included venues glamorising drinking by linking it with sexual imagery , djs inducing drinkers to consume more and customers being urged to drink faster through shots and shooters being " downed in one " .
observers repeatedly witnessed customers who were " swaying , stumbling , falling over , slurring their words and struggling to count out the correct money at the bar " being served more alcoholic drinks . "
it 's time for ministers to take ownership of the issue " frank soodeen alcohol concern in coventry , one chain venue " actively encouraged drunkenness through a drink-downing competition " , while a group of under-age girls was admitted to a nightclub after they were heard by door staff chanting their dates of birth .
cocktails were often given names associated with drugs , including one sold in newquay called liquid cocaine .
health and safety hazards including overcrowding , broken glass and spilled alcohol were common , as were incidents of anti-social behaviour such as fights , assaults and criminal damage .
the report found that the industry 's voluntarily agreed standards were not consistently adopted , applied or monitored .
" in the current trading climate the commercial imperative generally overrides adherence " to the code , it says .
it recommends strengthening the code , setting up a new regulatory body or mandatory regulation led by local government .
however , it found that supermarkets were complying more fully with the standards , by displaying signs encouraging sensible drinking , while most off-licences displayed age-challenging signs by tills .
frank soodeen , head of public affairs at alcohol concern , said that the report was " pretty definitive evidence " that voluntary regulation was not enough .
" it 's time for ministers to take ownership of the issue and more clearly outline bar managers ' responsibilities , " he said .
' marketed responsibly ' a home office spokesman said : " everyone - the alcohol industry , government , local authorities , the police and individuals - has a part to play to tackle alcohol harm .
" the government has made it clear that alcohol must be sold and marketed responsibly and that new legislation will be introduced if necessary if existing voluntary standards are not being met . "
the report , titled review of the social responsibility standards for the production and sale of alcoholic drinks , was commissioned by the home office in february 2008 .
the survey was carried out in coventry , hackney , harrogate , manchester , norfolk , tyneside , newquay and swindon .

the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- expressed " deep disappointment " at the detention of opposition leader aung san suu kyi .
and the organisation called for burma 's generals to hold " meaningful dialogue " with opposition figures .
burma 's rulers have shown few signs of opening up since joining asean in 1997 .
but the bloc is generally reluctant to speak out about the internal affairs of its member states - instead favouring quiet diplomacy .
the bbc 's jonathan head , at the singapore meeting , says this policy of constructive engagement appears to have run its course with the burmese generals .
' emboldened ' group meanwhile , burma 's foreign minister nyan win hinted on the fringes of the meeting that ms suu kyi could be freed in six months .
but the generals have released the nobel peace prize winner several times in the past - only to re-arrest her soon after .
she has now spent more than 12 of the last 18 years under house arrest .
asean 's recent mediation in the aftermath of the impact of cyclone nargis will also be on the agenda .
the organisation was praised for its role in convincing burma to allow international aid and aid workers into the country , overturning an initial ban on foreign help in the days after the cyclone struck .
our correspondent says the bloc 's success in matters relating to the cyclone may have influenced its bolder-than-usual approach to burma in singapore .
preventing conflict another issue the ministers are tackling is the escalating tension between two other member states - thailand and cambodia .
troops from both countries have been sent to a disputed border area containing the ancient temples of preah vihear .
on monday , asean called for " utmost caution and restraint " from both sides .
the foreign ministers will also discuss the bloc 's new charter , which supposedly enshrines respect for human rights and is expected to be signed by all members - even burma - by the end of the year .
but our correspondent says the rationale for this association has always been less about what it does than what it aims to prevent - conflict among its 10 member states and domination by powers like the united states , china and india .
and bigger regional issues on the sidelines of this summit - notably a meeting of foreign ministers from the six parties to the north korean nuclear talks - are still likely to overshadow anything that asean itself announces , he adds .
asean is composed of brunei , cambodia , indonesia , laos , malaysia , burma , the philippines , singapore , thailand and vietnam .

but these days the site is dominated by a huge tower of scaffolding , topped by a yellow mobile crane , which dwarfs king ezana 's obelisk , the one royal monument still standing . "
they were imagining the skyscrapers of the future " fisseha zibelo , ministry of culture inside the scaffolding lies part of the axum obelisk , looted by italian troops in 1937 during their brief occupation of abyssinia .
italy returned the 1,700-year-old monument in 2005 , after decades of negotiations between the two countries .
the obelisk , which weighs more than 150 tonnes , was taken back to ethiopia in three pieces .
now it is being restored and resurrected back in its original home .
unique at the moment an ugly fence of corrugated iron screens off the working area .
but if you get inside , you can see the first chunk of the rome obelisk already in place , in the centre of the scaffolding tower .
it has been firmly cemented into its new foundations , exactly where it stood in antiquity .
the remains of the old foundations lie nearby - huge blocks of stone cut to fit the base of the monument .
when the work is done they will be placed alongside so visitors can see the how things were done before the days of cranes and concrete .
the base of the column is a huge block of grey granite , carved - as if it was the ground floor of a tall building - with the unmistakable image of a door , complete with a ring-shaped door handle .
one of the most astonishing things about these monuments is that they appear to mimic the facades of multi-story buildings .
fisseha zibelo , from ethiopia 's ministry of culture , says this carving shows the imagination of the monuments ' creators .
" we know they had two- and three-storey buildings , because in axum there are big buildings with more than one storey , " he said , " but here they were imagining the skyscrapers of the future . "
the two other sections of the obelisk are still lying nearby on concrete supports .
it is a unique opportunity to get close to them , to see the sharp clarity of the details , nearly 2,000 years after they were first carved .
you can see the window frames of the imaginary building , and the round beam-ends protruding from the walls in characteristic axumite building style .
protective collar the middle section is due to be hoisted into place soon and is almost ready to go .
the work is being done by an italian firm , lattanzi .
site supervisor mauro cristini describes the whole project as experimental work .
" nobody anywhere has ever done anything like this . "
but he says that although the middle section is massively heavy , it is in good condition , solid apart from a mended break at one corner .
that is not the case with the upper section , which is much more fragile .
the slender peak of the column , with its famous curved top , was already broken , and was struck by lightning in rome , damaging it still further .
mr cristini 's workers are painting on a protective coating before fitting it with a strong collar - effectively a handle for the crane to hold onto while raising it into position .
the whole project to raise the obelisk has been quite controversial .
it was lying on the ground when the italians found it , and had been on the ground for centuries .
some archaeologists think it should have been replaced in that position .
not only is there the risk of damage to the obelisk itself during the work , but they worry that the new foundations could disturb the complex of underground tombs which lies beneath the monuments , and which has only recently begun to be explored . "
the circle is closed now " mauro cristini site supervisor and then there is the risk to king ezana 's column , the one carved royal monument which has stood since antiquity , and which is very close to the construction works .
it already leans at a slight angle , and has been braced with steel hawsers to prevent it being damaged by the vibration caused by the heavy equipment .
it is regularly monitored , and mr cristini says that although some slight movement has been recorded , it has not been enough to cause concern .
the whole team - ethiopian and italian - are impatient to see the obelisk finally in place .
the last section should be placed in position in early august , ready for an official ceremony on the fourth of september , just before the end of ethiopia 's millennium year .
pride of place " this monument was made by our ancestors " says fisseha zibelo .
" it 's only in axum that this kind of monument was made , so for us , it is a matter of pride and mark of our identity . "
as for mr cristini , he says for him this is a little bit of history .

they were imagining the skyscrapers of the future fisseha zibelo , ministry of culture inside the scaffolding lies part of the axum obelisk , looted by italian troops in 1937 during their brief occupation of abyssinia .
italy returned the 1,700-year-old monument in 2005 , after decades of negotiations between the two countries .
the obelisk , which weighs more than 150 tonnes , was taken back to ethiopia in three pieces .
now it is being restored and resurrected back in its original home .
unique at the moment an ugly fence of corrugated iron screens off the working area .
but if you get inside , you can see the first chunk of the rome obelisk already in place , in the centre of the scaffolding tower .
it has been firmly cemented into its new foundations , exactly where it stood in antiquity .
the remains of the old foundations lie nearby - huge blocks of stone cut to fit the base of the monument .
the great obelisk - the largest of all - still lies in the area when the work is done they will be placed alongside so visitors can see the how things were done before the days of cranes and concrete .
the base of the column is a huge block of grey granite , carved - as if it was the ground floor of a tall building - with the unmistakable image of a door , complete with a ring-shaped door handle .
one of the most astonishing things about these monuments is that they appear to mimic the facades of multi-story buildings .
fisseha zibelo , from ethiopia 's ministry of culture , says this carving shows the imagination of the monuments ' creators .
" we know they had two- and three-storey buildings , because in axum there are big buildings with more than one storey , " he said , " but here they were imagining the skyscrapers of the future . "
the two other sections of the obelisk are still lying nearby on concrete supports .
it is a unique opportunity to get close to them , to see the sharp clarity of the details , nearly 2,000 years after they were first carved .
you can see the window frames of the imaginary building , and the round beam-ends protruding from the walls in characteristic axumite building style .
protective collar the middle section is due to be hoisted into place soon and is almost ready to go .
the work is being done by an italian firm , lattanzi .
site supervisor mauro cristini describes the whole project as experimental work .
" nobody anywhere has ever done anything like this . "
but he says that although the middle section is massively heavy , it is in good condition , solid apart from a mended break at one corner .
that is not the case with the upper section , which is much more fragile .
the slender peak of the column , with its famous curved top , was already broken , and was struck by lightning in rome , damaging it still further .
mr cristini 's workers are painting on a protective coating before fitting it with a strong collar - effectively a handle for the crane to hold onto while raising it into position .
the whole project to raise the obelisk has been quite controversial .
it was lying on the ground when the italians found it , and had been on the ground for centuries .
some archaeologists think it should have been replaced in that position .
not only is there the risk of damage to the obelisk itself during the work , but they worry that the new foundations could disturb the complex of underground tombs which lies beneath the monuments , and which has only recently begun to be explored .
the circle is closed now mauro cristini site supervisor and then there is the risk to king ezana 's column , the one carved royal monument which has stood since antiquity , and which is very close to the construction works .
it already leans at a slight angle , and has been braced with steel hawsers to prevent it being damaged by the vibration caused by the heavy equipment .
it is regularly monitored , and mr cristini says that although some slight movement has been recorded , it has not been enough to cause concern .
the whole team - ethiopian and italian - are impatient to see the obelisk finally in place .
the last section should be placed in position in early august , ready for an official ceremony on the fourth of september , just before the end of ethiopia 's millennium year .
pride of place " this monument was made by our ancestors " says fisseha zibelo .
" it 's only in axum that this kind of monument was made , so for us , it is a matter of pride and mark of our identity . "
as for mr cristini , he says for him this is a little bit of history .

but these days the site is dominated by a huge tower of scaffolding , topped by a yellow mobile crane , which dwarfs king ezana 's obelisk , the one royal monument still standing .
they were imagining the skyscrapers of the future fisseha zibelo , ministry of culture inside the scaffolding lies part of the axum obelisk , looted by italian troops in 1937 during their brief occupation of abyssinia .
italy returned the 1,700-year-old monument in 2005 , after decades of negotiations between the two countries .
the obelisk , which weighs more than 150 tonnes , was taken back to ethiopia in three pieces .
now it is being restored and resurrected back in its original home .
unique at the moment an ugly fence of corrugated iron screens off the working area .
but if you get inside , you can see the first chunk of the rome obelisk already in place , in the centre of the scaffolding tower .
it has been firmly cemented into its new foundations , exactly where it stood in antiquity .
the remains of the old foundations lie nearby - huge blocks of stone cut to fit the base of the monument .
the great obelisk - the largest of all - still lies in the area when the work is done they will be placed alongside so visitors can see the how things were done before the days of cranes and concrete .
the base of the column is a huge block of grey granite , carved - as if it was the ground floor of a tall building - with the unmistakable image of a door , complete with a ring-shaped door handle .
one of the most astonishing things about these monuments is that they appear to mimic the facades of multi-story buildings .
fisseha zibelo , from ethiopia 's ministry of culture , says this carving shows the imagination of the monuments ' creators .
" we know they had two- and three-storey buildings , because in axum there are big buildings with more than one storey , " he said , " but here they were imagining the skyscrapers of the future . "
the two other sections of the obelisk are still lying nearby on concrete supports .
it is a unique opportunity to get close to them , to see the sharp clarity of the details , nearly 2,000 years after they were first carved .
you can see the window frames of the imaginary building , and the round beam-ends protruding from the walls in characteristic axumite building style .
protective collar the middle section is due to be hoisted into place soon and is almost ready to go .
the work is being done by an italian firm , lattanzi .
site supervisor mauro cristini describes the whole project as experimental work .
" nobody anywhere has ever done anything like this . "
but he says that although the middle section is massively heavy , it is in good condition , solid apart from a mended break at one corner .
that is not the case with the upper section , which is much more fragile .
the slender peak of the column , with its famous curved top , was already broken , and was struck by lightning in rome , damaging it still further .
mr cristini 's workers are painting on a protective coating before fitting it with a strong collar - effectively a handle for the crane to hold onto while raising it into position .
the whole project to raise the obelisk has been quite controversial .
it was lying on the ground when the italians found it , and had been on the ground for centuries .
some archaeologists think it should have been replaced in that position .
not only is there the risk of damage to the obelisk itself during the work , but they worry that the new foundations could disturb the complex of underground tombs which lies beneath the monuments , and which has only recently begun to be explored .
the circle is closed now mauro cristini site supervisor and then there is the risk to king ezana 's column , the one carved royal monument which has stood since antiquity , and which is very close to the construction works .
it already leans at a slight angle , and has been braced with steel hawsers to prevent it being damaged by the vibration caused by the heavy equipment .
it is regularly monitored , and mr cristini says that although some slight movement has been recorded , it has not been enough to cause concern .
the whole team - ethiopian and italian - are impatient to see the obelisk finally in place .
the last section should be placed in position in early august , ready for an official ceremony on the fourth of september , just before the end of ethiopia 's millennium year .
pride of place " this monument was made by our ancestors " says fisseha zibelo .
" it 's only in axum that this kind of monument was made , so for us , it is a matter of pride and mark of our identity . "
as for mr cristini , he says for him this is a little bit of history .
" the circle is closed now , " he says .
" before it was on the ground , but now the people of ethiopia will be able to see it on its original site , so everything is going to be even better than before . "

the organisers of the annual bestival on the isle of wight are behind the inaugural three-day event .
despite problems with parking and camping on site , it is hoped the festival will return next year .
some people queued for up to three hours as organisers had to find extra parking and camping areas when the site filled up on friday .
extra toilets had to be found to cater for the new camp site after some complaints from people with children about a lack of facilities .

the ruling overturns an injunction to suppress the information won by nxp - makers of the travel smartcards used in london and many other cities .
the injunction was sought in june 2008 after dutch researchers demonstrated how to copy cards and travel free on the london underground .
the researchers plan to publish their research in october .
cracked cards the security weaknesses in the oyster card were discovered by prof bart jacobs and colleagues from radboud university , nijmegen in march 2008 .
the weaknesses centre on the chip , called the mifare classic , that sits at the heart of the contactless card system .
as well as being used on 17 million oyster cards , the mifare chip is used by about 1bn smartcards worldwide , and is the basis of the dutch rijkspas card .
many organisations , including governments , use mifare technology as a secure entry system for buildings .
given the many millions of cards in use prof jacobs held off publishing details about how the information on the chips can be copied and used .
it told the dutch government and nxp about its work to give them time to harden systems against the attack . "
assume organised crime knows about this , assume they will be selling it anyway " bruce schneier despite this , nxp sought an injunction to ensure the details of the attack would never be aired .
the case went to court in holland and now the court in arnhem has overturned the injunction citing local freedom of expression laws .
in its ruling , the court said : " damage to nxp is not the result of the publication of the article but of the production and sale of a chip that appears to have shortcomings . "
in a statement , radboud university hailed the ruling and said : " ... in a democratic society it is of great importance that the results of scientific research can be published " .
christophe duverne , a spokesman for nxp , told reuters that it would take months or years for some users of the chip to adapt their systems to defend against the attack .
" we do n't mind them publishing the effects of what they have discovered to inform society , i think this is absolutely fine , " he said .
" but disclosing things in detail including the algorithm ... is not going to benefit society , it will create damage to society . "
a spokesman for transport for london said : " transport for london remains confident in the security of the oyster card system .
we take fraud and the security of personal data extremely seriously and constantly review our security procedures . "
he added : " any fraudulent card would be identified within 24 hours of being used and blocked .
using a fraudulent card for free travel is subject to prosecution and we would seek to enforce this wherever possible . "
security expert bruce schneier said : " as bad as the damage is from publishing - and there probably will be some - the damage is much , much worse by not disclosing . "
mr schneier said it was a " dangerous assumption " to think that only the researchers know about weaknesses with mifare .
" assume organised crime knows about this , assume they will be selling it anyway , " he said .
information about the research will be published in a journal and shown at a security conference held in malaga .
the dutch group is one of three known to have cracked the mifare classic technology .
