but hamburg came back well to earn a deserved point in an entertaining game thanks to a paolo guerrero header and a piotr trochowski penalty . although there were plus points in the performance for klinsmann , injury-hit bayern were often second best to a bright hamburg side who under new coach martin jol sought to go forward from the start .
klinsmann said the bayern team had taken " a good step forward " but there was " a lot of work still to do . " " of course as coach you want three points in your first game , " he said .
" we had hoped to go 3-1 in front directly after the break but unfortunately hamburg got the penalty to make it 2-2 .
we had some problems in the first 10 or 15 minutes but managed to get two goals in front only to give it away .
the various parts of the team played better together and the fine tuning is coming along .
hamburg played well , had their chances and the result was a fair one . " we are still in the early phase and at the moment we are not in a position to put an opponent under pressure , " he added .
" our combination play is n't together yet but this will come automatically with improved fitness in the coming weeks .
we have to improve from week to week . " perfect beginning hamburg began strongly and the lively trochowski fired an 11th-minute cross-shot from the left which struck the post with michael rensing in goal beaten .
but the visitors were caught napping a minute later from a throw-in by philipp lahm who sent ze roberto down the left .
the brazilian cut the ball back and schweinsteiger raced in to drive the ball into the net . four minutes later bayern were awarded a penalty when dutch defender joris mathijsen had his arms around schweinsteiger , and podolski sent goalkeeper frank rost the wrong way from the spot kick . it was the perfect begin for bayern who were missing several injured first-choice players including france midfielder franck ribery , italy striker luca toni , turkey midfielder haltin altintop and argentina defender martin demechelis . however the shirt-sleeved klinsmann was often on the touchline with instructions as hamburg continued to use the ball well in midfield and find space to threaten an uncertain bayern defense . hamburg back in the game new captain david jarolim and trochowski , a former bayern player , more than adequately filled the gap created by the departure of rafael van der vaart to real madrid , with dutch international nigel de jong a firm anchor in defensive midfield . in the 25th minute , hamburg were back in the game when trochowski whipped in a cross from the right and former bayern striker guerrero was left unmarked to head the ball firmly down into the net . podolski had a glorious opportunity to put bayern further ahead but blasted the ball over the bar four minutes after the break , while hamburg came even closer a minute late when ivica olic struck the post . however the equalizer was n't long coming .
referee thorsten kinhoefer again pointed to the spot for a holding offence when bayern right-back christian lell was adjudged to have tugged at olic , and trochowski stepped up to coolly convert from the spot for the 57th-minute equalizer . jol said he was pleased with his team 's fightback . " when you are 2-0 behind you can be satisfied with the result , " he said .
" we should have been in front but were not careful and conceded the first goal .
it was disappointing to be 2-0 down but i think the penalty was ok . " the bundesliga continues with six matches on saturday and two on sunday . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in an interview with german newsmagazine der spiegel that was published saturday , aug .
16 , schroeder said that the georgian invasion of south ossetia was " the moment that initiated the current hostilities . " he declined to comment on whether russia 's response was disproportionate , saying that military conflicts developed their own dynamic . schroeder 's successor , chancellor angela merkel , friday described the russian reaction as " disproportionate in some aspects . " nato membership now far away bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder and putin are still friends the former chancellor , who was a close friend while of then russian prime minister vladimir putin during his seven years in office , said georgia 's bid for nato membership was now further off than before . " imagine that we had been forced into military action on the side of georgia as a nato member , on the side of an obvious gambler , as one must describe saakashvili , " schroeder said . " i do n't believe russia is pursuing a policy of annexation and i also do n't believe that there will be a return to the previous status quo for south ossetia and abkhazia , " schroeder said , referring to the separatist georgian regions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.08.2008 german business leader : 2008 will still be a good year großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are struggling to get new orders in an interview with dw-tv , martin wansleben , the ceo of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , says that pessimists might make germany 's current economic downturn worse than it actually is . dw-tv : mr. wansleben , the germans are infamous pessimists .
the glass is always half empty .
right now , the general mood when it comes to the economy seems to be negative .
what 's your feeling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin wansleben has been dihk 's ceo since 2001 martin wansleben : my personal feeling is that things are great .
we 've had problems like this in the past .
sometimes the business cycle experiences a downturn .
but we 're well advised to prepare for what 's coming and not just approach it assuming it 's all doom and gloom ahead . but we 're hearing horror stories .
people are talking about a recession in germany .
what do you think ? i 'm being cautious .
we 're used to evaluating economic growth from quarter to quarter .
we used to do it by looking back to the same quarter of the year before .
if we look at this year like that , then we saw 3 percent growth in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the previous year .
but if we compare -lrb- this year 's -rrb- second quarter to the first quarter , then growth is declining .
so , there is still growth , at least two percent or more this year .
that 's really not a recession . so you 're not worried about the german economy ? i 'm a bit worried about the general mood in germany and regarding the economy , about what decisions are being made .
but you could worry about things like that anytime .
and who does n't think that they personally , or other people , or society as a whole , should be doing more ? does that mean the mood is worse than reality ? i think that the mood is worse than we should actually expect as normal .
the economy has been doing really well for the past three years , so we should n't be too worried if it performs less well at some point .
but - and this is important - nor should we just lean back and say it 'll all work out .
we should be cautiously optimistic and work hard .
that way , even in an economic slump , we 'll be fine . so what do you think needs to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising gas prices have shocked germans , wansleben says the first thing is to look at the facts and the numbers as they really are .
and the second thing is , i think the government needs to realize that they ca n't just plod along till the next election in september next year .
somebody simply making trips abroad is n't going to help .
we need to make important decisions at home now .
and the same goes for the european level .
we 're coming up to a decisive moment for germany .
i can imagine that , with hindsight , we 'll look back to the early summer as a psychological turning point .
the energy prices gave us quite a shock .
with gas prices at 1.60 euros -lrb- $ 2.34 -rrb- a liter -lrb- quarter gallon -rrb- , many of us have paid 80 euros to fill up a 50-liter tank and just thought - what on earth is going on ?
i think germans are worried about who 's taking care of things .
ordinary people here might be feeling that members of the elite are only watching their own backs . and trying to protect their image perhaps ? image , or whatever else they have to protect .
but not pooling their knowledge to try and figure out what the problems are , or the challenges , and a joint approach .
that 's worrying , and that 's why there 's all this talk of doom and gloom .
so , now the talk of recession is spreading , just because of a bit of uncertainty and worry .
a few weeks or months ago it was about energy prices , and now it 's practically a yearning for a recession - so much yearning that it could practically cause one . but the low morale could also be caused by people having less money in their pockets .
high prices , and salaries not rising by as much as people expect in a strong economy .
is that a problem too ? i think that spending is key to that - how much money people have to spend .
and rising prices are part of that , as are energy and commodity prices . but the government ca n't do anything about that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even store rebates of 19 percent to shop tax free have n't helped much , it seems no , the government ca n't do anything about that .
back in 2006 it seemed like a good time to raise sales tax as the economy was booming .
many hoped the cycle of business would sort of wash over that fact and no-one would notice .
but now we have to accept that the rise in sales tax has been a real blow to the economy .
it was a big mistake .
it has to be corrected somehow .
also , we 're facing what economists call " cold progression . "
today , people who are earning only double the average income are already in the highest tax bracket .
a lot is being skimmed off by the state , but the state has n't been doing enough to figure out revenue policies that would put more money in people 's pockets .
it 's simply the wrong approach to think the budget can be balanced by taxes and fees . the whole of europe feels the results of the german economy weakening .
what effects do you think that will have ? first off , other european countries have already weakened , and even before germany started to feel the pinch … i think that the economic slowdown , as normal as it is , is becoming worse - partly because of energy and commodity prices , which are eroding purchasing power .
but also because of the financial crisis , which is hitting very close to home here .
a lot of assets have been wiped out , and financial opportunities for private investors , and leeway for the banks . but are the businesses that you represent already feeling the slump ?
are they noticeably less bullish ? yes , orders are decreasing .
it has n't affected the factories yet .
there are still plenty of orders , and they 're still producing at full throttle .
that 's why we 're not noticing anything different in the rate of growth at the moment .
and that 's why we have to be careful .
it could be that the economy will pull back , the euro will fall and oil prices will drop . is a weaker euro good ? it 'd be good if the euro stopped being overvalued .
that 's why it 's good that it 's falling right now .
but i 'm not sure about the idea the more the euro falls , the better .
that 's not always the case , so we need to watch out . and finally mr wansleben .
what is the current state of the german economy ?
is the glass half empty or half full ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's hoping things will go up again i think we 're right where you 'd expect us to be .
this year will still be a good year .
everyone knows things are going to get worse at some point .
now there are more and more signs that that will happen next year .
i think the most important thing is how the economy is structured , and it 's fine .
we 're really well represented globally .
germany is one of the very few countries in the world where middle-sized companies are independent on the world markets , and not beholden to bigger ones .
this international anchorage helps us to use all the possibilities out there : in russia or china , or india or south america .
i think it 's important to reiterate that . another thing is that over the past 10 to 15 years , german companies have learned a lot from the financial crisis of the early 1990s .
they 've left no stone unturned , their cost structures are totally different , and there 's a lot of innovation in processes and products . i do n't think that we need to be pessimistic right now .
as i 've said , what i 'm worried about is politicians choosing to stick with unproductive policies .
if the economics minister says it would actually be good to implement some reforms , but the majority does n't back them , that shows that even government officials can see the government is lagging behind on what 's actually important . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the glass is always half empty .
right now , the general mood when it comes to the economy seems to be negative .
what 's your feeling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin wansleben has been dihk 's ceo since 2001 martin wansleben : my personal feeling is that things are great .
we 've had problems like this in the past .
sometimes the business cycle experiences a downturn .
but we 're well advised to prepare for what 's coming and not just approach it assuming it 's all doom and gloom ahead . but we 're hearing horror stories .
people are talking about a recession in germany .
what do you think ? i 'm being cautious .
we 're used to evaluating economic growth from quarter to quarter .
we used to do it by looking back to the same quarter of the year before .
if we look at this year like that , then we saw 3 percent growth in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the previous year .
but if we compare -lrb- this year 's -rrb- second quarter to the first quarter , then growth is declining .
so , there is still growth , at least two percent or more this year .
that 's really not a recession . so you 're not worried about the german economy ? i 'm a bit worried about the general mood in germany and regarding the economy , about what decisions are being made .
but you could worry about things like that anytime .
and who does n't think that they personally , or other people , or society as a whole , should be doing more ? does that mean the mood is worse than reality ? i think that the mood is worse than we should actually expect as normal .
the economy has been doing really well for the past three years , so we should n't be too worried if it performs less well at some point .
but - and this is important - nor should we just lean back and say it 'll all work out .
we should be cautiously optimistic and work hard .
that way , even in an economic slump , we 'll be fine . so what do you think needs to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising gas prices have shocked germans , wansleben says the first thing is to look at the facts and the numbers as they really are .
and the second thing is , i think the government needs to realize that they ca n't just plod along till the next election in september next year .
somebody simply making trips abroad is n't going to help .
we need to make important decisions at home now .
and the same goes for the european level .
we 're coming up to a decisive moment for germany .
i can imagine that , with hindsight , we 'll look back to the early summer as a psychological turning point .
the energy prices gave us quite a shock .
with gas prices at 1.60 euros -lrb- $ 2.34 -rrb- a liter -lrb- quarter gallon -rrb- , many of us have paid 80 euros to fill up a 50-liter tank and just thought - what on earth is going on ?
i think germans are worried about who 's taking care of things .
ordinary people here might be feeling that members of the elite are only watching their own backs . and trying to protect their image perhaps ? image , or whatever else they have to protect .
but not pooling their knowledge to try and figure out what the problems are , or the challenges , and a joint approach .
that 's worrying , and that 's why there 's all this talk of doom and gloom .
so , now the talk of recession is spreading , just because of a bit of uncertainty and worry .
a few weeks or months ago it was about energy prices , and now it 's practically a yearning for a recession - so much yearning that it could practically cause one . but the low morale could also be caused by people having less money in their pockets .
high prices , and salaries not rising by as much as people expect in a strong economy .
is that a problem too ? i think that spending is key to that - how much money people have to spend .
and rising prices are part of that , as are energy and commodity prices . but the government ca n't do anything about that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even store rebates of 19 percent to shop tax free have n't helped much , it seems no , the government ca n't do anything about that .
back in 2006 it seemed like a good time to raise sales tax as the economy was booming .
many hoped the cycle of business would sort of wash over that fact and no-one would notice .
but now we have to accept that the rise in sales tax has been a real blow to the economy .
it was a big mistake .
it has to be corrected somehow .
also , we 're facing what economists call " cold progression . "
today , people who are earning only double the average income are already in the highest tax bracket .
a lot is being skimmed off by the state , but the state has n't been doing enough to figure out revenue policies that would put more money in people 's pockets .
it 's simply the wrong approach to think the budget can be balanced by taxes and fees . the whole of europe feels the results of the german economy weakening .
what effects do you think that will have ? first off , other european countries have already weakened , and even before germany started to feel the pinch … i think that the economic slowdown , as normal as it is , is becoming worse - partly because of energy and commodity prices , which are eroding purchasing power .
but also because of the financial crisis , which is hitting very close to home here .
a lot of assets have been wiped out , and financial opportunities for private investors , and leeway for the banks . but are the businesses that you represent already feeling the slump ?
are they noticeably less bullish ? yes , orders are decreasing .
it has n't affected the factories yet .
there are still plenty of orders , and they 're still producing at full throttle .
that 's why we 're not noticing anything different in the rate of growth at the moment .
and that 's why we have to be careful .
it could be that the economy will pull back , the euro will fall and oil prices will drop . is a weaker euro good ? it 'd be good if the euro stopped being overvalued .
that 's why it 's good that it 's falling right now .
but i 'm not sure about the idea the more the euro falls , the better .
that 's not always the case , so we need to watch out . and finally mr wansleben .
what is the current state of the german economy ?
is the glass half empty or half full ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's hoping things will go up again i think we 're right where you 'd expect us to be .
this year will still be a good year .
everyone knows things are going to get worse at some point .
now there are more and more signs that that will happen next year .
i think the most important thing is how the economy is structured , and it 's fine .
we 're really well represented globally .
germany is one of the very few countries in the world where middle-sized companies are independent on the world markets , and not beholden to bigger ones .
this international anchorage helps us to use all the possibilities out there : in russia or china , or india or south america .
i think it 's important to reiterate that . another thing is that over the past 10 to 15 years , german companies have learned a lot from the financial crisis of the early 1990s .
they 've left no stone unturned , their cost structures are totally different , and there 's a lot of innovation in processes and products . i do n't think that we need to be pessimistic right now .
as i 've said , what i 'm worried about is politicians choosing to stick with unproductive policies .
if the economics minister says it would actually be good to implement some reforms , but the majority does n't back them , that shows that even government officials can see the government is lagging behind on what 's actually important . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the glass is always half empty .
right now , the general mood when it comes to the economy seems to be negative .
what 's your feeling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin wansleben has been dihk 's ceo since 2001 martin wansleben : my personal feeling is that things are great .
we 've had problems like this in the past .
sometimes the business cycle experiences a downturn .
but we 're well advised to prepare for what 's coming and not just approach it assuming it 's all doom and gloom ahead . but we 're hearing horror stories .
people are talking about a recession in germany .
what do you think ? i 'm being cautious .
we 're used to evaluating economic growth from quarter to quarter .
we used to do it by looking back to the same quarter of the year before .
if we look at this year like that , then we saw 3 percent growth in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the previous year .
but if we compare -lrb- this year 's -rrb- second quarter to the first quarter , then growth is declining .
so , there is still growth , at least two percent or more this year .
that 's really not a recession . so you 're not worried about the german economy ? i 'm a bit worried about the general mood in germany and regarding the economy , about what decisions are being made .
but you could worry about things like that anytime .
and who does n't think that they personally , or other people , or society as a whole , should be doing more ? does that mean the mood is worse than reality ? i think that the mood is worse than we should actually expect as normal .
the economy has been doing really well for the past three years , so we should n't be too worried if it performs less well at some point .
but - and this is important - nor should we just lean back and say it 'll all work out .
we should be cautiously optimistic and work hard .
that way , even in an economic slump , we 'll be fine . so what do you think needs to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising gas prices have shocked germans , wansleben says the first thing is to look at the facts and the numbers as they really are .
and the second thing is , i think the government needs to realize that they ca n't just plod along till the next election in september next year .
somebody simply making trips abroad is n't going to help .
we need to make important decisions at home now .
and the same goes for the european level .
we 're coming up to a decisive moment for germany .
i can imagine that , with hindsight , we 'll look back to the early summer as a psychological turning point .
the energy prices gave us quite a shock .
with gas prices at 1.60 euros -lrb- $ 2.34 -rrb- a liter -lrb- quarter gallon -rrb- , many of us have paid 80 euros to fill up a 50-liter tank and just thought - what on earth is going on ?
i think germans are worried about who 's taking care of things .
ordinary people here might be feeling that members of the elite are only watching their own backs . and trying to protect their image perhaps ? image , or whatever else they have to protect .
but not pooling their knowledge to try and figure out what the problems are , or the challenges , and a joint approach .
that 's worrying , and that 's why there 's all this talk of doom and gloom .
so , now the talk of recession is spreading , just because of a bit of uncertainty and worry .
a few weeks or months ago it was about energy prices , and now it 's practically a yearning for a recession - so much yearning that it could practically cause one . but the low morale could also be caused by people having less money in their pockets .
high prices , and salaries not rising by as much as people expect in a strong economy .
is that a problem too ? i think that spending is key to that - how much money people have to spend .
and rising prices are part of that , as are energy and commodity prices . but the government ca n't do anything about that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even store rebates of 19 percent to shop tax free have n't helped much , it seems no , the government ca n't do anything about that .
back in 2006 it seemed like a good time to raise sales tax as the economy was booming .
many hoped the cycle of business would sort of wash over that fact and no-one would notice .
but now we have to accept that the rise in sales tax has been a real blow to the economy .
it was a big mistake .
it has to be corrected somehow .
also , we 're facing what economists call " cold progression . "
today , people who are earning only double the average income are already in the highest tax bracket .
a lot is being skimmed off by the state , but the state has n't been doing enough to figure out revenue policies that would put more money in people 's pockets .
it 's simply the wrong approach to think the budget can be balanced by taxes and fees . the whole of europe feels the results of the german economy weakening .
what effects do you think that will have ? first off , other european countries have already weakened , and even before germany started to feel the pinch … i think that the economic slowdown , as normal as it is , is becoming worse - partly because of energy and commodity prices , which are eroding purchasing power .
but also because of the financial crisis , which is hitting very close to home here .
a lot of assets have been wiped out , and financial opportunities for private investors , and leeway for the banks . but are the businesses that you represent already feeling the slump ?
are they noticeably less bullish ? yes , orders are decreasing .
it has n't affected the factories yet .
there are still plenty of orders , and they 're still producing at full throttle .
that 's why we 're not noticing anything different in the rate of growth at the moment .
and that 's why we have to be careful .
it could be that the economy will pull back , the euro will fall and oil prices will drop . is a weaker euro good ? it 'd be good if the euro stopped being overvalued .
that 's why it 's good that it 's falling right now .
but i 'm not sure about the idea the more the euro falls , the better .
that 's not always the case , so we need to watch out . and finally mr wansleben .
what is the current state of the german economy ?
is the glass half empty or half full ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's hoping things will go up again i think we 're right where you 'd expect us to be .
this year will still be a good year .
everyone knows things are going to get worse at some point .
now there are more and more signs that that will happen next year .
i think the most important thing is how the economy is structured , and it 's fine .
we 're really well represented globally .
germany is one of the very few countries in the world where middle-sized companies are independent on the world markets , and not beholden to bigger ones .
this international anchorage helps us to use all the possibilities out there : in russia or china , or india or south america .
i think it 's important to reiterate that . another thing is that over the past 10 to 15 years , german companies have learned a lot from the financial crisis of the early 1990s .
they 've left no stone unturned , their cost structures are totally different , and there 's a lot of innovation in processes and products . i do n't think that we need to be pessimistic right now .
as i 've said , what i 'm worried about is politicians choosing to stick with unproductive policies .
if the economics minister says it would actually be good to implement some reforms , but the majority does n't back them , that shows that even government officials can see the government is lagging behind on what 's actually important . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the ceasefire has to be verifiable and permanent , " german news agencies quoted a government spokesman as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , did n't mince words with medvedev merkel 's meeting with saakashvili comes two days after the chancellor met russian president dimitry medvedev in the black sea resort of sochi . the chancellor openly criticized russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori , saying it was " disproportionate in some aspects . " former chancellor blames georgia merkel underscored in the meeting with medvedev that " the basic point for any political solution to the conflict must be georgia 's territorial integrity . " on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that georgia 's territorial integrity and sovereignty could not be questioned . " georgia 's territorial integrity remains the basis of german policy , " steinmeier told newspaper welt am sonntag . he was referring to statements by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov who described calls to respect georgia 's territorial integrity as " just talk " that one " should forget . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schroeder , right , was and is good friends with russian prime minister putin steinmeier added that russia had crossed a limit with its bombardment of georgia proper but said it was pointless to assign blame in the conflict . his view was at odds with comments by former german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel , schroeder called president saakashvili a " gambler " and said he had triggered the war . the crisis began when georgia sent forces last week to retake south ossetia , a pro-russian province that threw off georgian rule in the 1990s .
moscow responded by sending troops into georgia . russia signs ceasefire medvedev meanwhile signed the six-point plan mediated by the european union earlier saturday in moscow .
saakashvili signed the document in tbilisi on friday in the presence of us secretary of state condoleezza rice . the agreement is not a peace settlement but provides the basis for a legally binding text to end the fighting and pave the way for a political solution .
the united nations security council is to formalize the six principles of the ceasefire . one of the key points is the withdrawal of russian armed forces to positions held before hostilities began in south ossetia . other points include renouncing violence , cessation of hostilities , granting access to humanitarian aid , the return of georgian armed forces to their usual quarters and the opening of international discussions on the future status of the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . the framework plan falls short of the original proposal by the eu presidency .
the draft had called for the " full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia " and the deployment of a eu or un monitoring mission . moscow , tiblisi locked in war of words despite the signing of the agreement by georgia and russia , the two sides are still engaged in a verbal war with claims and counter claims flying around . after the meeting with chancellor merkel on friday , medvedev made plain that russia would respond " in the same way " if it felt provoked again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says moscow would like to see him out in an interview with the german weekly der spiegel published saturday , saakashvili said moscow was determined to see his government toppled . russian leaders had told both sarkozy and rice that " there will be no agreement on resolving the conflict without my resignation , " saakashvili said . he accused russia of using the georgian military action in breakaway south ossetia as a pretext to march into the region .
" south ossetia is not the issue for russia , " he said .
" moscow wants to take over all of georgia . " on saturday , georgia accused russian troops of blowing up a railway bridge west of the capital tbilisi earlier in the day , saying its main east-west train link had been severed .
russia strongly denied any involvement . georgia said saturday that 182 people , including 67 civilians , had been confirmed dead in the conflict with russia .
georgian health minister alexander kvitashvili said his number of dead and wounded only included people in areas controlled by georgia .
he added there was evidence of mutilation of bodies . russian officials have said at least 2,000 people , mostly russian citizens , were killed in south ossetia , the breakaway region at the center of the conflict .
the figure has not been independently confirmed . bush accuses russia of " bullying " speaking in washington after the return of us secretary of state condoleeza rice from the caucasus , us president george w bush accused russia of " bullying " behavior in sending armored units into georgia and bombing georgian targets from the air . but bush admitted that some progress had been made by the signing of the french-brokered peace plan by russia and georgia . " now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations , " he said . bush has consistently held up georgia as a beacon of democracy in the caucasus .

" the eu has to deal with russia in a united manner , with determination and at the same time be ready for a dialogue , " poettering told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . poettering also warned against scrapping the eu 's strategic partnership with russia .

" the ceasefire has to be verifiable and permanent , " german news agencies quoted a government spokesman as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , did n't mince words with medvedev merkel 's meeting with saakashvili comes two days after the chancellor met russian president dimitry medvedev in the black sea resort of sochi . the chancellor openly criticized russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori , saying it was " disproportionate in some aspects . " former chancellor blames georgia merkel underscored in the meeting with medvedev that " the basic point for any political solution to the conflict must be georgia 's territorial integrity . " on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that georgia 's territorial integrity and sovereignty could not be questioned . " georgia 's territorial integrity remains the basis of german policy , " steinmeier told newspaper welt am sonntag . he was referring to statements by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov who described calls to respect georgia 's territorial integrity as " just talk " that one " should forget . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schroeder , right , was and is good friends with russian prime minister putin steinmeier added that russia had crossed a limit with its bombardment of georgia proper but said it was pointless to assign blame in the conflict . his view was at odds with comments by former german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel , schroeder called president saakashvili a " gambler " and said he had triggered the war . the crisis began when georgia sent forces last week to retake south ossetia , a pro-russian province that threw off georgian rule in the 1990s .
moscow responded by sending troops into georgia . russia signs ceasefire medvedev meanwhile signed the six-point plan mediated by the european union earlier saturday in moscow .
saakashvili signed the document in tbilisi on friday in the presence of us secretary of state condoleezza rice . the agreement is not a peace settlement but provides the basis for a legally binding text to end the fighting and pave the way for a political solution .
the united nations security council is to formalize the six principles of the ceasefire . one of the key points is the withdrawal of russian armed forces to positions held before hostilities began in south ossetia . other points include renouncing violence , cessation of hostilities , granting access to humanitarian aid , the return of georgian armed forces to their usual quarters and the opening of international discussions on the future status of the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . the framework plan falls short of the original proposal by the eu presidency .
the draft had called for the " full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia " and the deployment of a eu or un monitoring mission . moscow , tiblisi locked in war of words despite the signing of the agreement by georgia and russia , the two sides are still engaged in a verbal war with claims and counter claims flying around . after the meeting with chancellor merkel on friday , medvedev made plain that russia would respond " in the same way " if it felt provoked again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says moscow would like to see him out in an interview with the german weekly der spiegel published saturday , saakashvili said moscow was determined to see his government toppled . russian leaders had told both sarkozy and rice that " there will be no agreement on resolving the conflict without my resignation , " saakashvili said . he accused russia of using the georgian military action in breakaway south ossetia as a pretext to march into the region .
" south ossetia is not the issue for russia , " he said .
" moscow wants to take over all of georgia . " on saturday , georgia accused russian troops of blowing up a railway bridge west of the capital tbilisi earlier in the day , saying its main east-west train link had been severed .
russia strongly denied any involvement . georgia said saturday that 182 people , including 67 civilians , had been confirmed dead in the conflict with russia .
georgian health minister alexander kvitashvili said his number of dead and wounded only included people in areas controlled by georgia .
he added there was evidence of mutilation of bodies . russian officials have said at least 2,000 people , mostly russian citizens , were killed in south ossetia , the breakaway region at the center of the conflict .
the figure has not been independently confirmed . bush accuses russia of " bullying " speaking in washington after the return of us secretary of state condoleeza rice from the caucasus , us president george w bush accused russia of " bullying " behavior in sending armored units into georgia and bombing georgian targets from the air . but bush admitted that some progress had been made by the signing of the french-brokered peace plan by russia and georgia . " now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations , " he said . bush has consistently held up georgia as a beacon of democracy in the caucasus .

" the ceasefire has to be verifiable and permanent , " german news agencies quoted a government spokesman as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , did n't mince words with medvedev merkel 's meeting with saakashvili comes two days after the chancellor met russian president dimitry medvedev in the black sea resort of sochi . the chancellor openly criticized russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori , saying it was " disproportionate in some aspects . " former chancellor blames georgia merkel underscored in the meeting with medvedev that " the basic point for any political solution to the conflict must be georgia 's territorial integrity . " on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that georgia 's territorial integrity and sovereignty could not be questioned . " georgia 's territorial integrity remains the basis of german policy , " steinmeier told newspaper welt am sonntag . he was referring to statements by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov who described calls to respect georgia 's territorial integrity as " just talk " that one " should forget . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schroeder , right , was and is good friends with russian prime minister putin steinmeier added that russia had crossed a limit with its bombardment of georgia proper but said it was pointless to assign blame in the conflict . his view was at odds with comments by former german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel , schroeder called president saakashvili a " gambler " and said he had triggered the war . the crisis began when georgia sent forces last week to retake south ossetia , a pro-russian province that threw off georgian rule in the 1990s .
moscow responded by sending troops into georgia . russia signs ceasefire medvedev meanwhile signed the six-point plan mediated by the european union earlier saturday in moscow .
saakashvili signed the document in tbilisi on friday in the presence of us secretary of state condoleezza rice . the agreement is not a peace settlement but provides the basis for a legally binding text to end the fighting and pave the way for a political solution .
the united nations security council is to formalize the six principles of the ceasefire . one of the key points is the withdrawal of russian armed forces to positions held before hostilities began in south ossetia . other points include renouncing violence , cessation of hostilities , granting access to humanitarian aid , the return of georgian armed forces to their usual quarters and the opening of international discussions on the future status of the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . the framework plan falls short of the original proposal by the eu presidency .
the draft had called for the " full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia " and the deployment of a eu or un monitoring mission . moscow , tiblisi locked in war of words despite the signing of the agreement by georgia and russia , the two sides are still engaged in a verbal war with claims and counter claims flying around . after the meeting with chancellor merkel on friday , medvedev made plain that russia would respond " in the same way " if it felt provoked again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says moscow would like to see him out in an interview with the german weekly der spiegel published saturday , saakashvili said moscow was determined to see his government toppled . russian leaders had told both sarkozy and rice that " there will be no agreement on resolving the conflict without my resignation , " saakashvili said . he accused russia of using the georgian military action in breakaway south ossetia as a pretext to march into the region .
" south ossetia is not the issue for russia , " he said .
" moscow wants to take over all of georgia . " on saturday , georgia accused russian troops of blowing up a railway bridge west of the capital tbilisi earlier in the day , saying its main east-west train link had been severed .
russia strongly denied any involvement . georgia said saturday that 182 people , including 67 civilians , had been confirmed dead in the conflict with russia .
georgian health minister alexander kvitashvili said his number of dead and wounded only included people in areas controlled by georgia .
he added there was evidence of mutilation of bodies . russian officials have said at least 2,000 people , mostly russian citizens , were killed in south ossetia , the breakaway region at the center of the conflict .
the figure has not been independently confirmed . bush accuses russia of " bullying " speaking in washington after the return of us secretary of state condoleeza rice from the caucasus , us president george w bush accused russia of " bullying " behavior in sending armored units into georgia and bombing georgian targets from the air . but bush admitted that some progress had been made by the signing of the french-brokered peace plan by russia and georgia . " now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations , " he said . bush has consistently held up georgia as a beacon of democracy in the caucasus .
in a weekly radio address , bush said america would not leave georgia in the lurch and said the free world had to stand up for a threatened democracy which had decided in favor of freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has urged russia to honor the ceasefire and withdraw troops from georgia rice is to go to brussels next week to meet with nato foreign ministers and european union officials on the georgia crisis . asked about possible repercussions for russia , rice said there had already been consequences in the expression of " universal concern " on russia 's actions . " i think that russia will care about this talk because it is not just talk , it is about russia 's standing in the international community , " she said . poland says eu too soft on russia amid the flurry of diplomacy to end the conflict , the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering urged the eu to be united on the issue . " the eu has to deal with russia in a united manner , with determination and at the same time be ready for a dialogue , " poettering told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . poettering also warned against scrapping the eu 's strategic partnership with russia . " plans to isolate russia wo n't lead anywhere .
you ca n't isolate a member of the un security council . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski has pooh-poohed the idea of the eu having a common stance on russia however , polish president lech kaczynski on saturday accused paris and berlin of going too soft on russia because of their commercial ties with that country . in an interview , kaczynski said that european union policy was being decided by paris and berlin , without taking into consideration the views of the new eu members that were once under moscow 's control during the cold war .

mass discounters and high end luxury department stores however are not affected by the trend . there used to be a well-known commercial jingle in the retail business .
" kaufhof offers everything under one roof a thousand times . " department stores used to be a huge draw for shoppers in the inner cities .
but the whole concept in which all shopping needs could be met in one huge store does n't seem to be working anymore .
customers are abandoning the idea , and big chain department stores find themselves in financial straits these days . in the 1970s , 12 percent of all retail revenues landed in the coffers of nationwide chains such as karstadt , kaufhof , hertie and horten and co .
today department stores account for barely 3.5 percent of sales in the retail industry and market share keeps dipping . household names such as wehmeyer and hertie are fast disappearing , and wehmeyer 's former rival , the clothing chain sinn-leffers , recently declared bankruptcy .
even germany 's traditional chains such as karstadt and kaufhof are feeling the winds of change . german household names disappearing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertie , a german household name is barely surviving now already in the 1990s , department stores were experiencing the financial squeeze .
cash and carry discounters in the suburbs and countryside were cutting into their business .
that was when hertie and horten & co. had gone under . the hertie name made an attempted comeback under different management , but is insolvent again .
only about half of the 72 remaining hertie stores are expected to survive . interestingly , neither the mass discount chains nor the upscale , luxury department stores are hurting ; only the ones such as kaufhof and karstadt in the moderate price segment of the retail market . “ this loss in the middle segment has been creeping up over the last 15 years or so , " said marco atzberger of the retail research institute -lrb- ehi -rrb- in cologne , who explained that too little has been invested name recognition , product lines and giving the stores a facelift . " and such incremental developments are always the most dangerous , since you do n't notice them until it is too late to do something about it , ” he said . competition squeezes out traditional department store what 's missing in such middle range department stores is an ambiance that seduces shoppers .
otherwise they need to develop new retail concepts , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : department stores with high overhead can not compete with online vendors another problem is competition from the internet and the downward pressure on prices from online shopping .
the discerning german consumer , according to atzberger is very price conscious and department stores with their much high overhead costs would have a harder time offering bargains than a company selling goods online . at the high-end of the retail spectrum , luxury department stores in the best neighborhoods of big german cities such as kadewe in berlin or alsterhaus in hamburg offer a unique ambiance and are able to entice shoppers by appealing to their emotions rather than their pocketbook , he said . us style shopping mall comes to germany “ we are seeing more and more of the ‘ shop in shop ' concept , which means that a department store chain sublets space to a specialty stores such as wmf , which sells household goods and cookery or a clothing brand , " atzberger said .
" this concept is better known abroad than in germany .
and it works abroad . " bildunterschrift : there are roughly 400 shopping malls now , and the numbers keep rising in germany the decline of the department store has also been accelerated by the introduction of american style suburban shopping malls with numerous specialty shops all under one roof .
roughly 400 of such shopping centers now exist in all of germany and 15 more are expected to be opening their doors next year , according to atzberger 's retail institute . even the ownership structure of such retail space is different from the traditional department store .
financial groups invest in the real estate and hire a management team to rent out space to individual retailers . “ the management takes care of everything , " atzberger said .
" the opening hours are all coordinated with all the different stores , free parking space is provided for customers .

but hamburg came back well to earn a deserved point in an entertaining game thanks to a paolo guerrero header and a piotr trochowski penalty . although there were plus points in the performance for klinsmann , injury-hit bayern were often second best to a bright hamburg side who under new coach martin jol sought to go forward from the start .
klinsmann said the bayern team had taken " a good step forward " but there was " a lot of work still to do . " " of course as coach you want three points in your first game , " he said .
" we had hoped to go 3-1 in front directly after the break but unfortunately hamburg got the penalty to make it 2-2 .
we had some problems in the first 10 or 15 minutes but managed to get two goals in front only to give it away .
the various parts of the team played better together and the fine tuning is coming along .
hamburg played well , had their chances and the result was a fair one . " we are still in the early phase and at the moment we are not in a position to put an opponent under pressure , " he added .
" our combination play is n't together yet but this will come automatically with improved fitness in the coming weeks .
we have to improve from week to week . " perfect beginning hamburg began strongly and the lively trochowski fired an 11th-minute cross-shot from the left which struck the post with michael rensing in goal beaten .
but the visitors were caught napping a minute later from a throw-in by philipp lahm who sent ze roberto down the left .
the brazilian cut the ball back and schweinsteiger raced in to drive the ball into the net . four minutes later bayern were awarded a penalty when dutch defender joris mathijsen had his arms around schweinsteiger , and podolski sent goalkeeper frank rost the wrong way from the spot kick . it was the perfect begin for bayern who were missing several injured first-choice players including france midfielder franck ribery , italy striker luca toni , turkey midfielder haltin altintop and argentina defender martin demechelis . however the shirt-sleeved klinsmann was often on the touchline with instructions as hamburg continued to use the ball well in midfield and find space to threaten an uncertain bayern defense . hamburg back in the game new captain david jarolim and trochowski , a former bayern player , more than adequately filled the gap created by the departure of rafael van der vaart to real madrid , with dutch international nigel de jong a firm anchor in defensive midfield . in the 25th minute , hamburg were back in the game when trochowski whipped in a cross from the right and former bayern striker guerrero was left unmarked to head the ball firmly down into the net . podolski had a glorious opportunity to put bayern further ahead but blasted the ball over the bar four minutes after the break , while hamburg came even closer a minute late when ivica olic struck the post . however the equalizer was n't long coming .
referee thorsten kinhoefer again pointed to the spot for a holding offence when bayern right-back christian lell was adjudged to have tugged at olic , and trochowski stepped up to coolly convert from the spot for the 57th-minute equalizer . jol said he was pleased with his team 's fightback . " when you are 2-0 behind you can be satisfied with the result , " he said .
" we should have been in front but were not careful and conceded the first goal .
it was disappointing to be 2-0 down but i think the penalty was ok . " the bundesliga continues with six matches on saturday and two on sunday . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hundreds of british olympic officials preparing to host the olympic games in 2012 have been sent to china to learn from the beijing hosts how the chinese are organizing the event . british olympic officials will be meeting chinese organizers and visiting all the main locations in order to learn how to cope with tens of thousands of athletes , journalists and supporters .
referring to the beijing olympics , paul deighton , chief executive of the london organising committee of the olympic games -lrb- locog -rrb- , was quoted by british media as saying , " i 'm not sure how many other countries would have either the resources or the control of the resources to be able to put them behind an event like this . "
" i think london is much more likely to the model for the games in the future , " he said .
nevertheless , the officials will most probably be looking at how the host organizers deal with security and transport , especially since the july 7 , 2005 terrorist bombings on the london underground took place the day after it was announced that london had been chosen to host the olympics in 2012 .
growing criticism in london bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london mayor boris johnson wants a lasting legacy in an interview with the financial times newspaper , published tuesday aug .
12 , mayor of london boris johnson voiced his concerns that not enough work has been done to ensure the legacy of the games .
" there are … i think , serious questions to be asked about the legacy value of some of the sites and some of the venues , " johnson said .
" i want to make sure that we can alchemize them into gold for london for 50 years to come , and that is going to take some pretty crunchy work . "
after the huge delays in building the new wembley stadium and the squandered investments in the millenium dome , london 's olympic projects are being met with growing skepticism .
the opposition political parties have also criticized the decision to send so many officials to beijing , arguing that little is to be learned from china because of the huge difference in budgets .

by contrast it has been reported that , by the end of the games , china will have spent over 20 billion pounds -lrb- 25 billion euros , $ 39 billion -rrb- .
this has led to more general questions of whether it is at all useful to look to other countries ' examples when preparing to host the games .
officials in london have stressed the unique nature of each olympics based on the location and have also said how london has great potential to set its own standard .
boris johnson 's comments add to the concerns that the massive new building projects for the olympics may not provide lasting value for the poorer areas of east london where most of the sites are being built .
one of the main aims of hosting the olympics was to regenerate the area with a legacy of good sports facilities and more inspiration for young people to play sport .

hundreds of british olympic officials preparing to host the olympic games in 2012 have been sent to china to learn from the beijing hosts how the chinese are organizing the event . british olympic officials will be meeting chinese organizers and visiting all the main locations in order to learn how to cope with tens of thousands of athletes , journalists and supporters .
referring to the beijing olympics , paul deighton , chief executive of the london organising committee of the olympic games -lrb- locog -rrb- , was quoted by british media as saying , " i 'm not sure how many other countries would have either the resources or the control of the resources to be able to put them behind an event like this . "
" i think london is much more likely to the model for the games in the future , " he said .
nevertheless , the officials will most probably be looking at how the host organizers deal with security and transport , especially since the july 7 , 2005 terrorist bombings on the london underground took place the day after it was announced that london had been chosen to host the olympics in 2012 .
growing criticism in london bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london mayor boris johnson wants a lasting legacy in an interview with the financial times newspaper , published tuesday aug .
12 , mayor of london boris johnson voiced his concerns that not enough work has been done to ensure the legacy of the games .
" there are … i think , serious questions to be asked about the legacy value of some of the sites and some of the venues , " johnson said .
" i want to make sure that we can alchemize them into gold for london for 50 years to come , and that is going to take some pretty crunchy work . "
after the huge delays in building the new wembley stadium and the squandered investments in the millenium dome , london 's olympic projects are being met with growing skepticism .
the opposition political parties have also criticized the decision to send so many officials to beijing , arguing that little is to be learned from china because of the huge difference in budgets .
budgetary differences negate comparisons bildunterschrift : london is unlikely to be able to compete financially with the extravagance of beijing britain 's budget for the olympic games has already almost trebled from a predicted 3.4 billion pounds -lrb- 4.3 billion euros , $ 6.5 billion -rrb- to 9.3 billion pounds -lrb- $ 17.8 billion , 12 billion euros -rrb- .
by contrast it has been reported that , by the end of the games , china will have spent over 20 billion pounds -lrb- 25 billion euros , $ 39 billion -rrb- .
this has led to more general questions of whether it is at all useful to look to other countries ' examples when preparing to host the games .
officials in london have stressed the unique nature of each olympics based on the location and have also said how london has great potential to set its own standard .
boris johnson 's comments add to the concerns that the massive new building projects for the olympics may not provide lasting value for the poorer areas of east london where most of the sites are being built .
one of the main aims of hosting the olympics was to regenerate the area with a legacy of good sports facilities and more inspiration for young people to play sport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.08.2008 eu minister calls for closer russia ties after caucasus war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over dealing with a stronger , resurgent russia georgia and russia have accepted a french-brokered caucasus peace plan .
dw spoke to luxembourg 's foreign minister asselborn about the divisions within the eu on the conflict and dealing with an assertive russia . on wednesday this week , you spent several hours discussing the situation in the caucasus with your european colleagues .
there was talk of a european peace mission .
what exactly is this about ?
jean asselborn : that is an interesting question : how can the european union contribute ?
we need to be present in the country .
but how can we be present ?
we can think about two or three things now .
for example , we can act as a monitor by sending police organized under the european flag to follow the situation ..
but no troops , no soldiers ?
if there are troops - and this is the second thing i wanted to say - then i feel that needs to be decided within the framework of the united nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asselborn insists that a solid partnership with russia is essential where does the eu stand on the future status of the south ossetia and abkhazia provinces that officially belong to georgia ?
we have avoided talking about this and i will also avoid discussing it with you .
it 's one the points where we said that we as the european union will of course contribute in negotiations , in a sort of mediation or intervention .
and we have said from the very beginning what should happen with this .
in any case we are backing the integrity of georgian territory .
but were the eu foreign ministers in agreement about who is to blame for the conflict ?
no , we avoided the question of blame .
if we got bogged down in playing the blame game , we would have lost a lot of time .
we would have never agreed on anything and that would n't have solved anything anyhow .
we are not judges in the european union .
but some countries , the baltic states and poland in particular , have clearly demonstrated solidarity with georgia while the german foreign minister , for example , warned against judging russia too quickly .
what does this mean then for the planned new strategic partnership agreement between the eu and russia ?
i think it would be a fatal mistake to break off this partnership .
i do not find it 100 percent bad that the baltic states and poland have taken this stance .
but you could still see and feel that the eu presidency - currently held by france , it could have been another country speaking on behalf of the european union - is calling the shots .
bildunterschrift : and we also need to know that we have no political interest in ducking when the us and russia are involved in a verbal war .
we have to show that we are important in our own right .
we can do that with our solidarity which of course we then need to demonstrate .
the european union has more inhabitants than russia and the us put together .
we are a big player in the global economy .
politically too , we are a very important factor when we present a united front .
as the european union , we must stick to the partnership with russia , even after these recent events which of course do not please us .
we need to enhance this partnership so that one day we wo n't have these situations any more .
to what extent can the european union function efficiently and as a united force without the lisbon treaty ?
the european union can function coherently with regard to foreign policy even without the lisbon treaty .
and we also need to remember that with the lisbon treaty , nothing fundamental changes in the bloc 's foreign policy .
foreign policy will remain the most difficult area in the european union in the next ten years , even with the lisbon treaty .
european foreign policy is more than the adding-up of national interests .
it 's a question of political will , not about a treaty .
we need to work on that and we also need to judge ourselves based on that . interview : susanne henn -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke to luxembourg 's foreign minister asselborn about the divisions within the eu on the conflict and dealing with an assertive russia . on wednesday this week , you spent several hours discussing the situation in the caucasus with your european colleagues .
there was talk of a european peace mission .
what exactly is this about ?
jean asselborn : that is an interesting question : how can the european union contribute ?
we need to be present in the country .
but how can we be present ?
we can think about two or three things now .
for example , we can act as a monitor by sending police organized under the european flag to follow the situation ..
but no troops , no soldiers ?
if there are troops - and this is the second thing i wanted to say - then i feel that needs to be decided within the framework of the united nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asselborn insists that a solid partnership with russia is essential where does the eu stand on the future status of the south ossetia and abkhazia provinces that officially belong to georgia ?
we have avoided talking about this and i will also avoid discussing it with you .
it 's one the points where we said that we as the european union will of course contribute in negotiations , in a sort of mediation or intervention .
and we have said from the very beginning what should happen with this .
in any case we are backing the integrity of georgian territory .
but were the eu foreign ministers in agreement about who is to blame for the conflict ?
no , we avoided the question of blame .
if we got bogged down in playing the blame game , we would have lost a lot of time .
we would have never agreed on anything and that would n't have solved anything anyhow .
we are not judges in the european union .
but some countries , the baltic states and poland in particular , have clearly demonstrated solidarity with georgia while the german foreign minister , for example , warned against judging russia too quickly .
what does this mean then for the planned new strategic partnership agreement between the eu and russia ?
i think it would be a fatal mistake to break off this partnership .
i do not find it 100 percent bad that the baltic states and poland have taken this stance .
but you could still see and feel that the eu presidency - currently held by france , it could have been another country speaking on behalf of the european union - is calling the shots .
bildunterschrift : and we also need to know that we have no political interest in ducking when the us and russia are involved in a verbal war .
we have to show that we are important in our own right .
we can do that with our solidarity which of course we then need to demonstrate .
the european union has more inhabitants than russia and the us put together .
we are a big player in the global economy .
politically too , we are a very important factor when we present a united front .
as the european union , we must stick to the partnership with russia , even after these recent events which of course do not please us .
we need to enhance this partnership so that one day we wo n't have these situations any more .
to what extent can the european union function efficiently and as a united force without the lisbon treaty ?
the european union can function coherently with regard to foreign policy even without the lisbon treaty .
and we also need to remember that with the lisbon treaty , nothing fundamental changes in the bloc 's foreign policy .
foreign policy will remain the most difficult area in the european union in the next ten years , even with the lisbon treaty .
european foreign policy is more than the adding-up of national interests .
it 's a question of political will , not about a treaty .
we need to work on that and we also need to judge ourselves based on that . interview : susanne henn -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but you could still see and feel that the eu presidency - currently held by france , it could have been another country speaking on behalf of the european union - is calling the shots .
bildunterschrift : and we also need to know that we have no political interest in ducking when the us and russia are involved in a verbal war .
we have to show that we are important in our own right .
we can do that with our solidarity which of course we then need to demonstrate .
the european union has more inhabitants than russia and the us put together .
we are a big player in the global economy .
politically too , we are a very important factor when we present a united front .
as the european union , we must stick to the partnership with russia , even after these recent events which of course do not please us .
we need to enhance this partnership so that one day we wo n't have these situations any more .
to what extent can the european union function efficiently and as a united force without the lisbon treaty ?
the european union can function coherently with regard to foreign policy even without the lisbon treaty .
and we also need to remember that with the lisbon treaty , nothing fundamental changes in the bloc 's foreign policy .
foreign policy will remain the most difficult area in the european union in the next ten years , even with the lisbon treaty .
european foreign policy is more than the adding-up of national interests .
it 's a question of political will , not about a treaty .
we need to work on that and we also need to judge ourselves based on that . interview : susanne henn -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a controversial citizenship test in one german state especially caught their attention . members of the united nations committee for the eradication of racial discrimination -lrb- cerd -rrb- on friday , aug .
15 , said that they were concerned about citizenship application questions targeted at muslims in the southwestern german state of baden-wuerttemberg . " the committee recommends that the federal government encourage the use of questionnaires without discriminatory content , for all applicants for citizenship , " said the committee , according to afp news agency . baden-wuerttemberg , home to car maker daimler 's mercedes benz , apparently requires citizens of the 57 member states of the organization of the islamic conference to answer specific questions when they apply for german citizenship . german test also under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian edathy wants the citizenship test to be reworked a nationwide citizenship test which is to become compulsory for immigrants and includes questions seeking the applicant 's views on forced marriages and homosexuality has also come under criticism . earlier this week , sebastian edathy , the social democratic chairman of the parliament 's domestic affairs committee , asked the federal interior ministry to rework the test which is made up of 300 potential questions . edathy said that many questions had wrong multiple choice answers that were meant to be correct and that some questions were completely irrelevant for a citizenship test .
ministry officials have rejected the claim and said that the test in its present form will take effect next month . the un committee also described as " regrettable " that many migrants who have lived in germany for many years , still failed to get citizenship . " germany should facilitate acquisition of german citizenship by such long-term residents and persons born in germany in order to promote their integration , " the committee said . growing racism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minster wolfgang schaeuble created the islam conference to improve relations while cerd members applauded germany for introducing anti-discrimination legislation two years ago and setting up a so-called islam conference , they also criticized a growing number of racist incidents in germany , saying that the federal government was not doing enough to prevent them .
the committee found that jews , muslims , sinti and roma as well as african asylum seekers had been attacked . german justice ministry officials said that they would study the comments carefully , but stressed that germany was " actively engaged " in implementing eu anti-discrimination laws in germany .
germany 's national action plan against racism will be presented to the un high commissioner for human rights later this year . lack of integration ? in their report , cerd officials also wondered how germany wants to define itself as a " non-multi-ethnic state " as one fifth of the population has a migrant background and about 8 percent are foreigners without a german passport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people with migrant backgrounds have joined germany 's police pool cerd asked german officials to tell them whether these groups are integrated in agencies such as the police .
german officials , according to news reports , countered that the government 's policy was to " integrate , not assimilate " people with a migrant background . the anti-racism experts also bemoaned germany 's use of language when it comes to the law and officials agencies .
they also said that it was unfortunate that german law did n't see racist motives in connection with crimes as an aggravating factor .
cerd said that foreign victims of violence often receive less compensation money than germans . sinti and roma are in an especially bad position as they are discriminated against in the work place , in media coverage about them and when searching for apartments , cerd members said . the committee also criticized that children of asylum seekers in the states of hesse , baden-württemberg and saarland did not all attend school and that many children of migrant families had to attend special education schools . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a controversial citizenship test in one german state especially caught their attention . members of the united nations committee for the eradication of racial discrimination -lrb- cerd -rrb- on friday , aug .
15 , said that they were concerned about citizenship application questions targeted at muslims in the southwestern german state of baden-wuerttemberg . " the committee recommends that the federal government encourage the use of questionnaires without discriminatory content , for all applicants for citizenship , " said the committee , according to afp news agency . baden-wuerttemberg , home to car maker daimler 's mercedes benz , apparently requires citizens of the 57 member states of the organization of the islamic conference to answer specific questions when they apply for german citizenship . german test also under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian edathy wants the citizenship test to be reworked a nationwide citizenship test which is to become compulsory for immigrants and includes questions seeking the applicant 's views on forced marriages and homosexuality has also come under criticism . earlier this week , sebastian edathy , the social democratic chairman of the parliament 's domestic affairs committee , asked the federal interior ministry to rework the test which is made up of 300 potential questions . edathy said that many questions had wrong multiple choice answers that were meant to be correct and that some questions were completely irrelevant for a citizenship test .
ministry officials have rejected the claim and said that the test in its present form will take effect next month . the un committee also described as " regrettable " that many migrants who have lived in germany for many years , still failed to get citizenship . " germany should facilitate acquisition of german citizenship by such long-term residents and persons born in germany in order to promote their integration , " the committee said . growing racism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minster wolfgang schaeuble created the islam conference to improve relations while cerd members applauded germany for introducing anti-discrimination legislation two years ago and setting up a so-called islam conference , they also criticized a growing number of racist incidents in germany , saying that the federal government was not doing enough to prevent them .
the committee found that jews , muslims , sinti and roma as well as african asylum seekers had been attacked . german justice ministry officials said that they would study the comments carefully , but stressed that germany was " actively engaged " in implementing eu anti-discrimination laws in germany .
germany 's national action plan against racism will be presented to the un high commissioner for human rights later this year . lack of integration ? in their report , cerd officials also wondered how germany wants to define itself as a " non-multi-ethnic state " as one fifth of the population has a migrant background and about 8 percent are foreigners without a german passport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people with migrant backgrounds have joined germany 's police pool cerd asked german officials to tell them whether these groups are integrated in agencies such as the police .
german officials , according to news reports , countered that the government 's policy was to " integrate , not assimilate " people with a migrant background . the anti-racism experts also bemoaned germany 's use of language when it comes to the law and officials agencies .
they also said that it was unfortunate that german law did n't see racist motives in connection with crimes as an aggravating factor .
cerd said that foreign victims of violence often receive less compensation money than germans . sinti and roma are in an especially bad position as they are discriminated against in the work place , in media coverage about them and when searching for apartments , cerd members said . the committee also criticized that children of asylum seekers in the states of hesse , baden-württemberg and saarland did not all attend school and that many children of migrant families had to attend special education schools . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but hamburg came back well to earn a deserved point in an entertaining game thanks to a paolo guerrero header and a piotr trochowski penalty . although there were plus points in the performance for klinsmann , injury-hit bayern were often second best to a bright hamburg side who under new coach martin jol sought to go forward from the start .
klinsmann said the bayern team had taken " a good step forward " but there was " a lot of work still to do . " " of course as coach you want three points in your first game , " he said .
" we had hoped to go 3-1 in front directly after the break but unfortunately hamburg got the penalty to make it 2-2 .
we had some problems in the first 10 or 15 minutes but managed to get two goals in front only to give it away .
the various parts of the team played better together and the fine tuning is coming along .
hamburg played well , had their chances and the result was a fair one . " we are still in the early phase and at the moment we are not in a position to put an opponent under pressure , " he added .
" our combination play is n't together yet but this will come automatically with improved fitness in the coming weeks .
we have to improve from week to week . " perfect beginning hamburg began strongly and the lively trochowski fired an 11th-minute cross-shot from the left which struck the post with michael rensing in goal beaten .
but the visitors were caught napping a minute later from a throw-in by philipp lahm who sent ze roberto down the left .
the brazilian cut the ball back and schweinsteiger raced in to drive the ball into the net . four minutes later bayern were awarded a penalty when dutch defender joris mathijsen had his arms around schweinsteiger , and podolski sent goalkeeper frank rost the wrong way from the spot kick . it was the perfect begin for bayern who were missing several injured first-choice players including france midfielder franck ribery , italy striker luca toni , turkey midfielder haltin altintop and argentina defender martin demechelis . however the shirt-sleeved klinsmann was often on the touchline with instructions as hamburg continued to use the ball well in midfield and find space to threaten an uncertain bayern defense . hamburg back in the game new captain david jarolim and trochowski , a former bayern player , more than adequately filled the gap created by the departure of rafael van der vaart to real madrid , with dutch international nigel de jong a firm anchor in defensive midfield . in the 25th minute , hamburg were back in the game when trochowski whipped in a cross from the right and former bayern striker guerrero was left unmarked to head the ball firmly down into the net . podolski had a glorious opportunity to put bayern further ahead but blasted the ball over the bar four minutes after the break , while hamburg came even closer a minute late when ivica olic struck the post . however the equalizer was n't long coming .
referee thorsten kinhoefer again pointed to the spot for a holding offence when bayern right-back christian lell was adjudged to have tugged at olic , and trochowski stepped up to coolly convert from the spot for the 57th-minute equalizer . jol said he was pleased with his team 's fightback . " when you are 2-0 behind you can be satisfied with the result , " he said .
" we should have been in front but were not careful and conceded the first goal .
it was disappointing to be 2-0 down but i think the penalty was ok . " the bundesliga continues with six matches on saturday and two on sunday . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hundreds of british olympic officials preparing to host the olympic games in 2012 have been sent to china to learn from the beijing hosts how the chinese are organizing the event . british olympic officials will be meeting chinese organizers and visiting all the main locations in order to learn how to cope with tens of thousands of athletes , journalists and supporters .
referring to the beijing olympics , paul deighton , chief executive of the london organising committee of the olympic games -lrb- locog -rrb- , was quoted by british media as saying , " i 'm not sure how many other countries would have either the resources or the control of the resources to be able to put them behind an event like this . "
" i think london is much more likely to the model for the games in the future , " he said .
nevertheless , the officials will most probably be looking at how the host organizers deal with security and transport , especially since the july 7 , 2005 terrorist bombings on the london underground took place the day after it was announced that london had been chosen to host the olympics in 2012 .
growing criticism in london bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london mayor boris johnson wants a lasting legacy in an interview with the financial times newspaper , published tuesday aug .
12 , mayor of london boris johnson voiced his concerns that not enough work has been done to ensure the legacy of the games .
" there are … i think , serious questions to be asked about the legacy value of some of the sites and some of the venues , " johnson said .
" i want to make sure that we can alchemize them into gold for london for 50 years to come , and that is going to take some pretty crunchy work . "
after the huge delays in building the new wembley stadium and the squandered investments in the millenium dome , london 's olympic projects are being met with growing skepticism .
the opposition political parties have also criticized the decision to send so many officials to beijing , arguing that little is to be learned from china because of the huge difference in budgets .
budgetary differences negate comparisons bildunterschrift : london is unlikely to be able to compete financially with the extravagance of beijing britain 's budget for the olympic games has already almost trebled from a predicted 3.4 billion pounds -lrb- 4.3 billion euros , $ 6.5 billion -rrb- to 9.3 billion pounds -lrb- $ 17.8 billion , 12 billion euros -rrb- .
by contrast it has been reported that , by the end of the games , china will have spent over 20 billion pounds -lrb- 25 billion euros , $ 39 billion -rrb- .
this has led to more general questions of whether it is at all useful to look to other countries ' examples when preparing to host the games .
officials in london have stressed the unique nature of each olympics based on the location and have also said how london has great potential to set its own standard .
boris johnson 's comments add to the concerns that the massive new building projects for the olympics may not provide lasting value for the poorer areas of east london where most of the sites are being built .
one of the main aims of hosting the olympics was to regenerate the area with a legacy of good sports facilities and more inspiration for young people to play sport .

the brazilian cut the ball back and schweinsteiger raced in to drive the ball into the net . four minutes later bayern were awarded a penalty when dutch defender joris mathijsen had his arms around schweinsteiger , and podolski sent goalkeeper frank rost the wrong way from the spot kick . it was the perfect begin for bayern who were missing several injured first-choice players including france midfielder franck ribery , italy striker luca toni , turkey midfielder haltin altintop and argentina defender martin demechelis . however the shirt-sleeved klinsmann was often on the touchline with instructions as hamburg continued to use the ball well in midfield and find space to threaten an uncertain bayern defense . hamburg back in the game new captain david jarolim and trochowski , a former bayern player , more than adequately filled the gap created by the departure of rafael van der vaart to real madrid , with dutch international nigel de jong a firm anchor in defensive midfield . in the 25th minute , hamburg were back in the game when trochowski whipped in a cross from the right and former bayern striker guerrero was left unmarked to head the ball firmly down into the net . podolski had a glorious opportunity to put bayern further ahead but blasted the ball over the bar four minutes after the break , while hamburg came even closer a minute late when ivica olic struck the post . however the equalizer was n't long coming .
referee thorsten kinhoefer again pointed to the spot for a holding offence when bayern right-back christian lell was adjudged to have tugged at olic , and trochowski stepped up to coolly convert from the spot for the 57th-minute equalizer . jol said he was pleased with his team 's fightback . " when you are 2-0 behind you can be satisfied with the result , " he said .
" we should have been in front but were not careful and conceded the first goal .
it was disappointing to be 2-0 down but i think the penalty was ok . " the bundesliga continues with six matches on saturday and two on sunday . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hundreds of british olympic officials preparing to host the olympic games in 2012 have been sent to china to learn from the beijing hosts how the chinese are organizing the event . british olympic officials will be meeting chinese organizers and visiting all the main locations in order to learn how to cope with tens of thousands of athletes , journalists and supporters .
referring to the beijing olympics , paul deighton , chief executive of the london organising committee of the olympic games -lrb- locog -rrb- , was quoted by british media as saying , " i 'm not sure how many other countries would have either the resources or the control of the resources to be able to put them behind an event like this . "
" i think london is much more likely to the model for the games in the future , " he said .
nevertheless , the officials will most probably be looking at how the host organizers deal with security and transport , especially since the july 7 , 2005 terrorist bombings on the london underground took place the day after it was announced that london had been chosen to host the olympics in 2012 .
growing criticism in london bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london mayor boris johnson wants a lasting legacy in an interview with the financial times newspaper , published tuesday aug .
12 , mayor of london boris johnson voiced his concerns that not enough work has been done to ensure the legacy of the games .
" there are … i think , serious questions to be asked about the legacy value of some of the sites and some of the venues , " johnson said .
" i want to make sure that we can alchemize them into gold for london for 50 years to come , and that is going to take some pretty crunchy work . "
after the huge delays in building the new wembley stadium and the squandered investments in the millenium dome , london 's olympic projects are being met with growing skepticism .
the opposition political parties have also criticized the decision to send so many officials to beijing , arguing that little is to be learned from china because of the huge difference in budgets .
budgetary differences negate comparisons bildunterschrift : london is unlikely to be able to compete financially with the extravagance of beijing britain 's budget for the olympic games has already almost trebled from a predicted 3.4 billion pounds -lrb- 4.3 billion euros , $ 6.5 billion -rrb- to 9.3 billion pounds -lrb- $ 17.8 billion , 12 billion euros -rrb- .
by contrast it has been reported that , by the end of the games , china will have spent over 20 billion pounds -lrb- 25 billion euros , $ 39 billion -rrb- .
this has led to more general questions of whether it is at all useful to look to other countries ' examples when preparing to host the games .
officials in london have stressed the unique nature of each olympics based on the location and have also said how london has great potential to set its own standard .
boris johnson 's comments add to the concerns that the massive new building projects for the olympics may not provide lasting value for the poorer areas of east london where most of the sites are being built .
one of the main aims of hosting the olympics was to regenerate the area with a legacy of good sports facilities and more inspiration for young people to play sport .
neither boris johnson nor british prime minister gordon brown went to the opening ceremony in beijing , although both are going to the closing ceremony when the baton will be passed on to london . dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke to luxembourg 's foreign minister asselborn about the divisions within the eu on the conflict and dealing with an assertive russia . on wednesday this week , you spent several hours discussing the situation in the caucasus with your european colleagues .
there was talk of a european peace mission .
what exactly is this about ?
jean asselborn : that is an interesting question : how can the european union contribute ?
we need to be present in the country .
but how can we be present ?
we can think about two or three things now .
for example , we can act as a monitor by sending police organized under the european flag to follow the situation ..
but no troops , no soldiers ?
if there are troops - and this is the second thing i wanted to say - then i feel that needs to be decided within the framework of the united nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asselborn insists that a solid partnership with russia is essential where does the eu stand on the future status of the south ossetia and abkhazia provinces that officially belong to georgia ?
we have avoided talking about this and i will also avoid discussing it with you .
it 's one the points where we said that we as the european union will of course contribute in negotiations , in a sort of mediation or intervention .
and we have said from the very beginning what should happen with this .
in any case we are backing the integrity of georgian territory .
but were the eu foreign ministers in agreement about who is to blame for the conflict ?
no , we avoided the question of blame .
if we got bogged down in playing the blame game , we would have lost a lot of time .
we would have never agreed on anything and that would n't have solved anything anyhow .
we are not judges in the european union .
but some countries , the baltic states and poland in particular , have clearly demonstrated solidarity with georgia while the german foreign minister , for example , warned against judging russia too quickly .
what does this mean then for the planned new strategic partnership agreement between the eu and russia ?
i think it would be a fatal mistake to break off this partnership .
i do not find it 100 percent bad that the baltic states and poland have taken this stance .
but you could still see and feel that the eu presidency - currently held by france , it could have been another country speaking on behalf of the european union - is calling the shots .
bildunterschrift : and we also need to know that we have no political interest in ducking when the us and russia are involved in a verbal war .
we have to show that we are important in our own right .
we can do that with our solidarity which of course we then need to demonstrate .
the european union has more inhabitants than russia and the us put together .
we are a big player in the global economy .
politically too , we are a very important factor when we present a united front .
as the european union , we must stick to the partnership with russia , even after these recent events which of course do not please us .
we need to enhance this partnership so that one day we wo n't have these situations any more .
to what extent can the european union function efficiently and as a united force without the lisbon treaty ?
the european union can function coherently with regard to foreign policy even without the lisbon treaty .
and we also need to remember that with the lisbon treaty , nothing fundamental changes in the bloc 's foreign policy .
foreign policy will remain the most difficult area in the european union in the next ten years , even with the lisbon treaty .
european foreign policy is more than the adding-up of national interests .
it 's a question of political will , not about a treaty .

the nation has since long been scoring points in culture , but now the country is broke and is rethinking the preservation of cultural monuments . milan native simona cagno is worried about churches and historical palaces that are disintegrating all over italy right in front of her .
" i do n't know what i should say about this , " she said .
" i ca n't seem to find the words . "
private leasing and selling " instead of expensive restoration is now apparently the word from rome .
in other words : getting rid of monuments instead of holding onto them .

an historian , music scientist , writer and opera conductor , richard wagner 's great-grandson has been living in italy for almost 30 years .
the country has produced the greatest painters , composers and architects not just for europe , but for world history as well , wagner said .

has the cultural legacy been lost ?
silvio berlusconi would be more than happy to silence the skeptics in italy - whether they are judges , monument preservationists or artists .
there has n't been talk of an interesting cultural sector for a long time now .
" nothing considerable is taking place anymore that i would probably appreciate , " wagner said , adding that in the past , there was a real sense of excitement and now that no longer exists .

private sponsors carry the costs for this almost exclusively .
the ministry of cultural assets , which would normally take responsibility for the " last supper " did not have enough money .
now the situation is even more depressing .
not even 3 percent of italian households will donate money for the maintenance of monuments .
and the cutbacks that the berlusconi government passed via a finance decree leave the budget of the ministry of cultural assets even smaller .

" the ceasefire has to be verifiable and permanent , " german news agencies quoted a government spokesman as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , did n't mince words with medvedev merkel 's meeting with saakashvili comes two days after the chancellor met russian president dimitry medvedev in the black sea resort of sochi . the chancellor openly criticized russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori , saying it was " disproportionate in some aspects . " former chancellor blames georgia merkel underscored in the meeting with medvedev that " the basic point for any political solution to the conflict must be georgia 's territorial integrity . " on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that georgia 's territorial integrity and sovereignty could not be questioned . " georgia 's territorial integrity remains the basis of german policy , " steinmeier told newspaper welt am sonntag . he was referring to statements by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov who described calls to respect georgia 's territorial integrity as " just talk " that one " should forget . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schroeder , right , was and is good friends with russian prime minister putin steinmeier added that russia had crossed a limit with its bombardment of georgia proper but said it was pointless to assign blame in the conflict . his view was at odds with comments by former german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel , schroeder called president saakashvili a " gambler " and said he had triggered the war . the crisis began when georgia sent forces last week to retake south ossetia , a pro-russian province that threw off georgian rule in the 1990s .
moscow responded by sending troops into georgia . russia signs ceasefire medvedev meanwhile signed the six-point plan mediated by the european union earlier saturday in moscow .

the united nations security council is to formalize the six principles of the ceasefire . one of the key points is the withdrawal of russian armed forces to positions held before hostilities began in south ossetia . other points include renouncing violence , cessation of hostilities , granting access to humanitarian aid , the return of georgian armed forces to their usual quarters and the opening of international discussions on the future status of the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . the framework plan falls short of the original proposal by the eu presidency .

" south ossetia is not the issue for russia , " he said .
" moscow wants to take over all of georgia . " on saturday , georgia accused russian troops of blowing up a railway bridge west of the capital tbilisi earlier in the day , saying its main east-west train link had been severed .
russia strongly denied any involvement . georgia said saturday that 182 people , including 67 civilians , had been confirmed dead in the conflict with russia .
georgian health minister alexander kvitashvili said his number of dead and wounded only included people in areas controlled by georgia .
he added there was evidence of mutilation of bodies . russian officials have said at least 2,000 people , mostly russian citizens , were killed in south ossetia , the breakaway region at the center of the conflict .
the figure has not been independently confirmed . bush accuses russia of " bullying " speaking in washington after the return of us secretary of state condoleeza rice from the caucasus , us president george w bush accused russia of " bullying " behavior in sending armored units into georgia and bombing georgian targets from the air . but bush admitted that some progress had been made by the signing of the french-brokered peace plan by russia and georgia .

" in an interview with german newsmagazine der spiegel that was published saturday , aug .
16 , schroeder said that the georgian invasion of south ossetia was " the moment that initiated the current hostilities . " he declined to comment on whether russia 's response was disproportionate , saying that military conflicts developed their own dynamic . schroeder 's successor , chancellor angela merkel , friday described the russian reaction as " disproportionate in some aspects . " nato membership now far away bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder and putin are still friends the former chancellor , who was a close friend while of then russian prime minister vladimir putin during his seven years in office , said georgia 's bid for nato membership was now further off than before . " imagine that we had been forced into military action on the side of georgia as a nato member , on the side of an obvious gambler , as one must describe saakashvili , " schroeder said . " i do n't believe russia is pursuing a policy of annexation and i also do n't believe that there will be a return to the previous status quo for south ossetia and abkhazia , " schroeder said , referring to the separatist georgian regions .
" that is out of the question . "
georgia and ukraine , which is also seeking membership of the us-led western alliance , had to resolve their internal difficulties first , he told der spiegel . western errors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west needs russia , schroeder says schroeder said the west had make " serious errors " in its policy toward russia , and western views of russia did not correspond with the reality there . the former chancellor , who heads the shareholders ' committee of nord stream , the russian-german company building a pipeline under the baltic sea to pipe russian gas directly from russia to germany , dismissed talk of a new cold war . russian leaders were not interested in conflict with the west . " i think little of demonizing russia , and i believe moscow will soon see the need for greater integration into the international community , " schroeder said . no major global problem , whether iran 's nuclear program , north korea , peace in the middle east or climate change , could be resolved without russia , schroeder said .
he urged the european union to press ahead with plans to forge a " strategic partnership " pact with moscow , saying europe risked losing influence and pushing russia towards china if it did not work with the kremlin . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mass discounters and high end luxury department stores however are not affected by the trend . there used to be a well-known commercial jingle in the retail business .
" kaufhof offers everything under one roof a thousand times . " department stores used to be a huge draw for shoppers in the inner cities .
but the whole concept in which all shopping needs could be met in one huge store does n't seem to be working anymore .
customers are abandoning the idea , and big chain department stores find themselves in financial straits these days . in the 1970s , 12 percent of all retail revenues landed in the coffers of nationwide chains such as karstadt , kaufhof , hertie and horten and co .
today department stores account for barely 3.5 percent of sales in the retail industry and market share keeps dipping . household names such as wehmeyer and hertie are fast disappearing , and wehmeyer 's former rival , the clothing chain sinn-leffers , recently declared bankruptcy .
even germany 's traditional chains such as karstadt and kaufhof are feeling the winds of change . german household names disappearing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertie , a german household name is barely surviving now already in the 1990s , department stores were experiencing the financial squeeze .
cash and carry discounters in the suburbs and countryside were cutting into their business .
that was when hertie and horten & co. had gone under . the hertie name made an attempted comeback under different management , but is insolvent again .
only about half of the 72 remaining hertie stores are expected to survive . interestingly , neither the mass discount chains nor the upscale , luxury department stores are hurting ; only the ones such as kaufhof and karstadt in the moderate price segment of the retail market . “ this loss in the middle segment has been creeping up over the last 15 years or so , " said marco atzberger of the retail research institute -lrb- ehi -rrb- in cologne , who explained that too little has been invested name recognition , product lines and giving the stores a facelift . " and such incremental developments are always the most dangerous , since you do n't notice them until it is too late to do something about it , ” he said . competition squeezes out traditional department store what 's missing in such middle range department stores is an ambiance that seduces shoppers .
otherwise they need to develop new retail concepts , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : department stores with high overhead can not compete with online vendors another problem is competition from the internet and the downward pressure on prices from online shopping .
the discerning german consumer , according to atzberger is very price conscious and department stores with their much high overhead costs would have a harder time offering bargains than a company selling goods online . at the high-end of the retail spectrum , luxury department stores in the best neighborhoods of big german cities such as kadewe in berlin or alsterhaus in hamburg offer a unique ambiance and are able to entice shoppers by appealing to their emotions rather than their pocketbook , he said . us style shopping mall comes to germany “ we are seeing more and more of the ‘ shop in shop ' concept , which means that a department store chain sublets space to a specialty stores such as wmf , which sells household goods and cookery or a clothing brand , " atzberger said .
" this concept is better known abroad than in germany .
and it works abroad . " bildunterschrift : there are roughly 400 shopping malls now , and the numbers keep rising in germany the decline of the department store has also been accelerated by the introduction of american style suburban shopping malls with numerous specialty shops all under one roof .
roughly 400 of such shopping centers now exist in all of germany and 15 more are expected to be opening their doors next year , according to atzberger 's retail institute . even the ownership structure of such retail space is different from the traditional department store .

sometimes the business cycle experiences a downturn .
but we 're well advised to prepare for what 's coming and not just approach it assuming it 's all doom and gloom ahead . but we 're hearing horror stories .
people are talking about a recession in germany .
what do you think ? i 'm being cautious .
we 're used to evaluating economic growth from quarter to quarter .
we used to do it by looking back to the same quarter of the year before .
if we look at this year like that , then we saw 3 percent growth in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the previous year .
but if we compare -lrb- this year 's -rrb- second quarter to the first quarter , then growth is declining .
so , there is still growth , at least two percent or more this year .
that 's really not a recession . so you 're not worried about the german economy ? i 'm a bit worried about the general mood in germany and regarding the economy , about what decisions are being made .
but you could worry about things like that anytime .
and who does n't think that they personally , or other people , or society as a whole , should be doing more ? does that mean the mood is worse than reality ? i think that the mood is worse than we should actually expect as normal .
the economy has been doing really well for the past three years , so we should n't be too worried if it performs less well at some point .
but - and this is important - nor should we just lean back and say it 'll all work out .
we should be cautiously optimistic and work hard .
that way , even in an economic slump , we 'll be fine . so what do you think needs to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising gas prices have shocked germans , wansleben says the first thing is to look at the facts and the numbers as they really are .
and the second thing is , i think the government needs to realize that they ca n't just plod along till the next election in september next year .
somebody simply making trips abroad is n't going to help .
we need to make important decisions at home now .
and the same goes for the european level .
we 're coming up to a decisive moment for germany .
i can imagine that , with hindsight , we 'll look back to the early summer as a psychological turning point .
the energy prices gave us quite a shock .
with gas prices at 1.60 euros -lrb- $ 2.34 -rrb- a liter -lrb- quarter gallon -rrb- , many of us have paid 80 euros to fill up a 50-liter tank and just thought - what on earth is going on ?
i think germans are worried about who 's taking care of things .
ordinary people here might be feeling that members of the elite are only watching their own backs . and trying to protect their image perhaps ? image , or whatever else they have to protect .
but not pooling their knowledge to try and figure out what the problems are , or the challenges , and a joint approach .
that 's worrying , and that 's why there 's all this talk of doom and gloom .
so , now the talk of recession is spreading , just because of a bit of uncertainty and worry .
a few weeks or months ago it was about energy prices , and now it 's practically a yearning for a recession - so much yearning that it could practically cause one . but the low morale could also be caused by people having less money in their pockets .
high prices , and salaries not rising by as much as people expect in a strong economy .
is that a problem too ? i think that spending is key to that - how much money people have to spend .
and rising prices are part of that , as are energy and commodity prices . but the government ca n't do anything about that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even store rebates of 19 percent to shop tax free have n't helped much , it seems no , the government ca n't do anything about that .
back in 2006 it seemed like a good time to raise sales tax as the economy was booming .
many hoped the cycle of business would sort of wash over that fact and no-one would notice .
but now we have to accept that the rise in sales tax has been a real blow to the economy .
it was a big mistake .
it has to be corrected somehow .
also , we 're facing what economists call " cold progression . "
today , people who are earning only double the average income are already in the highest tax bracket .
a lot is being skimmed off by the state , but the state has n't been doing enough to figure out revenue policies that would put more money in people 's pockets .
it 's simply the wrong approach to think the budget can be balanced by taxes and fees . the whole of europe feels the results of the german economy weakening .
what effects do you think that will have ? first off , other european countries have already weakened , and even before germany started to feel the pinch … i think that the economic slowdown , as normal as it is , is becoming worse - partly because of energy and commodity prices , which are eroding purchasing power .
but also because of the financial crisis , which is hitting very close to home here .
a lot of assets have been wiped out , and financial opportunities for private investors , and leeway for the banks . but are the businesses that you represent already feeling the slump ?
are they noticeably less bullish ? yes , orders are decreasing .
it has n't affected the factories yet .
there are still plenty of orders , and they 're still producing at full throttle .
that 's why we 're not noticing anything different in the rate of growth at the moment .
and that 's why we have to be careful .
it could be that the economy will pull back , the euro will fall and oil prices will drop . is a weaker euro good ? it 'd be good if the euro stopped being overvalued .
that 's why it 's good that it 's falling right now .
but i 'm not sure about the idea the more the euro falls , the better .
that 's not always the case , so we need to watch out . and finally mr wansleben .
what is the current state of the german economy ?
is the glass half empty or half full ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's hoping things will go up again i think we 're right where you 'd expect us to be .
this year will still be a good year .
everyone knows things are going to get worse at some point .
now there are more and more signs that that will happen next year .
i think the most important thing is how the economy is structured , and it 's fine .
we 're really well represented globally .
germany is one of the very few countries in the world where middle-sized companies are independent on the world markets , and not beholden to bigger ones .
this international anchorage helps us to use all the possibilities out there : in russia or china , or india or south america .
i think it 's important to reiterate that . another thing is that over the past 10 to 15 years , german companies have learned a lot from the financial crisis of the early 1990s .
they 've left no stone unturned , their cost structures are totally different , and there 's a lot of innovation in processes and products . i do n't think that we need to be pessimistic right now .
as i 've said , what i 'm worried about is politicians choosing to stick with unproductive policies .
if the economics minister says it would actually be good to implement some reforms , but the majority does n't back them , that shows that even government officials can see the government is lagging behind on what 's actually important . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in an interview with german newsmagazine der spiegel that was published saturday , aug .
16 , schroeder said that the georgian invasion of south ossetia was " the moment that initiated the current hostilities .

" nato membership now far away bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder and putin are still friends the former chancellor , who was a close friend while of then russian prime minister vladimir putin during his seven years in office , said georgia 's bid for nato membership was now further off than before .

" i think little of demonizing russia , and i believe moscow will soon see the need for greater integration into the international community , " schroeder said . no major global problem , whether iran 's nuclear program , north korea , peace in the middle east or climate change , could be resolved without russia , schroeder said .
he urged the european union to press ahead with plans to forge a " strategic partnership " pact with moscow , saying europe risked losing influence and pushing russia towards china if it did not work with the kremlin . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the committee recommends that the federal government encourage the use of questionnaires without discriminatory content , for all applicants for citizenship , " said the committee , according to afp news agency . baden-wuerttemberg , home to car maker daimler 's mercedes benz , apparently requires citizens of the 57 member states of the organization of the islamic conference to answer specific questions when they apply for german citizenship . german test also under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian edathy wants the citizenship test to be reworked a nationwide citizenship test which is to become compulsory for immigrants and includes questions seeking the applicant 's views on forced marriages and homosexuality has also come under criticism . earlier this week , sebastian edathy , the social democratic chairman of the parliament 's domestic affairs committee , asked the federal interior ministry to rework the test which is made up of 300 potential questions . edathy said that many questions had wrong multiple choice answers that were meant to be correct and that some questions were completely irrelevant for a citizenship test .

german officials , according to news reports , countered that the government 's policy was to " integrate , not assimilate " people with a migrant background . the anti-racism experts also bemoaned germany 's use of language when it comes to the law and officials agencies .
they also said that it was unfortunate that german law did n't see racist motives in connection with crimes as an aggravating factor .
cerd said that foreign victims of violence often receive less compensation money than germans . sinti and roma are in an especially bad position as they are discriminated against in the work place , in media coverage about them and when searching for apartments , cerd members said . the committee also criticized that children of asylum seekers in the states of hesse , baden-württemberg and saarland did not all attend school and that many children of migrant families had to attend special education schools . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 16.08.2008 shopping malls replace old department stores in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxury retailers such as berlin 's kadewe are doing fine , but not ordinary department stores the ordinary department store is gradually disappearing in germany due to competition from online shopping and suburban malls .
mass discounters and high end luxury department stores however are not affected by the trend . there used to be a well-known commercial jingle in the retail business .
" kaufhof offers everything under one roof a thousand times . " department stores used to be a huge draw for shoppers in the inner cities .
but the whole concept in which all shopping needs could be met in one huge store does n't seem to be working anymore .
customers are abandoning the idea , and big chain department stores find themselves in financial straits these days . in the 1970s , 12 percent of all retail revenues landed in the coffers of nationwide chains such as karstadt , kaufhof , hertie and horten and co .
today department stores account for barely 3.5 percent of sales in the retail industry and market share keeps dipping . household names such as wehmeyer and hertie are fast disappearing , and wehmeyer 's former rival , the clothing chain sinn-leffers , recently declared bankruptcy .
even germany 's traditional chains such as karstadt and kaufhof are feeling the winds of change . german household names disappearing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertie , a german household name is barely surviving now already in the 1990s , department stores were experiencing the financial squeeze .
cash and carry discounters in the suburbs and countryside were cutting into their business .
that was when hertie and horten & co. had gone under . the hertie name made an attempted comeback under different management , but is insolvent again .
only about half of the 72 remaining hertie stores are expected to survive . interestingly , neither the mass discount chains nor the upscale , luxury department stores are hurting ; only the ones such as kaufhof and karstadt in the moderate price segment of the retail market . “ this loss in the middle segment has been creeping up over the last 15 years or so , " said marco atzberger of the retail research institute -lrb- ehi -rrb- in cologne , who explained that too little has been invested name recognition , product lines and giving the stores a facelift . " and such incremental developments are always the most dangerous , since you do n't notice them until it is too late to do something about it , ” he said . competition squeezes out traditional department store what 's missing in such middle range department stores is an ambiance that seduces shoppers .
otherwise they need to develop new retail concepts , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : department stores with high overhead can not compete with online vendors another problem is competition from the internet and the downward pressure on prices from online shopping .
the discerning german consumer , according to atzberger is very price conscious and department stores with their much high overhead costs would have a harder time offering bargains than a company selling goods online . at the high-end of the retail spectrum , luxury department stores in the best neighborhoods of big german cities such as kadewe in berlin or alsterhaus in hamburg offer a unique ambiance and are able to entice shoppers by appealing to their emotions rather than their pocketbook , he said . us style shopping mall comes to germany “ we are seeing more and more of the ‘ shop in shop ' concept , which means that a department store chain sublets space to a specialty stores such as wmf , which sells household goods and cookery or a clothing brand , " atzberger said .
" this concept is better known abroad than in germany .
and it works abroad . " bildunterschrift : there are roughly 400 shopping malls now , and the numbers keep rising in germany the decline of the department store has also been accelerated by the introduction of american style suburban shopping malls with numerous specialty shops all under one roof .
roughly 400 of such shopping centers now exist in all of germany and 15 more are expected to be opening their doors next year , according to atzberger 's retail institute . even the ownership structure of such retail space is different from the traditional department store .
financial groups invest in the real estate and hire a management team to rent out space to individual retailers . “ the management takes care of everything , " atzberger said .
" the opening hours are all coordinated with all the different stores , free parking space is provided for customers .
they take care of the retail mix to ensure that there is a wide range of stores that complement each other in terms of price range and variety .
that is one thing you do n't find in the inner cities , and a drawback for the city department store . " rolf wenkel -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nation has since long been scoring points in culture , but now the country is broke and is rethinking the preservation of cultural monuments . milan native simona cagno is worried about churches and historical palaces that are disintegrating all over italy right in front of her .
" i do n't know what i should say about this , " she said .
" i ca n't seem to find the words . "
private leasing and selling " instead of expensive restoration is now apparently the word from rome .
in other words : getting rid of monuments instead of holding onto them .
in verona , three palaces and one former convent are about to be auctioned off so that the city can afford a new parking garage for trade show visitors .
have the italian authorities lost their minds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's government is doing some belt-tightening in sicily , the region is planning to privately rent the world-famous temple of agrigento for the next 30 years .
" it just makes me scream and ask : ' how much further will italy sink ? " ' said gottfried wagner with disgust .
an historian , music scientist , writer and opera conductor , richard wagner 's great-grandson has been living in italy for almost 30 years .
the country has produced the greatest painters , composers and architects not just for europe , but for world history as well , wagner said .
" where will we end up if culture is only abused for political prostitution ? " he asked .
has the cultural legacy been lost ?
silvio berlusconi would be more than happy to silence the skeptics in italy - whether they are judges , monument preservationists or artists .
there has n't been talk of an interesting cultural sector for a long time now .
" nothing considerable is taking place anymore that i would probably appreciate , " wagner said , adding that in the past , there was a real sense of excitement and now that no longer exists .
" and this is the cultural and spiritual situation at the moment in italy and i could say this a thousand times over : it 's frightening , " he said .
trash instead of culture - what started in berlusconi 's television programs has since spread through the entire country .
italy , the cradle of the renaissance and of the communal city character , is trampling on its cultural legacy - a legacy that attracts millions of tourists to the country . no money for culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous constructions are set to be leased they marvel at leonardo da vinci 's last supper , for example , and most are overwhelmed by the 15th century mural painting 's beauty .
the fresco has been restored for 20 years to help stop its slow deterioration .
private sponsors carry the costs for this almost exclusively .
the ministry of cultural assets , which would normally take responsibility for the " last supper " did not have enough money .
now the situation is even more depressing .
not even 3 percent of italian households will donate money for the maintenance of monuments .
and the cutbacks that the berlusconi government passed via a finance decree leave the budget of the ministry of cultural assets even smaller .
" the funds for cultural assets and museums have degenerated like the political interest in culture , " said salvatore settis , italy 's most well-known monument preservationist .
the internationally-recognized art historian and director of the state-run ivy-league-type school " ecole normale " in pisa has calculated that the savings totaling 700 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- over three years mean less for the ministry of cultural assets . no sense of culture ?
in answer to the tentative question of where the minister should still make cuts , antonio leone from the governing party alliance " volk der freiheit " -lrb- people of freedom -rrb- said : " the minister must now set priorities .
the ministry received a certain budget and it has to make do with it . "
it is the minister 's job to make cuts where cuts can be made , and not to make cuts where they ca n't be made , he added . kirstin hausen -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the ceasefire has to be verifiable and permanent , " german news agencies quoted a government spokesman as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , did n't mince words with medvedev merkel 's meeting with saakashvili comes two days after the chancellor met russian president dimitry medvedev in the black sea resort of sochi . the chancellor openly criticized russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori , saying it was " disproportionate in some aspects . " former chancellor blames georgia merkel underscored in the meeting with medvedev that " the basic point for any political solution to the conflict must be georgia 's territorial integrity . " on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that georgia 's territorial integrity and sovereignty could not be questioned . " georgia 's territorial integrity remains the basis of german policy , " steinmeier told newspaper welt am sonntag . he was referring to statements by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov who described calls to respect georgia 's territorial integrity as " just talk " that one " should forget . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schroeder , right , was and is good friends with russian prime minister putin steinmeier added that russia had crossed a limit with its bombardment of georgia proper but said it was pointless to assign blame in the conflict . his view was at odds with comments by former german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel , schroeder called president saakashvili a " gambler " and said he had triggered the war . the crisis began when georgia sent forces last week to retake south ossetia , a pro-russian province that threw off georgian rule in the 1990s .
moscow responded by sending troops into georgia . russia signs ceasefire medvedev meanwhile signed the six-point plan mediated by the european union earlier saturday in moscow .
saakashvili signed the document in tbilisi on friday in the presence of us secretary of state condoleezza rice . the agreement is not a peace settlement but provides the basis for a legally binding text to end the fighting and pave the way for a political solution .
the united nations security council is to formalize the six principles of the ceasefire . one of the key points is the withdrawal of russian armed forces to positions held before hostilities began in south ossetia . other points include renouncing violence , cessation of hostilities , granting access to humanitarian aid , the return of georgian armed forces to their usual quarters and the opening of international discussions on the future status of the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . the framework plan falls short of the original proposal by the eu presidency .
the draft had called for the " full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia " and the deployment of a eu or un monitoring mission . moscow , tiblisi locked in war of words despite the signing of the agreement by georgia and russia , the two sides are still engaged in a verbal war with claims and counter claims flying around . after the meeting with chancellor merkel on friday , medvedev made plain that russia would respond " in the same way " if it felt provoked again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says moscow would like to see him out in an interview with the german weekly der spiegel published saturday , saakashvili said moscow was determined to see his government toppled . russian leaders had told both sarkozy and rice that " there will be no agreement on resolving the conflict without my resignation , " saakashvili said . he accused russia of using the georgian military action in breakaway south ossetia as a pretext to march into the region .
" south ossetia is not the issue for russia , " he said .
" moscow wants to take over all of georgia . " on saturday , georgia accused russian troops of blowing up a railway bridge west of the capital tbilisi earlier in the day , saying its main east-west train link had been severed .
russia strongly denied any involvement . georgia said saturday that 182 people , including 67 civilians , had been confirmed dead in the conflict with russia .
georgian health minister alexander kvitashvili said his number of dead and wounded only included people in areas controlled by georgia .
he added there was evidence of mutilation of bodies . russian officials have said at least 2,000 people , mostly russian citizens , were killed in south ossetia , the breakaway region at the center of the conflict .
the figure has not been independently confirmed . bush accuses russia of " bullying " speaking in washington after the return of us secretary of state condoleeza rice from the caucasus , us president george w bush accused russia of " bullying " behavior in sending armored units into georgia and bombing georgian targets from the air . but bush admitted that some progress had been made by the signing of the french-brokered peace plan by russia and georgia . " now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations , " he said . bush has consistently held up georgia as a beacon of democracy in the caucasus .
in a weekly radio address , bush said america would not leave georgia in the lurch and said the free world had to stand up for a threatened democracy which had decided in favor of freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has urged russia to honor the ceasefire and withdraw troops from georgia rice is to go to brussels next week to meet with nato foreign ministers and european union officials on the georgia crisis . asked about possible repercussions for russia , rice said there had already been consequences in the expression of " universal concern " on russia 's actions . " i think that russia will care about this talk because it is not just talk , it is about russia 's standing in the international community , " she said . poland says eu too soft on russia amid the flurry of diplomacy to end the conflict , the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering urged the eu to be united on the issue . " the eu has to deal with russia in a united manner , with determination and at the same time be ready for a dialogue , " poettering told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . poettering also warned against scrapping the eu 's strategic partnership with russia . " plans to isolate russia wo n't lead anywhere .
you ca n't isolate a member of the un security council . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski has pooh-poohed the idea of the eu having a common stance on russia however , polish president lech kaczynski on saturday accused paris and berlin of going too soft on russia because of their commercial ties with that country . in an interview , kaczynski said that european union policy was being decided by paris and berlin , without taking into consideration the views of the new eu members that were once under moscow 's control during the cold war .

the firm reportedly expected to pay $ 100 million in bribes to argentine officials including menem and the then ministers of finance and interior .
siemens ' argentine headquarters , located near the historic plaza de mayo in central buenos aires , were searched in an effort to secure evidence on an order from judge ariel lijo .
former siemens officials claimed - in the context of a broader investigation against the german multinational firm - that the company paid bribes in argentina .
german courts forwarded the information to authorities in buenos aires . siemens in the 1990s was seeking a $ 1.26-billion contract to digitalize argentine identity documents and other services , the daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported .
the contract was signed under menem in 1998 but cancelled in 2001 by his successor , president fernando de la rua .
later , siemens allegedly paid further bribes until 2004 - under former argentine president nestor kirchner , husband of current president cristina fernandez de kirchner - in an effort to have the contract restored . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in an interview with german newsmagazine der spiegel that was published saturday , aug .
16 , schroeder said that the georgian invasion of south ossetia was " the moment that initiated the current hostilities . " he declined to comment on whether russia 's response was disproportionate , saying that military conflicts developed their own dynamic . schroeder 's successor , chancellor angela merkel , friday described the russian reaction as " disproportionate in some aspects . " nato membership now far away bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder and putin are still friends the former chancellor , who was a close friend while of then russian prime minister vladimir putin during his seven years in office , said georgia 's bid for nato membership was now further off than before .

" i think little of demonizing russia , and i believe moscow will soon see the need for greater integration into the international community , " schroeder said . no major global problem , whether iran 's nuclear program , north korea , peace in the middle east or climate change , could be resolved without russia , schroeder said .
he urged the european union to press ahead with plans to forge a " strategic partnership " pact with moscow , saying europe risked losing influence and pushing russia towards china if it did not work with the kremlin . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a controversial citizenship test in one german state especially caught their attention . members of the united nations committee for the eradication of racial discrimination -lrb- cerd -rrb- on friday , aug .
15 , said that they were concerned about citizenship application questions targeted at muslims in the southwestern german state of baden-wuerttemberg . " the committee recommends that the federal government encourage the use of questionnaires without discriminatory content , for all applicants for citizenship , " said the committee , according to afp news agency . baden-wuerttemberg , home to car maker daimler 's mercedes benz , apparently requires citizens of the 57 member states of the organization of the islamic conference to answer specific questions when they apply for german citizenship . german test also under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian edathy wants the citizenship test to be reworked a nationwide citizenship test which is to become compulsory for immigrants and includes questions seeking the applicant 's views on forced marriages and homosexuality has also come under criticism . earlier this week , sebastian edathy , the social democratic chairman of the parliament 's domestic affairs committee , asked the federal interior ministry to rework the test which is made up of 300 potential questions . edathy said that many questions had wrong multiple choice answers that were meant to be correct and that some questions were completely irrelevant for a citizenship test .
ministry officials have rejected the claim and said that the test in its present form will take effect next month . the un committee also described as " regrettable " that many migrants who have lived in germany for many years , still failed to get citizenship . " germany should facilitate acquisition of german citizenship by such long-term residents and persons born in germany in order to promote their integration , " the committee said . growing racism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minster wolfgang schaeuble created the islam conference to improve relations while cerd members applauded germany for introducing anti-discrimination legislation two years ago and setting up a so-called islam conference , they also criticized a growing number of racist incidents in germany , saying that the federal government was not doing enough to prevent them .
the committee found that jews , muslims , sinti and roma as well as african asylum seekers had been attacked . german justice ministry officials said that they would study the comments carefully , but stressed that germany was " actively engaged " in implementing eu anti-discrimination laws in germany .
germany 's national action plan against racism will be presented to the un high commissioner for human rights later this year . lack of integration ? in their report , cerd officials also wondered how germany wants to define itself as a " non-multi-ethnic state " as one fifth of the population has a migrant background and about 8 percent are foreigners without a german passport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people with migrant backgrounds have joined germany 's police pool cerd asked german officials to tell them whether these groups are integrated in agencies such as the police .
german officials , according to news reports , countered that the government 's policy was to " integrate , not assimilate " people with a migrant background . the anti-racism experts also bemoaned germany 's use of language when it comes to the law and officials agencies .
they also said that it was unfortunate that german law did n't see racist motives in connection with crimes as an aggravating factor .
cerd said that foreign victims of violence often receive less compensation money than germans . sinti and roma are in an especially bad position as they are discriminated against in the work place , in media coverage about them and when searching for apartments , cerd members said . the committee also criticized that children of asylum seekers in the states of hesse , baden-württemberg and saarland did not all attend school and that many children of migrant families had to attend special education schools . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nation has since long been scoring points in culture , but now the country is broke and is rethinking the preservation of cultural monuments . milan native simona cagno is worried about churches and historical palaces that are disintegrating all over italy right in front of her .
" i do n't know what i should say about this , " she said .
" i ca n't seem to find the words . "
private leasing and selling " instead of expensive restoration is now apparently the word from rome .
in other words : getting rid of monuments instead of holding onto them .
in verona , three palaces and one former convent are about to be auctioned off so that the city can afford a new parking garage for trade show visitors .
have the italian authorities lost their minds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's government is doing some belt-tightening in sicily , the region is planning to privately rent the world-famous temple of agrigento for the next 30 years .
" it just makes me scream and ask : ' how much further will italy sink ? " ' said gottfried wagner with disgust .
an historian , music scientist , writer and opera conductor , richard wagner 's great-grandson has been living in italy for almost 30 years .
the country has produced the greatest painters , composers and architects not just for europe , but for world history as well , wagner said .
" where will we end up if culture is only abused for political prostitution ? " he asked .
has the cultural legacy been lost ?
silvio berlusconi would be more than happy to silence the skeptics in italy - whether they are judges , monument preservationists or artists .
there has n't been talk of an interesting cultural sector for a long time now .
" nothing considerable is taking place anymore that i would probably appreciate , " wagner said , adding that in the past , there was a real sense of excitement and now that no longer exists .
" and this is the cultural and spiritual situation at the moment in italy and i could say this a thousand times over : it 's frightening , " he said .
trash instead of culture - what started in berlusconi 's television programs has since spread through the entire country .
italy , the cradle of the renaissance and of the communal city character , is trampling on its cultural legacy - a legacy that attracts millions of tourists to the country . no money for culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous constructions are set to be leased they marvel at leonardo da vinci 's last supper , for example , and most are overwhelmed by the 15th century mural painting 's beauty .
the fresco has been restored for 20 years to help stop its slow deterioration .
private sponsors carry the costs for this almost exclusively .
the ministry of cultural assets , which would normally take responsibility for the " last supper " did not have enough money .
now the situation is even more depressing .
not even 3 percent of italian households will donate money for the maintenance of monuments .
and the cutbacks that the berlusconi government passed via a finance decree leave the budget of the ministry of cultural assets even smaller .
" the funds for cultural assets and museums have degenerated like the political interest in culture , " said salvatore settis , italy 's most well-known monument preservationist .
the internationally-recognized art historian and director of the state-run ivy-league-type school " ecole normale " in pisa has calculated that the savings totaling 700 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- over three years mean less for the ministry of cultural assets . no sense of culture ?
in answer to the tentative question of where the minister should still make cuts , antonio leone from the governing party alliance " volk der freiheit " -lrb- people of freedom -rrb- said : " the minister must now set priorities .
the ministry received a certain budget and it has to make do with it . "
it is the minister 's job to make cuts where cuts can be made , and not to make cuts where they ca n't be made , he added . kirstin hausen -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke to luxembourg 's foreign minister asselborn about the divisions within the eu on the conflict and dealing with an assertive russia . on wednesday this week , you spent several hours discussing the situation in the caucasus with your european colleagues .
there was talk of a european peace mission .
what exactly is this about ?
jean asselborn : that is an interesting question : how can the european union contribute ?
we need to be present in the country .
but how can we be present ?
we can think about two or three things now .
for example , we can act as a monitor by sending police organized under the european flag to follow the situation ..
but no troops , no soldiers ?
if there are troops - and this is the second thing i wanted to say - then i feel that needs to be decided within the framework of the united nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asselborn insists that a solid partnership with russia is essential where does the eu stand on the future status of the south ossetia and abkhazia provinces that officially belong to georgia ?
we have avoided talking about this and i will also avoid discussing it with you .
it 's one the points where we said that we as the european union will of course contribute in negotiations , in a sort of mediation or intervention .
and we have said from the very beginning what should happen with this .
in any case we are backing the integrity of georgian territory .
but were the eu foreign ministers in agreement about who is to blame for the conflict ?
no , we avoided the question of blame .
if we got bogged down in playing the blame game , we would have lost a lot of time .
we would have never agreed on anything and that would n't have solved anything anyhow .
we are not judges in the european union .
but some countries , the baltic states and poland in particular , have clearly demonstrated solidarity with georgia while the german foreign minister , for example , warned against judging russia too quickly .
what does this mean then for the planned new strategic partnership agreement between the eu and russia ?
i think it would be a fatal mistake to break off this partnership .
i do not find it 100 percent bad that the baltic states and poland have taken this stance .
but you could still see and feel that the eu presidency - currently held by france , it could have been another country speaking on behalf of the european union - is calling the shots .
bildunterschrift : and we also need to know that we have no political interest in ducking when the us and russia are involved in a verbal war .
we have to show that we are important in our own right .
we can do that with our solidarity which of course we then need to demonstrate .
the european union has more inhabitants than russia and the us put together .
we are a big player in the global economy .
politically too , we are a very important factor when we present a united front .
as the european union , we must stick to the partnership with russia , even after these recent events which of course do not please us .
we need to enhance this partnership so that one day we wo n't have these situations any more .
to what extent can the european union function efficiently and as a united force without the lisbon treaty ?
the european union can function coherently with regard to foreign policy even without the lisbon treaty .
and we also need to remember that with the lisbon treaty , nothing fundamental changes in the bloc 's foreign policy .
foreign policy will remain the most difficult area in the european union in the next ten years , even with the lisbon treaty .
european foreign policy is more than the adding-up of national interests .
it 's a question of political will , not about a treaty .
we need to work on that and we also need to judge ourselves based on that . interview : susanne henn -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" kaufhof offers everything under one roof a thousand times . " department stores used to be a huge draw for shoppers in the inner cities .
but the whole concept in which all shopping needs could be met in one huge store does n't seem to be working anymore .
customers are abandoning the idea , and big chain department stores find themselves in financial straits these days . in the 1970s , 12 percent of all retail revenues landed in the coffers of nationwide chains such as karstadt , kaufhof , hertie and horten and co .
today department stores account for barely 3.5 percent of sales in the retail industry and market share keeps dipping . household names such as wehmeyer and hertie are fast disappearing , and wehmeyer 's former rival , the clothing chain sinn-leffers , recently declared bankruptcy .
even germany 's traditional chains such as karstadt and kaufhof are feeling the winds of change . german household names disappearing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertie , a german household name is barely surviving now already in the 1990s , department stores were experiencing the financial squeeze .
cash and carry discounters in the suburbs and countryside were cutting into their business .
that was when hertie and horten & co. had gone under . the hertie name made an attempted comeback under different management , but is insolvent again .
only about half of the 72 remaining hertie stores are expected to survive . interestingly , neither the mass discount chains nor the upscale , luxury department stores are hurting ; only the ones such as kaufhof and karstadt in the moderate price segment of the retail market . “ this loss in the middle segment has been creeping up over the last 15 years or so , " said marco atzberger of the retail research institute -lrb- ehi -rrb- in cologne , who explained that too little has been invested name recognition , product lines and giving the stores a facelift . " and such incremental developments are always the most dangerous , since you do n't notice them until it is too late to do something about it , ” he said . competition squeezes out traditional department store what 's missing in such middle range department stores is an ambiance that seduces shoppers .
otherwise they need to develop new retail concepts , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : department stores with high overhead can not compete with online vendors another problem is competition from the internet and the downward pressure on prices from online shopping .
the discerning german consumer , according to atzberger is very price conscious and department stores with their much high overhead costs would have a harder time offering bargains than a company selling goods online . at the high-end of the retail spectrum , luxury department stores in the best neighborhoods of big german cities such as kadewe in berlin or alsterhaus in hamburg offer a unique ambiance and are able to entice shoppers by appealing to their emotions rather than their pocketbook , he said . us style shopping mall comes to germany “ we are seeing more and more of the ‘ shop in shop ' concept , which means that a department store chain sublets space to a specialty stores such as wmf , which sells household goods and cookery or a clothing brand , " atzberger said .
" this concept is better known abroad than in germany .
and it works abroad . " bildunterschrift : there are roughly 400 shopping malls now , and the numbers keep rising in germany the decline of the department store has also been accelerated by the introduction of american style suburban shopping malls with numerous specialty shops all under one roof .
roughly 400 of such shopping centers now exist in all of germany and 15 more are expected to be opening their doors next year , according to atzberger 's retail institute . even the ownership structure of such retail space is different from the traditional department store .
financial groups invest in the real estate and hire a management team to rent out space to individual retailers . “ the management takes care of everything , " atzberger said .
" the opening hours are all coordinated with all the different stores , free parking space is provided for customers .
they take care of the retail mix to ensure that there is a wide range of stores that complement each other in terms of price range and variety .
that is one thing you do n't find in the inner cities , and a drawback for the city department store . " rolf wenkel -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but hamburg came back well to earn a deserved point in an entertaining game thanks to a paolo guerrero header and a piotr trochowski penalty . although there were plus points in the performance for klinsmann , injury-hit bayern were often second best to a bright hamburg side who under new coach martin jol sought to go forward from the start .
klinsmann said the bayern team had taken " a good step forward " but there was " a lot of work still to do . " " of course as coach you want three points in your first game , " he said .
" we had hoped to go 3-1 in front directly after the break but unfortunately hamburg got the penalty to make it 2-2 .
we had some problems in the first 10 or 15 minutes but managed to get two goals in front only to give it away .
the various parts of the team played better together and the fine tuning is coming along .
hamburg played well , had their chances and the result was a fair one . " we are still in the early phase and at the moment we are not in a position to put an opponent under pressure , " he added .
" our combination play is n't together yet but this will come automatically with improved fitness in the coming weeks .
we have to improve from week to week . " perfect beginning hamburg began strongly and the lively trochowski fired an 11th-minute cross-shot from the left which struck the post with michael rensing in goal beaten .
but the visitors were caught napping a minute later from a throw-in by philipp lahm who sent ze roberto down the left .
the brazilian cut the ball back and schweinsteiger raced in to drive the ball into the net . four minutes later bayern were awarded a penalty when dutch defender joris mathijsen had his arms around schweinsteiger , and podolski sent goalkeeper frank rost the wrong way from the spot kick . it was the perfect begin for bayern who were missing several injured first-choice players including france midfielder franck ribery , italy striker luca toni , turkey midfielder haltin altintop and argentina defender martin demechelis . however the shirt-sleeved klinsmann was often on the touchline with instructions as hamburg continued to use the ball well in midfield and find space to threaten an uncertain bayern defense . hamburg back in the game new captain david jarolim and trochowski , a former bayern player , more than adequately filled the gap created by the departure of rafael van der vaart to real madrid , with dutch international nigel de jong a firm anchor in defensive midfield . in the 25th minute , hamburg were back in the game when trochowski whipped in a cross from the right and former bayern striker guerrero was left unmarked to head the ball firmly down into the net . podolski had a glorious opportunity to put bayern further ahead but blasted the ball over the bar four minutes after the break , while hamburg came even closer a minute late when ivica olic struck the post . however the equalizer was n't long coming .
referee thorsten kinhoefer again pointed to the spot for a holding offence when bayern right-back christian lell was adjudged to have tugged at olic , and trochowski stepped up to coolly convert from the spot for the 57th-minute equalizer . jol said he was pleased with his team 's fightback . " when you are 2-0 behind you can be satisfied with the result , " he said .
" we should have been in front but were not careful and conceded the first goal .
it was disappointing to be 2-0 down but i think the penalty was ok . " the bundesliga continues with six matches on saturday and two on sunday . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the glass is always half empty .
right now , the general mood when it comes to the economy seems to be negative .
what 's your feeling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin wansleben has been dihk 's ceo since 2001 martin wansleben : my personal feeling is that things are great .
we 've had problems like this in the past .
sometimes the business cycle experiences a downturn .
but we 're well advised to prepare for what 's coming and not just approach it assuming it 's all doom and gloom ahead . but we 're hearing horror stories .
people are talking about a recession in germany .
what do you think ? i 'm being cautious .
we 're used to evaluating economic growth from quarter to quarter .
we used to do it by looking back to the same quarter of the year before .
if we look at this year like that , then we saw 3 percent growth in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the previous year .
but if we compare -lrb- this year 's -rrb- second quarter to the first quarter , then growth is declining .
so , there is still growth , at least two percent or more this year .
that 's really not a recession . so you 're not worried about the german economy ? i 'm a bit worried about the general mood in germany and regarding the economy , about what decisions are being made .
but you could worry about things like that anytime .
and who does n't think that they personally , or other people , or society as a whole , should be doing more ? does that mean the mood is worse than reality ? i think that the mood is worse than we should actually expect as normal .
the economy has been doing really well for the past three years , so we should n't be too worried if it performs less well at some point .
but - and this is important - nor should we just lean back and say it 'll all work out .
we should be cautiously optimistic and work hard .
that way , even in an economic slump , we 'll be fine . so what do you think needs to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising gas prices have shocked germans , wansleben says the first thing is to look at the facts and the numbers as they really are .
and the second thing is , i think the government needs to realize that they ca n't just plod along till the next election in september next year .
somebody simply making trips abroad is n't going to help .
we need to make important decisions at home now .
and the same goes for the european level .
we 're coming up to a decisive moment for germany .
i can imagine that , with hindsight , we 'll look back to the early summer as a psychological turning point .
the energy prices gave us quite a shock .
with gas prices at 1.60 euros -lrb- $ 2.34 -rrb- a liter -lrb- quarter gallon -rrb- , many of us have paid 80 euros to fill up a 50-liter tank and just thought - what on earth is going on ?
i think germans are worried about who 's taking care of things .
ordinary people here might be feeling that members of the elite are only watching their own backs . and trying to protect their image perhaps ? image , or whatever else they have to protect .
but not pooling their knowledge to try and figure out what the problems are , or the challenges , and a joint approach .
that 's worrying , and that 's why there 's all this talk of doom and gloom .
so , now the talk of recession is spreading , just because of a bit of uncertainty and worry .
a few weeks or months ago it was about energy prices , and now it 's practically a yearning for a recession - so much yearning that it could practically cause one . but the low morale could also be caused by people having less money in their pockets .
high prices , and salaries not rising by as much as people expect in a strong economy .
is that a problem too ? i think that spending is key to that - how much money people have to spend .
and rising prices are part of that , as are energy and commodity prices . but the government ca n't do anything about that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even store rebates of 19 percent to shop tax free have n't helped much , it seems no , the government ca n't do anything about that .
back in 2006 it seemed like a good time to raise sales tax as the economy was booming .
many hoped the cycle of business would sort of wash over that fact and no-one would notice .
but now we have to accept that the rise in sales tax has been a real blow to the economy .
it was a big mistake .
it has to be corrected somehow .
also , we 're facing what economists call " cold progression . "
today , people who are earning only double the average income are already in the highest tax bracket .
a lot is being skimmed off by the state , but the state has n't been doing enough to figure out revenue policies that would put more money in people 's pockets .
it 's simply the wrong approach to think the budget can be balanced by taxes and fees . the whole of europe feels the results of the german economy weakening .
what effects do you think that will have ? first off , other european countries have already weakened , and even before germany started to feel the pinch … i think that the economic slowdown , as normal as it is , is becoming worse - partly because of energy and commodity prices , which are eroding purchasing power .
but also because of the financial crisis , which is hitting very close to home here .
a lot of assets have been wiped out , and financial opportunities for private investors , and leeway for the banks . but are the businesses that you represent already feeling the slump ?
are they noticeably less bullish ? yes , orders are decreasing .
it has n't affected the factories yet .
there are still plenty of orders , and they 're still producing at full throttle .
that 's why we 're not noticing anything different in the rate of growth at the moment .
and that 's why we have to be careful .
it could be that the economy will pull back , the euro will fall and oil prices will drop . is a weaker euro good ? it 'd be good if the euro stopped being overvalued .
that 's why it 's good that it 's falling right now .
but i 'm not sure about the idea the more the euro falls , the better .
that 's not always the case , so we need to watch out . and finally mr wansleben .
what is the current state of the german economy ?
is the glass half empty or half full ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's hoping things will go up again i think we 're right where you 'd expect us to be .
this year will still be a good year .
everyone knows things are going to get worse at some point .
now there are more and more signs that that will happen next year .
i think the most important thing is how the economy is structured , and it 's fine .
we 're really well represented globally .
germany is one of the very few countries in the world where middle-sized companies are independent on the world markets , and not beholden to bigger ones .
this international anchorage helps us to use all the possibilities out there : in russia or china , or india or south america .
i think it 's important to reiterate that . another thing is that over the past 10 to 15 years , german companies have learned a lot from the financial crisis of the early 1990s .
they 've left no stone unturned , their cost structures are totally different , and there 's a lot of innovation in processes and products . i do n't think that we need to be pessimistic right now .
as i 've said , what i 'm worried about is politicians choosing to stick with unproductive policies .
if the economics minister says it would actually be good to implement some reforms , but the majority does n't back them , that shows that even government officials can see the government is lagging behind on what 's actually important . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and who does n't think that they personally , or other people , or society as a whole , should be doing more ? does that mean the mood is worse than reality ? i think that the mood is worse than we should actually expect as normal .
the economy has been doing really well for the past three years , so we should n't be too worried if it performs less well at some point .
but - and this is important - nor should we just lean back and say it 'll all work out .
we should be cautiously optimistic and work hard .
that way , even in an economic slump , we 'll be fine . so what do you think needs to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising gas prices have shocked germans , wansleben says the first thing is to look at the facts and the numbers as they really are .
and the second thing is , i think the government needs to realize that they ca n't just plod along till the next election in september next year .
somebody simply making trips abroad is n't going to help .
we need to make important decisions at home now .
and the same goes for the european level .
we 're coming up to a decisive moment for germany .
i can imagine that , with hindsight , we 'll look back to the early summer as a psychological turning point .
the energy prices gave us quite a shock .
with gas prices at 1.60 euros -lrb- $ 2.34 -rrb- a liter -lrb- quarter gallon -rrb- , many of us have paid 80 euros to fill up a 50-liter tank and just thought - what on earth is going on ?
i think germans are worried about who 's taking care of things .
ordinary people here might be feeling that members of the elite are only watching their own backs . and trying to protect their image perhaps ? image , or whatever else they have to protect .
but not pooling their knowledge to try and figure out what the problems are , or the challenges , and a joint approach .
that 's worrying , and that 's why there 's all this talk of doom and gloom .
so , now the talk of recession is spreading , just because of a bit of uncertainty and worry .
a few weeks or months ago it was about energy prices , and now it 's practically a yearning for a recession - so much yearning that it could practically cause one . but the low morale could also be caused by people having less money in their pockets .
high prices , and salaries not rising by as much as people expect in a strong economy .
is that a problem too ? i think that spending is key to that - how much money people have to spend .
and rising prices are part of that , as are energy and commodity prices . but the government ca n't do anything about that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even store rebates of 19 percent to shop tax free have n't helped much , it seems no , the government ca n't do anything about that .
back in 2006 it seemed like a good time to raise sales tax as the economy was booming .
many hoped the cycle of business would sort of wash over that fact and no-one would notice .
but now we have to accept that the rise in sales tax has been a real blow to the economy .
it was a big mistake .
it has to be corrected somehow .
also , we 're facing what economists call " cold progression . "
today , people who are earning only double the average income are already in the highest tax bracket .
a lot is being skimmed off by the state , but the state has n't been doing enough to figure out revenue policies that would put more money in people 's pockets .
it 's simply the wrong approach to think the budget can be balanced by taxes and fees . the whole of europe feels the results of the german economy weakening .
what effects do you think that will have ? first off , other european countries have already weakened , and even before germany started to feel the pinch … i think that the economic slowdown , as normal as it is , is becoming worse - partly because of energy and commodity prices , which are eroding purchasing power .
but also because of the financial crisis , which is hitting very close to home here .
a lot of assets have been wiped out , and financial opportunities for private investors , and leeway for the banks . but are the businesses that you represent already feeling the slump ?
are they noticeably less bullish ? yes , orders are decreasing .
it has n't affected the factories yet .
there are still plenty of orders , and they 're still producing at full throttle .
that 's why we 're not noticing anything different in the rate of growth at the moment .
and that 's why we have to be careful .
it could be that the economy will pull back , the euro will fall and oil prices will drop . is a weaker euro good ? it 'd be good if the euro stopped being overvalued .
that 's why it 's good that it 's falling right now .
but i 'm not sure about the idea the more the euro falls , the better .
that 's not always the case , so we need to watch out . and finally mr wansleben .
what is the current state of the german economy ?
is the glass half empty or half full ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's hoping things will go up again i think we 're right where you 'd expect us to be .
this year will still be a good year .
everyone knows things are going to get worse at some point .
now there are more and more signs that that will happen next year .
i think the most important thing is how the economy is structured , and it 's fine .
we 're really well represented globally .
germany is one of the very few countries in the world where middle-sized companies are independent on the world markets , and not beholden to bigger ones .
this international anchorage helps us to use all the possibilities out there : in russia or china , or india or south america .
i think it 's important to reiterate that . another thing is that over the past 10 to 15 years , german companies have learned a lot from the financial crisis of the early 1990s .
they 've left no stone unturned , their cost structures are totally different , and there 's a lot of innovation in processes and products . i do n't think that we need to be pessimistic right now .
as i 've said , what i 'm worried about is politicians choosing to stick with unproductive policies .

the glass is always half empty .
right now , the general mood when it comes to the economy seems to be negative .
what 's your feeling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin wansleben has been dihk 's ceo since 2001 martin wansleben : my personal feeling is that things are great .
we 've had problems like this in the past .
sometimes the business cycle experiences a downturn .
but we 're well advised to prepare for what 's coming and not just approach it assuming it 's all doom and gloom ahead . but we 're hearing horror stories .
people are talking about a recession in germany .
what do you think ? i 'm being cautious .
we 're used to evaluating economic growth from quarter to quarter .
we used to do it by looking back to the same quarter of the year before .
if we look at this year like that , then we saw 3 percent growth in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the previous year .
but if we compare -lrb- this year 's -rrb- second quarter to the first quarter , then growth is declining .
so , there is still growth , at least two percent or more this year .
that 's really not a recession . so you 're not worried about the german economy ? i 'm a bit worried about the general mood in germany and regarding the economy , about what decisions are being made .
but you could worry about things like that anytime .

dw spoke to luxembourg 's foreign minister asselborn about the divisions within the eu on the conflict and dealing with an assertive russia . on wednesday this week , you spent several hours discussing the situation in the caucasus with your european colleagues .
there was talk of a european peace mission .
what exactly is this about ?
jean asselborn : that is an interesting question : how can the european union contribute ?
we need to be present in the country .
but how can we be present ?
we can think about two or three things now .
for example , we can act as a monitor by sending police organized under the european flag to follow the situation ..
but no troops , no soldiers ?
if there are troops - and this is the second thing i wanted to say - then i feel that needs to be decided within the framework of the united nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asselborn insists that a solid partnership with russia is essential where does the eu stand on the future status of the south ossetia and abkhazia provinces that officially belong to georgia ?
we have avoided talking about this and i will also avoid discussing it with you .
it 's one the points where we said that we as the european union will of course contribute in negotiations , in a sort of mediation or intervention .
and we have said from the very beginning what should happen with this .
in any case we are backing the integrity of georgian territory .
but were the eu foreign ministers in agreement about who is to blame for the conflict ?
no , we avoided the question of blame .
if we got bogged down in playing the blame game , we would have lost a lot of time .
we would have never agreed on anything and that would n't have solved anything anyhow .
we are not judges in the european union .
but some countries , the baltic states and poland in particular , have clearly demonstrated solidarity with georgia while the german foreign minister , for example , warned against judging russia too quickly .
what does this mean then for the planned new strategic partnership agreement between the eu and russia ?
i think it would be a fatal mistake to break off this partnership .
i do not find it 100 percent bad that the baltic states and poland have taken this stance .
but you could still see and feel that the eu presidency - currently held by france , it could have been another country speaking on behalf of the european union - is calling the shots .
bildunterschrift : and we also need to know that we have no political interest in ducking when the us and russia are involved in a verbal war .
we have to show that we are important in our own right .
we can do that with our solidarity which of course we then need to demonstrate .
the european union has more inhabitants than russia and the us put together .
we are a big player in the global economy .
politically too , we are a very important factor when we present a united front .
as the european union , we must stick to the partnership with russia , even after these recent events which of course do not please us .
we need to enhance this partnership so that one day we wo n't have these situations any more .
to what extent can the european union function efficiently and as a united force without the lisbon treaty ?
the european union can function coherently with regard to foreign policy even without the lisbon treaty .
and we also need to remember that with the lisbon treaty , nothing fundamental changes in the bloc 's foreign policy .
foreign policy will remain the most difficult area in the european union in the next ten years , even with the lisbon treaty .
european foreign policy is more than the adding-up of national interests .
it 's a question of political will , not about a treaty .
we need to work on that and we also need to judge ourselves based on that . interview : susanne henn -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the firm reportedly expected to pay $ 100 million in bribes to argentine officials including menem and the then ministers of finance and interior .
siemens ' argentine headquarters , located near the historic plaza de mayo in central buenos aires , were searched in an effort to secure evidence on an order from judge ariel lijo .
former siemens officials claimed - in the context of a broader investigation against the german multinational firm - that the company paid bribes in argentina .
german courts forwarded the information to authorities in buenos aires . siemens in the 1990s was seeking a $ 1.26-billion contract to digitalize argentine identity documents and other services , the daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported .
the contract was signed under menem in 1998 but cancelled in 2001 by his successor , president fernando de la rua .
later , siemens allegedly paid further bribes until 2004 - under former argentine president nestor kirchner , husband of current president cristina fernandez de kirchner - in an effort to have the contract restored . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the ceasefire has to be verifiable and permanent , " german news agencies quoted a government spokesman as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , did n't mince words with medvedev merkel 's meeting with saakashvili comes two days after the chancellor met russian president dimitry medvedev in the black sea resort of sochi . the chancellor openly criticized russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori , saying it was " disproportionate in some aspects . " former chancellor blames georgia merkel underscored in the meeting with medvedev that " the basic point for any political solution to the conflict must be georgia 's territorial integrity . " on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that georgia 's territorial integrity and sovereignty could not be questioned . " georgia 's territorial integrity remains the basis of german policy , " steinmeier told newspaper welt am sonntag . he was referring to statements by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov who described calls to respect georgia 's territorial integrity as " just talk " that one " should forget . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schroeder , right , was and is good friends with russian prime minister putin steinmeier added that russia had crossed a limit with its bombardment of georgia proper but said it was pointless to assign blame in the conflict . his view was at odds with comments by former german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel , schroeder called president saakashvili a " gambler " and said he had triggered the war . the crisis began when georgia sent forces last week to retake south ossetia , a pro-russian province that threw off georgian rule in the 1990s .
moscow responded by sending troops into georgia . russia signs ceasefire medvedev meanwhile signed the six-point plan mediated by the european union earlier saturday in moscow .
saakashvili signed the document in tbilisi on friday in the presence of us secretary of state condoleezza rice . the agreement is not a peace settlement but provides the basis for a legally binding text to end the fighting and pave the way for a political solution .
the united nations security council is to formalize the six principles of the ceasefire . one of the key points is the withdrawal of russian armed forces to positions held before hostilities began in south ossetia . other points include renouncing violence , cessation of hostilities , granting access to humanitarian aid , the return of georgian armed forces to their usual quarters and the opening of international discussions on the future status of the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . the framework plan falls short of the original proposal by the eu presidency .
the draft had called for the " full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia " and the deployment of a eu or un monitoring mission . moscow , tiblisi locked in war of words despite the signing of the agreement by georgia and russia , the two sides are still engaged in a verbal war with claims and counter claims flying around . after the meeting with chancellor merkel on friday , medvedev made plain that russia would respond " in the same way " if it felt provoked again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says moscow would like to see him out in an interview with the german weekly der spiegel published saturday , saakashvili said moscow was determined to see his government toppled . russian leaders had told both sarkozy and rice that " there will be no agreement on resolving the conflict without my resignation , " saakashvili said . he accused russia of using the georgian military action in breakaway south ossetia as a pretext to march into the region .
" south ossetia is not the issue for russia , " he said .
" moscow wants to take over all of georgia . " on saturday , georgia accused russian troops of blowing up a railway bridge west of the capital tbilisi earlier in the day , saying its main east-west train link had been severed .
russia strongly denied any involvement . georgia said saturday that 182 people , including 67 civilians , had been confirmed dead in the conflict with russia .
georgian health minister alexander kvitashvili said his number of dead and wounded only included people in areas controlled by georgia .
he added there was evidence of mutilation of bodies . russian officials have said at least 2,000 people , mostly russian citizens , were killed in south ossetia , the breakaway region at the center of the conflict .
the figure has not been independently confirmed . bush accuses russia of " bullying " speaking in washington after the return of us secretary of state condoleeza rice from the caucasus , us president george w bush accused russia of " bullying " behavior in sending armored units into georgia and bombing georgian targets from the air . but bush admitted that some progress had been made by the signing of the french-brokered peace plan by russia and georgia . " now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations , " he said . bush has consistently held up georgia as a beacon of democracy in the caucasus .
in a weekly radio address , bush said america would not leave georgia in the lurch and said the free world had to stand up for a threatened democracy which had decided in favor of freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has urged russia to honor the ceasefire and withdraw troops from georgia rice is to go to brussels next week to meet with nato foreign ministers and european union officials on the georgia crisis . asked about possible repercussions for russia , rice said there had already been consequences in the expression of " universal concern " on russia 's actions . " i think that russia will care about this talk because it is not just talk , it is about russia 's standing in the international community , " she said . poland says eu too soft on russia amid the flurry of diplomacy to end the conflict , the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering urged the eu to be united on the issue . " the eu has to deal with russia in a united manner , with determination and at the same time be ready for a dialogue , " poettering told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . poettering also warned against scrapping the eu 's strategic partnership with russia . " plans to isolate russia wo n't lead anywhere .
you ca n't isolate a member of the un security council . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski has pooh-poohed the idea of the eu having a common stance on russia however , polish president lech kaczynski on saturday accused paris and berlin of going too soft on russia because of their commercial ties with that country . in an interview , kaczynski said that european union policy was being decided by paris and berlin , without taking into consideration the views of the new eu members that were once under moscow 's control during the cold war . " saying that the european union has a common policy towards russia is a joke .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schroeder , right , was and is good friends with russian prime minister putin steinmeier added that russia had crossed a limit with its bombardment of georgia proper but said it was pointless to assign blame in the conflict . his view was at odds with comments by former german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel , schroeder called president saakashvili a " gambler " and said he had triggered the war . the crisis began when georgia sent forces last week to retake south ossetia , a pro-russian province that threw off georgian rule in the 1990s .
moscow responded by sending troops into georgia . russia signs ceasefire medvedev meanwhile signed the six-point plan mediated by the european union earlier saturday in moscow .
saakashvili signed the document in tbilisi on friday in the presence of us secretary of state condoleezza rice . the agreement is not a peace settlement but provides the basis for a legally binding text to end the fighting and pave the way for a political solution .
the united nations security council is to formalize the six principles of the ceasefire . one of the key points is the withdrawal of russian armed forces to positions held before hostilities began in south ossetia . other points include renouncing violence , cessation of hostilities , granting access to humanitarian aid , the return of georgian armed forces to their usual quarters and the opening of international discussions on the future status of the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . the framework plan falls short of the original proposal by the eu presidency .
the draft had called for the " full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia " and the deployment of a eu or un monitoring mission . moscow , tiblisi locked in war of words despite the signing of the agreement by georgia and russia , the two sides are still engaged in a verbal war with claims and counter claims flying around . after the meeting with chancellor merkel on friday , medvedev made plain that russia would respond " in the same way " if it felt provoked again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says moscow would like to see him out in an interview with the german weekly der spiegel published saturday , saakashvili said moscow was determined to see his government toppled . russian leaders had told both sarkozy and rice that " there will be no agreement on resolving the conflict without my resignation , " saakashvili said . he accused russia of using the georgian military action in breakaway south ossetia as a pretext to march into the region .
" south ossetia is not the issue for russia , " he said .
" moscow wants to take over all of georgia . " on saturday , georgia accused russian troops of blowing up a railway bridge west of the capital tbilisi earlier in the day , saying its main east-west train link had been severed .
russia strongly denied any involvement . georgia said saturday that 182 people , including 67 civilians , had been confirmed dead in the conflict with russia .
georgian health minister alexander kvitashvili said his number of dead and wounded only included people in areas controlled by georgia .
he added there was evidence of mutilation of bodies . russian officials have said at least 2,000 people , mostly russian citizens , were killed in south ossetia , the breakaway region at the center of the conflict .
the figure has not been independently confirmed . bush accuses russia of " bullying " speaking in washington after the return of us secretary of state condoleeza rice from the caucasus , us president george w bush accused russia of " bullying " behavior in sending armored units into georgia and bombing georgian targets from the air . but bush admitted that some progress had been made by the signing of the french-brokered peace plan by russia and georgia . " now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations , " he said . bush has consistently held up georgia as a beacon of democracy in the caucasus .

in an interview with news magazine der spiegel , schroeder called president saakashvili a " gambler " and said he had triggered the war . the crisis began when georgia sent forces last week to retake south ossetia , a pro-russian province that threw off georgian rule in the 1990s .
moscow responded by sending troops into georgia . russia signs ceasefire medvedev meanwhile signed the six-point plan mediated by the european union earlier saturday in moscow .
saakashvili signed the document in tbilisi on friday in the presence of us secretary of state condoleezza rice . the agreement is not a peace settlement but provides the basis for a legally binding text to end the fighting and pave the way for a political solution .
the united nations security council is to formalize the six principles of the ceasefire . one of the key points is the withdrawal of russian armed forces to positions held before hostilities began in south ossetia . other points include renouncing violence , cessation of hostilities , granting access to humanitarian aid , the return of georgian armed forces to their usual quarters and the opening of international discussions on the future status of the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . the framework plan falls short of the original proposal by the eu presidency .
the draft had called for the " full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia " and the deployment of a eu or un monitoring mission . moscow , tiblisi locked in war of words despite the signing of the agreement by georgia and russia , the two sides are still engaged in a verbal war with claims and counter claims flying around . after the meeting with chancellor merkel on friday , medvedev made plain that russia would respond " in the same way " if it felt provoked again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says moscow would like to see him out in an interview with the german weekly der spiegel published saturday , saakashvili said moscow was determined to see his government toppled . russian leaders had told both sarkozy and rice that " there will be no agreement on resolving the conflict without my resignation , " saakashvili said . he accused russia of using the georgian military action in breakaway south ossetia as a pretext to march into the region .
" south ossetia is not the issue for russia , " he said .
" moscow wants to take over all of georgia . " on saturday , georgia accused russian troops of blowing up a railway bridge west of the capital tbilisi earlier in the day , saying its main east-west train link had been severed .
russia strongly denied any involvement . georgia said saturday that 182 people , including 67 civilians , had been confirmed dead in the conflict with russia .
georgian health minister alexander kvitashvili said his number of dead and wounded only included people in areas controlled by georgia .
he added there was evidence of mutilation of bodies . russian officials have said at least 2,000 people , mostly russian citizens , were killed in south ossetia , the breakaway region at the center of the conflict .
the figure has not been independently confirmed . bush accuses russia of " bullying " speaking in washington after the return of us secretary of state condoleeza rice from the caucasus , us president george w bush accused russia of " bullying " behavior in sending armored units into georgia and bombing georgian targets from the air . but bush admitted that some progress had been made by the signing of the french-brokered peace plan by russia and georgia . " now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations , " he said . bush has consistently held up georgia as a beacon of democracy in the caucasus .
in a weekly radio address , bush said america would not leave georgia in the lurch and said the free world had to stand up for a threatened democracy which had decided in favor of freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has urged russia to honor the ceasefire and withdraw troops from georgia rice is to go to brussels next week to meet with nato foreign ministers and european union officials on the georgia crisis . asked about possible repercussions for russia , rice said there had already been consequences in the expression of " universal concern " on russia 's actions . " i think that russia will care about this talk because it is not just talk , it is about russia 's standing in the international community , " she said . poland says eu too soft on russia amid the flurry of diplomacy to end the conflict , the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering urged the eu to be united on the issue . " the eu has to deal with russia in a united manner , with determination and at the same time be ready for a dialogue , " poettering told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . poettering also warned against scrapping the eu 's strategic partnership with russia . " plans to isolate russia wo n't lead anywhere .
you ca n't isolate a member of the un security council . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski has pooh-poohed the idea of the eu having a common stance on russia however , polish president lech kaczynski on saturday accused paris and berlin of going too soft on russia because of their commercial ties with that country . in an interview , kaczynski said that european union policy was being decided by paris and berlin , without taking into consideration the views of the new eu members that were once under moscow 's control during the cold war . " saying that the european union has a common policy towards russia is a joke .
because what policy would that be - submissiveness ? " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nation has since long been scoring points in culture , but now the country is broke and is rethinking the preservation of cultural monuments . milan native simona cagno is worried about churches and historical palaces that are disintegrating all over italy right in front of her .
" i do n't know what i should say about this , " she said .
" i ca n't seem to find the words . "
private leasing and selling " instead of expensive restoration is now apparently the word from rome .
in other words : getting rid of monuments instead of holding onto them .
in verona , three palaces and one former convent are about to be auctioned off so that the city can afford a new parking garage for trade show visitors .
have the italian authorities lost their minds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's government is doing some belt-tightening in sicily , the region is planning to privately rent the world-famous temple of agrigento for the next 30 years .
" it just makes me scream and ask : ' how much further will italy sink ? " ' said gottfried wagner with disgust .
an historian , music scientist , writer and opera conductor , richard wagner 's great-grandson has been living in italy for almost 30 years .
the country has produced the greatest painters , composers and architects not just for europe , but for world history as well , wagner said .

the nation has since long been scoring points in culture , but now the country is broke and is rethinking the preservation of cultural monuments . milan native simona cagno is worried about churches and historical palaces that are disintegrating all over italy right in front of her .
" i do n't know what i should say about this , " she said .
" i ca n't seem to find the words . "
private leasing and selling " instead of expensive restoration is now apparently the word from rome .
in other words : getting rid of monuments instead of holding onto them .

but hamburg came back well to earn a deserved point in an entertaining game thanks to a paolo guerrero header and a piotr trochowski penalty . although there were plus points in the performance for klinsmann , injury-hit bayern were often second best to a bright hamburg side who under new coach martin jol sought to go forward from the start .
klinsmann said the bayern team had taken " a good step forward " but there was " a lot of work still to do . " " of course as coach you want three points in your first game , " he said .
" we had hoped to go 3-1 in front directly after the break but unfortunately hamburg got the penalty to make it 2-2 .
we had some problems in the first 10 or 15 minutes but managed to get two goals in front only to give it away .
the various parts of the team played better together and the fine tuning is coming along .
hamburg played well , had their chances and the result was a fair one . " we are still in the early phase and at the moment we are not in a position to put an opponent under pressure , " he added .
" our combination play is n't together yet but this will come automatically with improved fitness in the coming weeks .
we have to improve from week to week . " perfect beginning hamburg began strongly and the lively trochowski fired an 11th-minute cross-shot from the left which struck the post with michael rensing in goal beaten .
but the visitors were caught napping a minute later from a throw-in by philipp lahm who sent ze roberto down the left .
the brazilian cut the ball back and schweinsteiger raced in to drive the ball into the net . four minutes later bayern were awarded a penalty when dutch defender joris mathijsen had his arms around schweinsteiger , and podolski sent goalkeeper frank rost the wrong way from the spot kick . it was the perfect begin for bayern who were missing several injured first-choice players including france midfielder franck ribery , italy striker luca toni , turkey midfielder haltin altintop and argentina defender martin demechelis . however the shirt-sleeved klinsmann was often on the touchline with instructions as hamburg continued to use the ball well in midfield and find space to threaten an uncertain bayern defense . hamburg back in the game new captain david jarolim and trochowski , a former bayern player , more than adequately filled the gap created by the departure of rafael van der vaart to real madrid , with dutch international nigel de jong a firm anchor in defensive midfield . in the 25th minute , hamburg were back in the game when trochowski whipped in a cross from the right and former bayern striker guerrero was left unmarked to head the ball firmly down into the net . podolski had a glorious opportunity to put bayern further ahead but blasted the ball over the bar four minutes after the break , while hamburg came even closer a minute late when ivica olic struck the post . however the equalizer was n't long coming .
referee thorsten kinhoefer again pointed to the spot for a holding offence when bayern right-back christian lell was adjudged to have tugged at olic , and trochowski stepped up to coolly convert from the spot for the 57th-minute equalizer . jol said he was pleased with his team 's fightback . " when you are 2-0 behind you can be satisfied with the result , " he said .
" we should have been in front but were not careful and conceded the first goal .
it was disappointing to be 2-0 down but i think the penalty was ok . " the bundesliga continues with six matches on saturday and two on sunday . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hundreds of british olympic officials preparing to host the olympic games in 2012 have been sent to china to learn from the beijing hosts how the chinese are organizing the event . british olympic officials will be meeting chinese organizers and visiting all the main locations in order to learn how to cope with tens of thousands of athletes , journalists and supporters .
referring to the beijing olympics , paul deighton , chief executive of the london organising committee of the olympic games -lrb- locog -rrb- , was quoted by british media as saying , " i 'm not sure how many other countries would have either the resources or the control of the resources to be able to put them behind an event like this . "
" i think london is much more likely to the model for the games in the future , " he said .
nevertheless , the officials will most probably be looking at how the host organizers deal with security and transport , especially since the july 7 , 2005 terrorist bombings on the london underground took place the day after it was announced that london had been chosen to host the olympics in 2012 .
growing criticism in london bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london mayor boris johnson wants a lasting legacy in an interview with the financial times newspaper , published tuesday aug .
12 , mayor of london boris johnson voiced his concerns that not enough work has been done to ensure the legacy of the games .
" there are … i think , serious questions to be asked about the legacy value of some of the sites and some of the venues , " johnson said .
" i want to make sure that we can alchemize them into gold for london for 50 years to come , and that is going to take some pretty crunchy work . "
after the huge delays in building the new wembley stadium and the squandered investments in the millenium dome , london 's olympic projects are being met with growing skepticism .
the opposition political parties have also criticized the decision to send so many officials to beijing , arguing that little is to be learned from china because of the huge difference in budgets .
budgetary differences negate comparisons bildunterschrift : london is unlikely to be able to compete financially with the extravagance of beijing britain 's budget for the olympic games has already almost trebled from a predicted 3.4 billion pounds -lrb- 4.3 billion euros , $ 6.5 billion -rrb- to 9.3 billion pounds -lrb- $ 17.8 billion , 12 billion euros -rrb- .
by contrast it has been reported that , by the end of the games , china will have spent over 20 billion pounds -lrb- 25 billion euros , $ 39 billion -rrb- .
this has led to more general questions of whether it is at all useful to look to other countries ' examples when preparing to host the games .
officials in london have stressed the unique nature of each olympics based on the location and have also said how london has great potential to set its own standard .
boris johnson 's comments add to the concerns that the massive new building projects for the olympics may not provide lasting value for the poorer areas of east london where most of the sites are being built .
one of the main aims of hosting the olympics was to regenerate the area with a legacy of good sports facilities and more inspiration for young people to play sport .
neither boris johnson nor british prime minister gordon brown went to the opening ceremony in beijing , although both are going to the closing ceremony when the baton will be passed on to london . dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.08.2008 eu minister calls for closer russia ties after caucasus war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over dealing with a stronger , resurgent russia georgia and russia have accepted a french-brokered caucasus peace plan .
dw spoke to luxembourg 's foreign minister asselborn about the divisions within the eu on the conflict and dealing with an assertive russia . on wednesday this week , you spent several hours discussing the situation in the caucasus with your european colleagues .
there was talk of a european peace mission .
what exactly is this about ?
jean asselborn : that is an interesting question : how can the european union contribute ?
we need to be present in the country .
but how can we be present ?
we can think about two or three things now .
for example , we can act as a monitor by sending police organized under the european flag to follow the situation ..
but no troops , no soldiers ?
if there are troops - and this is the second thing i wanted to say - then i feel that needs to be decided within the framework of the united nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asselborn insists that a solid partnership with russia is essential where does the eu stand on the future status of the south ossetia and abkhazia provinces that officially belong to georgia ?
we have avoided talking about this and i will also avoid discussing it with you .
it 's one the points where we said that we as the european union will of course contribute in negotiations , in a sort of mediation or intervention .
and we have said from the very beginning what should happen with this .
in any case we are backing the integrity of georgian territory .
but were the eu foreign ministers in agreement about who is to blame for the conflict ?
no , we avoided the question of blame .
if we got bogged down in playing the blame game , we would have lost a lot of time .
we would have never agreed on anything and that would n't have solved anything anyhow .
we are not judges in the european union .
but some countries , the baltic states and poland in particular , have clearly demonstrated solidarity with georgia while the german foreign minister , for example , warned against judging russia too quickly .
what does this mean then for the planned new strategic partnership agreement between the eu and russia ?
i think it would be a fatal mistake to break off this partnership .
i do not find it 100 percent bad that the baltic states and poland have taken this stance .
but you could still see and feel that the eu presidency - currently held by france , it could have been another country speaking on behalf of the european union - is calling the shots .
bildunterschrift : and we also need to know that we have no political interest in ducking when the us and russia are involved in a verbal war .
we have to show that we are important in our own right .
we can do that with our solidarity which of course we then need to demonstrate .
the european union has more inhabitants than russia and the us put together .
we are a big player in the global economy .
politically too , we are a very important factor when we present a united front .
as the european union , we must stick to the partnership with russia , even after these recent events which of course do not please us .
we need to enhance this partnership so that one day we wo n't have these situations any more .
to what extent can the european union function efficiently and as a united force without the lisbon treaty ?
the european union can function coherently with regard to foreign policy even without the lisbon treaty .
and we also need to remember that with the lisbon treaty , nothing fundamental changes in the bloc 's foreign policy .
foreign policy will remain the most difficult area in the european union in the next ten years , even with the lisbon treaty .
european foreign policy is more than the adding-up of national interests .
it 's a question of political will , not about a treaty .
we need to work on that and we also need to judge ourselves based on that . interview : susanne henn -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hundreds of british olympic officials preparing to host the olympic games in 2012 have been sent to china to learn from the beijing hosts how the chinese are organizing the event . british olympic officials will be meeting chinese organizers and visiting all the main locations in order to learn how to cope with tens of thousands of athletes , journalists and supporters .
referring to the beijing olympics , paul deighton , chief executive of the london organising committee of the olympic games -lrb- locog -rrb- , was quoted by british media as saying , " i 'm not sure how many other countries would have either the resources or the control of the resources to be able to put them behind an event like this . "
" i think london is much more likely to the model for the games in the future , " he said .
nevertheless , the officials will most probably be looking at how the host organizers deal with security and transport , especially since the july 7 , 2005 terrorist bombings on the london underground took place the day after it was announced that london had been chosen to host the olympics in 2012 .
growing criticism in london bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london mayor boris johnson wants a lasting legacy in an interview with the financial times newspaper , published tuesday aug .
12 , mayor of london boris johnson voiced his concerns that not enough work has been done to ensure the legacy of the games .
" there are … i think , serious questions to be asked about the legacy value of some of the sites and some of the venues , " johnson said .
" i want to make sure that we can alchemize them into gold for london for 50 years to come , and that is going to take some pretty crunchy work . "
after the huge delays in building the new wembley stadium and the squandered investments in the millenium dome , london 's olympic projects are being met with growing skepticism .
the opposition political parties have also criticized the decision to send so many officials to beijing , arguing that little is to be learned from china because of the huge difference in budgets .

by contrast it has been reported that , by the end of the games , china will have spent over 20 billion pounds -lrb- 25 billion euros , $ 39 billion -rrb- .
this has led to more general questions of whether it is at all useful to look to other countries ' examples when preparing to host the games .
officials in london have stressed the unique nature of each olympics based on the location and have also said how london has great potential to set its own standard .
boris johnson 's comments add to the concerns that the massive new building projects for the olympics may not provide lasting value for the poorer areas of east london where most of the sites are being built .
one of the main aims of hosting the olympics was to regenerate the area with a legacy of good sports facilities and more inspiration for young people to play sport .

the nation has since long been scoring points in culture , but now the country is broke and is rethinking the preservation of cultural monuments . milan native simona cagno is worried about churches and historical palaces that are disintegrating all over italy right in front of her .
" i do n't know what i should say about this , " she said .
" i ca n't seem to find the words . "
private leasing and selling " instead of expensive restoration is now apparently the word from rome .
in other words : getting rid of monuments instead of holding onto them .
in verona , three palaces and one former convent are about to be auctioned off so that the city can afford a new parking garage for trade show visitors .
have the italian authorities lost their minds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's government is doing some belt-tightening in sicily , the region is planning to privately rent the world-famous temple of agrigento for the next 30 years .
" it just makes me scream and ask : ' how much further will italy sink ? " ' said gottfried wagner with disgust .
an historian , music scientist , writer and opera conductor , richard wagner 's great-grandson has been living in italy for almost 30 years .
the country has produced the greatest painters , composers and architects not just for europe , but for world history as well , wagner said .
" where will we end up if culture is only abused for political prostitution ? " he asked .
has the cultural legacy been lost ?
silvio berlusconi would be more than happy to silence the skeptics in italy - whether they are judges , monument preservationists or artists .
there has n't been talk of an interesting cultural sector for a long time now .
" nothing considerable is taking place anymore that i would probably appreciate , " wagner said , adding that in the past , there was a real sense of excitement and now that no longer exists .
" and this is the cultural and spiritual situation at the moment in italy and i could say this a thousand times over : it 's frightening , " he said .
trash instead of culture - what started in berlusconi 's television programs has since spread through the entire country .
italy , the cradle of the renaissance and of the communal city character , is trampling on its cultural legacy - a legacy that attracts millions of tourists to the country . no money for culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous constructions are set to be leased they marvel at leonardo da vinci 's last supper , for example , and most are overwhelmed by the 15th century mural painting 's beauty .
the fresco has been restored for 20 years to help stop its slow deterioration .
private sponsors carry the costs for this almost exclusively .
the ministry of cultural assets , which would normally take responsibility for the " last supper " did not have enough money .
now the situation is even more depressing .

today department stores account for barely 3.5 percent of sales in the retail industry and market share keeps dipping . household names such as wehmeyer and hertie are fast disappearing , and wehmeyer 's former rival , the clothing chain sinn-leffers , recently declared bankruptcy .

but hamburg came back well to earn a deserved point in an entertaining game thanks to a paolo guerrero header and a piotr trochowski penalty . although there were plus points in the performance for klinsmann , injury-hit bayern were often second best to a bright hamburg side who under new coach martin jol sought to go forward from the start .
klinsmann said the bayern team had taken " a good step forward " but there was " a lot of work still to do . " " of course as coach you want three points in your first game , " he said .
" we had hoped to go 3-1 in front directly after the break but unfortunately hamburg got the penalty to make it 2-2 .
we had some problems in the first 10 or 15 minutes but managed to get two goals in front only to give it away .
the various parts of the team played better together and the fine tuning is coming along .
hamburg played well , had their chances and the result was a fair one . " we are still in the early phase and at the moment we are not in a position to put an opponent under pressure , " he added .
" our combination play is n't together yet but this will come automatically with improved fitness in the coming weeks .
we have to improve from week to week . " perfect beginning hamburg began strongly and the lively trochowski fired an 11th-minute cross-shot from the left which struck the post with michael rensing in goal beaten .
but the visitors were caught napping a minute later from a throw-in by philipp lahm who sent ze roberto down the left .
the brazilian cut the ball back and schweinsteiger raced in to drive the ball into the net . four minutes later bayern were awarded a penalty when dutch defender joris mathijsen had his arms around schweinsteiger , and podolski sent goalkeeper frank rost the wrong way from the spot kick . it was the perfect begin for bayern who were missing several injured first-choice players including france midfielder franck ribery , italy striker luca toni , turkey midfielder haltin altintop and argentina defender martin demechelis . however the shirt-sleeved klinsmann was often on the touchline with instructions as hamburg continued to use the ball well in midfield and find space to threaten an uncertain bayern defense . hamburg back in the game new captain david jarolim and trochowski , a former bayern player , more than adequately filled the gap created by the departure of rafael van der vaart to real madrid , with dutch international nigel de jong a firm anchor in defensive midfield . in the 25th minute , hamburg were back in the game when trochowski whipped in a cross from the right and former bayern striker guerrero was left unmarked to head the ball firmly down into the net . podolski had a glorious opportunity to put bayern further ahead but blasted the ball over the bar four minutes after the break , while hamburg came even closer a minute late when ivica olic struck the post . however the equalizer was n't long coming .
referee thorsten kinhoefer again pointed to the spot for a holding offence when bayern right-back christian lell was adjudged to have tugged at olic , and trochowski stepped up to coolly convert from the spot for the 57th-minute equalizer . jol said he was pleased with his team 's fightback . " when you are 2-0 behind you can be satisfied with the result , " he said .
" we should have been in front but were not careful and conceded the first goal .
it was disappointing to be 2-0 down but i think the penalty was ok . " the bundesliga continues with six matches on saturday and two on sunday . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 16.08.2008 shopping malls replace old department stores in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxury retailers such as berlin 's kadewe are doing fine , but not ordinary department stores the ordinary department store is gradually disappearing in germany due to competition from online shopping and suburban malls .
mass discounters and high end luxury department stores however are not affected by the trend . there used to be a well-known commercial jingle in the retail business .
" kaufhof offers everything under one roof a thousand times . " department stores used to be a huge draw for shoppers in the inner cities .
but the whole concept in which all shopping needs could be met in one huge store does n't seem to be working anymore .
customers are abandoning the idea , and big chain department stores find themselves in financial straits these days . in the 1970s , 12 percent of all retail revenues landed in the coffers of nationwide chains such as karstadt , kaufhof , hertie and horten and co .
today department stores account for barely 3.5 percent of sales in the retail industry and market share keeps dipping . household names such as wehmeyer and hertie are fast disappearing , and wehmeyer 's former rival , the clothing chain sinn-leffers , recently declared bankruptcy .
even germany 's traditional chains such as karstadt and kaufhof are feeling the winds of change . german household names disappearing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertie , a german household name is barely surviving now already in the 1990s , department stores were experiencing the financial squeeze .
cash and carry discounters in the suburbs and countryside were cutting into their business .
that was when hertie and horten & co. had gone under . the hertie name made an attempted comeback under different management , but is insolvent again .
only about half of the 72 remaining hertie stores are expected to survive . interestingly , neither the mass discount chains nor the upscale , luxury department stores are hurting ; only the ones such as kaufhof and karstadt in the moderate price segment of the retail market . “ this loss in the middle segment has been creeping up over the last 15 years or so , " said marco atzberger of the retail research institute -lrb- ehi -rrb- in cologne , who explained that too little has been invested name recognition , product lines and giving the stores a facelift . " and such incremental developments are always the most dangerous , since you do n't notice them until it is too late to do something about it , ” he said . competition squeezes out traditional department store what 's missing in such middle range department stores is an ambiance that seduces shoppers .
otherwise they need to develop new retail concepts , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : department stores with high overhead can not compete with online vendors another problem is competition from the internet and the downward pressure on prices from online shopping .
the discerning german consumer , according to atzberger is very price conscious and department stores with their much high overhead costs would have a harder time offering bargains than a company selling goods online . at the high-end of the retail spectrum , luxury department stores in the best neighborhoods of big german cities such as kadewe in berlin or alsterhaus in hamburg offer a unique ambiance and are able to entice shoppers by appealing to their emotions rather than their pocketbook , he said . us style shopping mall comes to germany “ we are seeing more and more of the ‘ shop in shop ' concept , which means that a department store chain sublets space to a specialty stores such as wmf , which sells household goods and cookery or a clothing brand , " atzberger said .
" this concept is better known abroad than in germany .
and it works abroad . " bildunterschrift : there are roughly 400 shopping malls now , and the numbers keep rising in germany the decline of the department store has also been accelerated by the introduction of american style suburban shopping malls with numerous specialty shops all under one roof .
roughly 400 of such shopping centers now exist in all of germany and 15 more are expected to be opening their doors next year , according to atzberger 's retail institute . even the ownership structure of such retail space is different from the traditional department store .
financial groups invest in the real estate and hire a management team to rent out space to individual retailers . “ the management takes care of everything , " atzberger said .
" the opening hours are all coordinated with all the different stores , free parking space is provided for customers .
they take care of the retail mix to ensure that there is a wide range of stores that complement each other in terms of price range and variety .
that is one thing you do n't find in the inner cities , and a drawback for the city department store . " rolf wenkel -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hundreds of british olympic officials preparing to host the olympic games in 2012 have been sent to china to learn from the beijing hosts how the chinese are organizing the event . british olympic officials will be meeting chinese organizers and visiting all the main locations in order to learn how to cope with tens of thousands of athletes , journalists and supporters .
referring to the beijing olympics , paul deighton , chief executive of the london organising committee of the olympic games -lrb- locog -rrb- , was quoted by british media as saying , " i 'm not sure how many other countries would have either the resources or the control of the resources to be able to put them behind an event like this . "
" i think london is much more likely to the model for the games in the future , " he said .
nevertheless , the officials will most probably be looking at how the host organizers deal with security and transport , especially since the july 7 , 2005 terrorist bombings on the london underground took place the day after it was announced that london had been chosen to host the olympics in 2012 .
growing criticism in london bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london mayor boris johnson wants a lasting legacy in an interview with the financial times newspaper , published tuesday aug .
12 , mayor of london boris johnson voiced his concerns that not enough work has been done to ensure the legacy of the games .
" there are … i think , serious questions to be asked about the legacy value of some of the sites and some of the venues , " johnson said .
" i want to make sure that we can alchemize them into gold for london for 50 years to come , and that is going to take some pretty crunchy work . "
after the huge delays in building the new wembley stadium and the squandered investments in the millenium dome , london 's olympic projects are being met with growing skepticism .
the opposition political parties have also criticized the decision to send so many officials to beijing , arguing that little is to be learned from china because of the huge difference in budgets .

by contrast it has been reported that , by the end of the games , china will have spent over 20 billion pounds -lrb- 25 billion euros , $ 39 billion -rrb- .
this has led to more general questions of whether it is at all useful to look to other countries ' examples when preparing to host the games .
officials in london have stressed the unique nature of each olympics based on the location and have also said how london has great potential to set its own standard .
boris johnson 's comments add to the concerns that the massive new building projects for the olympics may not provide lasting value for the poorer areas of east london where most of the sites are being built .
one of the main aims of hosting the olympics was to regenerate the area with a legacy of good sports facilities and more inspiration for young people to play sport .

hundreds of british olympic officials preparing to host the olympic games in 2012 have been sent to china to learn from the beijing hosts how the chinese are organizing the event . british olympic officials will be meeting chinese organizers and visiting all the main locations in order to learn how to cope with tens of thousands of athletes , journalists and supporters .
referring to the beijing olympics , paul deighton , chief executive of the london organising committee of the olympic games -lrb- locog -rrb- , was quoted by british media as saying , " i 'm not sure how many other countries would have either the resources or the control of the resources to be able to put them behind an event like this . "
" i think london is much more likely to the model for the games in the future , " he said .
nevertheless , the officials will most probably be looking at how the host organizers deal with security and transport , especially since the july 7 , 2005 terrorist bombings on the london underground took place the day after it was announced that london had been chosen to host the olympics in 2012 .
growing criticism in london bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london mayor boris johnson wants a lasting legacy in an interview with the financial times newspaper , published tuesday aug .
12 , mayor of london boris johnson voiced his concerns that not enough work has been done to ensure the legacy of the games .
" there are … i think , serious questions to be asked about the legacy value of some of the sites and some of the venues , " johnson said .
" i want to make sure that we can alchemize them into gold for london for 50 years to come , and that is going to take some pretty crunchy work . "
after the huge delays in building the new wembley stadium and the squandered investments in the millenium dome , london 's olympic projects are being met with growing skepticism .
the opposition political parties have also criticized the decision to send so many officials to beijing , arguing that little is to be learned from china because of the huge difference in budgets .
budgetary differences negate comparisons bildunterschrift : london is unlikely to be able to compete financially with the extravagance of beijing britain 's budget for the olympic games has already almost trebled from a predicted 3.4 billion pounds -lrb- 4.3 billion euros , $ 6.5 billion -rrb- to 9.3 billion pounds -lrb- $ 17.8 billion , 12 billion euros -rrb- .
by contrast it has been reported that , by the end of the games , china will have spent over 20 billion pounds -lrb- 25 billion euros , $ 39 billion -rrb- .
this has led to more general questions of whether it is at all useful to look to other countries ' examples when preparing to host the games .
officials in london have stressed the unique nature of each olympics based on the location and have also said how london has great potential to set its own standard .
boris johnson 's comments add to the concerns that the massive new building projects for the olympics may not provide lasting value for the poorer areas of east london where most of the sites are being built .
one of the main aims of hosting the olympics was to regenerate the area with a legacy of good sports facilities and more inspiration for young people to play sport .

nevertheless , the officials will most probably be looking at how the host organizers deal with security and transport , especially since the july 7 , 2005 terrorist bombings on the london underground took place the day after it was announced that london had been chosen to host the olympics in 2012 .
growing criticism in london bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london mayor boris johnson wants a lasting legacy in an interview with the financial times newspaper , published tuesday aug .
12 , mayor of london boris johnson voiced his concerns that not enough work has been done to ensure the legacy of the games .
" there are … i think , serious questions to be asked about the legacy value of some of the sites and some of the venues , " johnson said .
" i want to make sure that we can alchemize them into gold for london for 50 years to come , and that is going to take some pretty crunchy work . "
after the huge delays in building the new wembley stadium and the squandered investments in the millenium dome , london 's olympic projects are being met with growing skepticism .
the opposition political parties have also criticized the decision to send so many officials to beijing , arguing that little is to be learned from china because of the huge difference in budgets .
budgetary differences negate comparisons bildunterschrift : london is unlikely to be able to compete financially with the extravagance of beijing britain 's budget for the olympic games has already almost trebled from a predicted 3.4 billion pounds -lrb- 4.3 billion euros , $ 6.5 billion -rrb- to 9.3 billion pounds -lrb- $ 17.8 billion , 12 billion euros -rrb- .
by contrast it has been reported that , by the end of the games , china will have spent over 20 billion pounds -lrb- 25 billion euros , $ 39 billion -rrb- .
this has led to more general questions of whether it is at all useful to look to other countries ' examples when preparing to host the games .
officials in london have stressed the unique nature of each olympics based on the location and have also said how london has great potential to set its own standard .
boris johnson 's comments add to the concerns that the massive new building projects for the olympics may not provide lasting value for the poorer areas of east london where most of the sites are being built .
one of the main aims of hosting the olympics was to regenerate the area with a legacy of good sports facilities and more inspiration for young people to play sport .
neither boris johnson nor british prime minister gordon brown went to the opening ceremony in beijing , although both are going to the closing ceremony when the baton will be passed on to london . dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the whole concept in which all shopping needs could be met in one huge store does n't seem to be working anymore .
customers are abandoning the idea , and big chain department stores find themselves in financial straits these days . in the 1970s , 12 percent of all retail revenues landed in the coffers of nationwide chains such as karstadt , kaufhof , hertie and horten and co .
today department stores account for barely 3.5 percent of sales in the retail industry and market share keeps dipping . household names such as wehmeyer and hertie are fast disappearing , and wehmeyer 's former rival , the clothing chain sinn-leffers , recently declared bankruptcy .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : department stores with high overhead can not compete with online vendors another problem is competition from the internet and the downward pressure on prices from online shopping .
the discerning german consumer , according to atzberger is very price conscious and department stores with their much high overhead costs would have a harder time offering bargains than a company selling goods online . at the high-end of the retail spectrum , luxury department stores in the best neighborhoods of big german cities such as kadewe in berlin or alsterhaus in hamburg offer a unique ambiance and are able to entice shoppers by appealing to their emotions rather than their pocketbook , he said . us style shopping mall comes to germany “ we are seeing more and more of the ‘ shop in shop ' concept , which means that a department store chain sublets space to a specialty stores such as wmf , which sells household goods and cookery or a clothing brand , " atzberger said .

a controversial citizenship test in one german state especially caught their attention . members of the united nations committee for the eradication of racial discrimination -lrb- cerd -rrb- on friday , aug .
15 , said that they were concerned about citizenship application questions targeted at muslims in the southwestern german state of baden-wuerttemberg . " the committee recommends that the federal government encourage the use of questionnaires without discriminatory content , for all applicants for citizenship , " said the committee , according to afp news agency . baden-wuerttemberg , home to car maker daimler 's mercedes benz , apparently requires citizens of the 57 member states of the organization of the islamic conference to answer specific questions when they apply for german citizenship . german test also under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian edathy wants the citizenship test to be reworked a nationwide citizenship test which is to become compulsory for immigrants and includes questions seeking the applicant 's views on forced marriages and homosexuality has also come under criticism . earlier this week , sebastian edathy , the social democratic chairman of the parliament 's domestic affairs committee , asked the federal interior ministry to rework the test which is made up of 300 potential questions . edathy said that many questions had wrong multiple choice answers that were meant to be correct and that some questions were completely irrelevant for a citizenship test .
ministry officials have rejected the claim and said that the test in its present form will take effect next month . the un committee also described as " regrettable " that many migrants who have lived in germany for many years , still failed to get citizenship . " germany should facilitate acquisition of german citizenship by such long-term residents and persons born in germany in order to promote their integration , " the committee said . growing racism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minster wolfgang schaeuble created the islam conference to improve relations while cerd members applauded germany for introducing anti-discrimination legislation two years ago and setting up a so-called islam conference , they also criticized a growing number of racist incidents in germany , saying that the federal government was not doing enough to prevent them .
the committee found that jews , muslims , sinti and roma as well as african asylum seekers had been attacked . german justice ministry officials said that they would study the comments carefully , but stressed that germany was " actively engaged " in implementing eu anti-discrimination laws in germany .
germany 's national action plan against racism will be presented to the un high commissioner for human rights later this year . lack of integration ? in their report , cerd officials also wondered how germany wants to define itself as a " non-multi-ethnic state " as one fifth of the population has a migrant background and about 8 percent are foreigners without a german passport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people with migrant backgrounds have joined germany 's police pool cerd asked german officials to tell them whether these groups are integrated in agencies such as the police .
german officials , according to news reports , countered that the government 's policy was to " integrate , not assimilate " people with a migrant background . the anti-racism experts also bemoaned germany 's use of language when it comes to the law and officials agencies .
they also said that it was unfortunate that german law did n't see racist motives in connection with crimes as an aggravating factor .
cerd said that foreign victims of violence often receive less compensation money than germans . sinti and roma are in an especially bad position as they are discriminated against in the work place , in media coverage about them and when searching for apartments , cerd members said . the committee also criticized that children of asylum seekers in the states of hesse , baden-württemberg and saarland did not all attend school and that many children of migrant families had to attend special education schools . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke to luxembourg 's foreign minister asselborn about the divisions within the eu on the conflict and dealing with an assertive russia . on wednesday this week , you spent several hours discussing the situation in the caucasus with your european colleagues .
there was talk of a european peace mission .
what exactly is this about ?
jean asselborn : that is an interesting question : how can the european union contribute ?
we need to be present in the country .
but how can we be present ?
we can think about two or three things now .
for example , we can act as a monitor by sending police organized under the european flag to follow the situation ..
but no troops , no soldiers ?
if there are troops - and this is the second thing i wanted to say - then i feel that needs to be decided within the framework of the united nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asselborn insists that a solid partnership with russia is essential where does the eu stand on the future status of the south ossetia and abkhazia provinces that officially belong to georgia ?
we have avoided talking about this and i will also avoid discussing it with you .
it 's one the points where we said that we as the european union will of course contribute in negotiations , in a sort of mediation or intervention .
and we have said from the very beginning what should happen with this .
in any case we are backing the integrity of georgian territory .
but were the eu foreign ministers in agreement about who is to blame for the conflict ?
no , we avoided the question of blame .
if we got bogged down in playing the blame game , we would have lost a lot of time .
we would have never agreed on anything and that would n't have solved anything anyhow .
we are not judges in the european union .
but some countries , the baltic states and poland in particular , have clearly demonstrated solidarity with georgia while the german foreign minister , for example , warned against judging russia too quickly .
what does this mean then for the planned new strategic partnership agreement between the eu and russia ?
i think it would be a fatal mistake to break off this partnership .
i do not find it 100 percent bad that the baltic states and poland have taken this stance .
but you could still see and feel that the eu presidency - currently held by france , it could have been another country speaking on behalf of the european union - is calling the shots .
bildunterschrift : and we also need to know that we have no political interest in ducking when the us and russia are involved in a verbal war .
we have to show that we are important in our own right .
we can do that with our solidarity which of course we then need to demonstrate .
the european union has more inhabitants than russia and the us put together .
we are a big player in the global economy .
politically too , we are a very important factor when we present a united front .
as the european union , we must stick to the partnership with russia , even after these recent events which of course do not please us .
we need to enhance this partnership so that one day we wo n't have these situations any more .
to what extent can the european union function efficiently and as a united force without the lisbon treaty ?
the european union can function coherently with regard to foreign policy even without the lisbon treaty .
and we also need to remember that with the lisbon treaty , nothing fundamental changes in the bloc 's foreign policy .
foreign policy will remain the most difficult area in the european union in the next ten years , even with the lisbon treaty .
european foreign policy is more than the adding-up of national interests .
it 's a question of political will , not about a treaty .
we need to work on that and we also need to judge ourselves based on that . interview : susanne henn -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's one the points where we said that we as the european union will of course contribute in negotiations , in a sort of mediation or intervention .
and we have said from the very beginning what should happen with this .
in any case we are backing the integrity of georgian territory .
but were the eu foreign ministers in agreement about who is to blame for the conflict ?
no , we avoided the question of blame .
if we got bogged down in playing the blame game , we would have lost a lot of time .
we would have never agreed on anything and that would n't have solved anything anyhow .
we are not judges in the european union .
but some countries , the baltic states and poland in particular , have clearly demonstrated solidarity with georgia while the german foreign minister , for example , warned against judging russia too quickly .
what does this mean then for the planned new strategic partnership agreement between the eu and russia ?
i think it would be a fatal mistake to break off this partnership .
i do not find it 100 percent bad that the baltic states and poland have taken this stance .
but you could still see and feel that the eu presidency - currently held by france , it could have been another country speaking on behalf of the european union - is calling the shots .
bildunterschrift : and we also need to know that we have no political interest in ducking when the us and russia are involved in a verbal war .
we have to show that we are important in our own right .
we can do that with our solidarity which of course we then need to demonstrate .
the european union has more inhabitants than russia and the us put together .
we are a big player in the global economy .
politically too , we are a very important factor when we present a united front .
as the european union , we must stick to the partnership with russia , even after these recent events which of course do not please us .
we need to enhance this partnership so that one day we wo n't have these situations any more .
to what extent can the european union function efficiently and as a united force without the lisbon treaty ?
the european union can function coherently with regard to foreign policy even without the lisbon treaty .
and we also need to remember that with the lisbon treaty , nothing fundamental changes in the bloc 's foreign policy .
foreign policy will remain the most difficult area in the european union in the next ten years , even with the lisbon treaty .
european foreign policy is more than the adding-up of national interests .
it 's a question of political will , not about a treaty .
we need to work on that and we also need to judge ourselves based on that . interview : susanne henn -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke to luxembourg 's foreign minister asselborn about the divisions within the eu on the conflict and dealing with an assertive russia . on wednesday this week , you spent several hours discussing the situation in the caucasus with your european colleagues .
there was talk of a european peace mission .
what exactly is this about ?
jean asselborn : that is an interesting question : how can the european union contribute ?
we need to be present in the country .
but how can we be present ?
we can think about two or three things now .
for example , we can act as a monitor by sending police organized under the european flag to follow the situation ..
but no troops , no soldiers ?
if there are troops - and this is the second thing i wanted to say - then i feel that needs to be decided within the framework of the united nations .

the nation has since long been scoring points in culture , but now the country is broke and is rethinking the preservation of cultural monuments . milan native simona cagno is worried about churches and historical palaces that are disintegrating all over italy right in front of her .
" i do n't know what i should say about this , " she said .
" i ca n't seem to find the words . "
private leasing and selling " instead of expensive restoration is now apparently the word from rome .
in other words : getting rid of monuments instead of holding onto them .
in verona , three palaces and one former convent are about to be auctioned off so that the city can afford a new parking garage for trade show visitors .
have the italian authorities lost their minds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's government is doing some belt-tightening in sicily , the region is planning to privately rent the world-famous temple of agrigento for the next 30 years .
" it just makes me scream and ask : ' how much further will italy sink ? " ' said gottfried wagner with disgust .
an historian , music scientist , writer and opera conductor , richard wagner 's great-grandson has been living in italy for almost 30 years .
the country has produced the greatest painters , composers and architects not just for europe , but for world history as well , wagner said .
" where will we end up if culture is only abused for political prostitution ? " he asked .
has the cultural legacy been lost ?
silvio berlusconi would be more than happy to silence the skeptics in italy - whether they are judges , monument preservationists or artists .
there has n't been talk of an interesting cultural sector for a long time now .
" nothing considerable is taking place anymore that i would probably appreciate , " wagner said , adding that in the past , there was a real sense of excitement and now that no longer exists .
" and this is the cultural and spiritual situation at the moment in italy and i could say this a thousand times over : it 's frightening , " he said .
trash instead of culture - what started in berlusconi 's television programs has since spread through the entire country .
italy , the cradle of the renaissance and of the communal city character , is trampling on its cultural legacy - a legacy that attracts millions of tourists to the country . no money for culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous constructions are set to be leased they marvel at leonardo da vinci 's last supper , for example , and most are overwhelmed by the 15th century mural painting 's beauty .
the fresco has been restored for 20 years to help stop its slow deterioration .
private sponsors carry the costs for this almost exclusively .
the ministry of cultural assets , which would normally take responsibility for the " last supper " did not have enough money .
now the situation is even more depressing .
not even 3 percent of italian households will donate money for the maintenance of monuments .
and the cutbacks that the berlusconi government passed via a finance decree leave the budget of the ministry of cultural assets even smaller .
" the funds for cultural assets and museums have degenerated like the political interest in culture , " said salvatore settis , italy 's most well-known monument preservationist .
the internationally-recognized art historian and director of the state-run ivy-league-type school " ecole normale " in pisa has calculated that the savings totaling 700 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- over three years mean less for the ministry of cultural assets . no sense of culture ?
in answer to the tentative question of where the minister should still make cuts , antonio leone from the governing party alliance " volk der freiheit " -lrb- people of freedom -rrb- said : " the minister must now set priorities .
the ministry received a certain budget and it has to make do with it . "
it is the minister 's job to make cuts where cuts can be made , and not to make cuts where they ca n't be made , he added . kirstin hausen -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but hamburg came back well to earn a deserved point in an entertaining game thanks to a paolo guerrero header and a piotr trochowski penalty . although there were plus points in the performance for klinsmann , injury-hit bayern were often second best to a bright hamburg side who under new coach martin jol sought to go forward from the start .
klinsmann said the bayern team had taken " a good step forward " but there was " a lot of work still to do . " " of course as coach you want three points in your first game , " he said .
" we had hoped to go 3-1 in front directly after the break but unfortunately hamburg got the penalty to make it 2-2 .
we had some problems in the first 10 or 15 minutes but managed to get two goals in front only to give it away .
the various parts of the team played better together and the fine tuning is coming along .
hamburg played well , had their chances and the result was a fair one . " we are still in the early phase and at the moment we are not in a position to put an opponent under pressure , " he added .
" our combination play is n't together yet but this will come automatically with improved fitness in the coming weeks .

the brazilian cut the ball back and schweinsteiger raced in to drive the ball into the net . four minutes later bayern were awarded a penalty when dutch defender joris mathijsen had his arms around schweinsteiger , and podolski sent goalkeeper frank rost the wrong way from the spot kick . it was the perfect begin for bayern who were missing several injured first-choice players including france midfielder franck ribery , italy striker luca toni , turkey midfielder haltin altintop and argentina defender martin demechelis . however the shirt-sleeved klinsmann was often on the touchline with instructions as hamburg continued to use the ball well in midfield and find space to threaten an uncertain bayern defense . hamburg back in the game new captain david jarolim and trochowski , a former bayern player , more than adequately filled the gap created by the departure of rafael van der vaart to real madrid , with dutch international nigel de jong a firm anchor in defensive midfield . in the 25th minute , hamburg were back in the game when trochowski whipped in a cross from the right and former bayern striker guerrero was left unmarked to head the ball firmly down into the net . podolski had a glorious opportunity to put bayern further ahead but blasted the ball over the bar four minutes after the break , while hamburg came even closer a minute late when ivica olic struck the post . however the equalizer was n't long coming .

but hamburg came back well to earn a deserved point in an entertaining game thanks to a paolo guerrero header and a piotr trochowski penalty . although there were plus points in the performance for klinsmann , injury-hit bayern were often second best to a bright hamburg side who under new coach martin jol sought to go forward from the start .
klinsmann said the bayern team had taken " a good step forward " but there was " a lot of work still to do . " " of course as coach you want three points in your first game , " he said .
" we had hoped to go 3-1 in front directly after the break but unfortunately hamburg got the penalty to make it 2-2 .

referee thorsten kinhoefer again pointed to the spot for a holding offence when bayern right-back christian lell was adjudged to have tugged at olic , and trochowski stepped up to coolly convert from the spot for the 57th-minute equalizer . jol said he was pleased with his team 's fightback .

a controversial citizenship test in one german state especially caught their attention . members of the united nations committee for the eradication of racial discrimination -lrb- cerd -rrb- on friday , aug .
15 , said that they were concerned about citizenship application questions targeted at muslims in the southwestern german state of baden-wuerttemberg . " the committee recommends that the federal government encourage the use of questionnaires without discriminatory content , for all applicants for citizenship , " said the committee , according to afp news agency . baden-wuerttemberg , home to car maker daimler 's mercedes benz , apparently requires citizens of the 57 member states of the organization of the islamic conference to answer specific questions when they apply for german citizenship . german test also under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian edathy wants the citizenship test to be reworked a nationwide citizenship test which is to become compulsory for immigrants and includes questions seeking the applicant 's views on forced marriages and homosexuality has also come under criticism . earlier this week , sebastian edathy , the social democratic chairman of the parliament 's domestic affairs committee , asked the federal interior ministry to rework the test which is made up of 300 potential questions . edathy said that many questions had wrong multiple choice answers that were meant to be correct and that some questions were completely irrelevant for a citizenship test .
ministry officials have rejected the claim and said that the test in its present form will take effect next month . the un committee also described as " regrettable " that many migrants who have lived in germany for many years , still failed to get citizenship . " germany should facilitate acquisition of german citizenship by such long-term residents and persons born in germany in order to promote their integration , " the committee said . growing racism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minster wolfgang schaeuble created the islam conference to improve relations while cerd members applauded germany for introducing anti-discrimination legislation two years ago and setting up a so-called islam conference , they also criticized a growing number of racist incidents in germany , saying that the federal government was not doing enough to prevent them .
the committee found that jews , muslims , sinti and roma as well as african asylum seekers had been attacked . german justice ministry officials said that they would study the comments carefully , but stressed that germany was " actively engaged " in implementing eu anti-discrimination laws in germany .
germany 's national action plan against racism will be presented to the un high commissioner for human rights later this year . lack of integration ? in their report , cerd officials also wondered how germany wants to define itself as a " non-multi-ethnic state " as one fifth of the population has a migrant background and about 8 percent are foreigners without a german passport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people with migrant backgrounds have joined germany 's police pool cerd asked german officials to tell them whether these groups are integrated in agencies such as the police .
german officials , according to news reports , countered that the government 's policy was to " integrate , not assimilate " people with a migrant background . the anti-racism experts also bemoaned germany 's use of language when it comes to the law and officials agencies .
they also said that it was unfortunate that german law did n't see racist motives in connection with crimes as an aggravating factor .
cerd said that foreign victims of violence often receive less compensation money than germans . sinti and roma are in an especially bad position as they are discriminated against in the work place , in media coverage about them and when searching for apartments , cerd members said . the committee also criticized that children of asylum seekers in the states of hesse , baden-württemberg and saarland did not all attend school and that many children of migrant families had to attend special education schools . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nation has since long been scoring points in culture , but now the country is broke and is rethinking the preservation of cultural monuments . milan native simona cagno is worried about churches and historical palaces that are disintegrating all over italy right in front of her .
" i do n't know what i should say about this , " she said .
" i ca n't seem to find the words . "
private leasing and selling " instead of expensive restoration is now apparently the word from rome .
in other words : getting rid of monuments instead of holding onto them .
in verona , three palaces and one former convent are about to be auctioned off so that the city can afford a new parking garage for trade show visitors .
have the italian authorities lost their minds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's government is doing some belt-tightening in sicily , the region is planning to privately rent the world-famous temple of agrigento for the next 30 years .
" it just makes me scream and ask : ' how much further will italy sink ? " ' said gottfried wagner with disgust .
an historian , music scientist , writer and opera conductor , richard wagner 's great-grandson has been living in italy for almost 30 years .
the country has produced the greatest painters , composers and architects not just for europe , but for world history as well , wagner said .
" where will we end up if culture is only abused for political prostitution ? " he asked .
has the cultural legacy been lost ?
silvio berlusconi would be more than happy to silence the skeptics in italy - whether they are judges , monument preservationists or artists .
there has n't been talk of an interesting cultural sector for a long time now .
" nothing considerable is taking place anymore that i would probably appreciate , " wagner said , adding that in the past , there was a real sense of excitement and now that no longer exists .
" and this is the cultural and spiritual situation at the moment in italy and i could say this a thousand times over : it 's frightening , " he said .
trash instead of culture - what started in berlusconi 's television programs has since spread through the entire country .
italy , the cradle of the renaissance and of the communal city character , is trampling on its cultural legacy - a legacy that attracts millions of tourists to the country . no money for culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous constructions are set to be leased they marvel at leonardo da vinci 's last supper , for example , and most are overwhelmed by the 15th century mural painting 's beauty .
the fresco has been restored for 20 years to help stop its slow deterioration .
private sponsors carry the costs for this almost exclusively .
the ministry of cultural assets , which would normally take responsibility for the " last supper " did not have enough money .
now the situation is even more depressing .
not even 3 percent of italian households will donate money for the maintenance of monuments .
and the cutbacks that the berlusconi government passed via a finance decree leave the budget of the ministry of cultural assets even smaller .
" the funds for cultural assets and museums have degenerated like the political interest in culture , " said salvatore settis , italy 's most well-known monument preservationist .
the internationally-recognized art historian and director of the state-run ivy-league-type school " ecole normale " in pisa has calculated that the savings totaling 700 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- over three years mean less for the ministry of cultural assets . no sense of culture ?
in answer to the tentative question of where the minister should still make cuts , antonio leone from the governing party alliance " volk der freiheit " -lrb- people of freedom -rrb- said : " the minister must now set priorities .
the ministry received a certain budget and it has to make do with it . "
it is the minister 's job to make cuts where cuts can be made , and not to make cuts where they ca n't be made , he added . kirstin hausen -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in an interview with german newsmagazine der spiegel that was published saturday , aug .
16 , schroeder said that the georgian invasion of south ossetia was " the moment that initiated the current hostilities . " he declined to comment on whether russia 's response was disproportionate , saying that military conflicts developed their own dynamic . schroeder 's successor , chancellor angela merkel , friday described the russian reaction as " disproportionate in some aspects . " nato membership now far away bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder and putin are still friends the former chancellor , who was a close friend while of then russian prime minister vladimir putin during his seven years in office , said georgia 's bid for nato membership was now further off than before . " imagine that we had been forced into military action on the side of georgia as a nato member , on the side of an obvious gambler , as one must describe saakashvili , " schroeder said . " i do n't believe russia is pursuing a policy of annexation and i also do n't believe that there will be a return to the previous status quo for south ossetia and abkhazia , " schroeder said , referring to the separatist georgian regions .
" that is out of the question . "
georgia and ukraine , which is also seeking membership of the us-led western alliance , had to resolve their internal difficulties first , he told der spiegel . western errors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west needs russia , schroeder says schroeder said the west had make " serious errors " in its policy toward russia , and western views of russia did not correspond with the reality there . the former chancellor , who heads the shareholders ' committee of nord stream , the russian-german company building a pipeline under the baltic sea to pipe russian gas directly from russia to germany , dismissed talk of a new cold war . russian leaders were not interested in conflict with the west . " i think little of demonizing russia , and i believe moscow will soon see the need for greater integration into the international community , " schroeder said . no major global problem , whether iran 's nuclear program , north korea , peace in the middle east or climate change , could be resolved without russia , schroeder said .
he urged the european union to press ahead with plans to forge a " strategic partnership " pact with moscow , saying europe risked losing influence and pushing russia towards china if it did not work with the kremlin . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but we 're well advised to prepare for what 's coming and not just approach it assuming it 's all doom and gloom ahead . but we 're hearing horror stories .
people are talking about a recession in germany .
what do you think ? i 'm being cautious .
we 're used to evaluating economic growth from quarter to quarter .
we used to do it by looking back to the same quarter of the year before .
if we look at this year like that , then we saw 3 percent growth in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the previous year .
but if we compare -lrb- this year 's -rrb- second quarter to the first quarter , then growth is declining .
so , there is still growth , at least two percent or more this year .
that 's really not a recession . so you 're not worried about the german economy ? i 'm a bit worried about the general mood in germany and regarding the economy , about what decisions are being made .
but you could worry about things like that anytime .
and who does n't think that they personally , or other people , or society as a whole , should be doing more ? does that mean the mood is worse than reality ? i think that the mood is worse than we should actually expect as normal .
the economy has been doing really well for the past three years , so we should n't be too worried if it performs less well at some point .
but - and this is important - nor should we just lean back and say it 'll all work out .
we should be cautiously optimistic and work hard .
that way , even in an economic slump , we 'll be fine . so what do you think needs to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising gas prices have shocked germans , wansleben says the first thing is to look at the facts and the numbers as they really are .
and the second thing is , i think the government needs to realize that they ca n't just plod along till the next election in september next year .
somebody simply making trips abroad is n't going to help .
we need to make important decisions at home now .
and the same goes for the european level .
we 're coming up to a decisive moment for germany .
i can imagine that , with hindsight , we 'll look back to the early summer as a psychological turning point .
the energy prices gave us quite a shock .
with gas prices at 1.60 euros -lrb- $ 2.34 -rrb- a liter -lrb- quarter gallon -rrb- , many of us have paid 80 euros to fill up a 50-liter tank and just thought - what on earth is going on ?
i think germans are worried about who 's taking care of things .
ordinary people here might be feeling that members of the elite are only watching their own backs . and trying to protect their image perhaps ? image , or whatever else they have to protect .
but not pooling their knowledge to try and figure out what the problems are , or the challenges , and a joint approach .
that 's worrying , and that 's why there 's all this talk of doom and gloom .
so , now the talk of recession is spreading , just because of a bit of uncertainty and worry .
a few weeks or months ago it was about energy prices , and now it 's practically a yearning for a recession - so much yearning that it could practically cause one . but the low morale could also be caused by people having less money in their pockets .
high prices , and salaries not rising by as much as people expect in a strong economy .
is that a problem too ? i think that spending is key to that - how much money people have to spend .
and rising prices are part of that , as are energy and commodity prices . but the government ca n't do anything about that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even store rebates of 19 percent to shop tax free have n't helped much , it seems no , the government ca n't do anything about that .
back in 2006 it seemed like a good time to raise sales tax as the economy was booming .
many hoped the cycle of business would sort of wash over that fact and no-one would notice .
but now we have to accept that the rise in sales tax has been a real blow to the economy .
it was a big mistake .
it has to be corrected somehow .
also , we 're facing what economists call " cold progression . "
today , people who are earning only double the average income are already in the highest tax bracket .
a lot is being skimmed off by the state , but the state has n't been doing enough to figure out revenue policies that would put more money in people 's pockets .
it 's simply the wrong approach to think the budget can be balanced by taxes and fees . the whole of europe feels the results of the german economy weakening .
what effects do you think that will have ? first off , other european countries have already weakened , and even before germany started to feel the pinch … i think that the economic slowdown , as normal as it is , is becoming worse - partly because of energy and commodity prices , which are eroding purchasing power .
but also because of the financial crisis , which is hitting very close to home here .
a lot of assets have been wiped out , and financial opportunities for private investors , and leeway for the banks . but are the businesses that you represent already feeling the slump ?
are they noticeably less bullish ? yes , orders are decreasing .
it has n't affected the factories yet .
there are still plenty of orders , and they 're still producing at full throttle .
that 's why we 're not noticing anything different in the rate of growth at the moment .
and that 's why we have to be careful .
it could be that the economy will pull back , the euro will fall and oil prices will drop . is a weaker euro good ? it 'd be good if the euro stopped being overvalued .
that 's why it 's good that it 's falling right now .
but i 'm not sure about the idea the more the euro falls , the better .
that 's not always the case , so we need to watch out . and finally mr wansleben .
what is the current state of the german economy ?
is the glass half empty or half full ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's hoping things will go up again i think we 're right where you 'd expect us to be .
this year will still be a good year .
everyone knows things are going to get worse at some point .
now there are more and more signs that that will happen next year .
i think the most important thing is how the economy is structured , and it 's fine .
we 're really well represented globally .
germany is one of the very few countries in the world where middle-sized companies are independent on the world markets , and not beholden to bigger ones .
this international anchorage helps us to use all the possibilities out there : in russia or china , or india or south america .
i think it 's important to reiterate that . another thing is that over the past 10 to 15 years , german companies have learned a lot from the financial crisis of the early 1990s .
they 've left no stone unturned , their cost structures are totally different , and there 's a lot of innovation in processes and products . i do n't think that we need to be pessimistic right now .
as i 've said , what i 'm worried about is politicians choosing to stick with unproductive policies .
if the economics minister says it would actually be good to implement some reforms , but the majority does n't back them , that shows that even government officials can see the government is lagging behind on what 's actually important . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the glass is always half empty .
right now , the general mood when it comes to the economy seems to be negative .
what 's your feeling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin wansleben has been dihk 's ceo since 2001 martin wansleben : my personal feeling is that things are great .
we 've had problems like this in the past .
sometimes the business cycle experiences a downturn .
but we 're well advised to prepare for what 's coming and not just approach it assuming it 's all doom and gloom ahead . but we 're hearing horror stories .
people are talking about a recession in germany .
what do you think ? i 'm being cautious .
we 're used to evaluating economic growth from quarter to quarter .
we used to do it by looking back to the same quarter of the year before .
if we look at this year like that , then we saw 3 percent growth in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the previous year .
but if we compare -lrb- this year 's -rrb- second quarter to the first quarter , then growth is declining .
so , there is still growth , at least two percent or more this year .
that 's really not a recession . so you 're not worried about the german economy ? i 'm a bit worried about the general mood in germany and regarding the economy , about what decisions are being made .
but you could worry about things like that anytime .
and who does n't think that they personally , or other people , or society as a whole , should be doing more ? does that mean the mood is worse than reality ? i think that the mood is worse than we should actually expect as normal .
the economy has been doing really well for the past three years , so we should n't be too worried if it performs less well at some point .
but - and this is important - nor should we just lean back and say it 'll all work out .
we should be cautiously optimistic and work hard .
that way , even in an economic slump , we 'll be fine . so what do you think needs to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising gas prices have shocked germans , wansleben says the first thing is to look at the facts and the numbers as they really are .
and the second thing is , i think the government needs to realize that they ca n't just plod along till the next election in september next year .
somebody simply making trips abroad is n't going to help .
we need to make important decisions at home now .
and the same goes for the european level .
we 're coming up to a decisive moment for germany .
i can imagine that , with hindsight , we 'll look back to the early summer as a psychological turning point .
the energy prices gave us quite a shock .
with gas prices at 1.60 euros -lrb- $ 2.34 -rrb- a liter -lrb- quarter gallon -rrb- , many of us have paid 80 euros to fill up a 50-liter tank and just thought - what on earth is going on ?
i think germans are worried about who 's taking care of things .
ordinary people here might be feeling that members of the elite are only watching their own backs . and trying to protect their image perhaps ? image , or whatever else they have to protect .
but not pooling their knowledge to try and figure out what the problems are , or the challenges , and a joint approach .
that 's worrying , and that 's why there 's all this talk of doom and gloom .
so , now the talk of recession is spreading , just because of a bit of uncertainty and worry .
a few weeks or months ago it was about energy prices , and now it 's practically a yearning for a recession - so much yearning that it could practically cause one . but the low morale could also be caused by people having less money in their pockets .
high prices , and salaries not rising by as much as people expect in a strong economy .
is that a problem too ? i think that spending is key to that - how much money people have to spend .
and rising prices are part of that , as are energy and commodity prices . but the government ca n't do anything about that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even store rebates of 19 percent to shop tax free have n't helped much , it seems no , the government ca n't do anything about that .
back in 2006 it seemed like a good time to raise sales tax as the economy was booming .
many hoped the cycle of business would sort of wash over that fact and no-one would notice .
but now we have to accept that the rise in sales tax has been a real blow to the economy .
it was a big mistake .
it has to be corrected somehow .
also , we 're facing what economists call " cold progression . "
today , people who are earning only double the average income are already in the highest tax bracket .
a lot is being skimmed off by the state , but the state has n't been doing enough to figure out revenue policies that would put more money in people 's pockets .
it 's simply the wrong approach to think the budget can be balanced by taxes and fees . the whole of europe feels the results of the german economy weakening .
what effects do you think that will have ? first off , other european countries have already weakened , and even before germany started to feel the pinch … i think that the economic slowdown , as normal as it is , is becoming worse - partly because of energy and commodity prices , which are eroding purchasing power .
but also because of the financial crisis , which is hitting very close to home here .
a lot of assets have been wiped out , and financial opportunities for private investors , and leeway for the banks . but are the businesses that you represent already feeling the slump ?
are they noticeably less bullish ? yes , orders are decreasing .
it has n't affected the factories yet .
there are still plenty of orders , and they 're still producing at full throttle .
that 's why we 're not noticing anything different in the rate of growth at the moment .
and that 's why we have to be careful .
it could be that the economy will pull back , the euro will fall and oil prices will drop . is a weaker euro good ? it 'd be good if the euro stopped being overvalued .
that 's why it 's good that it 's falling right now .
but i 'm not sure about the idea the more the euro falls , the better .
that 's not always the case , so we need to watch out . and finally mr wansleben .
what is the current state of the german economy ?
is the glass half empty or half full ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's hoping things will go up again i think we 're right where you 'd expect us to be .
this year will still be a good year .
everyone knows things are going to get worse at some point .
now there are more and more signs that that will happen next year .
i think the most important thing is how the economy is structured , and it 's fine .
we 're really well represented globally .
germany is one of the very few countries in the world where middle-sized companies are independent on the world markets , and not beholden to bigger ones .
this international anchorage helps us to use all the possibilities out there : in russia or china , or india or south america .
i think it 's important to reiterate that . another thing is that over the past 10 to 15 years , german companies have learned a lot from the financial crisis of the early 1990s .
they 've left no stone unturned , their cost structures are totally different , and there 's a lot of innovation in processes and products . i do n't think that we need to be pessimistic right now .
as i 've said , what i 'm worried about is politicians choosing to stick with unproductive policies .
if the economics minister says it would actually be good to implement some reforms , but the majority does n't back them , that shows that even government officials can see the government is lagging behind on what 's actually important . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the ceasefire has to be verifiable and permanent , " german news agencies quoted a government spokesman as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , did n't mince words with medvedev merkel 's meeting with saakashvili comes two days after the chancellor met russian president dimitry medvedev in the black sea resort of sochi . the chancellor openly criticized russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori , saying it was " disproportionate in some aspects . " former chancellor blames georgia merkel underscored in the meeting with medvedev that " the basic point for any political solution to the conflict must be georgia 's territorial integrity . " on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that georgia 's territorial integrity and sovereignty could not be questioned . " georgia 's territorial integrity remains the basis of german policy , " steinmeier told newspaper welt am sonntag . he was referring to statements by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov who described calls to respect georgia 's territorial integrity as " just talk " that one " should forget . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schroeder , right , was and is good friends with russian prime minister putin steinmeier added that russia had crossed a limit with its bombardment of georgia proper but said it was pointless to assign blame in the conflict . his view was at odds with comments by former german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel , schroeder called president saakashvili a " gambler " and said he had triggered the war . the crisis began when georgia sent forces last week to retake south ossetia , a pro-russian province that threw off georgian rule in the 1990s .
moscow responded by sending troops into georgia . russia signs ceasefire medvedev meanwhile signed the six-point plan mediated by the european union earlier saturday in moscow .
saakashvili signed the document in tbilisi on friday in the presence of us secretary of state condoleezza rice . the agreement is not a peace settlement but provides the basis for a legally binding text to end the fighting and pave the way for a political solution .
the united nations security council is to formalize the six principles of the ceasefire . one of the key points is the withdrawal of russian armed forces to positions held before hostilities began in south ossetia . other points include renouncing violence , cessation of hostilities , granting access to humanitarian aid , the return of georgian armed forces to their usual quarters and the opening of international discussions on the future status of the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . the framework plan falls short of the original proposal by the eu presidency .
the draft had called for the " full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia " and the deployment of a eu or un monitoring mission . moscow , tiblisi locked in war of words despite the signing of the agreement by georgia and russia , the two sides are still engaged in a verbal war with claims and counter claims flying around . after the meeting with chancellor merkel on friday , medvedev made plain that russia would respond " in the same way " if it felt provoked again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says moscow would like to see him out in an interview with the german weekly der spiegel published saturday , saakashvili said moscow was determined to see his government toppled . russian leaders had told both sarkozy and rice that " there will be no agreement on resolving the conflict without my resignation , " saakashvili said . he accused russia of using the georgian military action in breakaway south ossetia as a pretext to march into the region .
" south ossetia is not the issue for russia , " he said .
" moscow wants to take over all of georgia . " on saturday , georgia accused russian troops of blowing up a railway bridge west of the capital tbilisi earlier in the day , saying its main east-west train link had been severed .
russia strongly denied any involvement . georgia said saturday that 182 people , including 67 civilians , had been confirmed dead in the conflict with russia .
georgian health minister alexander kvitashvili said his number of dead and wounded only included people in areas controlled by georgia .
he added there was evidence of mutilation of bodies . russian officials have said at least 2,000 people , mostly russian citizens , were killed in south ossetia , the breakaway region at the center of the conflict .
the figure has not been independently confirmed . bush accuses russia of " bullying " speaking in washington after the return of us secretary of state condoleeza rice from the caucasus , us president george w bush accused russia of " bullying " behavior in sending armored units into georgia and bombing georgian targets from the air . but bush admitted that some progress had been made by the signing of the french-brokered peace plan by russia and georgia . " now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations , " he said . bush has consistently held up georgia as a beacon of democracy in the caucasus .
in a weekly radio address , bush said america would not leave georgia in the lurch and said the free world had to stand up for a threatened democracy which had decided in favor of freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has urged russia to honor the ceasefire and withdraw troops from georgia rice is to go to brussels next week to meet with nato foreign ministers and european union officials on the georgia crisis . asked about possible repercussions for russia , rice said there had already been consequences in the expression of " universal concern " on russia 's actions .

" the ceasefire has to be verifiable and permanent , " german news agencies quoted a government spokesman as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , did n't mince words with medvedev merkel 's meeting with saakashvili comes two days after the chancellor met russian president dimitry medvedev in the black sea resort of sochi . the chancellor openly criticized russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori , saying it was " disproportionate in some aspects . " former chancellor blames georgia merkel underscored in the meeting with medvedev that " the basic point for any political solution to the conflict must be georgia 's territorial integrity . " on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that georgia 's territorial integrity and sovereignty could not be questioned . " georgia 's territorial integrity remains the basis of german policy , " steinmeier told newspaper welt am sonntag . he was referring to statements by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov who described calls to respect georgia 's territorial integrity as " just talk " that one " should forget . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schroeder , right , was and is good friends with russian prime minister putin steinmeier added that russia had crossed a limit with its bombardment of georgia proper but said it was pointless to assign blame in the conflict . his view was at odds with comments by former german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel , schroeder called president saakashvili a " gambler " and said he had triggered the war . the crisis began when georgia sent forces last week to retake south ossetia , a pro-russian province that threw off georgian rule in the 1990s .
moscow responded by sending troops into georgia . russia signs ceasefire medvedev meanwhile signed the six-point plan mediated by the european union earlier saturday in moscow .
saakashvili signed the document in tbilisi on friday in the presence of us secretary of state condoleezza rice . the agreement is not a peace settlement but provides the basis for a legally binding text to end the fighting and pave the way for a political solution .
the united nations security council is to formalize the six principles of the ceasefire . one of the key points is the withdrawal of russian armed forces to positions held before hostilities began in south ossetia . other points include renouncing violence , cessation of hostilities , granting access to humanitarian aid , the return of georgian armed forces to their usual quarters and the opening of international discussions on the future status of the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . the framework plan falls short of the original proposal by the eu presidency .
the draft had called for the " full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia " and the deployment of a eu or un monitoring mission . moscow , tiblisi locked in war of words despite the signing of the agreement by georgia and russia , the two sides are still engaged in a verbal war with claims and counter claims flying around . after the meeting with chancellor merkel on friday , medvedev made plain that russia would respond " in the same way " if it felt provoked again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says moscow would like to see him out in an interview with the german weekly der spiegel published saturday , saakashvili said moscow was determined to see his government toppled . russian leaders had told both sarkozy and rice that " there will be no agreement on resolving the conflict without my resignation , " saakashvili said . he accused russia of using the georgian military action in breakaway south ossetia as a pretext to march into the region .
" south ossetia is not the issue for russia , " he said .
" moscow wants to take over all of georgia . " on saturday , georgia accused russian troops of blowing up a railway bridge west of the capital tbilisi earlier in the day , saying its main east-west train link had been severed .
russia strongly denied any involvement . georgia said saturday that 182 people , including 67 civilians , had been confirmed dead in the conflict with russia .
georgian health minister alexander kvitashvili said his number of dead and wounded only included people in areas controlled by georgia .
he added there was evidence of mutilation of bodies . russian officials have said at least 2,000 people , mostly russian citizens , were killed in south ossetia , the breakaway region at the center of the conflict .
the figure has not been independently confirmed . bush accuses russia of " bullying " speaking in washington after the return of us secretary of state condoleeza rice from the caucasus , us president george w bush accused russia of " bullying " behavior in sending armored units into georgia and bombing georgian targets from the air . but bush admitted that some progress had been made by the signing of the french-brokered peace plan by russia and georgia . " now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations , " he said . bush has consistently held up georgia as a beacon of democracy in the caucasus .

the nation has since long been scoring points in culture , but now the country is broke and is rethinking the preservation of cultural monuments . milan native simona cagno is worried about churches and historical palaces that are disintegrating all over italy right in front of her .
" i do n't know what i should say about this , " she said .
" i ca n't seem to find the words . "
private leasing and selling " instead of expensive restoration is now apparently the word from rome .

dw spoke to luxembourg 's foreign minister asselborn about the divisions within the eu on the conflict and dealing with an assertive russia . on wednesday this week , you spent several hours discussing the situation in the caucasus with your european colleagues .
there was talk of a european peace mission .
what exactly is this about ?
jean asselborn : that is an interesting question : how can the european union contribute ?
we need to be present in the country .
but how can we be present ?
we can think about two or three things now .
for example , we can act as a monitor by sending police organized under the european flag to follow the situation ..
but no troops , no soldiers ?
if there are troops - and this is the second thing i wanted to say - then i feel that needs to be decided within the framework of the united nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asselborn insists that a solid partnership with russia is essential where does the eu stand on the future status of the south ossetia and abkhazia provinces that officially belong to georgia ?
we have avoided talking about this and i will also avoid discussing it with you .
it 's one the points where we said that we as the european union will of course contribute in negotiations , in a sort of mediation or intervention .
and we have said from the very beginning what should happen with this .
in any case we are backing the integrity of georgian territory .
but were the eu foreign ministers in agreement about who is to blame for the conflict ?
no , we avoided the question of blame .
if we got bogged down in playing the blame game , we would have lost a lot of time .
we would have never agreed on anything and that would n't have solved anything anyhow .
we are not judges in the european union .
but some countries , the baltic states and poland in particular , have clearly demonstrated solidarity with georgia while the german foreign minister , for example , warned against judging russia too quickly .
what does this mean then for the planned new strategic partnership agreement between the eu and russia ?
i think it would be a fatal mistake to break off this partnership .
i do not find it 100 percent bad that the baltic states and poland have taken this stance .
but you could still see and feel that the eu presidency - currently held by france , it could have been another country speaking on behalf of the european union - is calling the shots .
bildunterschrift : and we also need to know that we have no political interest in ducking when the us and russia are involved in a verbal war .
we have to show that we are important in our own right .
we can do that with our solidarity which of course we then need to demonstrate .
the european union has more inhabitants than russia and the us put together .
we are a big player in the global economy .
politically too , we are a very important factor when we present a united front .
as the european union , we must stick to the partnership with russia , even after these recent events which of course do not please us .
we need to enhance this partnership so that one day we wo n't have these situations any more .
to what extent can the european union function efficiently and as a united force without the lisbon treaty ?
the european union can function coherently with regard to foreign policy even without the lisbon treaty .
and we also need to remember that with the lisbon treaty , nothing fundamental changes in the bloc 's foreign policy .
foreign policy will remain the most difficult area in the european union in the next ten years , even with the lisbon treaty .
european foreign policy is more than the adding-up of national interests .
it 's a question of political will , not about a treaty .
we need to work on that and we also need to judge ourselves based on that . interview : susanne henn -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke to luxembourg 's foreign minister asselborn about the divisions within the eu on the conflict and dealing with an assertive russia . on wednesday this week , you spent several hours discussing the situation in the caucasus with your european colleagues .
there was talk of a european peace mission .
what exactly is this about ?
jean asselborn : that is an interesting question : how can the european union contribute ?
we need to be present in the country .
but how can we be present ?
we can think about two or three things now .
for example , we can act as a monitor by sending police organized under the european flag to follow the situation ..
but no troops , no soldiers ?
if there are troops - and this is the second thing i wanted to say - then i feel that needs to be decided within the framework of the united nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asselborn insists that a solid partnership with russia is essential where does the eu stand on the future status of the south ossetia and abkhazia provinces that officially belong to georgia ?
we have avoided talking about this and i will also avoid discussing it with you .
it 's one the points where we said that we as the european union will of course contribute in negotiations , in a sort of mediation or intervention .
and we have said from the very beginning what should happen with this .
in any case we are backing the integrity of georgian territory .
but were the eu foreign ministers in agreement about who is to blame for the conflict ?
no , we avoided the question of blame .
if we got bogged down in playing the blame game , we would have lost a lot of time .
we would have never agreed on anything and that would n't have solved anything anyhow .
we are not judges in the european union .
but some countries , the baltic states and poland in particular , have clearly demonstrated solidarity with georgia while the german foreign minister , for example , warned against judging russia too quickly .
what does this mean then for the planned new strategic partnership agreement between the eu and russia ?
i think it would be a fatal mistake to break off this partnership .
i do not find it 100 percent bad that the baltic states and poland have taken this stance .
but you could still see and feel that the eu presidency - currently held by france , it could have been another country speaking on behalf of the european union - is calling the shots .
bildunterschrift : and we also need to know that we have no political interest in ducking when the us and russia are involved in a verbal war .
we have to show that we are important in our own right .
we can do that with our solidarity which of course we then need to demonstrate .
the european union has more inhabitants than russia and the us put together .
we are a big player in the global economy .
politically too , we are a very important factor when we present a united front .
as the european union , we must stick to the partnership with russia , even after these recent events which of course do not please us .
we need to enhance this partnership so that one day we wo n't have these situations any more .
to what extent can the european union function efficiently and as a united force without the lisbon treaty ?
the european union can function coherently with regard to foreign policy even without the lisbon treaty .
and we also need to remember that with the lisbon treaty , nothing fundamental changes in the bloc 's foreign policy .
foreign policy will remain the most difficult area in the european union in the next ten years , even with the lisbon treaty .
european foreign policy is more than the adding-up of national interests .
it 's a question of political will , not about a treaty .
we need to work on that and we also need to judge ourselves based on that . interview : susanne henn -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

referring to the beijing olympics , paul deighton , chief executive of the london organising committee of the olympic games -lrb- locog -rrb- , was quoted by british media as saying , " i 'm not sure how many other countries would have either the resources or the control of the resources to be able to put them behind an event like this . "
" i think london is much more likely to the model for the games in the future , " he said .
nevertheless , the officials will most probably be looking at how the host organizers deal with security and transport , especially since the july 7 , 2005 terrorist bombings on the london underground took place the day after it was announced that london had been chosen to host the olympics in 2012 .

12 , mayor of london boris johnson voiced his concerns that not enough work has been done to ensure the legacy of the games .
" there are … i think , serious questions to be asked about the legacy value of some of the sites and some of the venues , " johnson said .
" i want to make sure that we can alchemize them into gold for london for 50 years to come , and that is going to take some pretty crunchy work . "
after the huge delays in building the new wembley stadium and the squandered investments in the millenium dome , london 's olympic projects are being met with growing skepticism .

hundreds of british olympic officials preparing to host the olympic games in 2012 have been sent to china to learn from the beijing hosts how the chinese are organizing the event . british olympic officials will be meeting chinese organizers and visiting all the main locations in order to learn how to cope with tens of thousands of athletes , journalists and supporters .
referring to the beijing olympics , paul deighton , chief executive of the london organising committee of the olympic games -lrb- locog -rrb- , was quoted by british media as saying , " i 'm not sure how many other countries would have either the resources or the control of the resources to be able to put them behind an event like this . "
" i think london is much more likely to the model for the games in the future , " he said .
nevertheless , the officials will most probably be looking at how the host organizers deal with security and transport , especially since the july 7 , 2005 terrorist bombings on the london underground took place the day after it was announced that london had been chosen to host the olympics in 2012 .
growing criticism in london bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london mayor boris johnson wants a lasting legacy in an interview with the financial times newspaper , published tuesday aug .
12 , mayor of london boris johnson voiced his concerns that not enough work has been done to ensure the legacy of the games .
" there are … i think , serious questions to be asked about the legacy value of some of the sites and some of the venues , " johnson said .
" i want to make sure that we can alchemize them into gold for london for 50 years to come , and that is going to take some pretty crunchy work . "
after the huge delays in building the new wembley stadium and the squandered investments in the millenium dome , london 's olympic projects are being met with growing skepticism .
the opposition political parties have also criticized the decision to send so many officials to beijing , arguing that little is to be learned from china because of the huge difference in budgets .
budgetary differences negate comparisons bildunterschrift : london is unlikely to be able to compete financially with the extravagance of beijing britain 's budget for the olympic games has already almost trebled from a predicted 3.4 billion pounds -lrb- 4.3 billion euros , $ 6.5 billion -rrb- to 9.3 billion pounds -lrb- $ 17.8 billion , 12 billion euros -rrb- .
by contrast it has been reported that , by the end of the games , china will have spent over 20 billion pounds -lrb- 25 billion euros , $ 39 billion -rrb- .
this has led to more general questions of whether it is at all useful to look to other countries ' examples when preparing to host the games .
officials in london have stressed the unique nature of each olympics based on the location and have also said how london has great potential to set its own standard .
boris johnson 's comments add to the concerns that the massive new building projects for the olympics may not provide lasting value for the poorer areas of east london where most of the sites are being built .
one of the main aims of hosting the olympics was to regenerate the area with a legacy of good sports facilities and more inspiration for young people to play sport .
neither boris johnson nor british prime minister gordon brown went to the opening ceremony in beijing , although both are going to the closing ceremony when the baton will be passed on to london . dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

referee thorsten kinhoefer again pointed to the spot for a holding offence when bayern right-back christian lell was adjudged to have tugged at olic , and trochowski stepped up to coolly convert from the spot for the 57th-minute equalizer . jol said he was pleased with his team 's fightback .

but hamburg came back well to earn a deserved point in an entertaining game thanks to a paolo guerrero header and a piotr trochowski penalty . although there were plus points in the performance for klinsmann , injury-hit bayern were often second best to a bright hamburg side who under new coach martin jol sought to go forward from the start .
klinsmann said the bayern team had taken " a good step forward " but there was " a lot of work still to do . " " of course as coach you want three points in your first game , " he said .
" we had hoped to go 3-1 in front directly after the break but unfortunately hamburg got the penalty to make it 2-2 .
we had some problems in the first 10 or 15 minutes but managed to get two goals in front only to give it away .
the various parts of the team played better together and the fine tuning is coming along .
hamburg played well , had their chances and the result was a fair one . " we are still in the early phase and at the moment we are not in a position to put an opponent under pressure , " he added .
" our combination play is n't together yet but this will come automatically with improved fitness in the coming weeks .

the brazilian cut the ball back and schweinsteiger raced in to drive the ball into the net . four minutes later bayern were awarded a penalty when dutch defender joris mathijsen had his arms around schweinsteiger , and podolski sent goalkeeper frank rost the wrong way from the spot kick . it was the perfect begin for bayern who were missing several injured first-choice players including france midfielder franck ribery , italy striker luca toni , turkey midfielder haltin altintop and argentina defender martin demechelis . however the shirt-sleeved klinsmann was often on the touchline with instructions as hamburg continued to use the ball well in midfield and find space to threaten an uncertain bayern defense . hamburg back in the game new captain david jarolim and trochowski , a former bayern player , more than adequately filled the gap created by the departure of rafael van der vaart to real madrid , with dutch international nigel de jong a firm anchor in defensive midfield . in the 25th minute , hamburg were back in the game when trochowski whipped in a cross from the right and former bayern striker guerrero was left unmarked to head the ball firmly down into the net . podolski had a glorious opportunity to put bayern further ahead but blasted the ball over the bar four minutes after the break , while hamburg came even closer a minute late when ivica olic struck the post . however the equalizer was n't long coming .
referee thorsten kinhoefer again pointed to the spot for a holding offence when bayern right-back christian lell was adjudged to have tugged at olic , and trochowski stepped up to coolly convert from the spot for the 57th-minute equalizer . jol said he was pleased with his team 's fightback .

a controversial citizenship test in one german state especially caught their attention . members of the united nations committee for the eradication of racial discrimination -lrb- cerd -rrb- on friday , aug .
15 , said that they were concerned about citizenship application questions targeted at muslims in the southwestern german state of baden-wuerttemberg . " the committee recommends that the federal government encourage the use of questionnaires without discriminatory content , for all applicants for citizenship , " said the committee , according to afp news agency . baden-wuerttemberg , home to car maker daimler 's mercedes benz , apparently requires citizens of the 57 member states of the organization of the islamic conference to answer specific questions when they apply for german citizenship . german test also under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian edathy wants the citizenship test to be reworked a nationwide citizenship test which is to become compulsory for immigrants and includes questions seeking the applicant 's views on forced marriages and homosexuality has also come under criticism . earlier this week , sebastian edathy , the social democratic chairman of the parliament 's domestic affairs committee , asked the federal interior ministry to rework the test which is made up of 300 potential questions . edathy said that many questions had wrong multiple choice answers that were meant to be correct and that some questions were completely irrelevant for a citizenship test .
ministry officials have rejected the claim and said that the test in its present form will take effect next month . the un committee also described as " regrettable " that many migrants who have lived in germany for many years , still failed to get citizenship . " germany should facilitate acquisition of german citizenship by such long-term residents and persons born in germany in order to promote their integration , " the committee said . growing racism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minster wolfgang schaeuble created the islam conference to improve relations while cerd members applauded germany for introducing anti-discrimination legislation two years ago and setting up a so-called islam conference , they also criticized a growing number of racist incidents in germany , saying that the federal government was not doing enough to prevent them .
the committee found that jews , muslims , sinti and roma as well as african asylum seekers had been attacked . german justice ministry officials said that they would study the comments carefully , but stressed that germany was " actively engaged " in implementing eu anti-discrimination laws in germany .
germany 's national action plan against racism will be presented to the un high commissioner for human rights later this year . lack of integration ? in their report , cerd officials also wondered how germany wants to define itself as a " non-multi-ethnic state " as one fifth of the population has a migrant background and about 8 percent are foreigners without a german passport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people with migrant backgrounds have joined germany 's police pool cerd asked german officials to tell them whether these groups are integrated in agencies such as the police .
german officials , according to news reports , countered that the government 's policy was to " integrate , not assimilate " people with a migrant background . the anti-racism experts also bemoaned germany 's use of language when it comes to the law and officials agencies .
they also said that it was unfortunate that german law did n't see racist motives in connection with crimes as an aggravating factor .
cerd said that foreign victims of violence often receive less compensation money than germans . sinti and roma are in an especially bad position as they are discriminated against in the work place , in media coverage about them and when searching for apartments , cerd members said . the committee also criticized that children of asylum seekers in the states of hesse , baden-württemberg and saarland did not all attend school and that many children of migrant families had to attend special education schools . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.08.2008 german business leader : 2008 will still be a good year großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are struggling to get new orders in an interview with dw-tv , martin wansleben , the ceo of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , says that pessimists might make germany 's current economic downturn worse than it actually is . dw-tv : mr. wansleben , the germans are infamous pessimists .
the glass is always half empty .
right now , the general mood when it comes to the economy seems to be negative .
what 's your feeling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin wansleben has been dihk 's ceo since 2001 martin wansleben : my personal feeling is that things are great .
we 've had problems like this in the past .
sometimes the business cycle experiences a downturn .
but we 're well advised to prepare for what 's coming and not just approach it assuming it 's all doom and gloom ahead . but we 're hearing horror stories .
people are talking about a recession in germany .
what do you think ? i 'm being cautious .
we 're used to evaluating economic growth from quarter to quarter .
we used to do it by looking back to the same quarter of the year before .
if we look at this year like that , then we saw 3 percent growth in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the previous year .
but if we compare -lrb- this year 's -rrb- second quarter to the first quarter , then growth is declining .
so , there is still growth , at least two percent or more this year .
that 's really not a recession . so you 're not worried about the german economy ? i 'm a bit worried about the general mood in germany and regarding the economy , about what decisions are being made .
but you could worry about things like that anytime .
and who does n't think that they personally , or other people , or society as a whole , should be doing more ? does that mean the mood is worse than reality ? i think that the mood is worse than we should actually expect as normal .
the economy has been doing really well for the past three years , so we should n't be too worried if it performs less well at some point .
but - and this is important - nor should we just lean back and say it 'll all work out .
we should be cautiously optimistic and work hard .
that way , even in an economic slump , we 'll be fine . so what do you think needs to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising gas prices have shocked germans , wansleben says the first thing is to look at the facts and the numbers as they really are .
and the second thing is , i think the government needs to realize that they ca n't just plod along till the next election in september next year .
somebody simply making trips abroad is n't going to help .
we need to make important decisions at home now .
and the same goes for the european level .
we 're coming up to a decisive moment for germany .
i can imagine that , with hindsight , we 'll look back to the early summer as a psychological turning point .
the energy prices gave us quite a shock .
with gas prices at 1.60 euros -lrb- $ 2.34 -rrb- a liter -lrb- quarter gallon -rrb- , many of us have paid 80 euros to fill up a 50-liter tank and just thought - what on earth is going on ?
i think germans are worried about who 's taking care of things .
ordinary people here might be feeling that members of the elite are only watching their own backs . and trying to protect their image perhaps ? image , or whatever else they have to protect .
but not pooling their knowledge to try and figure out what the problems are , or the challenges , and a joint approach .
that 's worrying , and that 's why there 's all this talk of doom and gloom .
so , now the talk of recession is spreading , just because of a bit of uncertainty and worry .
a few weeks or months ago it was about energy prices , and now it 's practically a yearning for a recession - so much yearning that it could practically cause one . but the low morale could also be caused by people having less money in their pockets .
high prices , and salaries not rising by as much as people expect in a strong economy .
is that a problem too ? i think that spending is key to that - how much money people have to spend .
and rising prices are part of that , as are energy and commodity prices . but the government ca n't do anything about that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even store rebates of 19 percent to shop tax free have n't helped much , it seems no , the government ca n't do anything about that .
back in 2006 it seemed like a good time to raise sales tax as the economy was booming .
many hoped the cycle of business would sort of wash over that fact and no-one would notice .
but now we have to accept that the rise in sales tax has been a real blow to the economy .
it was a big mistake .
it has to be corrected somehow .
also , we 're facing what economists call " cold progression . "
today , people who are earning only double the average income are already in the highest tax bracket .
a lot is being skimmed off by the state , but the state has n't been doing enough to figure out revenue policies that would put more money in people 's pockets .
it 's simply the wrong approach to think the budget can be balanced by taxes and fees . the whole of europe feels the results of the german economy weakening .
what effects do you think that will have ? first off , other european countries have already weakened , and even before germany started to feel the pinch … i think that the economic slowdown , as normal as it is , is becoming worse - partly because of energy and commodity prices , which are eroding purchasing power .
but also because of the financial crisis , which is hitting very close to home here .
a lot of assets have been wiped out , and financial opportunities for private investors , and leeway for the banks . but are the businesses that you represent already feeling the slump ?
are they noticeably less bullish ? yes , orders are decreasing .
it has n't affected the factories yet .
there are still plenty of orders , and they 're still producing at full throttle .
that 's why we 're not noticing anything different in the rate of growth at the moment .
and that 's why we have to be careful .
it could be that the economy will pull back , the euro will fall and oil prices will drop . is a weaker euro good ? it 'd be good if the euro stopped being overvalued .
that 's why it 's good that it 's falling right now .
but i 'm not sure about the idea the more the euro falls , the better .
that 's not always the case , so we need to watch out . and finally mr wansleben .
what is the current state of the german economy ?
is the glass half empty or half full ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's hoping things will go up again i think we 're right where you 'd expect us to be .
this year will still be a good year .
everyone knows things are going to get worse at some point .
now there are more and more signs that that will happen next year .
i think the most important thing is how the economy is structured , and it 's fine .
we 're really well represented globally .
germany is one of the very few countries in the world where middle-sized companies are independent on the world markets , and not beholden to bigger ones .
this international anchorage helps us to use all the possibilities out there : in russia or china , or india or south america .
i think it 's important to reiterate that . another thing is that over the past 10 to 15 years , german companies have learned a lot from the financial crisis of the early 1990s .
they 've left no stone unturned , their cost structures are totally different , and there 's a lot of innovation in processes and products . i do n't think that we need to be pessimistic right now .
as i 've said , what i 'm worried about is politicians choosing to stick with unproductive policies .
if the economics minister says it would actually be good to implement some reforms , but the majority does n't back them , that shows that even government officials can see the government is lagging behind on what 's actually important . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the glass is always half empty .
right now , the general mood when it comes to the economy seems to be negative .
what 's your feeling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin wansleben has been dihk 's ceo since 2001 martin wansleben : my personal feeling is that things are great .
we 've had problems like this in the past .
sometimes the business cycle experiences a downturn .
but we 're well advised to prepare for what 's coming and not just approach it assuming it 's all doom and gloom ahead . but we 're hearing horror stories .
people are talking about a recession in germany .
what do you think ? i 'm being cautious .
we 're used to evaluating economic growth from quarter to quarter .
we used to do it by looking back to the same quarter of the year before .
if we look at this year like that , then we saw 3 percent growth in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the previous year .
but if we compare -lrb- this year 's -rrb- second quarter to the first quarter , then growth is declining .
so , there is still growth , at least two percent or more this year .
that 's really not a recession . so you 're not worried about the german economy ? i 'm a bit worried about the general mood in germany and regarding the economy , about what decisions are being made .
but you could worry about things like that anytime .
and who does n't think that they personally , or other people , or society as a whole , should be doing more ? does that mean the mood is worse than reality ? i think that the mood is worse than we should actually expect as normal .
the economy has been doing really well for the past three years , so we should n't be too worried if it performs less well at some point .
but - and this is important - nor should we just lean back and say it 'll all work out .
we should be cautiously optimistic and work hard .
that way , even in an economic slump , we 'll be fine . so what do you think needs to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising gas prices have shocked germans , wansleben says the first thing is to look at the facts and the numbers as they really are .
and the second thing is , i think the government needs to realize that they ca n't just plod along till the next election in september next year .
somebody simply making trips abroad is n't going to help .
we need to make important decisions at home now .
and the same goes for the european level .
we 're coming up to a decisive moment for germany .
i can imagine that , with hindsight , we 'll look back to the early summer as a psychological turning point .
the energy prices gave us quite a shock .
with gas prices at 1.60 euros -lrb- $ 2.34 -rrb- a liter -lrb- quarter gallon -rrb- , many of us have paid 80 euros to fill up a 50-liter tank and just thought - what on earth is going on ?
i think germans are worried about who 's taking care of things .
ordinary people here might be feeling that members of the elite are only watching their own backs . and trying to protect their image perhaps ? image , or whatever else they have to protect .
but not pooling their knowledge to try and figure out what the problems are , or the challenges , and a joint approach .
that 's worrying , and that 's why there 's all this talk of doom and gloom .
so , now the talk of recession is spreading , just because of a bit of uncertainty and worry .
a few weeks or months ago it was about energy prices , and now it 's practically a yearning for a recession - so much yearning that it could practically cause one . but the low morale could also be caused by people having less money in their pockets .
high prices , and salaries not rising by as much as people expect in a strong economy .
is that a problem too ? i think that spending is key to that - how much money people have to spend .
and rising prices are part of that , as are energy and commodity prices . but the government ca n't do anything about that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even store rebates of 19 percent to shop tax free have n't helped much , it seems no , the government ca n't do anything about that .
back in 2006 it seemed like a good time to raise sales tax as the economy was booming .
many hoped the cycle of business would sort of wash over that fact and no-one would notice .
but now we have to accept that the rise in sales tax has been a real blow to the economy .
it was a big mistake .
it has to be corrected somehow .
also , we 're facing what economists call " cold progression . "
today , people who are earning only double the average income are already in the highest tax bracket .
a lot is being skimmed off by the state , but the state has n't been doing enough to figure out revenue policies that would put more money in people 's pockets .
it 's simply the wrong approach to think the budget can be balanced by taxes and fees . the whole of europe feels the results of the german economy weakening .
what effects do you think that will have ? first off , other european countries have already weakened , and even before germany started to feel the pinch … i think that the economic slowdown , as normal as it is , is becoming worse - partly because of energy and commodity prices , which are eroding purchasing power .
but also because of the financial crisis , which is hitting very close to home here .
a lot of assets have been wiped out , and financial opportunities for private investors , and leeway for the banks . but are the businesses that you represent already feeling the slump ?
are they noticeably less bullish ? yes , orders are decreasing .
it has n't affected the factories yet .
there are still plenty of orders , and they 're still producing at full throttle .
that 's why we 're not noticing anything different in the rate of growth at the moment .
and that 's why we have to be careful .
it could be that the economy will pull back , the euro will fall and oil prices will drop . is a weaker euro good ? it 'd be good if the euro stopped being overvalued .
that 's why it 's good that it 's falling right now .
but i 'm not sure about the idea the more the euro falls , the better .
that 's not always the case , so we need to watch out . and finally mr wansleben .
what is the current state of the german economy ?
is the glass half empty or half full ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's hoping things will go up again i think we 're right where you 'd expect us to be .
this year will still be a good year .
everyone knows things are going to get worse at some point .
now there are more and more signs that that will happen next year .
i think the most important thing is how the economy is structured , and it 's fine .
we 're really well represented globally .
germany is one of the very few countries in the world where middle-sized companies are independent on the world markets , and not beholden to bigger ones .
this international anchorage helps us to use all the possibilities out there : in russia or china , or india or south america .
i think it 's important to reiterate that . another thing is that over the past 10 to 15 years , german companies have learned a lot from the financial crisis of the early 1990s .
they 've left no stone unturned , their cost structures are totally different , and there 's a lot of innovation in processes and products . i do n't think that we need to be pessimistic right now .
as i 've said , what i 'm worried about is politicians choosing to stick with unproductive policies .
if the economics minister says it would actually be good to implement some reforms , but the majority does n't back them , that shows that even government officials can see the government is lagging behind on what 's actually important . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the glass is always half empty .
right now , the general mood when it comes to the economy seems to be negative .
what 's your feeling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin wansleben has been dihk 's ceo since 2001 martin wansleben : my personal feeling is that things are great .
we 've had problems like this in the past .
sometimes the business cycle experiences a downturn .
but we 're well advised to prepare for what 's coming and not just approach it assuming it 's all doom and gloom ahead . but we 're hearing horror stories .
people are talking about a recession in germany .
what do you think ? i 'm being cautious .
we 're used to evaluating economic growth from quarter to quarter .
we used to do it by looking back to the same quarter of the year before .
if we look at this year like that , then we saw 3 percent growth in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the previous year .
but if we compare -lrb- this year 's -rrb- second quarter to the first quarter , then growth is declining .
so , there is still growth , at least two percent or more this year .
that 's really not a recession . so you 're not worried about the german economy ? i 'm a bit worried about the general mood in germany and regarding the economy , about what decisions are being made .
but you could worry about things like that anytime .
and who does n't think that they personally , or other people , or society as a whole , should be doing more ? does that mean the mood is worse than reality ? i think that the mood is worse than we should actually expect as normal .
the economy has been doing really well for the past three years , so we should n't be too worried if it performs less well at some point .
but - and this is important - nor should we just lean back and say it 'll all work out .
we should be cautiously optimistic and work hard .
that way , even in an economic slump , we 'll be fine . so what do you think needs to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising gas prices have shocked germans , wansleben says the first thing is to look at the facts and the numbers as they really are .
and the second thing is , i think the government needs to realize that they ca n't just plod along till the next election in september next year .
somebody simply making trips abroad is n't going to help .
we need to make important decisions at home now .
and the same goes for the european level .
we 're coming up to a decisive moment for germany .
i can imagine that , with hindsight , we 'll look back to the early summer as a psychological turning point .
the energy prices gave us quite a shock .
with gas prices at 1.60 euros -lrb- $ 2.34 -rrb- a liter -lrb- quarter gallon -rrb- , many of us have paid 80 euros to fill up a 50-liter tank and just thought - what on earth is going on ?
i think germans are worried about who 's taking care of things .
ordinary people here might be feeling that members of the elite are only watching their own backs . and trying to protect their image perhaps ? image , or whatever else they have to protect .
but not pooling their knowledge to try and figure out what the problems are , or the challenges , and a joint approach .
that 's worrying , and that 's why there 's all this talk of doom and gloom .
so , now the talk of recession is spreading , just because of a bit of uncertainty and worry .
a few weeks or months ago it was about energy prices , and now it 's practically a yearning for a recession - so much yearning that it could practically cause one . but the low morale could also be caused by people having less money in their pockets .
high prices , and salaries not rising by as much as people expect in a strong economy .
is that a problem too ? i think that spending is key to that - how much money people have to spend .
and rising prices are part of that , as are energy and commodity prices . but the government ca n't do anything about that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even store rebates of 19 percent to shop tax free have n't helped much , it seems no , the government ca n't do anything about that .
back in 2006 it seemed like a good time to raise sales tax as the economy was booming .
many hoped the cycle of business would sort of wash over that fact and no-one would notice .
but now we have to accept that the rise in sales tax has been a real blow to the economy .
it was a big mistake .
it has to be corrected somehow .
also , we 're facing what economists call " cold progression . "
today , people who are earning only double the average income are already in the highest tax bracket .
a lot is being skimmed off by the state , but the state has n't been doing enough to figure out revenue policies that would put more money in people 's pockets .
it 's simply the wrong approach to think the budget can be balanced by taxes and fees . the whole of europe feels the results of the german economy weakening .
what effects do you think that will have ? first off , other european countries have already weakened , and even before germany started to feel the pinch … i think that the economic slowdown , as normal as it is , is becoming worse - partly because of energy and commodity prices , which are eroding purchasing power .
but also because of the financial crisis , which is hitting very close to home here .
a lot of assets have been wiped out , and financial opportunities for private investors , and leeway for the banks . but are the businesses that you represent already feeling the slump ?
are they noticeably less bullish ? yes , orders are decreasing .
it has n't affected the factories yet .
there are still plenty of orders , and they 're still producing at full throttle .
that 's why we 're not noticing anything different in the rate of growth at the moment .
and that 's why we have to be careful .
it could be that the economy will pull back , the euro will fall and oil prices will drop . is a weaker euro good ? it 'd be good if the euro stopped being overvalued .
that 's why it 's good that it 's falling right now .
but i 'm not sure about the idea the more the euro falls , the better .
that 's not always the case , so we need to watch out . and finally mr wansleben .

many hoped the cycle of business would sort of wash over that fact and no-one would notice .
but now we have to accept that the rise in sales tax has been a real blow to the economy .
it was a big mistake .
it has to be corrected somehow .
also , we 're facing what economists call " cold progression . "
today , people who are earning only double the average income are already in the highest tax bracket .
a lot is being skimmed off by the state , but the state has n't been doing enough to figure out revenue policies that would put more money in people 's pockets .
it 's simply the wrong approach to think the budget can be balanced by taxes and fees . the whole of europe feels the results of the german economy weakening .
what effects do you think that will have ? first off , other european countries have already weakened , and even before germany started to feel the pinch … i think that the economic slowdown , as normal as it is , is becoming worse - partly because of energy and commodity prices , which are eroding purchasing power .
but also because of the financial crisis , which is hitting very close to home here .
a lot of assets have been wiped out , and financial opportunities for private investors , and leeway for the banks . but are the businesses that you represent already feeling the slump ?
are they noticeably less bullish ? yes , orders are decreasing .
it has n't affected the factories yet .
there are still plenty of orders , and they 're still producing at full throttle .
that 's why we 're not noticing anything different in the rate of growth at the moment .
and that 's why we have to be careful .
it could be that the economy will pull back , the euro will fall and oil prices will drop . is a weaker euro good ? it 'd be good if the euro stopped being overvalued .
that 's why it 's good that it 's falling right now .
but i 'm not sure about the idea the more the euro falls , the better .
that 's not always the case , so we need to watch out . and finally mr wansleben .
what is the current state of the german economy ?
is the glass half empty or half full ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's hoping things will go up again i think we 're right where you 'd expect us to be .
this year will still be a good year .
everyone knows things are going to get worse at some point .
now there are more and more signs that that will happen next year .
i think the most important thing is how the economy is structured , and it 's fine .
we 're really well represented globally .
germany is one of the very few countries in the world where middle-sized companies are independent on the world markets , and not beholden to bigger ones .
this international anchorage helps us to use all the possibilities out there : in russia or china , or india or south america .
i think it 's important to reiterate that . another thing is that over the past 10 to 15 years , german companies have learned a lot from the financial crisis of the early 1990s .
they 've left no stone unturned , their cost structures are totally different , and there 's a lot of innovation in processes and products . i do n't think that we need to be pessimistic right now .
as i 've said , what i 'm worried about is politicians choosing to stick with unproductive policies .
if the economics minister says it would actually be good to implement some reforms , but the majority does n't back them , that shows that even government officials can see the government is lagging behind on what 's actually important . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the firm reportedly expected to pay $ 100 million in bribes to argentine officials including menem and the then ministers of finance and interior .
siemens ' argentine headquarters , located near the historic plaza de mayo in central buenos aires , were searched in an effort to secure evidence on an order from judge ariel lijo .
former siemens officials claimed - in the context of a broader investigation against the german multinational firm - that the company paid bribes in argentina .
german courts forwarded the information to authorities in buenos aires . siemens in the 1990s was seeking a $ 1.26-billion contract to digitalize argentine identity documents and other services , the daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported .
the contract was signed under menem in 1998 but cancelled in 2001 by his successor , president fernando de la rua .

" the ceasefire has to be verifiable and permanent , " german news agencies quoted a government spokesman as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , did n't mince words with medvedev merkel 's meeting with saakashvili comes two days after the chancellor met russian president dimitry medvedev in the black sea resort of sochi . the chancellor openly criticized russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori , saying it was " disproportionate in some aspects . " former chancellor blames georgia merkel underscored in the meeting with medvedev that " the basic point for any political solution to the conflict must be georgia 's territorial integrity . " on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that georgia 's territorial integrity and sovereignty could not be questioned . " georgia 's territorial integrity remains the basis of german policy , " steinmeier told newspaper welt am sonntag . he was referring to statements by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov who described calls to respect georgia 's territorial integrity as " just talk " that one " should forget . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schroeder , right , was and is good friends with russian prime minister putin steinmeier added that russia had crossed a limit with its bombardment of georgia proper but said it was pointless to assign blame in the conflict . his view was at odds with comments by former german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel , schroeder called president saakashvili a " gambler " and said he had triggered the war . the crisis began when georgia sent forces last week to retake south ossetia , a pro-russian province that threw off georgian rule in the 1990s .
moscow responded by sending troops into georgia . russia signs ceasefire medvedev meanwhile signed the six-point plan mediated by the european union earlier saturday in moscow .
saakashvili signed the document in tbilisi on friday in the presence of us secretary of state condoleezza rice . the agreement is not a peace settlement but provides the basis for a legally binding text to end the fighting and pave the way for a political solution .
the united nations security council is to formalize the six principles of the ceasefire . one of the key points is the withdrawal of russian armed forces to positions held before hostilities began in south ossetia . other points include renouncing violence , cessation of hostilities , granting access to humanitarian aid , the return of georgian armed forces to their usual quarters and the opening of international discussions on the future status of the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . the framework plan falls short of the original proposal by the eu presidency .
the draft had called for the " full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia " and the deployment of a eu or un monitoring mission . moscow , tiblisi locked in war of words despite the signing of the agreement by georgia and russia , the two sides are still engaged in a verbal war with claims and counter claims flying around . after the meeting with chancellor merkel on friday , medvedev made plain that russia would respond " in the same way " if it felt provoked again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says moscow would like to see him out in an interview with the german weekly der spiegel published saturday , saakashvili said moscow was determined to see his government toppled . russian leaders had told both sarkozy and rice that " there will be no agreement on resolving the conflict without my resignation , " saakashvili said . he accused russia of using the georgian military action in breakaway south ossetia as a pretext to march into the region .
" south ossetia is not the issue for russia , " he said .
" moscow wants to take over all of georgia . " on saturday , georgia accused russian troops of blowing up a railway bridge west of the capital tbilisi earlier in the day , saying its main east-west train link had been severed .
russia strongly denied any involvement . georgia said saturday that 182 people , including 67 civilians , had been confirmed dead in the conflict with russia .
georgian health minister alexander kvitashvili said his number of dead and wounded only included people in areas controlled by georgia .
he added there was evidence of mutilation of bodies . russian officials have said at least 2,000 people , mostly russian citizens , were killed in south ossetia , the breakaway region at the center of the conflict .
the figure has not been independently confirmed . bush accuses russia of " bullying " speaking in washington after the return of us secretary of state condoleeza rice from the caucasus , us president george w bush accused russia of " bullying " behavior in sending armored units into georgia and bombing georgian targets from the air . but bush admitted that some progress had been made by the signing of the french-brokered peace plan by russia and georgia . " now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations , " he said . bush has consistently held up georgia as a beacon of democracy in the caucasus .

" moscow wants to take over all of georgia . " on saturday , georgia accused russian troops of blowing up a railway bridge west of the capital tbilisi earlier in the day , saying its main east-west train link had been severed .
russia strongly denied any involvement . georgia said saturday that 182 people , including 67 civilians , had been confirmed dead in the conflict with russia .

" the ceasefire has to be verifiable and permanent , " german news agencies quoted a government spokesman as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , did n't mince words with medvedev merkel 's meeting with saakashvili comes two days after the chancellor met russian president dimitry medvedev in the black sea resort of sochi . the chancellor openly criticized russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori , saying it was " disproportionate in some aspects . " former chancellor blames georgia merkel underscored in the meeting with medvedev that " the basic point for any political solution to the conflict must be georgia 's territorial integrity . " on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that georgia 's territorial integrity and sovereignty could not be questioned . " georgia 's territorial integrity remains the basis of german policy , " steinmeier told newspaper welt am sonntag . he was referring to statements by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov who described calls to respect georgia 's territorial integrity as " just talk " that one " should forget . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schroeder , right , was and is good friends with russian prime minister putin steinmeier added that russia had crossed a limit with its bombardment of georgia proper but said it was pointless to assign blame in the conflict . his view was at odds with comments by former german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel , schroeder called president saakashvili a " gambler " and said he had triggered the war . the crisis began when georgia sent forces last week to retake south ossetia , a pro-russian province that threw off georgian rule in the 1990s .
moscow responded by sending troops into georgia . russia signs ceasefire medvedev meanwhile signed the six-point plan mediated by the european union earlier saturday in moscow .

but hamburg came back well to earn a deserved point in an entertaining game thanks to a paolo guerrero header and a piotr trochowski penalty . although there were plus points in the performance for klinsmann , injury-hit bayern were often second best to a bright hamburg side who under new coach martin jol sought to go forward from the start .
klinsmann said the bayern team had taken " a good step forward " but there was " a lot of work still to do . " " of course as coach you want three points in your first game , " he said .
" we had hoped to go 3-1 in front directly after the break but unfortunately hamburg got the penalty to make it 2-2 .
we had some problems in the first 10 or 15 minutes but managed to get two goals in front only to give it away .
the various parts of the team played better together and the fine tuning is coming along .
hamburg played well , had their chances and the result was a fair one . " we are still in the early phase and at the moment we are not in a position to put an opponent under pressure , " he added .
" our combination play is n't together yet but this will come automatically with improved fitness in the coming weeks .
we have to improve from week to week . " perfect beginning hamburg began strongly and the lively trochowski fired an 11th-minute cross-shot from the left which struck the post with michael rensing in goal beaten .
but the visitors were caught napping a minute later from a throw-in by philipp lahm who sent ze roberto down the left .
the brazilian cut the ball back and schweinsteiger raced in to drive the ball into the net . four minutes later bayern were awarded a penalty when dutch defender joris mathijsen had his arms around schweinsteiger , and podolski sent goalkeeper frank rost the wrong way from the spot kick . it was the perfect begin for bayern who were missing several injured first-choice players including france midfielder franck ribery , italy striker luca toni , turkey midfielder haltin altintop and argentina defender martin demechelis . however the shirt-sleeved klinsmann was often on the touchline with instructions as hamburg continued to use the ball well in midfield and find space to threaten an uncertain bayern defense . hamburg back in the game new captain david jarolim and trochowski , a former bayern player , more than adequately filled the gap created by the departure of rafael van der vaart to real madrid , with dutch international nigel de jong a firm anchor in defensive midfield . in the 25th minute , hamburg were back in the game when trochowski whipped in a cross from the right and former bayern striker guerrero was left unmarked to head the ball firmly down into the net . podolski had a glorious opportunity to put bayern further ahead but blasted the ball over the bar four minutes after the break , while hamburg came even closer a minute late when ivica olic struck the post . however the equalizer was n't long coming .
referee thorsten kinhoefer again pointed to the spot for a holding offence when bayern right-back christian lell was adjudged to have tugged at olic , and trochowski stepped up to coolly convert from the spot for the 57th-minute equalizer . jol said he was pleased with his team 's fightback . " when you are 2-0 behind you can be satisfied with the result , " he said .
" we should have been in front but were not careful and conceded the first goal .

" the ceasefire has to be verifiable and permanent , " german news agencies quoted a government spokesman as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , did n't mince words with medvedev merkel 's meeting with saakashvili comes two days after the chancellor met russian president dimitry medvedev in the black sea resort of sochi . the chancellor openly criticized russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori , saying it was " disproportionate in some aspects . " former chancellor blames georgia merkel underscored in the meeting with medvedev that " the basic point for any political solution to the conflict must be georgia 's territorial integrity . " on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that georgia 's territorial integrity and sovereignty could not be questioned . " georgia 's territorial integrity remains the basis of german policy , " steinmeier told newspaper welt am sonntag . he was referring to statements by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov who described calls to respect georgia 's territorial integrity as " just talk " that one " should forget . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schroeder , right , was and is good friends with russian prime minister putin steinmeier added that russia had crossed a limit with its bombardment of georgia proper but said it was pointless to assign blame in the conflict . his view was at odds with comments by former german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel , schroeder called president saakashvili a " gambler " and said he had triggered the war . the crisis began when georgia sent forces last week to retake south ossetia , a pro-russian province that threw off georgian rule in the 1990s .
moscow responded by sending troops into georgia . russia signs ceasefire medvedev meanwhile signed the six-point plan mediated by the european union earlier saturday in moscow .
saakashvili signed the document in tbilisi on friday in the presence of us secretary of state condoleezza rice . the agreement is not a peace settlement but provides the basis for a legally binding text to end the fighting and pave the way for a political solution .
the united nations security council is to formalize the six principles of the ceasefire . one of the key points is the withdrawal of russian armed forces to positions held before hostilities began in south ossetia . other points include renouncing violence , cessation of hostilities , granting access to humanitarian aid , the return of georgian armed forces to their usual quarters and the opening of international discussions on the future status of the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . the framework plan falls short of the original proposal by the eu presidency .
the draft had called for the " full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia " and the deployment of a eu or un monitoring mission . moscow , tiblisi locked in war of words despite the signing of the agreement by georgia and russia , the two sides are still engaged in a verbal war with claims and counter claims flying around . after the meeting with chancellor merkel on friday , medvedev made plain that russia would respond " in the same way " if it felt provoked again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says moscow would like to see him out in an interview with the german weekly der spiegel published saturday , saakashvili said moscow was determined to see his government toppled . russian leaders had told both sarkozy and rice that " there will be no agreement on resolving the conflict without my resignation , " saakashvili said . he accused russia of using the georgian military action in breakaway south ossetia as a pretext to march into the region .
" south ossetia is not the issue for russia , " he said .
" moscow wants to take over all of georgia . " on saturday , georgia accused russian troops of blowing up a railway bridge west of the capital tbilisi earlier in the day , saying its main east-west train link had been severed .
russia strongly denied any involvement . georgia said saturday that 182 people , including 67 civilians , had been confirmed dead in the conflict with russia .
georgian health minister alexander kvitashvili said his number of dead and wounded only included people in areas controlled by georgia .
he added there was evidence of mutilation of bodies . russian officials have said at least 2,000 people , mostly russian citizens , were killed in south ossetia , the breakaway region at the center of the conflict .
the figure has not been independently confirmed . bush accuses russia of " bullying " speaking in washington after the return of us secretary of state condoleeza rice from the caucasus , us president george w bush accused russia of " bullying " behavior in sending armored units into georgia and bombing georgian targets from the air . but bush admitted that some progress had been made by the signing of the french-brokered peace plan by russia and georgia . " now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations , " he said . bush has consistently held up georgia as a beacon of democracy in the caucasus .
in a weekly radio address , bush said america would not leave georgia in the lurch and said the free world had to stand up for a threatened democracy which had decided in favor of freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has urged russia to honor the ceasefire and withdraw troops from georgia rice is to go to brussels next week to meet with nato foreign ministers and european union officials on the georgia crisis . asked about possible repercussions for russia , rice said there had already been consequences in the expression of " universal concern " on russia 's actions . " i think that russia will care about this talk because it is not just talk , it is about russia 's standing in the international community , " she said . poland says eu too soft on russia amid the flurry of diplomacy to end the conflict , the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering urged the eu to be united on the issue . " the eu has to deal with russia in a united manner , with determination and at the same time be ready for a dialogue , " poettering told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . poettering also warned against scrapping the eu 's strategic partnership with russia . " plans to isolate russia wo n't lead anywhere .
you ca n't isolate a member of the un security council . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski has pooh-poohed the idea of the eu having a common stance on russia however , polish president lech kaczynski on saturday accused paris and berlin of going too soft on russia because of their commercial ties with that country . in an interview , kaczynski said that european union policy was being decided by paris and berlin , without taking into consideration the views of the new eu members that were once under moscow 's control during the cold war . " saying that the european union has a common policy towards russia is a joke .

" the ceasefire has to be verifiable and permanent , " german news agencies quoted a government spokesman as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , did n't mince words with medvedev merkel 's meeting with saakashvili comes two days after the chancellor met russian president dimitry medvedev in the black sea resort of sochi . the chancellor openly criticized russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori , saying it was " disproportionate in some aspects . " former chancellor blames georgia merkel underscored in the meeting with medvedev that " the basic point for any political solution to the conflict must be georgia 's territorial integrity . " on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that georgia 's territorial integrity and sovereignty could not be questioned . " georgia 's territorial integrity remains the basis of german policy , " steinmeier told newspaper welt am sonntag . he was referring to statements by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov who described calls to respect georgia 's territorial integrity as " just talk " that one " should forget . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schroeder , right , was and is good friends with russian prime minister putin steinmeier added that russia had crossed a limit with its bombardment of georgia proper but said it was pointless to assign blame in the conflict . his view was at odds with comments by former german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel , schroeder called president saakashvili a " gambler " and said he had triggered the war . the crisis began when georgia sent forces last week to retake south ossetia , a pro-russian province that threw off georgian rule in the 1990s .
moscow responded by sending troops into georgia . russia signs ceasefire medvedev meanwhile signed the six-point plan mediated by the european union earlier saturday in moscow .
saakashvili signed the document in tbilisi on friday in the presence of us secretary of state condoleezza rice . the agreement is not a peace settlement but provides the basis for a legally binding text to end the fighting and pave the way for a political solution .
the united nations security council is to formalize the six principles of the ceasefire . one of the key points is the withdrawal of russian armed forces to positions held before hostilities began in south ossetia . other points include renouncing violence , cessation of hostilities , granting access to humanitarian aid , the return of georgian armed forces to their usual quarters and the opening of international discussions on the future status of the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . the framework plan falls short of the original proposal by the eu presidency .
the draft had called for the " full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia " and the deployment of a eu or un monitoring mission . moscow , tiblisi locked in war of words despite the signing of the agreement by georgia and russia , the two sides are still engaged in a verbal war with claims and counter claims flying around . after the meeting with chancellor merkel on friday , medvedev made plain that russia would respond " in the same way " if it felt provoked again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says moscow would like to see him out in an interview with the german weekly der spiegel published saturday , saakashvili said moscow was determined to see his government toppled . russian leaders had told both sarkozy and rice that " there will be no agreement on resolving the conflict without my resignation , " saakashvili said . he accused russia of using the georgian military action in breakaway south ossetia as a pretext to march into the region .
" south ossetia is not the issue for russia , " he said .
" moscow wants to take over all of georgia . " on saturday , georgia accused russian troops of blowing up a railway bridge west of the capital tbilisi earlier in the day , saying its main east-west train link had been severed .
russia strongly denied any involvement . georgia said saturday that 182 people , including 67 civilians , had been confirmed dead in the conflict with russia .
georgian health minister alexander kvitashvili said his number of dead and wounded only included people in areas controlled by georgia .
he added there was evidence of mutilation of bodies . russian officials have said at least 2,000 people , mostly russian citizens , were killed in south ossetia , the breakaway region at the center of the conflict .

" the ceasefire has to be verifiable and permanent , " german news agencies quoted a government spokesman as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , did n't mince words with medvedev merkel 's meeting with saakashvili comes two days after the chancellor met russian president dimitry medvedev in the black sea resort of sochi . the chancellor openly criticized russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori , saying it was " disproportionate in some aspects . " former chancellor blames georgia merkel underscored in the meeting with medvedev that " the basic point for any political solution to the conflict must be georgia 's territorial integrity . " on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that georgia 's territorial integrity and sovereignty could not be questioned . " georgia 's territorial integrity remains the basis of german policy , " steinmeier told newspaper welt am sonntag . he was referring to statements by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov who described calls to respect georgia 's territorial integrity as " just talk " that one " should forget . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schroeder , right , was and is good friends with russian prime minister putin steinmeier added that russia had crossed a limit with its bombardment of georgia proper but said it was pointless to assign blame in the conflict . his view was at odds with comments by former german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel , schroeder called president saakashvili a " gambler " and said he had triggered the war . the crisis began when georgia sent forces last week to retake south ossetia , a pro-russian province that threw off georgian rule in the 1990s .
moscow responded by sending troops into georgia . russia signs ceasefire medvedev meanwhile signed the six-point plan mediated by the european union earlier saturday in moscow .
saakashvili signed the document in tbilisi on friday in the presence of us secretary of state condoleezza rice . the agreement is not a peace settlement but provides the basis for a legally binding text to end the fighting and pave the way for a political solution .
the united nations security council is to formalize the six principles of the ceasefire . one of the key points is the withdrawal of russian armed forces to positions held before hostilities began in south ossetia . other points include renouncing violence , cessation of hostilities , granting access to humanitarian aid , the return of georgian armed forces to their usual quarters and the opening of international discussions on the future status of the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . the framework plan falls short of the original proposal by the eu presidency .
the draft had called for the " full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia " and the deployment of a eu or un monitoring mission . moscow , tiblisi locked in war of words despite the signing of the agreement by georgia and russia , the two sides are still engaged in a verbal war with claims and counter claims flying around . after the meeting with chancellor merkel on friday , medvedev made plain that russia would respond " in the same way " if it felt provoked again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says moscow would like to see him out in an interview with the german weekly der spiegel published saturday , saakashvili said moscow was determined to see his government toppled . russian leaders had told both sarkozy and rice that " there will be no agreement on resolving the conflict without my resignation , " saakashvili said . he accused russia of using the georgian military action in breakaway south ossetia as a pretext to march into the region .
" south ossetia is not the issue for russia , " he said .
" moscow wants to take over all of georgia . " on saturday , georgia accused russian troops of blowing up a railway bridge west of the capital tbilisi earlier in the day , saying its main east-west train link had been severed .
russia strongly denied any involvement . georgia said saturday that 182 people , including 67 civilians , had been confirmed dead in the conflict with russia .
georgian health minister alexander kvitashvili said his number of dead and wounded only included people in areas controlled by georgia .
he added there was evidence of mutilation of bodies . russian officials have said at least 2,000 people , mostly russian citizens , were killed in south ossetia , the breakaway region at the center of the conflict .
the figure has not been independently confirmed . bush accuses russia of " bullying " speaking in washington after the return of us secretary of state condoleeza rice from the caucasus , us president george w bush accused russia of " bullying " behavior in sending armored units into georgia and bombing georgian targets from the air . but bush admitted that some progress had been made by the signing of the french-brokered peace plan by russia and georgia .

the glass is always half empty .
right now , the general mood when it comes to the economy seems to be negative .
what 's your feeling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin wansleben has been dihk 's ceo since 2001 martin wansleben : my personal feeling is that things are great .
we 've had problems like this in the past .
sometimes the business cycle experiences a downturn .
but we 're well advised to prepare for what 's coming and not just approach it assuming it 's all doom and gloom ahead . but we 're hearing horror stories .
people are talking about a recession in germany .
what do you think ? i 'm being cautious .
we 're used to evaluating economic growth from quarter to quarter .
we used to do it by looking back to the same quarter of the year before .
if we look at this year like that , then we saw 3 percent growth in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the previous year .
but if we compare -lrb- this year 's -rrb- second quarter to the first quarter , then growth is declining .
so , there is still growth , at least two percent or more this year .
that 's really not a recession . so you 're not worried about the german economy ? i 'm a bit worried about the general mood in germany and regarding the economy , about what decisions are being made .
but you could worry about things like that anytime .
and who does n't think that they personally , or other people , or society as a whole , should be doing more ? does that mean the mood is worse than reality ? i think that the mood is worse than we should actually expect as normal .
the economy has been doing really well for the past three years , so we should n't be too worried if it performs less well at some point .
but - and this is important - nor should we just lean back and say it 'll all work out .
we should be cautiously optimistic and work hard .
that way , even in an economic slump , we 'll be fine . so what do you think needs to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising gas prices have shocked germans , wansleben says the first thing is to look at the facts and the numbers as they really are .
and the second thing is , i think the government needs to realize that they ca n't just plod along till the next election in september next year .
somebody simply making trips abroad is n't going to help .
we need to make important decisions at home now .
and the same goes for the european level .
we 're coming up to a decisive moment for germany .
i can imagine that , with hindsight , we 'll look back to the early summer as a psychological turning point .
the energy prices gave us quite a shock .
with gas prices at 1.60 euros -lrb- $ 2.34 -rrb- a liter -lrb- quarter gallon -rrb- , many of us have paid 80 euros to fill up a 50-liter tank and just thought - what on earth is going on ?
i think germans are worried about who 's taking care of things .
ordinary people here might be feeling that members of the elite are only watching their own backs . and trying to protect their image perhaps ? image , or whatever else they have to protect .
but not pooling their knowledge to try and figure out what the problems are , or the challenges , and a joint approach .
that 's worrying , and that 's why there 's all this talk of doom and gloom .
so , now the talk of recession is spreading , just because of a bit of uncertainty and worry .
a few weeks or months ago it was about energy prices , and now it 's practically a yearning for a recession - so much yearning that it could practically cause one . but the low morale could also be caused by people having less money in their pockets .
high prices , and salaries not rising by as much as people expect in a strong economy .
is that a problem too ? i think that spending is key to that - how much money people have to spend .
and rising prices are part of that , as are energy and commodity prices . but the government ca n't do anything about that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even store rebates of 19 percent to shop tax free have n't helped much , it seems no , the government ca n't do anything about that .
back in 2006 it seemed like a good time to raise sales tax as the economy was booming .
many hoped the cycle of business would sort of wash over that fact and no-one would notice .
but now we have to accept that the rise in sales tax has been a real blow to the economy .
it was a big mistake .
it has to be corrected somehow .
also , we 're facing what economists call " cold progression . "
today , people who are earning only double the average income are already in the highest tax bracket .
a lot is being skimmed off by the state , but the state has n't been doing enough to figure out revenue policies that would put more money in people 's pockets .
it 's simply the wrong approach to think the budget can be balanced by taxes and fees . the whole of europe feels the results of the german economy weakening .
what effects do you think that will have ? first off , other european countries have already weakened , and even before germany started to feel the pinch … i think that the economic slowdown , as normal as it is , is becoming worse - partly because of energy and commodity prices , which are eroding purchasing power .
but also because of the financial crisis , which is hitting very close to home here .
a lot of assets have been wiped out , and financial opportunities for private investors , and leeway for the banks . but are the businesses that you represent already feeling the slump ?
are they noticeably less bullish ? yes , orders are decreasing .
it has n't affected the factories yet .
there are still plenty of orders , and they 're still producing at full throttle .
that 's why we 're not noticing anything different in the rate of growth at the moment .
and that 's why we have to be careful .
it could be that the economy will pull back , the euro will fall and oil prices will drop . is a weaker euro good ? it 'd be good if the euro stopped being overvalued .
that 's why it 's good that it 's falling right now .
but i 'm not sure about the idea the more the euro falls , the better .
that 's not always the case , so we need to watch out . and finally mr wansleben .
what is the current state of the german economy ?
is the glass half empty or half full ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's hoping things will go up again i think we 're right where you 'd expect us to be .
this year will still be a good year .
everyone knows things are going to get worse at some point .
now there are more and more signs that that will happen next year .
i think the most important thing is how the economy is structured , and it 's fine .
we 're really well represented globally .
germany is one of the very few countries in the world where middle-sized companies are independent on the world markets , and not beholden to bigger ones .
this international anchorage helps us to use all the possibilities out there : in russia or china , or india or south america .
i think it 's important to reiterate that . another thing is that over the past 10 to 15 years , german companies have learned a lot from the financial crisis of the early 1990s .
they 've left no stone unturned , their cost structures are totally different , and there 's a lot of innovation in processes and products . i do n't think that we need to be pessimistic right now .
as i 've said , what i 'm worried about is politicians choosing to stick with unproductive policies .
if the economics minister says it would actually be good to implement some reforms , but the majority does n't back them , that shows that even government officials can see the government is lagging behind on what 's actually important . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so , now the talk of recession is spreading , just because of a bit of uncertainty and worry .
a few weeks or months ago it was about energy prices , and now it 's practically a yearning for a recession - so much yearning that it could practically cause one . but the low morale could also be caused by people having less money in their pockets .
high prices , and salaries not rising by as much as people expect in a strong economy .
is that a problem too ? i think that spending is key to that - how much money people have to spend .
and rising prices are part of that , as are energy and commodity prices . but the government ca n't do anything about that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even store rebates of 19 percent to shop tax free have n't helped much , it seems no , the government ca n't do anything about that .
back in 2006 it seemed like a good time to raise sales tax as the economy was booming .
many hoped the cycle of business would sort of wash over that fact and no-one would notice .
but now we have to accept that the rise in sales tax has been a real blow to the economy .
it was a big mistake .
it has to be corrected somehow .
also , we 're facing what economists call " cold progression . "
today , people who are earning only double the average income are already in the highest tax bracket .
a lot is being skimmed off by the state , but the state has n't been doing enough to figure out revenue policies that would put more money in people 's pockets .
it 's simply the wrong approach to think the budget can be balanced by taxes and fees . the whole of europe feels the results of the german economy weakening .
what effects do you think that will have ? first off , other european countries have already weakened , and even before germany started to feel the pinch … i think that the economic slowdown , as normal as it is , is becoming worse - partly because of energy and commodity prices , which are eroding purchasing power .
but also because of the financial crisis , which is hitting very close to home here .
a lot of assets have been wiped out , and financial opportunities for private investors , and leeway for the banks . but are the businesses that you represent already feeling the slump ?
are they noticeably less bullish ? yes , orders are decreasing .
it has n't affected the factories yet .
there are still plenty of orders , and they 're still producing at full throttle .
that 's why we 're not noticing anything different in the rate of growth at the moment .
and that 's why we have to be careful .
it could be that the economy will pull back , the euro will fall and oil prices will drop . is a weaker euro good ? it 'd be good if the euro stopped being overvalued .
that 's why it 's good that it 's falling right now .
but i 'm not sure about the idea the more the euro falls , the better .
that 's not always the case , so we need to watch out . and finally mr wansleben .
what is the current state of the german economy ?
is the glass half empty or half full ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's hoping things will go up again i think we 're right where you 'd expect us to be .
this year will still be a good year .
everyone knows things are going to get worse at some point .
now there are more and more signs that that will happen next year .
i think the most important thing is how the economy is structured , and it 's fine .
we 're really well represented globally .
germany is one of the very few countries in the world where middle-sized companies are independent on the world markets , and not beholden to bigger ones .
this international anchorage helps us to use all the possibilities out there : in russia or china , or india or south america .
i think it 's important to reiterate that . another thing is that over the past 10 to 15 years , german companies have learned a lot from the financial crisis of the early 1990s .
they 've left no stone unturned , their cost structures are totally different , and there 's a lot of innovation in processes and products . i do n't think that we need to be pessimistic right now .
as i 've said , what i 'm worried about is politicians choosing to stick with unproductive policies .

the glass is always half empty .
right now , the general mood when it comes to the economy seems to be negative .
what 's your feeling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin wansleben has been dihk 's ceo since 2001 martin wansleben : my personal feeling is that things are great .
we 've had problems like this in the past .
sometimes the business cycle experiences a downturn .
but we 're well advised to prepare for what 's coming and not just approach it assuming it 's all doom and gloom ahead . but we 're hearing horror stories .
people are talking about a recession in germany .
what do you think ? i 'm being cautious .
we 're used to evaluating economic growth from quarter to quarter .
we used to do it by looking back to the same quarter of the year before .
if we look at this year like that , then we saw 3 percent growth in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the previous year .
but if we compare -lrb- this year 's -rrb- second quarter to the first quarter , then growth is declining .
so , there is still growth , at least two percent or more this year .
that 's really not a recession . so you 're not worried about the german economy ? i 'm a bit worried about the general mood in germany and regarding the economy , about what decisions are being made .
but you could worry about things like that anytime .
and who does n't think that they personally , or other people , or society as a whole , should be doing more ? does that mean the mood is worse than reality ? i think that the mood is worse than we should actually expect as normal .
the economy has been doing really well for the past three years , so we should n't be too worried if it performs less well at some point .
but - and this is important - nor should we just lean back and say it 'll all work out .
we should be cautiously optimistic and work hard .
that way , even in an economic slump , we 'll be fine . so what do you think needs to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising gas prices have shocked germans , wansleben says the first thing is to look at the facts and the numbers as they really are .
and the second thing is , i think the government needs to realize that they ca n't just plod along till the next election in september next year .
somebody simply making trips abroad is n't going to help .
we need to make important decisions at home now .
and the same goes for the european level .
we 're coming up to a decisive moment for germany .
i can imagine that , with hindsight , we 'll look back to the early summer as a psychological turning point .
the energy prices gave us quite a shock .
with gas prices at 1.60 euros -lrb- $ 2.34 -rrb- a liter -lrb- quarter gallon -rrb- , many of us have paid 80 euros to fill up a 50-liter tank and just thought - what on earth is going on ?
i think germans are worried about who 's taking care of things .
ordinary people here might be feeling that members of the elite are only watching their own backs . and trying to protect their image perhaps ? image , or whatever else they have to protect .
but not pooling their knowledge to try and figure out what the problems are , or the challenges , and a joint approach .
that 's worrying , and that 's why there 's all this talk of doom and gloom .

so , there is still growth , at least two percent or more this year .
that 's really not a recession . so you 're not worried about the german economy ? i 'm a bit worried about the general mood in germany and regarding the economy , about what decisions are being made .
but you could worry about things like that anytime .
and who does n't think that they personally , or other people , or society as a whole , should be doing more ? does that mean the mood is worse than reality ? i think that the mood is worse than we should actually expect as normal .
the economy has been doing really well for the past three years , so we should n't be too worried if it performs less well at some point .
but - and this is important - nor should we just lean back and say it 'll all work out .
we should be cautiously optimistic and work hard .
that way , even in an economic slump , we 'll be fine . so what do you think needs to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising gas prices have shocked germans , wansleben says the first thing is to look at the facts and the numbers as they really are .
and the second thing is , i think the government needs to realize that they ca n't just plod along till the next election in september next year .
somebody simply making trips abroad is n't going to help .
we need to make important decisions at home now .
and the same goes for the european level .
we 're coming up to a decisive moment for germany .
i can imagine that , with hindsight , we 'll look back to the early summer as a psychological turning point .
the energy prices gave us quite a shock .
with gas prices at 1.60 euros -lrb- $ 2.34 -rrb- a liter -lrb- quarter gallon -rrb- , many of us have paid 80 euros to fill up a 50-liter tank and just thought - what on earth is going on ?
i think germans are worried about who 's taking care of things .
ordinary people here might be feeling that members of the elite are only watching their own backs . and trying to protect their image perhaps ? image , or whatever else they have to protect .
but not pooling their knowledge to try and figure out what the problems are , or the challenges , and a joint approach .
that 's worrying , and that 's why there 's all this talk of doom and gloom .
so , now the talk of recession is spreading , just because of a bit of uncertainty and worry .
a few weeks or months ago it was about energy prices , and now it 's practically a yearning for a recession - so much yearning that it could practically cause one . but the low morale could also be caused by people having less money in their pockets .
high prices , and salaries not rising by as much as people expect in a strong economy .
is that a problem too ? i think that spending is key to that - how much money people have to spend .
and rising prices are part of that , as are energy and commodity prices . but the government ca n't do anything about that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even store rebates of 19 percent to shop tax free have n't helped much , it seems no , the government ca n't do anything about that .
back in 2006 it seemed like a good time to raise sales tax as the economy was booming .
many hoped the cycle of business would sort of wash over that fact and no-one would notice .
but now we have to accept that the rise in sales tax has been a real blow to the economy .
it was a big mistake .
it has to be corrected somehow .
also , we 're facing what economists call " cold progression . "
today , people who are earning only double the average income are already in the highest tax bracket .
a lot is being skimmed off by the state , but the state has n't been doing enough to figure out revenue policies that would put more money in people 's pockets .
it 's simply the wrong approach to think the budget can be balanced by taxes and fees . the whole of europe feels the results of the german economy weakening .
what effects do you think that will have ? first off , other european countries have already weakened , and even before germany started to feel the pinch … i think that the economic slowdown , as normal as it is , is becoming worse - partly because of energy and commodity prices , which are eroding purchasing power .
but also because of the financial crisis , which is hitting very close to home here .
a lot of assets have been wiped out , and financial opportunities for private investors , and leeway for the banks . but are the businesses that you represent already feeling the slump ?
are they noticeably less bullish ? yes , orders are decreasing .
it has n't affected the factories yet .
there are still plenty of orders , and they 're still producing at full throttle .
that 's why we 're not noticing anything different in the rate of growth at the moment .
and that 's why we have to be careful .
it could be that the economy will pull back , the euro will fall and oil prices will drop . is a weaker euro good ? it 'd be good if the euro stopped being overvalued .
that 's why it 's good that it 's falling right now .
but i 'm not sure about the idea the more the euro falls , the better .
that 's not always the case , so we need to watch out . and finally mr wansleben .
what is the current state of the german economy ?
is the glass half empty or half full ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's hoping things will go up again i think we 're right where you 'd expect us to be .
this year will still be a good year .
everyone knows things are going to get worse at some point .
now there are more and more signs that that will happen next year .
i think the most important thing is how the economy is structured , and it 's fine .
we 're really well represented globally .
germany is one of the very few countries in the world where middle-sized companies are independent on the world markets , and not beholden to bigger ones .
this international anchorage helps us to use all the possibilities out there : in russia or china , or india or south america .
i think it 's important to reiterate that . another thing is that over the past 10 to 15 years , german companies have learned a lot from the financial crisis of the early 1990s .
they 've left no stone unturned , their cost structures are totally different , and there 's a lot of innovation in processes and products . i do n't think that we need to be pessimistic right now .
as i 've said , what i 'm worried about is politicians choosing to stick with unproductive policies .

the glass is always half empty .
right now , the general mood when it comes to the economy seems to be negative .
what 's your feeling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin wansleben has been dihk 's ceo since 2001 martin wansleben : my personal feeling is that things are great .
we 've had problems like this in the past .
sometimes the business cycle experiences a downturn .
but we 're well advised to prepare for what 's coming and not just approach it assuming it 's all doom and gloom ahead . but we 're hearing horror stories .
people are talking about a recession in germany .
what do you think ? i 'm being cautious .
we 're used to evaluating economic growth from quarter to quarter .
we used to do it by looking back to the same quarter of the year before .

but hamburg came back well to earn a deserved point in an entertaining game thanks to a paolo guerrero header and a piotr trochowski penalty . although there were plus points in the performance for klinsmann , injury-hit bayern were often second best to a bright hamburg side who under new coach martin jol sought to go forward from the start .
klinsmann said the bayern team had taken " a good step forward " but there was " a lot of work still to do . " " of course as coach you want three points in your first game , " he said .
" we had hoped to go 3-1 in front directly after the break but unfortunately hamburg got the penalty to make it 2-2 .
we had some problems in the first 10 or 15 minutes but managed to get two goals in front only to give it away .
the various parts of the team played better together and the fine tuning is coming along .
hamburg played well , had their chances and the result was a fair one . " we are still in the early phase and at the moment we are not in a position to put an opponent under pressure , " he added .
" our combination play is n't together yet but this will come automatically with improved fitness in the coming weeks .
we have to improve from week to week . " perfect beginning hamburg began strongly and the lively trochowski fired an 11th-minute cross-shot from the left which struck the post with michael rensing in goal beaten .
but the visitors were caught napping a minute later from a throw-in by philipp lahm who sent ze roberto down the left .
the brazilian cut the ball back and schweinsteiger raced in to drive the ball into the net . four minutes later bayern were awarded a penalty when dutch defender joris mathijsen had his arms around schweinsteiger , and podolski sent goalkeeper frank rost the wrong way from the spot kick . it was the perfect begin for bayern who were missing several injured first-choice players including france midfielder franck ribery , italy striker luca toni , turkey midfielder haltin altintop and argentina defender martin demechelis . however the shirt-sleeved klinsmann was often on the touchline with instructions as hamburg continued to use the ball well in midfield and find space to threaten an uncertain bayern defense . hamburg back in the game new captain david jarolim and trochowski , a former bayern player , more than adequately filled the gap created by the departure of rafael van der vaart to real madrid , with dutch international nigel de jong a firm anchor in defensive midfield . in the 25th minute , hamburg were back in the game when trochowski whipped in a cross from the right and former bayern striker guerrero was left unmarked to head the ball firmly down into the net . podolski had a glorious opportunity to put bayern further ahead but blasted the ball over the bar four minutes after the break , while hamburg came even closer a minute late when ivica olic struck the post . however the equalizer was n't long coming .
referee thorsten kinhoefer again pointed to the spot for a holding offence when bayern right-back christian lell was adjudged to have tugged at olic , and trochowski stepped up to coolly convert from the spot for the 57th-minute equalizer . jol said he was pleased with his team 's fightback . " when you are 2-0 behind you can be satisfied with the result , " he said .
" we should have been in front but were not careful and conceded the first goal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 16.08.2008 cultural cop-out : italy sells its monuments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy is calling for private leasing and selling instead of restoration silvio berlusconi is reforming italy 's cultural landscape .
the nation has since long been scoring points in culture , but now the country is broke and is rethinking the preservation of cultural monuments . milan native simona cagno is worried about churches and historical palaces that are disintegrating all over italy right in front of her .
" i do n't know what i should say about this , " she said .
" i ca n't seem to find the words . "
private leasing and selling " instead of expensive restoration is now apparently the word from rome .
in other words : getting rid of monuments instead of holding onto them .
in verona , three palaces and one former convent are about to be auctioned off so that the city can afford a new parking garage for trade show visitors .
have the italian authorities lost their minds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's government is doing some belt-tightening in sicily , the region is planning to privately rent the world-famous temple of agrigento for the next 30 years .
" it just makes me scream and ask : ' how much further will italy sink ? " ' said gottfried wagner with disgust .
an historian , music scientist , writer and opera conductor , richard wagner 's great-grandson has been living in italy for almost 30 years .
the country has produced the greatest painters , composers and architects not just for europe , but for world history as well , wagner said .
" where will we end up if culture is only abused for political prostitution ? " he asked .
has the cultural legacy been lost ?
silvio berlusconi would be more than happy to silence the skeptics in italy - whether they are judges , monument preservationists or artists .
there has n't been talk of an interesting cultural sector for a long time now .
" nothing considerable is taking place anymore that i would probably appreciate , " wagner said , adding that in the past , there was a real sense of excitement and now that no longer exists .
" and this is the cultural and spiritual situation at the moment in italy and i could say this a thousand times over : it 's frightening , " he said .
trash instead of culture - what started in berlusconi 's television programs has since spread through the entire country .
italy , the cradle of the renaissance and of the communal city character , is trampling on its cultural legacy - a legacy that attracts millions of tourists to the country . no money for culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous constructions are set to be leased they marvel at leonardo da vinci 's last supper , for example , and most are overwhelmed by the 15th century mural painting 's beauty .
the fresco has been restored for 20 years to help stop its slow deterioration .
private sponsors carry the costs for this almost exclusively .
the ministry of cultural assets , which would normally take responsibility for the " last supper " did not have enough money .
now the situation is even more depressing .
not even 3 percent of italian households will donate money for the maintenance of monuments .
and the cutbacks that the berlusconi government passed via a finance decree leave the budget of the ministry of cultural assets even smaller .
" the funds for cultural assets and museums have degenerated like the political interest in culture , " said salvatore settis , italy 's most well-known monument preservationist .
the internationally-recognized art historian and director of the state-run ivy-league-type school " ecole normale " in pisa has calculated that the savings totaling 700 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- over three years mean less for the ministry of cultural assets . no sense of culture ?
in answer to the tentative question of where the minister should still make cuts , antonio leone from the governing party alliance " volk der freiheit " -lrb- people of freedom -rrb- said : " the minister must now set priorities .
the ministry received a certain budget and it has to make do with it . "
it is the minister 's job to make cuts where cuts can be made , and not to make cuts where they ca n't be made , he added . kirstin hausen -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hundreds of british olympic officials preparing to host the olympic games in 2012 have been sent to china to learn from the beijing hosts how the chinese are organizing the event . british olympic officials will be meeting chinese organizers and visiting all the main locations in order to learn how to cope with tens of thousands of athletes , journalists and supporters .
referring to the beijing olympics , paul deighton , chief executive of the london organising committee of the olympic games -lrb- locog -rrb- , was quoted by british media as saying , " i 'm not sure how many other countries would have either the resources or the control of the resources to be able to put them behind an event like this . "
" i think london is much more likely to the model for the games in the future , " he said .

dw spoke to luxembourg 's foreign minister asselborn about the divisions within the eu on the conflict and dealing with an assertive russia . on wednesday this week , you spent several hours discussing the situation in the caucasus with your european colleagues .
there was talk of a european peace mission .
what exactly is this about ?
jean asselborn : that is an interesting question : how can the european union contribute ?
we need to be present in the country .
but how can we be present ?
we can think about two or three things now .
for example , we can act as a monitor by sending police organized under the european flag to follow the situation ..
but no troops , no soldiers ?
if there are troops - and this is the second thing i wanted to say - then i feel that needs to be decided within the framework of the united nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asselborn insists that a solid partnership with russia is essential where does the eu stand on the future status of the south ossetia and abkhazia provinces that officially belong to georgia ?
we have avoided talking about this and i will also avoid discussing it with you .
it 's one the points where we said that we as the european union will of course contribute in negotiations , in a sort of mediation or intervention .
and we have said from the very beginning what should happen with this .
in any case we are backing the integrity of georgian territory .
but were the eu foreign ministers in agreement about who is to blame for the conflict ?
no , we avoided the question of blame .

we would have never agreed on anything and that would n't have solved anything anyhow .
we are not judges in the european union .
but some countries , the baltic states and poland in particular , have clearly demonstrated solidarity with georgia while the german foreign minister , for example , warned against judging russia too quickly .
what does this mean then for the planned new strategic partnership agreement between the eu and russia ?
i think it would be a fatal mistake to break off this partnership .
i do not find it 100 percent bad that the baltic states and poland have taken this stance .
but you could still see and feel that the eu presidency - currently held by france , it could have been another country speaking on behalf of the european union - is calling the shots .

we can do that with our solidarity which of course we then need to demonstrate .
the european union has more inhabitants than russia and the us put together .
we are a big player in the global economy .
politically too , we are a very important factor when we present a united front .
as the european union , we must stick to the partnership with russia , even after these recent events which of course do not please us .

foreign policy will remain the most difficult area in the european union in the next ten years , even with the lisbon treaty .

dw spoke to luxembourg 's foreign minister asselborn about the divisions within the eu on the conflict and dealing with an assertive russia . on wednesday this week , you spent several hours discussing the situation in the caucasus with your european colleagues .
there was talk of a european peace mission .
what exactly is this about ?
jean asselborn : that is an interesting question : how can the european union contribute ?
we need to be present in the country .
but how can we be present ?
we can think about two or three things now .
for example , we can act as a monitor by sending police organized under the european flag to follow the situation ..
but no troops , no soldiers ?
if there are troops - and this is the second thing i wanted to say - then i feel that needs to be decided within the framework of the united nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asselborn insists that a solid partnership with russia is essential where does the eu stand on the future status of the south ossetia and abkhazia provinces that officially belong to georgia ?
we have avoided talking about this and i will also avoid discussing it with you .
it 's one the points where we said that we as the european union will of course contribute in negotiations , in a sort of mediation or intervention .
and we have said from the very beginning what should happen with this .
in any case we are backing the integrity of georgian territory .
but were the eu foreign ministers in agreement about who is to blame for the conflict ?

hundreds of british olympic officials preparing to host the olympic games in 2012 have been sent to china to learn from the beijing hosts how the chinese are organizing the event . british olympic officials will be meeting chinese organizers and visiting all the main locations in order to learn how to cope with tens of thousands of athletes , journalists and supporters .
referring to the beijing olympics , paul deighton , chief executive of the london organising committee of the olympic games -lrb- locog -rrb- , was quoted by british media as saying , " i 'm not sure how many other countries would have either the resources or the control of the resources to be able to put them behind an event like this . "
" i think london is much more likely to the model for the games in the future , " he said .
nevertheless , the officials will most probably be looking at how the host organizers deal with security and transport , especially since the july 7 , 2005 terrorist bombings on the london underground took place the day after it was announced that london had been chosen to host the olympics in 2012 .
growing criticism in london bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london mayor boris johnson wants a lasting legacy in an interview with the financial times newspaper , published tuesday aug .
12 , mayor of london boris johnson voiced his concerns that not enough work has been done to ensure the legacy of the games .
" there are … i think , serious questions to be asked about the legacy value of some of the sites and some of the venues , " johnson said .
" i want to make sure that we can alchemize them into gold for london for 50 years to come , and that is going to take some pretty crunchy work . "
after the huge delays in building the new wembley stadium and the squandered investments in the millenium dome , london 's olympic projects are being met with growing skepticism .
the opposition political parties have also criticized the decision to send so many officials to beijing , arguing that little is to be learned from china because of the huge difference in budgets .
budgetary differences negate comparisons bildunterschrift : london is unlikely to be able to compete financially with the extravagance of beijing britain 's budget for the olympic games has already almost trebled from a predicted 3.4 billion pounds -lrb- 4.3 billion euros , $ 6.5 billion -rrb- to 9.3 billion pounds -lrb- $ 17.8 billion , 12 billion euros -rrb- .
by contrast it has been reported that , by the end of the games , china will have spent over 20 billion pounds -lrb- 25 billion euros , $ 39 billion -rrb- .
this has led to more general questions of whether it is at all useful to look to other countries ' examples when preparing to host the games .
officials in london have stressed the unique nature of each olympics based on the location and have also said how london has great potential to set its own standard .
boris johnson 's comments add to the concerns that the massive new building projects for the olympics may not provide lasting value for the poorer areas of east london where most of the sites are being built .
one of the main aims of hosting the olympics was to regenerate the area with a legacy of good sports facilities and more inspiration for young people to play sport .
neither boris johnson nor british prime minister gordon brown went to the opening ceremony in beijing , although both are going to the closing ceremony when the baton will be passed on to london . dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.08.2008 eu minister calls for closer russia ties after caucasus war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over dealing with a stronger , resurgent russia georgia and russia have accepted a french-brokered caucasus peace plan .
dw spoke to luxembourg 's foreign minister asselborn about the divisions within the eu on the conflict and dealing with an assertive russia . on wednesday this week , you spent several hours discussing the situation in the caucasus with your european colleagues .
there was talk of a european peace mission .
what exactly is this about ?
jean asselborn : that is an interesting question : how can the european union contribute ?
we need to be present in the country .
but how can we be present ?
we can think about two or three things now .
for example , we can act as a monitor by sending police organized under the european flag to follow the situation ..
but no troops , no soldiers ?
if there are troops - and this is the second thing i wanted to say - then i feel that needs to be decided within the framework of the united nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asselborn insists that a solid partnership with russia is essential where does the eu stand on the future status of the south ossetia and abkhazia provinces that officially belong to georgia ?
we have avoided talking about this and i will also avoid discussing it with you .
it 's one the points where we said that we as the european union will of course contribute in negotiations , in a sort of mediation or intervention .
and we have said from the very beginning what should happen with this .
in any case we are backing the integrity of georgian territory .
but were the eu foreign ministers in agreement about who is to blame for the conflict ?
no , we avoided the question of blame .
if we got bogged down in playing the blame game , we would have lost a lot of time .
we would have never agreed on anything and that would n't have solved anything anyhow .
we are not judges in the european union .
but some countries , the baltic states and poland in particular , have clearly demonstrated solidarity with georgia while the german foreign minister , for example , warned against judging russia too quickly .
what does this mean then for the planned new strategic partnership agreement between the eu and russia ?
i think it would be a fatal mistake to break off this partnership .
i do not find it 100 percent bad that the baltic states and poland have taken this stance .
but you could still see and feel that the eu presidency - currently held by france , it could have been another country speaking on behalf of the european union - is calling the shots .
bildunterschrift : and we also need to know that we have no political interest in ducking when the us and russia are involved in a verbal war .
we have to show that we are important in our own right .
we can do that with our solidarity which of course we then need to demonstrate .
the european union has more inhabitants than russia and the us put together .
we are a big player in the global economy .
politically too , we are a very important factor when we present a united front .
as the european union , we must stick to the partnership with russia , even after these recent events which of course do not please us .
we need to enhance this partnership so that one day we wo n't have these situations any more .
to what extent can the european union function efficiently and as a united force without the lisbon treaty ?
the european union can function coherently with regard to foreign policy even without the lisbon treaty .
and we also need to remember that with the lisbon treaty , nothing fundamental changes in the bloc 's foreign policy .
foreign policy will remain the most difficult area in the european union in the next ten years , even with the lisbon treaty .
european foreign policy is more than the adding-up of national interests .
it 's a question of political will , not about a treaty .
we need to work on that and we also need to judge ourselves based on that . interview : susanne henn -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hundreds of british olympic officials preparing to host the olympic games in 2012 have been sent to china to learn from the beijing hosts how the chinese are organizing the event . british olympic officials will be meeting chinese organizers and visiting all the main locations in order to learn how to cope with tens of thousands of athletes , journalists and supporters .
referring to the beijing olympics , paul deighton , chief executive of the london organising committee of the olympic games -lrb- locog -rrb- , was quoted by british media as saying , " i 'm not sure how many other countries would have either the resources or the control of the resources to be able to put them behind an event like this . "
" i think london is much more likely to the model for the games in the future , " he said .
nevertheless , the officials will most probably be looking at how the host organizers deal with security and transport , especially since the july 7 , 2005 terrorist bombings on the london underground took place the day after it was announced that london had been chosen to host the olympics in 2012 .
growing criticism in london bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london mayor boris johnson wants a lasting legacy in an interview with the financial times newspaper , published tuesday aug .
12 , mayor of london boris johnson voiced his concerns that not enough work has been done to ensure the legacy of the games .
" there are … i think , serious questions to be asked about the legacy value of some of the sites and some of the venues , " johnson said .
" i want to make sure that we can alchemize them into gold for london for 50 years to come , and that is going to take some pretty crunchy work . "
after the huge delays in building the new wembley stadium and the squandered investments in the millenium dome , london 's olympic projects are being met with growing skepticism .
the opposition political parties have also criticized the decision to send so many officials to beijing , arguing that little is to be learned from china because of the huge difference in budgets .
budgetary differences negate comparisons bildunterschrift : london is unlikely to be able to compete financially with the extravagance of beijing britain 's budget for the olympic games has already almost trebled from a predicted 3.4 billion pounds -lrb- 4.3 billion euros , $ 6.5 billion -rrb- to 9.3 billion pounds -lrb- $ 17.8 billion , 12 billion euros -rrb- .
by contrast it has been reported that , by the end of the games , china will have spent over 20 billion pounds -lrb- 25 billion euros , $ 39 billion -rrb- .
this has led to more general questions of whether it is at all useful to look to other countries ' examples when preparing to host the games .
officials in london have stressed the unique nature of each olympics based on the location and have also said how london has great potential to set its own standard .
boris johnson 's comments add to the concerns that the massive new building projects for the olympics may not provide lasting value for the poorer areas of east london where most of the sites are being built .
one of the main aims of hosting the olympics was to regenerate the area with a legacy of good sports facilities and more inspiration for young people to play sport .

" i do n't know what i should say about this , " she said .
" i ca n't seem to find the words . "
private leasing and selling " instead of expensive restoration is now apparently the word from rome .
in other words : getting rid of monuments instead of holding onto them .

" it just makes me scream and ask : ' how much further will italy sink ? " ' said gottfried wagner with disgust .
an historian , music scientist , writer and opera conductor , richard wagner 's great-grandson has been living in italy for almost 30 years .
the country has produced the greatest painters , composers and architects not just for europe , but for world history as well , wagner said .
" where will we end up if culture is only abused for political prostitution ? " he asked .
has the cultural legacy been lost ?
silvio berlusconi would be more than happy to silence the skeptics in italy - whether they are judges , monument preservationists or artists .
there has n't been talk of an interesting cultural sector for a long time now .
" nothing considerable is taking place anymore that i would probably appreciate , " wagner said , adding that in the past , there was a real sense of excitement and now that no longer exists .
" and this is the cultural and spiritual situation at the moment in italy and i could say this a thousand times over : it 's frightening , " he said .

the ministry of cultural assets , which would normally take responsibility for the " last supper " did not have enough money .
now the situation is even more depressing .
not even 3 percent of italian households will donate money for the maintenance of monuments .
and the cutbacks that the berlusconi government passed via a finance decree leave the budget of the ministry of cultural assets even smaller .

the firm reportedly expected to pay $ 100 million in bribes to argentine officials including menem and the then ministers of finance and interior .
siemens ' argentine headquarters , located near the historic plaza de mayo in central buenos aires , were searched in an effort to secure evidence on an order from judge ariel lijo .
former siemens officials claimed - in the context of a broader investigation against the german multinational firm - that the company paid bribes in argentina .
german courts forwarded the information to authorities in buenos aires . siemens in the 1990s was seeking a $ 1.26-billion contract to digitalize argentine identity documents and other services , the daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported .
the contract was signed under menem in 1998 but cancelled in 2001 by his successor , president fernando de la rua .
later , siemens allegedly paid further bribes until 2004 - under former argentine president nestor kirchner , husband of current president cristina fernandez de kirchner - in an effort to have the contract restored . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

stewart rankin , 58 , spoke out as it emerged there are now more than 500 people in wales awaiting transplants .
mr rankin , from rogerstone , newport said it was a " disgrace " that so many people were having to wait for help .
the assembly government is still considering the health committee 's report on organ donation .
the charity donate wales has announced the waiting list for people awaiting transplants in wales had reached more than 500 for the first time .
of the 501 people in wales listed , 437 are waiting for a kidney transplant .
mr rankin is one of four awaiting a heart transplant .
the father of two teenage daughters , who has a congenital heart condition , has been waiting for a total of 760 days .
he said : " the problem is that the welsh assembly committee has decided that it wo n't support a system of " presumed consent " and that will put off other parts of the uk who are looking at whether they should support it .
a new campaign asks people to tell loved ones their wishes " now the waiting list in wales for the first time has gone over the 500 mark .
" it 's a disgrace for any prosperous , civilised society to say that they have got 500 people who are presumably going to die waiting for a transplant . "
mr rankin formerly worked in a number of different jobs including running a smallholding , but now he stays at home while his wife connie goes to work .
the couple have two daughters willow , 18 , who is taking a gap year before going to university , and 16-year-old molly , who has just sat her gcses .
he said : " to treat the people who are waiting for transplants in wales costs £ 40m each year .
" to give all of transplants would cost around £ 8m , saving in the first year alone something like £ 30m . "
good intentions donate wales said in the last 20 weeks alone 13 people have died whilst on the waiting list .
roy thomas , the charity 's chairman , said the figures of 501 on the waiting list underlined why it was " so important more of us who want to help should join the organ donor register " .
the charity launched its tell a loved one campaign in may .
since then almost 14,000 have joined the register , but mr thomas said more are still needed with only 27 % of the welsh population signed up .
he said : " we would like to say thank you to those that have joined the organ donor register in wales and told their loved ones about their wishes , but the challenge does not stop there .
" we urge those that want to help to act on their good intentions and sign-up now .
it only takes a few minutes to do so and you could save a life one day . "
' public debates ' last month the assembly health committee voted not to support a system of " presumed consent " for organ donation .
instead , they said they wanted public sector bodies to do more to encourage people to sign up as organ and bone marrow donors .
a welsh assembly government spokesman said : " mrs hart has always made clear she is personally in favour of considering presumed consent as a way of increasing the number of organ donations .
" however , she recognises that any changes to legislation would require wide-ranging consultation and the testing of public opinion as this is a sensitive and emotive issue .
" she has asked officials to develop proposals on how we can take forward a public debate in wales on presumed consent .
" it is important that everyone has the opportunity to contribute , and we expect to launch a consultation and series of public debates on the issue in september . "

the bbc top gear programme 's jeremy clarkson wrote it off as a " weedy , useless little engine " .
but enthusiasts like xavier audran who owns a dozen of them , worships the 2cv " not just as a car , but as a way of life " .

advertisement unveiling the 2cv - courtesy cité des sciences et de l 'industrie it had one headlight , no starter motor and even its own designer , pierre jules boulanger , admitted it looked like an umbrella on wheels .
it was originally destined as a cheap country round-around for farmers , designed to be able to carry four people -lrb- or sheep -rrb- and a basket of eggs across a ploughed field without breaking any shells ... or indeed bones .
but its cheapness meant that the low-income segment of the french population could afford one , and soon there was a waiting list of five years .
economical on fuel , cheap to repair with an almost indestructible air-cooled engine and with a comically soft suspension that made it springy enough to bump along off road , the 2cv was the perfect family holiday car .
its removable back seats handily doubled up as a picnic bench , saving generations of skirts and trousers from unsightly grass stains .
' symbol of france ' these days it is fairly rare to see this most quintessentially french vehicle trundling along the roads .
but in paris , a fleet of 2cvs offers sightseeing trips to tourists .
florent dargnies says driving the 2cv is " an experience in itself " florent dargnies , who runs such tours , says the deux chevaux is the epitome of gallic charm .
" the 2cv is a symbol of france , i mean like the eiffel tower or the french baguette , " mr dargnies says .
" when you are in a 2cv you escape .
it is an experience in itself .
its an adventure , and you feel like you 're in a cosy cocoon . "
' indestructible ' france is celebrating the 60th anniversary of the 2cv with a special exhibition of the car at the cite des sciences et de l 'industrie in paris .
the fascinating display takes the visitor through the birth of the deux chevaux , with one of the five remaining examples of an abandoned early production run from 1939 , and follows the car through its numerous renaissances and modifications .
wistful ex-owners stroke the exhibits fondly , reminiscing about their 2cv salad days .
the standing 2cv joke was that it managed to do 0 to 60km in one day only five million 2cv cars were ever sold , but no-one knows how many people were 2cv owners - the little car was so tough that it rarely needed repairs and was the perfect hand-me-down vehicle .
perhaps , its indestructibility was its downfall - a car which never needed spare parts was not going to make big profits for manufacturers .
its lack of vroom also became a bit of problem in the modern age of speed .
the standing 2cv joke was that it managed to do 0 to 60km / h -lrb- 37mph -rrb- in one day .
i remember driving with my french friend francoise in our university holidays in devon - her 2cv happily took us to the beach but - at the first sign of a hill - i had to get out and help push her up .
the deux chevaux is often unfairly accused , however , of earning its name because it only had a two-horse power capacity - in fact it had an eight-chevaux capacity and its name refers to the very low tax category into which it fell .
mr audran will not hear a word said against his favourite french car .
he has been all over europe in his various 2cvs , and this summer is off to attend a 2cv convention in italy .
what other car , he asks me , can do 40 miles -lrb- 64km -rrb- to the gallon , has a soft top and never suffers from electrical faults ?
his friend , he boasts , has even carried his donkey in his 2cv with its head sticking out of the roof .
jeremy clarkson may laugh but the truth is that the humble deux chevaux - designed to replace the horse and cart for farmers - revolutionised the french motor industry .

' indestructible ' france is celebrating the 60th anniversary of the 2cv with a special exhibition of the car at the cite des sciences et de l 'industrie in paris .
the fascinating display takes the visitor through the birth of the deux chevaux , with one of the five remaining examples of an abandoned early production run from 1939 , and follows the car through its numerous renaissances and modifications .

the standing 2cv joke was that it managed to do 0 to 60km in one day only five million 2cv cars were ever sold , but no-one knows how many people were 2cv owners - the little car was so tough that it rarely needed repairs and was the perfect hand-me-down vehicle .

the deux chevaux is often unfairly accused , however , of earning its name because it only had a two-horse power capacity - in fact it had an eight-chevaux capacity and its name refers to the very low tax category into which it fell .
mr audran will not hear a word said against his favourite french car .
he has been all over europe in his various 2cvs , and this summer is off to attend a 2cv convention in italy .

his friend , he boasts , has even carried his donkey in his 2cv with its head sticking out of the roof .

advertisement unveiling the 2cv - courtesy cité des sciences et de l 'industrie it had one headlight , no starter motor and even its own designer , pierre jules boulanger , admitted it looked like an umbrella on wheels .
it was originally destined as a cheap country round-around for farmers , designed to be able to carry four people -lrb- or sheep -rrb- and a basket of eggs across a ploughed field without breaking any shells ... or indeed bones .
but its cheapness meant that the low-income segment of the french population could afford one , and soon there was a waiting list of five years .
economical on fuel , cheap to repair with an almost indestructible air-cooled engine and with a comically soft suspension that made it springy enough to bump along off road , the 2cv was the perfect family holiday car .

" when you are in a 2cv you escape .

' indestructible ' france is celebrating the 60th anniversary of the 2cv with a special exhibition of the car at the cite des sciences et de l 'industrie in paris .
the fascinating display takes the visitor through the birth of the deux chevaux , with one of the five remaining examples of an abandoned early production run from 1939 , and follows the car through its numerous renaissances and modifications .
wistful ex-owners stroke the exhibits fondly , reminiscing about their 2cv salad days .
the standing 2cv joke was that it managed to do 0 to 60km in one day only five million 2cv cars were ever sold , but no-one knows how many people were 2cv owners - the little car was so tough that it rarely needed repairs and was the perfect hand-me-down vehicle .
