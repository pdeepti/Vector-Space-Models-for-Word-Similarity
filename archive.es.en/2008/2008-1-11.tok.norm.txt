however , the garbage has been officially received , albeit grudgingly . germany has stepped in to help resolve the naples rubbish crisis by accepting 30,000 tons of household waste from the italian city .
the port of bremerhaven plans to dispose of the rubbish , just under a third of the total amount of waste which has piled up on the streets of naples and its surrounding campania region over the last two weeks .
however , a spokesperson for the city government made it clear that the burning of the rubbish in a local waste incinerator would not become a regular occurrence and that bremerhaven was not entering the international disposal business .
" it was a one-off case of emergency aid , " the spokesperson said .
" it will not be extended . "
the 30,000 tons will be disposed of over the next six months .
bremerhaven has already dealt with 8,000 tons since local officials gave permission for the disposal action at the end of last year .
the waste is transported by train from italy to germany .

tensions over garbage spreading through italy meanwhile tensions related to the disposal of rubbish from naples and campania threatened to spill-over into other italian regions .
overnight police in sardinia detained dozens of people who tried to prevent ship carrying rubbish collected in naples from unloading it rotting cargo on the island .

the government also appointed the country 's former police chief as " special commissioner " giving him four months to supervise rubbish removal operations , an activity which officials say has been infiltrated by the local mafia , the camorra .

however , the garbage has been officially received , albeit grudgingly . germany has stepped in to help resolve the naples rubbish crisis by accepting 30,000 tons of household waste from the italian city .
the port of bremerhaven plans to dispose of the rubbish , just under a third of the total amount of waste which has piled up on the streets of naples and its surrounding campania region over the last two weeks .
however , a spokesperson for the city government made it clear that the burning of the rubbish in a local waste incinerator would not become a regular occurrence and that bremerhaven was not entering the international disposal business .
" it was a one-off case of emergency aid , " the spokesperson said .
" it will not be extended . "
the 30,000 tons will be disposed of over the next six months .
bremerhaven has already dealt with 8,000 tons since local officials gave permission for the disposal action at the end of last year .
the waste is transported by train from italy to germany .
an estimated 100,000 tons of rubbish has paralyzed naples , which lacks the facilities to dispose of the garbage .
the italian government has appointed a special commissioner to solve the crisis , which has led to clashes between residents and police .
eu commission chief demands action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy has been accused of ignoring eu directives on garbage the waste problem became an eu topic friday when european commission president demanded that italy should act swiftly to remove the rubbish .
" we are following with great attention what is happening in campania , " barroso told reporters at a function at the european college , an academic institution based in the northern italian city of parma .
barroso , recalling how the commission had begun a procedure against italy last july for " not respecting european legislation on the theme of refuse " said he hoped the italian government would " in a short time , " implement measures to solve the crisis .
barroso said he would discuss the rubbish issue with italian prime minister romano prodi in malta on saturday where both leaders are scheduled to attend celebrations marking the island state 's adoption of the euro currency .
tensions over garbage spreading through italy meanwhile tensions related to the disposal of rubbish from naples and campania threatened to spill-over into other italian regions .
overnight police in sardinia detained dozens of people who tried to prevent ship carrying rubbish collected in naples from unloading it rotting cargo on the island .
the protestors who included several local politicians were later released .
bildunterschrift : protests against the garbage have pitted security forces against angry residents the transport of rubbish to other italian regions was one of a series of measures announced by prodi on tuesday when he unveiled a plan to deal with the crisis which began when refuse removal trucks stopped operating in much of campania just before christmas because landfills were full .
the government also appointed the country 's former police chief as " special commissioner " giving him four months to supervise rubbish removal operations , an activity which officials say has been infiltrated by the local mafia , the camorra .
the activation of three energy recovery incinerators to serve naples - italy 's third largest city - and the rest of campania , were among a set of longer term measures announced by prodi to deal with the problem . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we very much hope this is going to become the reality come january 28 , and if not january 28 at the next earliest opportunity , " said jeremic on thursday , jan .

he suggested that the new chief prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia , serge brammertz , visit serbia before a decision is taken . jeremic said belgrade would do everything possible to ensure that war criminals , most eminently ex-general ratko mladic , are handed over to the tribunal . mladic , who is accused of masterminding the 1995 srebrenica massacre , in which more than 7,000 bosnian muslims were killed , is believed to be hiding out in serbia . germany says the pact is in europe 's interest steinmeier said europe had a strong interest in seeing " that the democratic and european path taken by serbia remains the path for the future of this country . " differences over the breakaway serb province of kosovo were not bridged at the talks .
steinmeier said the recent talks to resolve the status issue had ended in failure , but jeremic said they had achieved progress and called for more time to reach a negotiated settlement . the eu and the united nations want kosovo to assume a supervised form of statehood , but serbia , supported by russia , only wants to grant more autonomy to the province , which is mainly inhabited by ethnic albanians .

belgium and poland will also contribute to make up the shortfall in troops and equipment needed to launch the mission . the deployment aimed at protecting refugees from sudan 's darfur region , was originally planned to start in november but was delayed by a funding row and a lack of resources .
france had pledged at least 1,350 troops to the force , but on thursday offered more troops and aircraft to " help end a deadlock in discussions , " french defence ministry spokesman laurent teissere told a press conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy authorised the additional measures " the president of the republic has authorised the defence ministry to put additional means on the table , " he said .
france 's troop commitment is now expected to grow to about 3,500 soldiers , while other french resources could include logistical support units , helicopters and transport aircraft .
troops on ground in early february " we have all the means we need " for the force , which will protect hundreds of thousands of refugees from strife-torn darfur , an unnamed eu diplomat told reporters after a meeting of eu military experts in brussels . " the conclusion is that the eufor chad-car operation now has all that is needed to proceed to the next stage , which is for its commander , irish general pat nash , to draw up an operational plan , " he said . diplomats in brussels also said that russia and ukraine had taken part in the meeting and were examining whether they would provide aircraft for the mission . they provided no details about the contributions from belgium and poland but the poles were expected to contribute two helicopters . belgium had previously announced that it would be prepared to play a role in setting up the mission 's headquarters in chad , but a belgian military source said it could also send one or two aircraft . the mission 's other largest contributor , ireland , is also confident that it could also contribute to solving the shortfall in personnel and equipment .
at a military meeting on friday chaired by irish commander lieutenant general pat nash , diplomats agreed that the deployment is now viable for a launch in early february .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu troops will provide protection to refugees " eu military experts met and , for the first time , the conclusion is that they have what they need to launch the operation , " a diplomat said after the meeting .
the deployment still needs the go-ahead from eu ministers .
ireland 's defence minister willie o 'dea said on friday that the first irish troops will be on the ground in early february .
" while the process has taken longer than anticipated , it has reached a successful conclusion in the end , " o 'dea said in a statement .

a month later , he was guillotined in a leipzig prison yard , three days before his 25th birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler used the reichstag fire to consolidate his power the burning of the reichstag became a pivotal event as the power of the nazis grew , as they used it to incite fear about the threat of communism .
adolf hitler persuaded president paul von hindenburg to sign a decree curtailing some civil liberties , paving the way for the suppression of thousands of communists and other groups targeted by the nazis .
legal ups and downs after world war ii , van der lubbe 's brother attempted to have the verdict overturned , and had a short-lived success in 1980 , when a west german court complied .
three years later , however , the federal court of justice decided there had been no basis for re-examining the matter , and declared the west german court 's decision illegal .
on thursday though , the federal court , acting on a petition from a berlin lawyer , lifted the death penalty verdict based on a 1998 law that makes it possible to overturn legal injustices perpetrated by the nazis .
the acquittals of four other men tried alongside van der lubbe in 1933 remain in force , the prosecutor said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jürgen klinsmann guided the young german team to third place at the 2006 world cup , trumping all expectations . he will fill the position vacated by bayern 's current coach ottmar hitzfeld , who announced his decision to step down at the end of the season after criticism from the club management . hitzfeld came under fire when the team 's performance started to slide after a sparkling start to the season .
but bayern munich are still at the top of the bundesliga , and in their last game before the winter break they beat saloniki 6-0 in a uefa cup match . after turning down numerous requests - some public , others private - from the united states , australia and england , klinsmann 's job at bayern munich will be the first coaching position that he has held since handing over the top job in german soccer to his assistant joachim löw immediately after the 2006 world cup in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the man who decided to throw in the towel at bayern the current germany coach expressed surprise at the news .

it is a really exciting project that a former national coach who achieved a lot should coach a top club . " the president of bayern munich and soccer legend , franz beckenbauer has also welcomed the decision . " i do n't think it 's a bold decision .
it 's a clever and well-considered move , " the kaiser told the mass-market bild newspaper .
" jürgen klinsmann reaped success with his new methods in the national squad .
and i am sure he will also have success with bayern munich . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer , left , said hiring klinsi was a good move for bayern in the run-up to the world cup , klinsmann had been widely criticized in the media , which heaped scorn on his newfangled training methods imported from the united states where he has worked in sports consultancy .
but he and his squad went on to capture the imagination of the nation during the tournament in germany . this will not be the first time that klinsmann has been involved with the munich club .
he spent two years at bayern during his successful career as a player , helping them win the uefa cup and bundesliga title . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the garbage has been officially received , albeit grudgingly . germany has stepped in to help resolve the naples rubbish crisis by accepting 30,000 tons of household waste from the italian city .
the port of bremerhaven plans to dispose of the rubbish , just under a third of the total amount of waste which has piled up on the streets of naples and its surrounding campania region over the last two weeks .
however , a spokesperson for the city government made it clear that the burning of the rubbish in a local waste incinerator would not become a regular occurrence and that bremerhaven was not entering the international disposal business .
" it was a one-off case of emergency aid , " the spokesperson said .
" it will not be extended . "
the 30,000 tons will be disposed of over the next six months .
bremerhaven has already dealt with 8,000 tons since local officials gave permission for the disposal action at the end of last year .
the waste is transported by train from italy to germany .
an estimated 100,000 tons of rubbish has paralyzed naples , which lacks the facilities to dispose of the garbage .

barroso , recalling how the commission had begun a procedure against italy last july for " not respecting european legislation on the theme of refuse " said he hoped the italian government would " in a short time , " implement measures to solve the crisis .
barroso said he would discuss the rubbish issue with italian prime minister romano prodi in malta on saturday where both leaders are scheduled to attend celebrations marking the island state 's adoption of the euro currency .
tensions over garbage spreading through italy meanwhile tensions related to the disposal of rubbish from naples and campania threatened to spill-over into other italian regions .
overnight police in sardinia detained dozens of people who tried to prevent ship carrying rubbish collected in naples from unloading it rotting cargo on the island .
the protestors who included several local politicians were later released .
bildunterschrift : protests against the garbage have pitted security forces against angry residents the transport of rubbish to other italian regions was one of a series of measures announced by prodi on tuesday when he unveiled a plan to deal with the crisis which began when refuse removal trucks stopped operating in much of campania just before christmas because landfills were full .
the government also appointed the country 's former police chief as " special commissioner " giving him four months to supervise rubbish removal operations , an activity which officials say has been infiltrated by the local mafia , the camorra .

" the fact is that , when it comes to nuclear energy , germany is becoming ever more isolated , " a spokesperson from the atomic forum told the berliner zeitung . other countries have already recognized that protecting the climate while meeting energy needs is only possible through nuclear energy , the spokesperson said , but added that the association does n't see germany 's nuclear phase-out being reversed before the 2009 parliamentary elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever since the chernobyl disaster , germany has had a strong anti-nuclear movement under the former coalition government of social democrats and greens , germany committed to a total phase-out of nuclear power by the year 2020 .
current chancellor angela merkel , however , has repeatedly said that she believes nuclear power has a place in the country 's future " energy mix , " especially since germany is striving to reduce its output of carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming . germany is home to a strong anti-nuclear movement that has lobbied for the phase-out , saying the technology is n't safe , and that there 's still no satisfactory way of dealing with the storage of nuclear waste . " all the nuclear power plants in great britain created 82 billion kilowatt hours of power in 2005 - just a little bit more than renewable sources in germany in 2006 , " said greenpeace nuclear power expert heinz smital .
" instead of starting a nuclear adventure , great britain should also look to renewable energy .
there 's more than enough win on the island . " but the atomic forum feels opposition to nuclear power is waning . " there 's a shift in opinion among the population , " the association spokesperson said .
" a year ago , the majority rejected the idea of abandoning the phase-out , but this is no longer the case . " opportunity for german firms on thursday , jan .

" we are inviting companies to express an interest in building a new generation of power stations to replace the existing ones . " germany 's rwe and e.on have already said they are keen to get involved , though what form their participation would take , and whether they would be acting alone or with partners , is still open . following germany 's commitment to phasing out atomic energy , both companies began setting their sights at business opportunities abroad . " we 're talking with all the parties involved , " said an rwe spokeswoman .
" in addition to projects in the renewables field , gas-fired power plants and modern coal-fired power plants , we have also been looking into building new nuclear power plants .

" the fact is that , when it comes to nuclear energy , germany is becoming ever more isolated , " a spokesperson from the atomic forum told the berliner zeitung . other countries have already recognized that protecting the climate while meeting energy needs is only possible through nuclear energy , the spokesperson said , but added that the association does n't see germany 's nuclear phase-out being reversed before the 2009 parliamentary elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever since the chernobyl disaster , germany has had a strong anti-nuclear movement under the former coalition government of social democrats and greens , germany committed to a total phase-out of nuclear power by the year 2020 .
current chancellor angela merkel , however , has repeatedly said that she believes nuclear power has a place in the country 's future " energy mix , " especially since germany is striving to reduce its output of carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming . germany is home to a strong anti-nuclear movement that has lobbied for the phase-out , saying the technology is n't safe , and that there 's still no satisfactory way of dealing with the storage of nuclear waste . " all the nuclear power plants in great britain created 82 billion kilowatt hours of power in 2005 - just a little bit more than renewable sources in germany in 2006 , " said greenpeace nuclear power expert heinz smital .
" instead of starting a nuclear adventure , great britain should also look to renewable energy .
there 's more than enough win on the island . " but the atomic forum feels opposition to nuclear power is waning . " there 's a shift in opinion among the population , " the association spokesperson said .

" germany 's rwe and e.on have already said they are keen to get involved , though what form their participation would take , and whether they would be acting alone or with partners , is still open . following germany 's commitment to phasing out atomic energy , both companies began setting their sights at business opportunities abroad . " we 're talking with all the parties involved , " said an rwe spokeswoman .
" in addition to projects in the renewables field , gas-fired power plants and modern coal-fired power plants , we have also been looking into building new nuclear power plants .

" the fact is that , when it comes to nuclear energy , germany is becoming ever more isolated , " a spokesperson from the atomic forum told the berliner zeitung . other countries have already recognized that protecting the climate while meeting energy needs is only possible through nuclear energy , the spokesperson said , but added that the association does n't see germany 's nuclear phase-out being reversed before the 2009 parliamentary elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever since the chernobyl disaster , germany has had a strong anti-nuclear movement under the former coalition government of social democrats and greens , germany committed to a total phase-out of nuclear power by the year 2020 .
current chancellor angela merkel , however , has repeatedly said that she believes nuclear power has a place in the country 's future " energy mix , " especially since germany is striving to reduce its output of carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming . germany is home to a strong anti-nuclear movement that has lobbied for the phase-out , saying the technology is n't safe , and that there 's still no satisfactory way of dealing with the storage of nuclear waste . " all the nuclear power plants in great britain created 82 billion kilowatt hours of power in 2005 - just a little bit more than renewable sources in germany in 2006 , " said greenpeace nuclear power expert heinz smital .
" instead of starting a nuclear adventure , great britain should also look to renewable energy .
there 's more than enough win on the island . " but the atomic forum feels opposition to nuclear power is waning . " there 's a shift in opinion among the population , " the association spokesperson said .
" a year ago , the majority rejected the idea of abandoning the phase-out , but this is no longer the case . " opportunity for german firms on thursday , jan .

" we are inviting companies to express an interest in building a new generation of power stations to replace the existing ones . " germany 's rwe and e.on have already said they are keen to get involved , though what form their participation would take , and whether they would be acting alone or with partners , is still open . following germany 's commitment to phasing out atomic energy , both companies began setting their sights at business opportunities abroad . " we 're talking with all the parties involved , " said an rwe spokeswoman .
" in addition to projects in the renewables field , gas-fired power plants and modern coal-fired power plants , we have also been looking into building new nuclear power plants .

" we very much hope this is going to become the reality come january 28 , and if not january 28 at the next earliest opportunity , " said jeremic on thursday , jan .

he suggested that the new chief prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia , serge brammertz , visit serbia before a decision is taken . jeremic said belgrade would do everything possible to ensure that war criminals , most eminently ex-general ratko mladic , are handed over to the tribunal . mladic , who is accused of masterminding the 1995 srebrenica massacre , in which more than 7,000 bosnian muslims were killed , is believed to be hiding out in serbia . germany says the pact is in europe 's interest steinmeier said europe had a strong interest in seeing " that the democratic and european path taken by serbia remains the path for the future of this country . " differences over the breakaway serb province of kosovo were not bridged at the talks .
steinmeier said the recent talks to resolve the status issue had ended in failure , but jeremic said they had achieved progress and called for more time to reach a negotiated settlement . the eu and the united nations want kosovo to assume a supervised form of statehood , but serbia , supported by russia , only wants to grant more autonomy to the province , which is mainly inhabited by ethnic albanians .

" the fact is that , when it comes to nuclear energy , germany is becoming ever more isolated , " a spokesperson from the atomic forum told the berliner zeitung . other countries have already recognized that protecting the climate while meeting energy needs is only possible through nuclear energy , the spokesperson said , but added that the association does n't see germany 's nuclear phase-out being reversed before the 2009 parliamentary elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever since the chernobyl disaster , germany has had a strong anti-nuclear movement under the former coalition government of social democrats and greens , germany committed to a total phase-out of nuclear power by the year 2020 .
current chancellor angela merkel , however , has repeatedly said that she believes nuclear power has a place in the country 's future " energy mix , " especially since germany is striving to reduce its output of carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming . germany is home to a strong anti-nuclear movement that has lobbied for the phase-out , saying the technology is n't safe , and that there 's still no satisfactory way of dealing with the storage of nuclear waste . " all the nuclear power plants in great britain created 82 billion kilowatt hours of power in 2005 - just a little bit more than renewable sources in germany in 2006 , " said greenpeace nuclear power expert heinz smital .
" instead of starting a nuclear adventure , great britain should also look to renewable energy .
there 's more than enough win on the island . " but the atomic forum feels opposition to nuclear power is waning . " there 's a shift in opinion among the population , " the association spokesperson said .

however , the garbage has been officially received , albeit grudgingly . germany has stepped in to help resolve the naples rubbish crisis by accepting 30,000 tons of household waste from the italian city .
the port of bremerhaven plans to dispose of the rubbish , just under a third of the total amount of waste which has piled up on the streets of naples and its surrounding campania region over the last two weeks .
however , a spokesperson for the city government made it clear that the burning of the rubbish in a local waste incinerator would not become a regular occurrence and that bremerhaven was not entering the international disposal business .
" it was a one-off case of emergency aid , " the spokesperson said .
" it will not be extended . "
the 30,000 tons will be disposed of over the next six months .
bremerhaven has already dealt with 8,000 tons since local officials gave permission for the disposal action at the end of last year .
the waste is transported by train from italy to germany .
an estimated 100,000 tons of rubbish has paralyzed naples , which lacks the facilities to dispose of the garbage .
the italian government has appointed a special commissioner to solve the crisis , which has led to clashes between residents and police .
eu commission chief demands action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy has been accused of ignoring eu directives on garbage the waste problem became an eu topic friday when european commission president demanded that italy should act swiftly to remove the rubbish .
" we are following with great attention what is happening in campania , " barroso told reporters at a function at the european college , an academic institution based in the northern italian city of parma .
barroso , recalling how the commission had begun a procedure against italy last july for " not respecting european legislation on the theme of refuse " said he hoped the italian government would " in a short time , " implement measures to solve the crisis .
barroso said he would discuss the rubbish issue with italian prime minister romano prodi in malta on saturday where both leaders are scheduled to attend celebrations marking the island state 's adoption of the euro currency .
tensions over garbage spreading through italy meanwhile tensions related to the disposal of rubbish from naples and campania threatened to spill-over into other italian regions .
overnight police in sardinia detained dozens of people who tried to prevent ship carrying rubbish collected in naples from unloading it rotting cargo on the island .
the protestors who included several local politicians were later released .
bildunterschrift : protests against the garbage have pitted security forces against angry residents the transport of rubbish to other italian regions was one of a series of measures announced by prodi on tuesday when he unveiled a plan to deal with the crisis which began when refuse removal trucks stopped operating in much of campania just before christmas because landfills were full .
the government also appointed the country 's former police chief as " special commissioner " giving him four months to supervise rubbish removal operations , an activity which officials say has been infiltrated by the local mafia , the camorra .
the activation of three energy recovery incinerators to serve naples - italy 's third largest city - and the rest of campania , were among a set of longer term measures announced by prodi to deal with the problem . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , a spokesperson for the city government made it clear that the burning of the rubbish in a local waste incinerator would not become a regular occurrence and that bremerhaven was not entering the international disposal business .
" it was a one-off case of emergency aid , " the spokesperson said .
" it will not be extended . "
the 30,000 tons will be disposed of over the next six months .
bremerhaven has already dealt with 8,000 tons since local officials gave permission for the disposal action at the end of last year .
the waste is transported by train from italy to germany .
an estimated 100,000 tons of rubbish has paralyzed naples , which lacks the facilities to dispose of the garbage .
the italian government has appointed a special commissioner to solve the crisis , which has led to clashes between residents and police .
eu commission chief demands action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy has been accused of ignoring eu directives on garbage the waste problem became an eu topic friday when european commission president demanded that italy should act swiftly to remove the rubbish .
" we are following with great attention what is happening in campania , " barroso told reporters at a function at the european college , an academic institution based in the northern italian city of parma .
barroso , recalling how the commission had begun a procedure against italy last july for " not respecting european legislation on the theme of refuse " said he hoped the italian government would " in a short time , " implement measures to solve the crisis .
barroso said he would discuss the rubbish issue with italian prime minister romano prodi in malta on saturday where both leaders are scheduled to attend celebrations marking the island state 's adoption of the euro currency .
tensions over garbage spreading through italy meanwhile tensions related to the disposal of rubbish from naples and campania threatened to spill-over into other italian regions .
overnight police in sardinia detained dozens of people who tried to prevent ship carrying rubbish collected in naples from unloading it rotting cargo on the island .
the protestors who included several local politicians were later released .
bildunterschrift : protests against the garbage have pitted security forces against angry residents the transport of rubbish to other italian regions was one of a series of measures announced by prodi on tuesday when he unveiled a plan to deal with the crisis which began when refuse removal trucks stopped operating in much of campania just before christmas because landfills were full .
the government also appointed the country 's former police chief as " special commissioner " giving him four months to supervise rubbish removal operations , an activity which officials say has been infiltrated by the local mafia , the camorra .
the activation of three energy recovery incinerators to serve naples - italy 's third largest city - and the rest of campania , were among a set of longer term measures announced by prodi to deal with the problem . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a month later , he was guillotined in a leipzig prison yard , three days before his 25th birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler used the reichstag fire to consolidate his power the burning of the reichstag became a pivotal event as the power of the nazis grew , as they used it to incite fear about the threat of communism .
adolf hitler persuaded president paul von hindenburg to sign a decree curtailing some civil liberties , paving the way for the suppression of thousands of communists and other groups targeted by the nazis .
legal ups and downs after world war ii , van der lubbe 's brother attempted to have the verdict overturned , and had a short-lived success in 1980 , when a west german court complied .
three years later , however , the federal court of justice decided there had been no basis for re-examining the matter , and declared the west german court 's decision illegal .
on thursday though , the federal court , acting on a petition from a berlin lawyer , lifted the death penalty verdict based on a 1998 law that makes it possible to overturn legal injustices perpetrated by the nazis .
the acquittals of four other men tried alongside van der lubbe in 1933 remain in force , the prosecutor said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the fact is that , when it comes to nuclear energy , germany is becoming ever more isolated , " a spokesperson from the atomic forum told the berliner zeitung . other countries have already recognized that protecting the climate while meeting energy needs is only possible through nuclear energy , the spokesperson said , but added that the association does n't see germany 's nuclear phase-out being reversed before the 2009 parliamentary elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever since the chernobyl disaster , germany has had a strong anti-nuclear movement under the former coalition government of social democrats and greens , germany committed to a total phase-out of nuclear power by the year 2020 .
current chancellor angela merkel , however , has repeatedly said that she believes nuclear power has a place in the country 's future " energy mix , " especially since germany is striving to reduce its output of carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming . germany is home to a strong anti-nuclear movement that has lobbied for the phase-out , saying the technology is n't safe , and that there 's still no satisfactory way of dealing with the storage of nuclear waste . " all the nuclear power plants in great britain created 82 billion kilowatt hours of power in 2005 - just a little bit more than renewable sources in germany in 2006 , " said greenpeace nuclear power expert heinz smital .
" instead of starting a nuclear adventure , great britain should also look to renewable energy .
there 's more than enough win on the island . " but the atomic forum feels opposition to nuclear power is waning . " there 's a shift in opinion among the population , " the association spokesperson said .
" a year ago , the majority rejected the idea of abandoning the phase-out , but this is no longer the case . " opportunity for german firms on thursday , jan .

" germany 's rwe and e.on have already said they are keen to get involved , though what form their participation would take , and whether they would be acting alone or with partners , is still open . following germany 's commitment to phasing out atomic energy , both companies began setting their sights at business opportunities abroad . " we 're talking with all the parties involved , " said an rwe spokeswoman .
" in addition to projects in the renewables field , gas-fired power plants and modern coal-fired power plants , we have also been looking into building new nuclear power plants .

he suggested that the new chief prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia , serge brammertz , visit serbia before a decision is taken . jeremic said belgrade would do everything possible to ensure that war criminals , most eminently ex-general ratko mladic , are handed over to the tribunal . mladic , who is accused of masterminding the 1995 srebrenica massacre , in which more than 7,000 bosnian muslims were killed , is believed to be hiding out in serbia . germany says the pact is in europe 's interest steinmeier said europe had a strong interest in seeing " that the democratic and european path taken by serbia remains the path for the future of this country . " differences over the breakaway serb province of kosovo were not bridged at the talks .
steinmeier said the recent talks to resolve the status issue had ended in failure , but jeremic said they had achieved progress and called for more time to reach a negotiated settlement . the eu and the united nations want kosovo to assume a supervised form of statehood , but serbia , supported by russia , only wants to grant more autonomy to the province , which is mainly inhabited by ethnic albanians .

a month later , he was guillotined in a leipzig prison yard , three days before his 25th birthday .

adolf hitler persuaded president paul von hindenburg to sign a decree curtailing some civil liberties , paving the way for the suppression of thousands of communists and other groups targeted by the nazis .
legal ups and downs after world war ii , van der lubbe 's brother attempted to have the verdict overturned , and had a short-lived success in 1980 , when a west german court complied .
three years later , however , the federal court of justice decided there had been no basis for re-examining the matter , and declared the west german court 's decision illegal .
on thursday though , the federal court , acting on a petition from a berlin lawyer , lifted the death penalty verdict based on a 1998 law that makes it possible to overturn legal injustices perpetrated by the nazis .

however , the garbage has been officially received , albeit grudgingly . germany has stepped in to help resolve the naples rubbish crisis by accepting 30,000 tons of household waste from the italian city .
the port of bremerhaven plans to dispose of the rubbish , just under a third of the total amount of waste which has piled up on the streets of naples and its surrounding campania region over the last two weeks .
however , a spokesperson for the city government made it clear that the burning of the rubbish in a local waste incinerator would not become a regular occurrence and that bremerhaven was not entering the international disposal business .
" it was a one-off case of emergency aid , " the spokesperson said .
" it will not be extended . "
the 30,000 tons will be disposed of over the next six months .
bremerhaven has already dealt with 8,000 tons since local officials gave permission for the disposal action at the end of last year .
the waste is transported by train from italy to germany .
an estimated 100,000 tons of rubbish has paralyzed naples , which lacks the facilities to dispose of the garbage .
the italian government has appointed a special commissioner to solve the crisis , which has led to clashes between residents and police .
eu commission chief demands action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy has been accused of ignoring eu directives on garbage the waste problem became an eu topic friday when european commission president demanded that italy should act swiftly to remove the rubbish .
" we are following with great attention what is happening in campania , " barroso told reporters at a function at the european college , an academic institution based in the northern italian city of parma .
barroso , recalling how the commission had begun a procedure against italy last july for " not respecting european legislation on the theme of refuse " said he hoped the italian government would " in a short time , " implement measures to solve the crisis .
barroso said he would discuss the rubbish issue with italian prime minister romano prodi in malta on saturday where both leaders are scheduled to attend celebrations marking the island state 's adoption of the euro currency .
tensions over garbage spreading through italy meanwhile tensions related to the disposal of rubbish from naples and campania threatened to spill-over into other italian regions .
overnight police in sardinia detained dozens of people who tried to prevent ship carrying rubbish collected in naples from unloading it rotting cargo on the island .
the protestors who included several local politicians were later released .
bildunterschrift : protests against the garbage have pitted security forces against angry residents the transport of rubbish to other italian regions was one of a series of measures announced by prodi on tuesday when he unveiled a plan to deal with the crisis which began when refuse removal trucks stopped operating in much of campania just before christmas because landfills were full .
the government also appointed the country 's former police chief as " special commissioner " giving him four months to supervise rubbish removal operations , an activity which officials say has been infiltrated by the local mafia , the camorra .
the activation of three energy recovery incinerators to serve naples - italy 's third largest city - and the rest of campania , were among a set of longer term measures announced by prodi to deal with the problem . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 30,000 tons will be disposed of over the next six months .
bremerhaven has already dealt with 8,000 tons since local officials gave permission for the disposal action at the end of last year .
the waste is transported by train from italy to germany .
an estimated 100,000 tons of rubbish has paralyzed naples , which lacks the facilities to dispose of the garbage .
the italian government has appointed a special commissioner to solve the crisis , which has led to clashes between residents and police .
eu commission chief demands action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy has been accused of ignoring eu directives on garbage the waste problem became an eu topic friday when european commission president demanded that italy should act swiftly to remove the rubbish .
" we are following with great attention what is happening in campania , " barroso told reporters at a function at the european college , an academic institution based in the northern italian city of parma .
barroso , recalling how the commission had begun a procedure against italy last july for " not respecting european legislation on the theme of refuse " said he hoped the italian government would " in a short time , " implement measures to solve the crisis .
barroso said he would discuss the rubbish issue with italian prime minister romano prodi in malta on saturday where both leaders are scheduled to attend celebrations marking the island state 's adoption of the euro currency .
tensions over garbage spreading through italy meanwhile tensions related to the disposal of rubbish from naples and campania threatened to spill-over into other italian regions .
overnight police in sardinia detained dozens of people who tried to prevent ship carrying rubbish collected in naples from unloading it rotting cargo on the island .
the protestors who included several local politicians were later released .
bildunterschrift : protests against the garbage have pitted security forces against angry residents the transport of rubbish to other italian regions was one of a series of measures announced by prodi on tuesday when he unveiled a plan to deal with the crisis which began when refuse removal trucks stopped operating in much of campania just before christmas because landfills were full .
the government also appointed the country 's former police chief as " special commissioner " giving him four months to supervise rubbish removal operations , an activity which officials say has been infiltrated by the local mafia , the camorra .
the activation of three energy recovery incinerators to serve naples - italy 's third largest city - and the rest of campania , were among a set of longer term measures announced by prodi to deal with the problem . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we very much hope this is going to become the reality come january 28 , and if not january 28 at the next earliest opportunity , " said jeremic on thursday , jan .
10 . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also agreed that the meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on that date was the ideal time for signing the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- . agreement rests on co-operation with the hague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vuk jeremic would like to see an agreement by the end of january but he said the go-ahead depended on full cooperation by belgrade with the un war crimes tribunal based in the hague .
he suggested that the new chief prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia , serge brammertz , visit serbia before a decision is taken . jeremic said belgrade would do everything possible to ensure that war criminals , most eminently ex-general ratko mladic , are handed over to the tribunal . mladic , who is accused of masterminding the 1995 srebrenica massacre , in which more than 7,000 bosnian muslims were killed , is believed to be hiding out in serbia . germany says the pact is in europe 's interest steinmeier said europe had a strong interest in seeing " that the democratic and european path taken by serbia remains the path for the future of this country . " differences over the breakaway serb province of kosovo were not bridged at the talks .
steinmeier said the recent talks to resolve the status issue had ended in failure , but jeremic said they had achieved progress and called for more time to reach a negotiated settlement . the eu and the united nations want kosovo to assume a supervised form of statehood , but serbia , supported by russia , only wants to grant more autonomy to the province , which is mainly inhabited by ethnic albanians .

however , the garbage has been officially received , albeit grudgingly . germany has stepped in to help resolve the naples rubbish crisis by accepting 30,000 tons of household waste from the italian city .
the port of bremerhaven plans to dispose of the rubbish , just under a third of the total amount of waste which has piled up on the streets of naples and its surrounding campania region over the last two weeks .
however , a spokesperson for the city government made it clear that the burning of the rubbish in a local waste incinerator would not become a regular occurrence and that bremerhaven was not entering the international disposal business .
" it was a one-off case of emergency aid , " the spokesperson said .
" it will not be extended . "
the 30,000 tons will be disposed of over the next six months .
bremerhaven has already dealt with 8,000 tons since local officials gave permission for the disposal action at the end of last year .
the waste is transported by train from italy to germany .
an estimated 100,000 tons of rubbish has paralyzed naples , which lacks the facilities to dispose of the garbage .
the italian government has appointed a special commissioner to solve the crisis , which has led to clashes between residents and police .
eu commission chief demands action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy has been accused of ignoring eu directives on garbage the waste problem became an eu topic friday when european commission president demanded that italy should act swiftly to remove the rubbish .
" we are following with great attention what is happening in campania , " barroso told reporters at a function at the european college , an academic institution based in the northern italian city of parma .
barroso , recalling how the commission had begun a procedure against italy last july for " not respecting european legislation on the theme of refuse " said he hoped the italian government would " in a short time , " implement measures to solve the crisis .
barroso said he would discuss the rubbish issue with italian prime minister romano prodi in malta on saturday where both leaders are scheduled to attend celebrations marking the island state 's adoption of the euro currency .
tensions over garbage spreading through italy meanwhile tensions related to the disposal of rubbish from naples and campania threatened to spill-over into other italian regions .
overnight police in sardinia detained dozens of people who tried to prevent ship carrying rubbish collected in naples from unloading it rotting cargo on the island .
the protestors who included several local politicians were later released .
bildunterschrift : protests against the garbage have pitted security forces against angry residents the transport of rubbish to other italian regions was one of a series of measures announced by prodi on tuesday when he unveiled a plan to deal with the crisis which began when refuse removal trucks stopped operating in much of campania just before christmas because landfills were full .
the government also appointed the country 's former police chief as " special commissioner " giving him four months to supervise rubbish removal operations , an activity which officials say has been infiltrated by the local mafia , the camorra .
the activation of three energy recovery incinerators to serve naples - italy 's third largest city - and the rest of campania , were among a set of longer term measures announced by prodi to deal with the problem . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the fact is that , when it comes to nuclear energy , germany is becoming ever more isolated , " a spokesperson from the atomic forum told the berliner zeitung . other countries have already recognized that protecting the climate while meeting energy needs is only possible through nuclear energy , the spokesperson said , but added that the association does n't see germany 's nuclear phase-out being reversed before the 2009 parliamentary elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever since the chernobyl disaster , germany has had a strong anti-nuclear movement under the former coalition government of social democrats and greens , germany committed to a total phase-out of nuclear power by the year 2020 .
current chancellor angela merkel , however , has repeatedly said that she believes nuclear power has a place in the country 's future " energy mix , " especially since germany is striving to reduce its output of carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming . germany is home to a strong anti-nuclear movement that has lobbied for the phase-out , saying the technology is n't safe , and that there 's still no satisfactory way of dealing with the storage of nuclear waste . " all the nuclear power plants in great britain created 82 billion kilowatt hours of power in 2005 - just a little bit more than renewable sources in germany in 2006 , " said greenpeace nuclear power expert heinz smital .
" instead of starting a nuclear adventure , great britain should also look to renewable energy .
there 's more than enough win on the island . " but the atomic forum feels opposition to nuclear power is waning . " there 's a shift in opinion among the population , " the association spokesperson said .
" a year ago , the majority rejected the idea of abandoning the phase-out , but this is no longer the case . " opportunity for german firms on thursday , jan .
10 , the british government approved a new generation of nuclear power stations to be built by private companies without public subsidy , saying they would help britain meet its climate change goals and avoid overdependence on foreign oil and gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german company rwe is eyeing opportunities in britain " we want britain to be more secure in its energy supply , " british prime minister gordon brown said .
" we are inviting companies to express an interest in building a new generation of power stations to replace the existing ones . " germany 's rwe and e.on have already said they are keen to get involved , though what form their participation would take , and whether they would be acting alone or with partners , is still open . following germany 's commitment to phasing out atomic energy , both companies began setting their sights at business opportunities abroad . " we 're talking with all the parties involved , " said an rwe spokeswoman .

however , the garbage has been officially received , albeit grudgingly . germany has stepped in to help resolve the naples rubbish crisis by accepting 30,000 tons of household waste from the italian city .
the port of bremerhaven plans to dispose of the rubbish , just under a third of the total amount of waste which has piled up on the streets of naples and its surrounding campania region over the last two weeks .
however , a spokesperson for the city government made it clear that the burning of the rubbish in a local waste incinerator would not become a regular occurrence and that bremerhaven was not entering the international disposal business .
" it was a one-off case of emergency aid , " the spokesperson said .
" it will not be extended . "
the 30,000 tons will be disposed of over the next six months .
bremerhaven has already dealt with 8,000 tons since local officials gave permission for the disposal action at the end of last year .

" we are following with great attention what is happening in campania , " barroso told reporters at a function at the european college , an academic institution based in the northern italian city of parma .
barroso , recalling how the commission had begun a procedure against italy last july for " not respecting european legislation on the theme of refuse " said he hoped the italian government would " in a short time , " implement measures to solve the crisis .
barroso said he would discuss the rubbish issue with italian prime minister romano prodi in malta on saturday where both leaders are scheduled to attend celebrations marking the island state 's adoption of the euro currency .
tensions over garbage spreading through italy meanwhile tensions related to the disposal of rubbish from naples and campania threatened to spill-over into other italian regions .
overnight police in sardinia detained dozens of people who tried to prevent ship carrying rubbish collected in naples from unloading it rotting cargo on the island .
the protestors who included several local politicians were later released .
bildunterschrift : protests against the garbage have pitted security forces against angry residents the transport of rubbish to other italian regions was one of a series of measures announced by prodi on tuesday when he unveiled a plan to deal with the crisis which began when refuse removal trucks stopped operating in much of campania just before christmas because landfills were full .
the government also appointed the country 's former police chief as " special commissioner " giving him four months to supervise rubbish removal operations , an activity which officials say has been infiltrated by the local mafia , the camorra .
the activation of three energy recovery incinerators to serve naples - italy 's third largest city - and the rest of campania , were among a set of longer term measures announced by prodi to deal with the problem . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the fact is that , when it comes to nuclear energy , germany is becoming ever more isolated , " a spokesperson from the atomic forum told the berliner zeitung . other countries have already recognized that protecting the climate while meeting energy needs is only possible through nuclear energy , the spokesperson said , but added that the association does n't see germany 's nuclear phase-out being reversed before the 2009 parliamentary elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever since the chernobyl disaster , germany has had a strong anti-nuclear movement under the former coalition government of social democrats and greens , germany committed to a total phase-out of nuclear power by the year 2020 .
current chancellor angela merkel , however , has repeatedly said that she believes nuclear power has a place in the country 's future " energy mix , " especially since germany is striving to reduce its output of carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming . germany is home to a strong anti-nuclear movement that has lobbied for the phase-out , saying the technology is n't safe , and that there 's still no satisfactory way of dealing with the storage of nuclear waste . " all the nuclear power plants in great britain created 82 billion kilowatt hours of power in 2005 - just a little bit more than renewable sources in germany in 2006 , " said greenpeace nuclear power expert heinz smital .
" instead of starting a nuclear adventure , great britain should also look to renewable energy .
there 's more than enough win on the island . " but the atomic forum feels opposition to nuclear power is waning . " there 's a shift in opinion among the population , " the association spokesperson said .
" a year ago , the majority rejected the idea of abandoning the phase-out , but this is no longer the case . " opportunity for german firms on thursday , jan .

" we are inviting companies to express an interest in building a new generation of power stations to replace the existing ones . " germany 's rwe and e.on have already said they are keen to get involved , though what form their participation would take , and whether they would be acting alone or with partners , is still open . following germany 's commitment to phasing out atomic energy , both companies began setting their sights at business opportunities abroad . " we 're talking with all the parties involved , " said an rwe spokeswoman .
" in addition to projects in the renewables field , gas-fired power plants and modern coal-fired power plants , we have also been looking into building new nuclear power plants .

the government also appointed the country 's former police chief as " special commissioner " giving him four months to supervise rubbish removal operations , an activity which officials say has been infiltrated by the local mafia , the camorra .
the activation of three energy recovery incinerators to serve naples - italy 's third largest city - and the rest of campania , were among a set of longer term measures announced by prodi to deal with the problem . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a month later , he was guillotined in a leipzig prison yard , three days before his 25th birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler used the reichstag fire to consolidate his power the burning of the reichstag became a pivotal event as the power of the nazis grew , as they used it to incite fear about the threat of communism .
adolf hitler persuaded president paul von hindenburg to sign a decree curtailing some civil liberties , paving the way for the suppression of thousands of communists and other groups targeted by the nazis .
legal ups and downs after world war ii , van der lubbe 's brother attempted to have the verdict overturned , and had a short-lived success in 1980 , when a west german court complied .
three years later , however , the federal court of justice decided there had been no basis for re-examining the matter , and declared the west german court 's decision illegal .
on thursday though , the federal court , acting on a petition from a berlin lawyer , lifted the death penalty verdict based on a 1998 law that makes it possible to overturn legal injustices perpetrated by the nazis .
the acquittals of four other men tried alongside van der lubbe in 1933 remain in force , the prosecutor said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

annual signalling and track work usually means the closure of the six-mile purbeck line every january for five weeks .
but volunteers are running a special weekend service from norden to corfe castle and harman 's cross .
the 40-minute service uses a heritage diesel " railbus " dating from the 1960s .
it will run on saturdays and sundays , with eight trains a day running between norden park-and-ride , corfe castle and harman 's cross until 3 february .
last year the railway carried more than 200,000 passengers .
first year-long service " the swanage railway is not just a very successful tourist attraction - it 's a major people mover too so it 's important that we maintain as much of the weekend public train service as possible during our major engineering works at swanage , " said mick dean , swanage railway 's general manager .
" this is the first time that we have run trains between norden park and ride , corfe castle and harman 's cross during the new year shut down at swanage - meaning that for the first time we are running trains on every weekend throughout the year . "
last year , volunteers from swanage railway raised £ 30,000 in order to bring back to the uk a pullman observation coach from california to be used on the line .

the announcement follows a packed public meeting on thursday night to discuss the theatre 's future .
it was called by dick penny , managing director of the watershed media centre , who is still considering whether to take over as chairman of the trustees .
the old vic , which temporarily closed last summer for a refit , has been struggling with a cash crisis .
the original cost of the upgrade was put at £ 7m , but this has now risen to £ 9m .
the theatre was already £ 2m short of the initial figure and a fund-raising campaign was launched to make up the shortfall .
passion for bristol mr penny said he was taken aback by the strength of feeling for saving the theatre .
" what was impressive was not the numbers of people who turned out , but the passion for bristol , " he said .
" it 's not about one institution , it 's about our city and it was quite extraordinary .
i did go away rather shaky . "
nick capaldi , from the arts council , added : " it was a magnificent occasion , a real piece of theatre in its own right .

" we 're there to be convinced , we 've said we want to see vibrant active exciting theatre in bristol .
we 'll be making decisions by the end of the month . "
a host of actors , writers and directors have put their support behind the theatre .
actress jane lapotaire , who trained at the old vic said : " i 've been absolutely exhilarated by the strength of the feeling in the auditorium from the people of bristol about this beautiful building and how it should be shared by every group that lives in the city and how we could get it up and running again .

over 16,500 adults sought treatment for cannabis use in england in 2006/7 compared with 11,057 two years earlier when the drug moved from class b to c. currently 500 adults and children are being treated in england each week .
the department of health said the rise in treatment reflected improvements in drug treatment and not cannabis use .
but marjorie wallace of the mental health charity sane said the reality was now that hospital beds were filling up with people suffering the effects of cannabis addiction , depriving others from treatment .
figures also show hospitals are treating more than 1,000 cases of alcohol-related problems a day .
drug and alcohol campaigners said the data showed young people were particularly at risk .
abuse the number of children needing medical help in hospitals or clinics after smoking cannabis has risen to more than 9,200 .
and among under-18s there was a rise of 40 % in those seen by doctors in casualty or in the consulting room for alcohol-related problems over the last seven years .
the government is currently considering whether to reverse its reclassification .
advocates of downgrading cannabis say the risks are low compared with alcohol or tobacco . "
treatment services are getting better at engaging those in need of treatment , " a department of health spokeswoman but others say the drug should be moved back to class b , in line with drugs like amphetamines .
this would mean people in possession could be jailed for five years and charged an unlimited fine .
for possession of class c drugs , such as steroids , the maximum penalty is a two-year prison sentence , but charges are rarely brought against people found with small quantities of such drugs .
the british medical association said the figures strengthened its opposition to the drug .
a spokesman said : " this is a drug that is mostly smoked , so that can cause lung damage and cancer .
" there are also concerns about the potential negative effect cannabis has on users ' psychiatric state . "
a department of health spokeswoman said : " the increasing numbers accessing treatment as a result of cannabis use demonstrates that treatment services are getting better at engaging those in need of treatment , despite an overall reduction in the prevalence of cannabis use . "
addaction , a charity that treats people with drug problems , warned that young people often use cannabis at crucial development stages in their lives .
" it does have serious impacts on mental health and physical development , " said a spokesman .
marjorie wallace , of the mental health charity sane , said the figures were shocking , but not surprising .
she said : " the reality is now that hospital beds are filling up with people suffering the effects of cannabis addiction , depriving others from treatment .
" sane been saying for years that cannabis is a dangerous drug ; for some young people regular use can double the risk of developing later schizophrenia .
" you only need to see one person whose mind has been distorted and life irreparably damaged , or talk to their family , to realise that the headlines are not scaremongering but reflect daily , and preventable , tragedies . "
alcohol concern said the figures on alchol abuse provided ample evidence for the need for a very serious look at the price and affordability .
spokesman don shenker added : " the number of off licences still selling alcohol to under age drinkers shows that a much stiffer penalty regime is required . "

over 16,500 adults sought treatment for cannabis use in england in 2006/7 compared with 11,057 two years earlier when the drug moved from class b to c. currently 500 adults and children are being treated in england each week .
the department of health said the rise in treatment reflected improvements in drug treatment and not cannabis use .
but marjorie wallace of the mental health charity sane said the reality was now that hospital beds were filling up with people suffering the effects of cannabis addiction , depriving others from treatment .
figures also show hospitals are treating more than 1,000 cases of alcohol-related problems a day .
drug and alcohol campaigners said the data showed young people were particularly at risk .
abuse the number of children needing medical help in hospitals or clinics after smoking cannabis has risen to more than 9,200 .
and among under-18s there was a rise of 40 % in those seen by doctors in casualty or in the consulting room for alcohol-related problems over the last seven years .
the government is currently considering whether to reverse its reclassification .
advocates of downgrading cannabis say the risks are low compared with alcohol or tobacco .
treatment services are getting better at engaging those in need of treatment , a department of health spokeswoman but others say the drug should be moved back to class b , in line with drugs like amphetamines .
this would mean people in possession could be jailed for five years and charged an unlimited fine .
for possession of class c drugs , such as steroids , the maximum penalty is a two-year prison sentence , but charges are rarely brought against people found with small quantities of such drugs .
the british medical association said the figures strengthened its opposition to the drug .
a spokesman said : " this is a drug that is mostly smoked , so that can cause lung damage and cancer .
" there are also concerns about the potential negative effect cannabis has on users ' psychiatric state . "
a department of health spokeswoman said : " the increasing numbers accessing treatment as a result of cannabis use demonstrates that treatment services are getting better at engaging those in need of treatment , despite an overall reduction in the prevalence of cannabis use . "
addaction , a charity that treats people with drug problems , warned that young people often use cannabis at crucial development stages in their lives .
" it does have serious impacts on mental health and physical development , " said a spokesman .
marjorie wallace , of the mental health charity sane , said the figures were shocking , but not surprising .
she said : " the reality is now that hospital beds are filling up with people suffering the effects of cannabis addiction , depriving others from treatment .
" sane been saying for years that cannabis is a dangerous drug ; for some young people regular use can double the risk of developing later schizophrenia .
" you only need to see one person whose mind has been distorted and life irreparably damaged , or talk to their family , to realise that the headlines are not scaremongering but reflect daily , and preventable , tragedies . "
alcohol concern said the figures on alchol abuse provided ample evidence for the need for a very serious look at the price and affordability .
spokesman don shenker added : " the number of off licences still selling alcohol to under age drinkers shows that a much stiffer penalty regime is required . "

but how did it earn this status in the first place ?
the european union launched the capital of culture programme to replace the city of culture status , which began with athens in 1985 .
every eu member state has been awarded the accolade on rotation for the years up to 2019 , and the uk allocated 2008 .
it was left to the uk government to decide which of its cities would be nominated .
the norwegian city of stavanger has also been named a capital of culture for 2008 .
how was liverpool chosen ?
initially , a dozen cities were contesting the title , and a 12-person committee of judges was appointed to evaluate their bids .
the original entrants belfast birmingham bradford brighton and hove bristol canterbury and east kent cardiff inverness and the highlands liverpool newcastle and gateshead norwich oxford it was chaired by the former general director of the royal opera house , sir jeremy isaacs , with ex-bbc presenter sue macgregor and judith mayhew from the corporation of london as the deputy chairs .
after the judges visited all 12 cities , they announced a final shortlist of six in october 2002 .
the other contenders were birmingham , bristol , cardiff , newcastle-gateshead and oxford .
how did the judging panel weigh up the candidates ?
the six cities on the shortlist were visited again and given a chance to expand on their proposals .
finally , the bidding teams each faced a 90-minute grilling from the judging panel .
the committee then recommended to the department of culture that liverpool be named the eventual winner .
why was liverpool chosen ?
it was a close-run race but in the words of sir jeremy isaacs , chairman of the judges ' panel , what swung it for liverpool was a " greater sense ... that the whole city is involved in the bid and behind the bid " .
he added : " a little bit of extra zip from the fan club helps . "
liverpool 's cultural strengths include the largest collection of grade ii-listed buildings outside london , one of the best collections of european art outside london - and of course its status as the birthplace of the beatles .
the then culture secretary tessa jowell had also highlighted the competition 's role as " an engine for regeneration " .
