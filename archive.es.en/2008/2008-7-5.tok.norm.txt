scientists blame climate change and overfishing for the proliferation of the stinging nuisance . while mediterranean resort areas will be hardest hit by the jellyfish plague this summer , there will also be high concentrations in the baltic and north seas , according to scientists .
they warn that the dramatic increase in jellyfish is a sign that ocean ecosystems are out of whack .
" jellyfish are an excellent bellwether for the environment , " jacqueline goy of the oceanographic institute of paris told afp news agency .
" the more jellyfish , the stronger the signal that something has changed . "
jellyfish are a problem because their tentacles , used to paralyze prey , cause burning rashes when they come into contact with humans .
warm waters , overfishing blamed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stinging jellyfish take the fun out of swimming overfishing is one cause for the explosion in jellyfish populations , said ricardo aguilar , research director for the non-governmental organization oceana .
jellyfish predators such as tuna , sharks and turtles are disappearing .
the lack of predators also means a lack of competition for plankton and small fish , which make up the jellyfish diet .
the other cause for the population increase is global warming as higher water temperatures prolong their reproductive cycles .
" jellyfish have come to occupy the place of many other species , " aguilar told afp .
numbers staying high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marine biologists are worried about the increase it used to be that jellyfish would arrive inshore once every decade , stay for a few years , and then go in to a period of decline .
yet for the past eight years , jellyfish numbers have been steadily increasing with no signs of dropping off .
once the population explodes , it might be hard to control , marine biologists say .
this summer , marine biologists have already spotted swarms of jellyfish in the waters between corsica and the french mainland .
cannes , france plans to install booms and nets around its most popular beaches to keep the jellyfish at bay , according to the independent newspaper .
scientists have also started a jelly-watch off the italian and greek coasts to monitor the movements of the jellyfish , the newspaper reported .
fishing remains a highly politicized topic in europe .
the european union recently ordered a halt on blue fin tuna fishing in the mediterranean , saying that the entire 2008 quota had already been caught .
the french government is pushing for the fishery to reopen on an " emergency basis . "
marine biologists have warned that this could further exacerbate the jellyfish population . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she plans to set an example by bringing a major donation to the table . in a letter to her g8 colleagues , merkel warned her colleagues that extreme price hikes for food could lead to serious problems in the world 's poorest countries . the crisis could " threaten democratization , destabilize countries and lead to international security problems , " merkel wrote in the six-page paper , according to german newsmagazine der spiegel . the document is apparently based on the findings of a governmental working group the chancellor established at the end of april to analyze the current food shortage and come up with solutions . the group 's experts call for an increase in agricultural activity in developing countries , quick supply of seeds , fertilizer and agricultural machinery to selected regions as well as the immediate lifting of export restrictions . millions for short-term relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the countries marked in red are worst affected by the current crisis in her letter , merkel also reportedly announced that germany will give 477 million euros -lrb- $ 750 million -rrb- to supply poor countries with food .
the german working group has apparently found that the world 's 30 poorest countries will need $ 20 billion to import food . the german funds will be part of a larger package to secure food supply on a global level .
in an op-ed piece to be published in the sunday edition of der tagesspiegel newspaper , merkel writes that the package is meant to " bring about short-term relief for the current food shortage , but also offer a long-term strategy to increase worldwide agricultural production . " in her weekly video podcast message , merkel added that g8 leaders would talk about how industrialized countries can help african countries to strengthen their own agriculture . " we 'll also talk about what kind of standards we need in cultivating bio fuels in order to prevent competition with the production of food crops , " she said . during the g8 summit in japan , merkel is also expected to push for a un task force to deal with the food crisis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the race has been rocked by doping scandals for the past 10 years , and many believe that this time will be no different . in order to stem the widespread abuse of illegal drugs among cyclists , the international cycling union 's -lrb- uci -rrb- has started issuing biological passports , which chart the blood parameters of all professional riders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to blood tests , riders will also be forced to give urine , hair and nail samples in addition to that , the french national anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- will be taking random blood and urine samples , both before and during the race .
these samples will then be combined with the results of the uci tests . while experts have saluted the sport 's most recent efforts to ban drug users from cycling , some feel that more must be done . " the cyclists , and indeed other top athletes , are ultimately two steps ahead of the scientists and anti-doping controllers , " said jean-pierre de mondenard , a top anti-doping expert whose exhaustive " dictionary of doping " is a widely respected work in the field . what 's in your suitcase ? there are still around 20 undetectable products which can be used to enhance performance , which is why de mondenard feels that police should simply search participants ' luggage and other belongings to find any illegal drugs . while this method might sound invasive , it seems to be fruitful . in 2001 , during the giro d 'italia , 100 racers were tested and only two came up positive for performance-enhancing drugs .

since then , a seemingly endless succession of cyclists has been found to be users of various performance-enhancing drugs . the uci , based in switzerland , and the tour de france organizers , the amaury sports organization -lrb- aso -rrb- , have bumped heads over team entries and doping in the past few years . aso is taking no chances anymore and has acted tougher than ever before when inviting the teams for the 2008 edition .
they have refused to invite back several big names , including the 2007 winner , alberto contador of spain , who rode for team discovery . despite accusations , contador - who now rides for astana - himself was never actually convicted of doping .
it was other astana riders , in particular alexander vinokourov , who brought the team down .
also banned were american levi leipheimer , who came in third overall in 2007 , and andreas klöden of germany , a two-time tour runner-up . the benefits of extensive testing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour de france runs for three weeks and covers 3,559 kilometers despite all the hype surrounding testing during the race itself , there are actually several substances that can help cyclists along without actually showing up in their system come race day . ulrike spitz of the german national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- said that substances like epo and amphetamines can be used to enhance training even two weeks before the race , but can also disappear from the blood by race day . that 's why , according to spitz , extensive testing would show real benefits . " i think the health risk is very big for the athletes and if you do n't have this anti-doping rule , you will have frankensteins , " spitz said . riders fed up as for the actual athletes , most believe that the testing goes too far . " to go one step further , you would have to move into my house and live with me , " the 36-year old german rider jen voigt , a 10-year veteran of the tour , told a news conference on friday . voigt added that cycling professionals were requested to tell the uci of their whereabouts three months in advance each time they leave home for more than two hours .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.07.2008 eu considering making energy efficiency legally binding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with soaring energy prices , the eu is facing a tough challenge eu energy ministers are considering making energy efficiency legally binding across the union , french environment minister jean-louis borloo said on saturday , july 5 , in paris . " but this is very difficult to evaluate , and so we must work out many details before it can be applied , " borloo told dpa news agency .
the proposal was made on the third , and last , day of an informal meeting of eu environment and energy ministers in paris devoted to drafting a package of laws that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , increase the use of renewable energy sources and make energy use more efficient across europe .
france , which assumed the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , and brussels want to have the package approved by the european parliament by the end of the french term , on december 31 , or at the latest in march 2009 , just ahead of european parliament elections .
feran tarradelles espuny , the spokesman for european energy commissioner andris pibalgs , said that ministers were considering making energy efficiency goals as legally binding as budget deficit ceilings are .
global directive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers called the paris meeting " absolutely crucial " this could be a global directive constraining eu member states to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 or measures directed at specific energy-intensive sectors , he said .
german junior finance minister jochen homann said germany " would have no problem with -lrb- such a directive -rrb- on a european level . "
in addition , tarradelles espuny said , measures were being considered to set minimum efficiency standards for a wide range of equipment , such as light bulbs , electronic standby devices and street and office lighting equipment .
in one year , standby devices across europe consume as much energy as does the country of hungary , he said , and noted that a vote would be taken on monday on the standby device proposal .
huge savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using renewable sources of energy may become a duty for all eu states on friday , pibalgs said a reduction of 20 percent in the eu 's energy consumption would represent annual savings of 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , at an oil price of 60 dollars per barrel .
and it would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 780 million tons .
energy efficiency " is our best tool to mitigate the effect of increasing oil prices on citizens ' welfare , improve the eu 's competitiveness and achieve our goals for security of supply , " pibalgs said .
in addition , borloo said eu members were strongly in favour of the goal of having renewable energy sources represent 20 percent of all energy use by 2020 , with a minimum of 10 percent in transport , whether it be biofuels or electric automobiles .
eu environment ministers were also looking to increase the share of carbon dioxide savings in the production of some biofuels by 35 percent in the near term , and by 50 percent by the year 2015 , borloo said .
a double game with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is highly dependant on russian gas earlier on saturday , the former head of the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- , claude mandil , told participants at the meeting that europe was playing an ineffectual double game with russia and must cease if it wants to better diversify its energy sources . " on the one hand we are horrified that there will be a shortage of russian gas and , on the other hand , we are verbally aggressive with russia , " mandil said .
" let 's be flexible , " he went on .
" let 's stop provoking russian sovereignty in the belief that we can dictate russian behaviour on energy . "
borloo closed the three-day meeting by saying it had been " indispensable " and " absolutely crucial . "
" big objective difficulties remain to be overcome , but the desire to succeed is also big , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

energy efficiency " is our best tool to mitigate the effect of increasing oil prices on citizens ' welfare , improve the eu 's competitiveness and achieve our goals for security of supply , " pibalgs said .
in addition , borloo said eu members were strongly in favour of the goal of having renewable energy sources represent 20 percent of all energy use by 2020 , with a minimum of 10 percent in transport , whether it be biofuels or electric automobiles .
eu environment ministers were also looking to increase the share of carbon dioxide savings in the production of some biofuels by 35 percent in the near term , and by 50 percent by the year 2015 , borloo said .

the race has been rocked by doping scandals for the past 10 years , and many believe that this time will be no different . in order to stem the widespread abuse of illegal drugs among cyclists , the international cycling union 's -lrb- uci -rrb- has started issuing biological passports , which chart the blood parameters of all professional riders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to blood tests , riders will also be forced to give urine , hair and nail samples in addition to that , the french national anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- will be taking random blood and urine samples , both before and during the race .
these samples will then be combined with the results of the uci tests . while experts have saluted the sport 's most recent efforts to ban drug users from cycling , some feel that more must be done . " the cyclists , and indeed other top athletes , are ultimately two steps ahead of the scientists and anti-doping controllers , " said jean-pierre de mondenard , a top anti-doping expert whose exhaustive " dictionary of doping " is a widely respected work in the field . what 's in your suitcase ? there are still around 20 undetectable products which can be used to enhance performance , which is why de mondenard feels that police should simply search participants ' luggage and other belongings to find any illegal drugs . while this method might sound invasive , it seems to be fruitful . in 2001 , during the giro d 'italia , 100 racers were tested and only two came up positive for performance-enhancing drugs .
later , when the italian police searched the luggage of the racers , they found 52 of the cyclists were in possession of illegal substances . 2007 winner denied entry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2007 tour winner , alberto contador , has been banned from the race despite never being convicted of doping it was in 1998 - during the infamous fatima doping scandal - that the banned hormone epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- was found to be in widespread use .
since then , a seemingly endless succession of cyclists has been found to be users of various performance-enhancing drugs . the uci , based in switzerland , and the tour de france organizers , the amaury sports organization -lrb- aso -rrb- , have bumped heads over team entries and doping in the past few years . aso is taking no chances anymore and has acted tougher than ever before when inviting the teams for the 2008 edition .
they have refused to invite back several big names , including the 2007 winner , alberto contador of spain , who rode for team discovery . despite accusations , contador - who now rides for astana - himself was never actually convicted of doping .
it was other astana riders , in particular alexander vinokourov , who brought the team down .
also banned were american levi leipheimer , who came in third overall in 2007 , and andreas klöden of germany , a two-time tour runner-up . the benefits of extensive testing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour de france runs for three weeks and covers 3,559 kilometers despite all the hype surrounding testing during the race itself , there are actually several substances that can help cyclists along without actually showing up in their system come race day . ulrike spitz of the german national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- said that substances like epo and amphetamines can be used to enhance training even two weeks before the race , but can also disappear from the blood by race day . that 's why , according to spitz , extensive testing would show real benefits . " i think the health risk is very big for the athletes and if you do n't have this anti-doping rule , you will have frankensteins , " spitz said . riders fed up as for the actual athletes , most believe that the testing goes too far . " to go one step further , you would have to move into my house and live with me , " the 36-year old german rider jen voigt , a 10-year veteran of the tour , told a news conference on friday . voigt added that cycling professionals were requested to tell the uci of their whereabouts three months in advance each time they leave home for more than two hours .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.07.2008 eu considering making energy efficiency legally binding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with soaring energy prices , the eu is facing a tough challenge eu energy ministers are considering making energy efficiency legally binding across the union , french environment minister jean-louis borloo said on saturday , july 5 , in paris . " but this is very difficult to evaluate , and so we must work out many details before it can be applied , " borloo told dpa news agency .
the proposal was made on the third , and last , day of an informal meeting of eu environment and energy ministers in paris devoted to drafting a package of laws that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , increase the use of renewable energy sources and make energy use more efficient across europe .
france , which assumed the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , and brussels want to have the package approved by the european parliament by the end of the french term , on december 31 , or at the latest in march 2009 , just ahead of european parliament elections .
feran tarradelles espuny , the spokesman for european energy commissioner andris pibalgs , said that ministers were considering making energy efficiency goals as legally binding as budget deficit ceilings are .
global directive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers called the paris meeting " absolutely crucial " this could be a global directive constraining eu member states to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 or measures directed at specific energy-intensive sectors , he said .
german junior finance minister jochen homann said germany " would have no problem with -lrb- such a directive -rrb- on a european level . "
in addition , tarradelles espuny said , measures were being considered to set minimum efficiency standards for a wide range of equipment , such as light bulbs , electronic standby devices and street and office lighting equipment .
in one year , standby devices across europe consume as much energy as does the country of hungary , he said , and noted that a vote would be taken on monday on the standby device proposal .
huge savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using renewable sources of energy may become a duty for all eu states on friday , pibalgs said a reduction of 20 percent in the eu 's energy consumption would represent annual savings of 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , at an oil price of 60 dollars per barrel .
and it would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 780 million tons .
energy efficiency " is our best tool to mitigate the effect of increasing oil prices on citizens ' welfare , improve the eu 's competitiveness and achieve our goals for security of supply , " pibalgs said .
in addition , borloo said eu members were strongly in favour of the goal of having renewable energy sources represent 20 percent of all energy use by 2020 , with a minimum of 10 percent in transport , whether it be biofuels or electric automobiles .
eu environment ministers were also looking to increase the share of carbon dioxide savings in the production of some biofuels by 35 percent in the near term , and by 50 percent by the year 2015 , borloo said .
a double game with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is highly dependant on russian gas earlier on saturday , the former head of the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- , claude mandil , told participants at the meeting that europe was playing an ineffectual double game with russia and must cease if it wants to better diversify its energy sources . " on the one hand we are horrified that there will be a shortage of russian gas and , on the other hand , we are verbally aggressive with russia , " mandil said .
" let 's be flexible , " he went on .
" let 's stop provoking russian sovereignty in the belief that we can dictate russian behaviour on energy . "
borloo closed the three-day meeting by saying it had been " indispensable " and " absolutely crucial . "
" big objective difficulties remain to be overcome , but the desire to succeed is also big , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 05.07.2008 climate change brings jellyfish plague to europe 's beaches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some jellyfish have a nasty sting jellyfish are taking over europe 's favorite swimming spots in increasing numbers .
scientists blame climate change and overfishing for the proliferation of the stinging nuisance . while mediterranean resort areas will be hardest hit by the jellyfish plague this summer , there will also be high concentrations in the baltic and north seas , according to scientists .
they warn that the dramatic increase in jellyfish is a sign that ocean ecosystems are out of whack .
" jellyfish are an excellent bellwether for the environment , " jacqueline goy of the oceanographic institute of paris told afp news agency .
" the more jellyfish , the stronger the signal that something has changed . "
jellyfish are a problem because their tentacles , used to paralyze prey , cause burning rashes when they come into contact with humans .
warm waters , overfishing blamed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stinging jellyfish take the fun out of swimming overfishing is one cause for the explosion in jellyfish populations , said ricardo aguilar , research director for the non-governmental organization oceana .
jellyfish predators such as tuna , sharks and turtles are disappearing .
the lack of predators also means a lack of competition for plankton and small fish , which make up the jellyfish diet .
the other cause for the population increase is global warming as higher water temperatures prolong their reproductive cycles .
" jellyfish have come to occupy the place of many other species , " aguilar told afp .
numbers staying high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marine biologists are worried about the increase it used to be that jellyfish would arrive inshore once every decade , stay for a few years , and then go in to a period of decline .
yet for the past eight years , jellyfish numbers have been steadily increasing with no signs of dropping off .

" in her weekly video podcast message , merkel added that g8 leaders would talk about how industrialized countries can help african countries to strengthen their own agriculture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.07.2008 eu considering making energy efficiency legally binding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with soaring energy prices , the eu is facing a tough challenge eu energy ministers are considering making energy efficiency legally binding across the union , french environment minister jean-louis borloo said on saturday , july 5 , in paris . " but this is very difficult to evaluate , and so we must work out many details before it can be applied , " borloo told dpa news agency .
the proposal was made on the third , and last , day of an informal meeting of eu environment and energy ministers in paris devoted to drafting a package of laws that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , increase the use of renewable energy sources and make energy use more efficient across europe .
france , which assumed the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , and brussels want to have the package approved by the european parliament by the end of the french term , on december 31 , or at the latest in march 2009 , just ahead of european parliament elections .
feran tarradelles espuny , the spokesman for european energy commissioner andris pibalgs , said that ministers were considering making energy efficiency goals as legally binding as budget deficit ceilings are .
global directive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers called the paris meeting " absolutely crucial " this could be a global directive constraining eu member states to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 or measures directed at specific energy-intensive sectors , he said .
german junior finance minister jochen homann said germany " would have no problem with -lrb- such a directive -rrb- on a european level . "
in addition , tarradelles espuny said , measures were being considered to set minimum efficiency standards for a wide range of equipment , such as light bulbs , electronic standby devices and street and office lighting equipment .
in one year , standby devices across europe consume as much energy as does the country of hungary , he said , and noted that a vote would be taken on monday on the standby device proposal .
huge savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using renewable sources of energy may become a duty for all eu states on friday , pibalgs said a reduction of 20 percent in the eu 's energy consumption would represent annual savings of 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , at an oil price of 60 dollars per barrel .
and it would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 780 million tons .
energy efficiency " is our best tool to mitigate the effect of increasing oil prices on citizens ' welfare , improve the eu 's competitiveness and achieve our goals for security of supply , " pibalgs said .
in addition , borloo said eu members were strongly in favour of the goal of having renewable energy sources represent 20 percent of all energy use by 2020 , with a minimum of 10 percent in transport , whether it be biofuels or electric automobiles .
eu environment ministers were also looking to increase the share of carbon dioxide savings in the production of some biofuels by 35 percent in the near term , and by 50 percent by the year 2015 , borloo said .
a double game with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is highly dependant on russian gas earlier on saturday , the former head of the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- , claude mandil , told participants at the meeting that europe was playing an ineffectual double game with russia and must cease if it wants to better diversify its energy sources . " on the one hand we are horrified that there will be a shortage of russian gas and , on the other hand , we are verbally aggressive with russia , " mandil said .
" let 's be flexible , " he went on .
" let 's stop provoking russian sovereignty in the belief that we can dictate russian behaviour on energy . "
borloo closed the three-day meeting by saying it had been " indispensable " and " absolutely crucial . "
" big objective difficulties remain to be overcome , but the desire to succeed is also big , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but this is very difficult to evaluate , and so we must work out many details before it can be applied , " borloo told dpa news agency .
the proposal was made on the third , and last , day of an informal meeting of eu environment and energy ministers in paris devoted to drafting a package of laws that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , increase the use of renewable energy sources and make energy use more efficient across europe .
france , which assumed the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , and brussels want to have the package approved by the european parliament by the end of the french term , on december 31 , or at the latest in march 2009 , just ahead of european parliament elections .
feran tarradelles espuny , the spokesman for european energy commissioner andris pibalgs , said that ministers were considering making energy efficiency goals as legally binding as budget deficit ceilings are .
global directive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers called the paris meeting " absolutely crucial " this could be a global directive constraining eu member states to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 or measures directed at specific energy-intensive sectors , he said .
german junior finance minister jochen homann said germany " would have no problem with -lrb- such a directive -rrb- on a european level . "
in addition , tarradelles espuny said , measures were being considered to set minimum efficiency standards for a wide range of equipment , such as light bulbs , electronic standby devices and street and office lighting equipment .
in one year , standby devices across europe consume as much energy as does the country of hungary , he said , and noted that a vote would be taken on monday on the standby device proposal .
huge savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using renewable sources of energy may become a duty for all eu states on friday , pibalgs said a reduction of 20 percent in the eu 's energy consumption would represent annual savings of 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , at an oil price of 60 dollars per barrel .
and it would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 780 million tons .
energy efficiency " is our best tool to mitigate the effect of increasing oil prices on citizens ' welfare , improve the eu 's competitiveness and achieve our goals for security of supply , " pibalgs said .
in addition , borloo said eu members were strongly in favour of the goal of having renewable energy sources represent 20 percent of all energy use by 2020 , with a minimum of 10 percent in transport , whether it be biofuels or electric automobiles .
eu environment ministers were also looking to increase the share of carbon dioxide savings in the production of some biofuels by 35 percent in the near term , and by 50 percent by the year 2015 , borloo said .

" on the one hand we are horrified that there will be a shortage of russian gas and , on the other hand , we are verbally aggressive with russia , " mandil said .
" let 's be flexible , " he went on .
" let 's stop provoking russian sovereignty in the belief that we can dictate russian behaviour on energy . "

she plans to set an example by bringing a major donation to the table . in a letter to her g8 colleagues , merkel warned her colleagues that extreme price hikes for food could lead to serious problems in the world 's poorest countries . the crisis could " threaten democratization , destabilize countries and lead to international security problems , " merkel wrote in the six-page paper , according to german newsmagazine der spiegel . the document is apparently based on the findings of a governmental working group the chancellor established at the end of april to analyze the current food shortage and come up with solutions . the group 's experts call for an increase in agricultural activity in developing countries , quick supply of seeds , fertilizer and agricultural machinery to selected regions as well as the immediate lifting of export restrictions . millions for short-term relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the countries marked in red are worst affected by the current crisis in her letter , merkel also reportedly announced that germany will give 477 million euros -lrb- $ 750 million -rrb- to supply poor countries with food .
the german working group has apparently found that the world 's 30 poorest countries will need $ 20 billion to import food . the german funds will be part of a larger package to secure food supply on a global level .
in an op-ed piece to be published in the sunday edition of der tagesspiegel newspaper , merkel writes that the package is meant to " bring about short-term relief for the current food shortage , but also offer a long-term strategy to increase worldwide agricultural production . " in her weekly video podcast message , merkel added that g8 leaders would talk about how industrialized countries can help african countries to strengthen their own agriculture . " we 'll also talk about what kind of standards we need in cultivating bio fuels in order to prevent competition with the production of food crops , " she said . during the g8 summit in japan , merkel is also expected to push for a un task force to deal with the food crisis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.07.2008 eu considering making energy efficiency legally binding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with soaring energy prices , the eu is facing a tough challenge eu energy ministers are considering making energy efficiency legally binding across the union , french environment minister jean-louis borloo said on saturday , july 5 , in paris . " but this is very difficult to evaluate , and so we must work out many details before it can be applied , " borloo told dpa news agency .
the proposal was made on the third , and last , day of an informal meeting of eu environment and energy ministers in paris devoted to drafting a package of laws that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , increase the use of renewable energy sources and make energy use more efficient across europe .
france , which assumed the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , and brussels want to have the package approved by the european parliament by the end of the french term , on december 31 , or at the latest in march 2009 , just ahead of european parliament elections .
feran tarradelles espuny , the spokesman for european energy commissioner andris pibalgs , said that ministers were considering making energy efficiency goals as legally binding as budget deficit ceilings are .
global directive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers called the paris meeting " absolutely crucial " this could be a global directive constraining eu member states to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 or measures directed at specific energy-intensive sectors , he said .
german junior finance minister jochen homann said germany " would have no problem with -lrb- such a directive -rrb- on a european level . "
in addition , tarradelles espuny said , measures were being considered to set minimum efficiency standards for a wide range of equipment , such as light bulbs , electronic standby devices and street and office lighting equipment .
in one year , standby devices across europe consume as much energy as does the country of hungary , he said , and noted that a vote would be taken on monday on the standby device proposal .
huge savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using renewable sources of energy may become a duty for all eu states on friday , pibalgs said a reduction of 20 percent in the eu 's energy consumption would represent annual savings of 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , at an oil price of 60 dollars per barrel .
and it would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 780 million tons .
energy efficiency " is our best tool to mitigate the effect of increasing oil prices on citizens ' welfare , improve the eu 's competitiveness and achieve our goals for security of supply , " pibalgs said .
in addition , borloo said eu members were strongly in favour of the goal of having renewable energy sources represent 20 percent of all energy use by 2020 , with a minimum of 10 percent in transport , whether it be biofuels or electric automobiles .
eu environment ministers were also looking to increase the share of carbon dioxide savings in the production of some biofuels by 35 percent in the near term , and by 50 percent by the year 2015 , borloo said .

she plans to set an example by bringing a major donation to the table . in a letter to her g8 colleagues , merkel warned her colleagues that extreme price hikes for food could lead to serious problems in the world 's poorest countries . the crisis could " threaten democratization , destabilize countries and lead to international security problems , " merkel wrote in the six-page paper , according to german newsmagazine der spiegel . the document is apparently based on the findings of a governmental working group the chancellor established at the end of april to analyze the current food shortage and come up with solutions . the group 's experts call for an increase in agricultural activity in developing countries , quick supply of seeds , fertilizer and agricultural machinery to selected regions as well as the immediate lifting of export restrictions . millions for short-term relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the countries marked in red are worst affected by the current crisis in her letter , merkel also reportedly announced that germany will give 477 million euros -lrb- $ 750 million -rrb- to supply poor countries with food .
the german working group has apparently found that the world 's 30 poorest countries will need $ 20 billion to import food . the german funds will be part of a larger package to secure food supply on a global level .
in an op-ed piece to be published in the sunday edition of der tagesspiegel newspaper , merkel writes that the package is meant to " bring about short-term relief for the current food shortage , but also offer a long-term strategy to increase worldwide agricultural production . " in her weekly video podcast message , merkel added that g8 leaders would talk about how industrialized countries can help african countries to strengthen their own agriculture . " we 'll also talk about what kind of standards we need in cultivating bio fuels in order to prevent competition with the production of food crops , " she said . during the g8 summit in japan , merkel is also expected to push for a un task force to deal with the food crisis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.07.2008 eu considering making energy efficiency legally binding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with soaring energy prices , the eu is facing a tough challenge eu energy ministers are considering making energy efficiency legally binding across the union , french environment minister jean-louis borloo said on saturday , july 5 , in paris . " but this is very difficult to evaluate , and so we must work out many details before it can be applied , " borloo told dpa news agency .
the proposal was made on the third , and last , day of an informal meeting of eu environment and energy ministers in paris devoted to drafting a package of laws that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , increase the use of renewable energy sources and make energy use more efficient across europe .
france , which assumed the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , and brussels want to have the package approved by the european parliament by the end of the french term , on december 31 , or at the latest in march 2009 , just ahead of european parliament elections .
feran tarradelles espuny , the spokesman for european energy commissioner andris pibalgs , said that ministers were considering making energy efficiency goals as legally binding as budget deficit ceilings are .
global directive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers called the paris meeting " absolutely crucial " this could be a global directive constraining eu member states to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 or measures directed at specific energy-intensive sectors , he said .
german junior finance minister jochen homann said germany " would have no problem with -lrb- such a directive -rrb- on a european level . "
in addition , tarradelles espuny said , measures were being considered to set minimum efficiency standards for a wide range of equipment , such as light bulbs , electronic standby devices and street and office lighting equipment .
in one year , standby devices across europe consume as much energy as does the country of hungary , he said , and noted that a vote would be taken on monday on the standby device proposal .
huge savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using renewable sources of energy may become a duty for all eu states on friday , pibalgs said a reduction of 20 percent in the eu 's energy consumption would represent annual savings of 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , at an oil price of 60 dollars per barrel .
and it would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 780 million tons .
energy efficiency " is our best tool to mitigate the effect of increasing oil prices on citizens ' welfare , improve the eu 's competitiveness and achieve our goals for security of supply , " pibalgs said .
in addition , borloo said eu members were strongly in favour of the goal of having renewable energy sources represent 20 percent of all energy use by 2020 , with a minimum of 10 percent in transport , whether it be biofuels or electric automobiles .
eu environment ministers were also looking to increase the share of carbon dioxide savings in the production of some biofuels by 35 percent in the near term , and by 50 percent by the year 2015 , borloo said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.07.2008 eu considering making energy efficiency legally binding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with soaring energy prices , the eu is facing a tough challenge eu energy ministers are considering making energy efficiency legally binding across the union , french environment minister jean-louis borloo said on saturday , july 5 , in paris . " but this is very difficult to evaluate , and so we must work out many details before it can be applied , " borloo told dpa news agency .
the proposal was made on the third , and last , day of an informal meeting of eu environment and energy ministers in paris devoted to drafting a package of laws that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , increase the use of renewable energy sources and make energy use more efficient across europe .
france , which assumed the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , and brussels want to have the package approved by the european parliament by the end of the french term , on december 31 , or at the latest in march 2009 , just ahead of european parliament elections .
feran tarradelles espuny , the spokesman for european energy commissioner andris pibalgs , said that ministers were considering making energy efficiency goals as legally binding as budget deficit ceilings are .
global directive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers called the paris meeting " absolutely crucial " this could be a global directive constraining eu member states to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 or measures directed at specific energy-intensive sectors , he said .
german junior finance minister jochen homann said germany " would have no problem with -lrb- such a directive -rrb- on a european level . "
in addition , tarradelles espuny said , measures were being considered to set minimum efficiency standards for a wide range of equipment , such as light bulbs , electronic standby devices and street and office lighting equipment .
in one year , standby devices across europe consume as much energy as does the country of hungary , he said , and noted that a vote would be taken on monday on the standby device proposal .
huge savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using renewable sources of energy may become a duty for all eu states on friday , pibalgs said a reduction of 20 percent in the eu 's energy consumption would represent annual savings of 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , at an oil price of 60 dollars per barrel .
and it would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 780 million tons .
energy efficiency " is our best tool to mitigate the effect of increasing oil prices on citizens ' welfare , improve the eu 's competitiveness and achieve our goals for security of supply , " pibalgs said .
in addition , borloo said eu members were strongly in favour of the goal of having renewable energy sources represent 20 percent of all energy use by 2020 , with a minimum of 10 percent in transport , whether it be biofuels or electric automobiles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.07.2008 eu considering making energy efficiency legally binding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with soaring energy prices , the eu is facing a tough challenge eu energy ministers are considering making energy efficiency legally binding across the union , french environment minister jean-louis borloo said on saturday , july 5 , in paris . " but this is very difficult to evaluate , and so we must work out many details before it can be applied , " borloo told dpa news agency .
the proposal was made on the third , and last , day of an informal meeting of eu environment and energy ministers in paris devoted to drafting a package of laws that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , increase the use of renewable energy sources and make energy use more efficient across europe .
france , which assumed the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , and brussels want to have the package approved by the european parliament by the end of the french term , on december 31 , or at the latest in march 2009 , just ahead of european parliament elections .
feran tarradelles espuny , the spokesman for european energy commissioner andris pibalgs , said that ministers were considering making energy efficiency goals as legally binding as budget deficit ceilings are .
global directive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers called the paris meeting " absolutely crucial " this could be a global directive constraining eu member states to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 or measures directed at specific energy-intensive sectors , he said .
german junior finance minister jochen homann said germany " would have no problem with -lrb- such a directive -rrb- on a european level . "
in addition , tarradelles espuny said , measures were being considered to set minimum efficiency standards for a wide range of equipment , such as light bulbs , electronic standby devices and street and office lighting equipment .
in one year , standby devices across europe consume as much energy as does the country of hungary , he said , and noted that a vote would be taken on monday on the standby device proposal .
huge savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using renewable sources of energy may become a duty for all eu states on friday , pibalgs said a reduction of 20 percent in the eu 's energy consumption would represent annual savings of 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , at an oil price of 60 dollars per barrel .
and it would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 780 million tons .
energy efficiency " is our best tool to mitigate the effect of increasing oil prices on citizens ' welfare , improve the eu 's competitiveness and achieve our goals for security of supply , " pibalgs said .
in addition , borloo said eu members were strongly in favour of the goal of having renewable energy sources represent 20 percent of all energy use by 2020 , with a minimum of 10 percent in transport , whether it be biofuels or electric automobiles .
eu environment ministers were also looking to increase the share of carbon dioxide savings in the production of some biofuels by 35 percent in the near term , and by 50 percent by the year 2015 , borloo said .
a double game with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is highly dependant on russian gas earlier on saturday , the former head of the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- , claude mandil , told participants at the meeting that europe was playing an ineffectual double game with russia and must cease if it wants to better diversify its energy sources . " on the one hand we are horrified that there will be a shortage of russian gas and , on the other hand , we are verbally aggressive with russia , " mandil said .
" let 's be flexible , " he went on .
" let 's stop provoking russian sovereignty in the belief that we can dictate russian behaviour on energy . "
borloo closed the three-day meeting by saying it had been " indispensable " and " absolutely crucial . "
" big objective difficulties remain to be overcome , but the desire to succeed is also big , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu , russia hold first talks on new partnership pact the european union and russia said on friday they had agreed on what areas should be covered by a wide-ranging partnership treaty without setting a deadline for it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.07.2008 eu considering making energy efficiency legally binding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with soaring energy prices , the eu is facing a tough challenge eu energy ministers are considering making energy efficiency legally binding across the union , french environment minister jean-louis borloo said on saturday , july 5 , in paris . " but this is very difficult to evaluate , and so we must work out many details before it can be applied , " borloo told dpa news agency .
the proposal was made on the third , and last , day of an informal meeting of eu environment and energy ministers in paris devoted to drafting a package of laws that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , increase the use of renewable energy sources and make energy use more efficient across europe .
france , which assumed the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , and brussels want to have the package approved by the european parliament by the end of the french term , on december 31 , or at the latest in march 2009 , just ahead of european parliament elections .
feran tarradelles espuny , the spokesman for european energy commissioner andris pibalgs , said that ministers were considering making energy efficiency goals as legally binding as budget deficit ceilings are .
global directive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers called the paris meeting " absolutely crucial " this could be a global directive constraining eu member states to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 or measures directed at specific energy-intensive sectors , he said .
german junior finance minister jochen homann said germany " would have no problem with -lrb- such a directive -rrb- on a european level . "
in addition , tarradelles espuny said , measures were being considered to set minimum efficiency standards for a wide range of equipment , such as light bulbs , electronic standby devices and street and office lighting equipment .
in one year , standby devices across europe consume as much energy as does the country of hungary , he said , and noted that a vote would be taken on monday on the standby device proposal .
huge savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using renewable sources of energy may become a duty for all eu states on friday , pibalgs said a reduction of 20 percent in the eu 's energy consumption would represent annual savings of 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , at an oil price of 60 dollars per barrel .
and it would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 780 million tons .
energy efficiency " is our best tool to mitigate the effect of increasing oil prices on citizens ' welfare , improve the eu 's competitiveness and achieve our goals for security of supply , " pibalgs said .
in addition , borloo said eu members were strongly in favour of the goal of having renewable energy sources represent 20 percent of all energy use by 2020 , with a minimum of 10 percent in transport , whether it be biofuels or electric automobiles .
eu environment ministers were also looking to increase the share of carbon dioxide savings in the production of some biofuels by 35 percent in the near term , and by 50 percent by the year 2015 , borloo said .
a double game with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is highly dependant on russian gas earlier on saturday , the former head of the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- , claude mandil , told participants at the meeting that europe was playing an ineffectual double game with russia and must cease if it wants to better diversify its energy sources . " on the one hand we are horrified that there will be a shortage of russian gas and , on the other hand , we are verbally aggressive with russia , " mandil said .
" let 's be flexible , " he went on .
" let 's stop provoking russian sovereignty in the belief that we can dictate russian behaviour on energy . "
borloo closed the three-day meeting by saying it had been " indispensable " and " absolutely crucial . "

she plans to set an example by bringing a major donation to the table . in a letter to her g8 colleagues , merkel warned her colleagues that extreme price hikes for food could lead to serious problems in the world 's poorest countries . the crisis could " threaten democratization , destabilize countries and lead to international security problems , " merkel wrote in the six-page paper , according to german newsmagazine der spiegel . the document is apparently based on the findings of a governmental working group the chancellor established at the end of april to analyze the current food shortage and come up with solutions . the group 's experts call for an increase in agricultural activity in developing countries , quick supply of seeds , fertilizer and agricultural machinery to selected regions as well as the immediate lifting of export restrictions . millions for short-term relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the countries marked in red are worst affected by the current crisis in her letter , merkel also reportedly announced that germany will give 477 million euros -lrb- $ 750 million -rrb- to supply poor countries with food .
the german working group has apparently found that the world 's 30 poorest countries will need $ 20 billion to import food . the german funds will be part of a larger package to secure food supply on a global level .
in an op-ed piece to be published in the sunday edition of der tagesspiegel newspaper , merkel writes that the package is meant to " bring about short-term relief for the current food shortage , but also offer a long-term strategy to increase worldwide agricultural production . " in her weekly video podcast message , merkel added that g8 leaders would talk about how industrialized countries can help african countries to strengthen their own agriculture . " we 'll also talk about what kind of standards we need in cultivating bio fuels in order to prevent competition with the production of food crops , " she said . during the g8 summit in japan , merkel is also expected to push for a un task force to deal with the food crisis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

scientists blame climate change and overfishing for the proliferation of the stinging nuisance . while mediterranean resort areas will be hardest hit by the jellyfish plague this summer , there will also be high concentrations in the baltic and north seas , according to scientists .
they warn that the dramatic increase in jellyfish is a sign that ocean ecosystems are out of whack .
" jellyfish are an excellent bellwether for the environment , " jacqueline goy of the oceanographic institute of paris told afp news agency .
" the more jellyfish , the stronger the signal that something has changed . "
jellyfish are a problem because their tentacles , used to paralyze prey , cause burning rashes when they come into contact with humans .
warm waters , overfishing blamed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stinging jellyfish take the fun out of swimming overfishing is one cause for the explosion in jellyfish populations , said ricardo aguilar , research director for the non-governmental organization oceana .
jellyfish predators such as tuna , sharks and turtles are disappearing .
the lack of predators also means a lack of competition for plankton and small fish , which make up the jellyfish diet .
the other cause for the population increase is global warming as higher water temperatures prolong their reproductive cycles .
" jellyfish have come to occupy the place of many other species , " aguilar told afp .
numbers staying high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marine biologists are worried about the increase it used to be that jellyfish would arrive inshore once every decade , stay for a few years , and then go in to a period of decline .
yet for the past eight years , jellyfish numbers have been steadily increasing with no signs of dropping off .
once the population explodes , it might be hard to control , marine biologists say .
this summer , marine biologists have already spotted swarms of jellyfish in the waters between corsica and the french mainland .
cannes , france plans to install booms and nets around its most popular beaches to keep the jellyfish at bay , according to the independent newspaper .
scientists have also started a jelly-watch off the italian and greek coasts to monitor the movements of the jellyfish , the newspaper reported .
fishing remains a highly politicized topic in europe .
the european union recently ordered a halt on blue fin tuna fishing in the mediterranean , saying that the entire 2008 quota had already been caught .
the french government is pushing for the fishery to reopen on an " emergency basis . "

the race has been rocked by doping scandals for the past 10 years , and many believe that this time will be no different . in order to stem the widespread abuse of illegal drugs among cyclists , the international cycling union 's -lrb- uci -rrb- has started issuing biological passports , which chart the blood parameters of all professional riders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to blood tests , riders will also be forced to give urine , hair and nail samples in addition to that , the french national anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- will be taking random blood and urine samples , both before and during the race .
these samples will then be combined with the results of the uci tests . while experts have saluted the sport 's most recent efforts to ban drug users from cycling , some feel that more must be done . " the cyclists , and indeed other top athletes , are ultimately two steps ahead of the scientists and anti-doping controllers , " said jean-pierre de mondenard , a top anti-doping expert whose exhaustive " dictionary of doping " is a widely respected work in the field . what 's in your suitcase ? there are still around 20 undetectable products which can be used to enhance performance , which is why de mondenard feels that police should simply search participants ' luggage and other belongings to find any illegal drugs . while this method might sound invasive , it seems to be fruitful . in 2001 , during the giro d 'italia , 100 racers were tested and only two came up positive for performance-enhancing drugs .

they have refused to invite back several big names , including the 2007 winner , alberto contador of spain , who rode for team discovery . despite accusations , contador - who now rides for astana - himself was never actually convicted of doping .
it was other astana riders , in particular alexander vinokourov , who brought the team down .

scientists blame climate change and overfishing for the proliferation of the stinging nuisance . while mediterranean resort areas will be hardest hit by the jellyfish plague this summer , there will also be high concentrations in the baltic and north seas , according to scientists .
they warn that the dramatic increase in jellyfish is a sign that ocean ecosystems are out of whack .
" jellyfish are an excellent bellwether for the environment , " jacqueline goy of the oceanographic institute of paris told afp news agency .
" the more jellyfish , the stronger the signal that something has changed . "
jellyfish are a problem because their tentacles , used to paralyze prey , cause burning rashes when they come into contact with humans .
warm waters , overfishing blamed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stinging jellyfish take the fun out of swimming overfishing is one cause for the explosion in jellyfish populations , said ricardo aguilar , research director for the non-governmental organization oceana .
jellyfish predators such as tuna , sharks and turtles are disappearing .
the lack of predators also means a lack of competition for plankton and small fish , which make up the jellyfish diet .
the other cause for the population increase is global warming as higher water temperatures prolong their reproductive cycles .
" jellyfish have come to occupy the place of many other species , " aguilar told afp .
numbers staying high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marine biologists are worried about the increase it used to be that jellyfish would arrive inshore once every decade , stay for a few years , and then go in to a period of decline .
yet for the past eight years , jellyfish numbers have been steadily increasing with no signs of dropping off .
once the population explodes , it might be hard to control , marine biologists say .
this summer , marine biologists have already spotted swarms of jellyfish in the waters between corsica and the french mainland .
cannes , france plans to install booms and nets around its most popular beaches to keep the jellyfish at bay , according to the independent newspaper .
scientists have also started a jelly-watch off the italian and greek coasts to monitor the movements of the jellyfish , the newspaper reported .
fishing remains a highly politicized topic in europe .
the european union recently ordered a halt on blue fin tuna fishing in the mediterranean , saying that the entire 2008 quota had already been caught .
the french government is pushing for the fishery to reopen on an " emergency basis . "
marine biologists have warned that this could further exacerbate the jellyfish population . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the race has been rocked by doping scandals for the past 10 years , and many believe that this time will be no different . in order to stem the widespread abuse of illegal drugs among cyclists , the international cycling union 's -lrb- uci -rrb- has started issuing biological passports , which chart the blood parameters of all professional riders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to blood tests , riders will also be forced to give urine , hair and nail samples in addition to that , the french national anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- will be taking random blood and urine samples , both before and during the race .
these samples will then be combined with the results of the uci tests . while experts have saluted the sport 's most recent efforts to ban drug users from cycling , some feel that more must be done . " the cyclists , and indeed other top athletes , are ultimately two steps ahead of the scientists and anti-doping controllers , " said jean-pierre de mondenard , a top anti-doping expert whose exhaustive " dictionary of doping " is a widely respected work in the field . what 's in your suitcase ? there are still around 20 undetectable products which can be used to enhance performance , which is why de mondenard feels that police should simply search participants ' luggage and other belongings to find any illegal drugs . while this method might sound invasive , it seems to be fruitful . in 2001 , during the giro d 'italia , 100 racers were tested and only two came up positive for performance-enhancing drugs .

since then , a seemingly endless succession of cyclists has been found to be users of various performance-enhancing drugs . the uci , based in switzerland , and the tour de france organizers , the amaury sports organization -lrb- aso -rrb- , have bumped heads over team entries and doping in the past few years . aso is taking no chances anymore and has acted tougher than ever before when inviting the teams for the 2008 edition .
they have refused to invite back several big names , including the 2007 winner , alberto contador of spain , who rode for team discovery . despite accusations , contador - who now rides for astana - himself was never actually convicted of doping .
it was other astana riders , in particular alexander vinokourov , who brought the team down .
also banned were american levi leipheimer , who came in third overall in 2007 , and andreas klöden of germany , a two-time tour runner-up . the benefits of extensive testing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour de france runs for three weeks and covers 3,559 kilometers despite all the hype surrounding testing during the race itself , there are actually several substances that can help cyclists along without actually showing up in their system come race day . ulrike spitz of the german national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- said that substances like epo and amphetamines can be used to enhance training even two weeks before the race , but can also disappear from the blood by race day . that 's why , according to spitz , extensive testing would show real benefits . " i think the health risk is very big for the athletes and if you do n't have this anti-doping rule , you will have frankensteins , " spitz said . riders fed up as for the actual athletes , most believe that the testing goes too far . " to go one step further , you would have to move into my house and live with me , " the 36-year old german rider jen voigt , a 10-year veteran of the tour , told a news conference on friday . voigt added that cycling professionals were requested to tell the uci of their whereabouts three months in advance each time they leave home for more than two hours .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 05.07.2008 tour de france attempts to polish its tarnished image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teams have been training hard leading up to the race the tour de france kicks off this saturday , marking the beginning of a grueling three-week ride .
the race has been rocked by doping scandals for the past 10 years , and many believe that this time will be no different . in order to stem the widespread abuse of illegal drugs among cyclists , the international cycling union 's -lrb- uci -rrb- has started issuing biological passports , which chart the blood parameters of all professional riders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to blood tests , riders will also be forced to give urine , hair and nail samples in addition to that , the french national anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- will be taking random blood and urine samples , both before and during the race .
these samples will then be combined with the results of the uci tests . while experts have saluted the sport 's most recent efforts to ban drug users from cycling , some feel that more must be done . " the cyclists , and indeed other top athletes , are ultimately two steps ahead of the scientists and anti-doping controllers , " said jean-pierre de mondenard , a top anti-doping expert whose exhaustive " dictionary of doping " is a widely respected work in the field . what 's in your suitcase ? there are still around 20 undetectable products which can be used to enhance performance , which is why de mondenard feels that police should simply search participants ' luggage and other belongings to find any illegal drugs . while this method might sound invasive , it seems to be fruitful . in 2001 , during the giro d 'italia , 100 racers were tested and only two came up positive for performance-enhancing drugs .
later , when the italian police searched the luggage of the racers , they found 52 of the cyclists were in possession of illegal substances . 2007 winner denied entry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2007 tour winner , alberto contador , has been banned from the race despite never being convicted of doping it was in 1998 - during the infamous fatima doping scandal - that the banned hormone epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- was found to be in widespread use .
since then , a seemingly endless succession of cyclists has been found to be users of various performance-enhancing drugs . the uci , based in switzerland , and the tour de france organizers , the amaury sports organization -lrb- aso -rrb- , have bumped heads over team entries and doping in the past few years . aso is taking no chances anymore and has acted tougher than ever before when inviting the teams for the 2008 edition .
they have refused to invite back several big names , including the 2007 winner , alberto contador of spain , who rode for team discovery . despite accusations , contador - who now rides for astana - himself was never actually convicted of doping .
it was other astana riders , in particular alexander vinokourov , who brought the team down .
also banned were american levi leipheimer , who came in third overall in 2007 , and andreas klöden of germany , a two-time tour runner-up . the benefits of extensive testing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour de france runs for three weeks and covers 3,559 kilometers despite all the hype surrounding testing during the race itself , there are actually several substances that can help cyclists along without actually showing up in their system come race day . ulrike spitz of the german national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- said that substances like epo and amphetamines can be used to enhance training even two weeks before the race , but can also disappear from the blood by race day . that 's why , according to spitz , extensive testing would show real benefits . " i think the health risk is very big for the athletes and if you do n't have this anti-doping rule , you will have frankensteins , " spitz said . riders fed up as for the actual athletes , most believe that the testing goes too far . " to go one step further , you would have to move into my house and live with me , " the 36-year old german rider jen voigt , a 10-year veteran of the tour , told a news conference on friday . voigt added that cycling professionals were requested to tell the uci of their whereabouts three months in advance each time they leave home for more than two hours .

scientists blame climate change and overfishing for the proliferation of the stinging nuisance . while mediterranean resort areas will be hardest hit by the jellyfish plague this summer , there will also be high concentrations in the baltic and north seas , according to scientists .
they warn that the dramatic increase in jellyfish is a sign that ocean ecosystems are out of whack .
" jellyfish are an excellent bellwether for the environment , " jacqueline goy of the oceanographic institute of paris told afp news agency .
" the more jellyfish , the stronger the signal that something has changed . "
jellyfish are a problem because their tentacles , used to paralyze prey , cause burning rashes when they come into contact with humans .
warm waters , overfishing blamed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stinging jellyfish take the fun out of swimming overfishing is one cause for the explosion in jellyfish populations , said ricardo aguilar , research director for the non-governmental organization oceana .
jellyfish predators such as tuna , sharks and turtles are disappearing .
the lack of predators also means a lack of competition for plankton and small fish , which make up the jellyfish diet .
the other cause for the population increase is global warming as higher water temperatures prolong their reproductive cycles .
" jellyfish have come to occupy the place of many other species , " aguilar told afp .
numbers staying high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marine biologists are worried about the increase it used to be that jellyfish would arrive inshore once every decade , stay for a few years , and then go in to a period of decline .
yet for the past eight years , jellyfish numbers have been steadily increasing with no signs of dropping off .
once the population explodes , it might be hard to control , marine biologists say .
this summer , marine biologists have already spotted swarms of jellyfish in the waters between corsica and the french mainland .
cannes , france plans to install booms and nets around its most popular beaches to keep the jellyfish at bay , according to the independent newspaper .
scientists have also started a jelly-watch off the italian and greek coasts to monitor the movements of the jellyfish , the newspaper reported .
fishing remains a highly politicized topic in europe .
the european union recently ordered a halt on blue fin tuna fishing in the mediterranean , saying that the entire 2008 quota had already been caught .
the french government is pushing for the fishery to reopen on an " emergency basis . "
marine biologists have warned that this could further exacerbate the jellyfish population . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

-lrb- 03.06.2008 -rrb- major changes in store for baltic sea , study shows global warming is causing the air and water temperatures in the baltic sea region to heat up more intensely than other parts of the world , according to a recent study .
-lrb- 23.01.2008 -rrb- illegal fishing still a huge problem as stocks dwindle the eu recently imposed a ban on bluefin tuna fishing because of dwindling stocks .
it 's a move environmental groups say is pointless unless the bloc also gives its backing to effective control mechanisms .

employers are expected to have a significant say in the matter . according to a report in berliner zeitung on saturday , july 5 , germany 's coalition government plans to introduce a regular survey among manufacturers , the construction industry as well as retailers to find out about their current needs for skilled workers . the so-called arbeitskräftebedarfsindex , or index on the need for workers , will be part of a larger program to asses and react to the precise needs of german businesses as far as skilled foreign workers are concerned . the labor ministry is also expected to introduce a new alliance to cover the needs for workers that will include employers ' associations , trade unions and economic experts . drop in new citizens representatives of immigrants in germany meanwhile lamented the country 's hesitancy to naturalize people .

" but this is very difficult to evaluate , and so we must work out many details before it can be applied , " borloo told dpa news agency .
the proposal was made on the third , and last , day of an informal meeting of eu environment and energy ministers in paris devoted to drafting a package of laws that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , increase the use of renewable energy sources and make energy use more efficient across europe .
france , which assumed the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , and brussels want to have the package approved by the european parliament by the end of the french term , on december 31 , or at the latest in march 2009 , just ahead of european parliament elections .
feran tarradelles espuny , the spokesman for european energy commissioner andris pibalgs , said that ministers were considering making energy efficiency goals as legally binding as budget deficit ceilings are .
global directive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers called the paris meeting " absolutely crucial " this could be a global directive constraining eu member states to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 or measures directed at specific energy-intensive sectors , he said .
german junior finance minister jochen homann said germany " would have no problem with -lrb- such a directive -rrb- on a european level . "
in addition , tarradelles espuny said , measures were being considered to set minimum efficiency standards for a wide range of equipment , such as light bulbs , electronic standby devices and street and office lighting equipment .
in one year , standby devices across europe consume as much energy as does the country of hungary , he said , and noted that a vote would be taken on monday on the standby device proposal .
huge savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using renewable sources of energy may become a duty for all eu states on friday , pibalgs said a reduction of 20 percent in the eu 's energy consumption would represent annual savings of 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , at an oil price of 60 dollars per barrel .
and it would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 780 million tons .
energy efficiency " is our best tool to mitigate the effect of increasing oil prices on citizens ' welfare , improve the eu 's competitiveness and achieve our goals for security of supply , " pibalgs said .
in addition , borloo said eu members were strongly in favour of the goal of having renewable energy sources represent 20 percent of all energy use by 2020 , with a minimum of 10 percent in transport , whether it be biofuels or electric automobiles .
eu environment ministers were also looking to increase the share of carbon dioxide savings in the production of some biofuels by 35 percent in the near term , and by 50 percent by the year 2015 , borloo said .
a double game with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is highly dependant on russian gas earlier on saturday , the former head of the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- , claude mandil , told participants at the meeting that europe was playing an ineffectual double game with russia and must cease if it wants to better diversify its energy sources . " on the one hand we are horrified that there will be a shortage of russian gas and , on the other hand , we are verbally aggressive with russia , " mandil said .
" let 's be flexible , " he went on .
" let 's stop provoking russian sovereignty in the belief that we can dictate russian behaviour on energy . "
borloo closed the three-day meeting by saying it had been " indispensable " and " absolutely crucial . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 05.07.2008 tour de france attempts to polish its tarnished image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teams have been training hard leading up to the race the tour de france kicks off this saturday , marking the beginning of a grueling three-week ride .
the race has been rocked by doping scandals for the past 10 years , and many believe that this time will be no different . in order to stem the widespread abuse of illegal drugs among cyclists , the international cycling union 's -lrb- uci -rrb- has started issuing biological passports , which chart the blood parameters of all professional riders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to blood tests , riders will also be forced to give urine , hair and nail samples in addition to that , the french national anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- will be taking random blood and urine samples , both before and during the race .
these samples will then be combined with the results of the uci tests . while experts have saluted the sport 's most recent efforts to ban drug users from cycling , some feel that more must be done . " the cyclists , and indeed other top athletes , are ultimately two steps ahead of the scientists and anti-doping controllers , " said jean-pierre de mondenard , a top anti-doping expert whose exhaustive " dictionary of doping " is a widely respected work in the field . what 's in your suitcase ? there are still around 20 undetectable products which can be used to enhance performance , which is why de mondenard feels that police should simply search participants ' luggage and other belongings to find any illegal drugs . while this method might sound invasive , it seems to be fruitful . in 2001 , during the giro d 'italia , 100 racers were tested and only two came up positive for performance-enhancing drugs .
later , when the italian police searched the luggage of the racers , they found 52 of the cyclists were in possession of illegal substances . 2007 winner denied entry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2007 tour winner , alberto contador , has been banned from the race despite never being convicted of doping it was in 1998 - during the infamous fatima doping scandal - that the banned hormone epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- was found to be in widespread use .
since then , a seemingly endless succession of cyclists has been found to be users of various performance-enhancing drugs . the uci , based in switzerland , and the tour de france organizers , the amaury sports organization -lrb- aso -rrb- , have bumped heads over team entries and doping in the past few years . aso is taking no chances anymore and has acted tougher than ever before when inviting the teams for the 2008 edition .

scientists blame climate change and overfishing for the proliferation of the stinging nuisance . while mediterranean resort areas will be hardest hit by the jellyfish plague this summer , there will also be high concentrations in the baltic and north seas , according to scientists .
they warn that the dramatic increase in jellyfish is a sign that ocean ecosystems are out of whack .
" jellyfish are an excellent bellwether for the environment , " jacqueline goy of the oceanographic institute of paris told afp news agency .
" the more jellyfish , the stronger the signal that something has changed . "
jellyfish are a problem because their tentacles , used to paralyze prey , cause burning rashes when they come into contact with humans .
warm waters , overfishing blamed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stinging jellyfish take the fun out of swimming overfishing is one cause for the explosion in jellyfish populations , said ricardo aguilar , research director for the non-governmental organization oceana .
jellyfish predators such as tuna , sharks and turtles are disappearing .
the lack of predators also means a lack of competition for plankton and small fish , which make up the jellyfish diet .
the other cause for the population increase is global warming as higher water temperatures prolong their reproductive cycles .
" jellyfish have come to occupy the place of many other species , " aguilar told afp .

this summer , marine biologists have already spotted swarms of jellyfish in the waters between corsica and the french mainland .
cannes , france plans to install booms and nets around its most popular beaches to keep the jellyfish at bay , according to the independent newspaper .
scientists have also started a jelly-watch off the italian and greek coasts to monitor the movements of the jellyfish , the newspaper reported .
fishing remains a highly politicized topic in europe .
the european union recently ordered a halt on blue fin tuna fishing in the mediterranean , saying that the entire 2008 quota had already been caught .
the french government is pushing for the fishery to reopen on an " emergency basis . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.07.2008 eu considering making energy efficiency legally binding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with soaring energy prices , the eu is facing a tough challenge eu energy ministers are considering making energy efficiency legally binding across the union , french environment minister jean-louis borloo said on saturday , july 5 , in paris . " but this is very difficult to evaluate , and so we must work out many details before it can be applied , " borloo told dpa news agency .
the proposal was made on the third , and last , day of an informal meeting of eu environment and energy ministers in paris devoted to drafting a package of laws that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , increase the use of renewable energy sources and make energy use more efficient across europe .
france , which assumed the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , and brussels want to have the package approved by the european parliament by the end of the french term , on december 31 , or at the latest in march 2009 , just ahead of european parliament elections .
feran tarradelles espuny , the spokesman for european energy commissioner andris pibalgs , said that ministers were considering making energy efficiency goals as legally binding as budget deficit ceilings are .
global directive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers called the paris meeting " absolutely crucial " this could be a global directive constraining eu member states to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 or measures directed at specific energy-intensive sectors , he said .
german junior finance minister jochen homann said germany " would have no problem with -lrb- such a directive -rrb- on a european level . "
in addition , tarradelles espuny said , measures were being considered to set minimum efficiency standards for a wide range of equipment , such as light bulbs , electronic standby devices and street and office lighting equipment .
in one year , standby devices across europe consume as much energy as does the country of hungary , he said , and noted that a vote would be taken on monday on the standby device proposal .
huge savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using renewable sources of energy may become a duty for all eu states on friday , pibalgs said a reduction of 20 percent in the eu 's energy consumption would represent annual savings of 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , at an oil price of 60 dollars per barrel .
and it would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 780 million tons .
energy efficiency " is our best tool to mitigate the effect of increasing oil prices on citizens ' welfare , improve the eu 's competitiveness and achieve our goals for security of supply , " pibalgs said .
in addition , borloo said eu members were strongly in favour of the goal of having renewable energy sources represent 20 percent of all energy use by 2020 , with a minimum of 10 percent in transport , whether it be biofuels or electric automobiles .
eu environment ministers were also looking to increase the share of carbon dioxide savings in the production of some biofuels by 35 percent in the near term , and by 50 percent by the year 2015 , borloo said .
a double game with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is highly dependant on russian gas earlier on saturday , the former head of the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- , claude mandil , told participants at the meeting that europe was playing an ineffectual double game with russia and must cease if it wants to better diversify its energy sources . " on the one hand we are horrified that there will be a shortage of russian gas and , on the other hand , we are verbally aggressive with russia , " mandil said .
" let 's be flexible , " he went on .
" let 's stop provoking russian sovereignty in the belief that we can dictate russian behaviour on energy . "
borloo closed the three-day meeting by saying it had been " indispensable " and " absolutely crucial . "
" big objective difficulties remain to be overcome , but the desire to succeed is also big , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the race has been rocked by doping scandals for the past 10 years , and many believe that this time will be no different . in order to stem the widespread abuse of illegal drugs among cyclists , the international cycling union 's -lrb- uci -rrb- has started issuing biological passports , which chart the blood parameters of all professional riders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to blood tests , riders will also be forced to give urine , hair and nail samples in addition to that , the french national anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- will be taking random blood and urine samples , both before and during the race .

scientists blame climate change and overfishing for the proliferation of the stinging nuisance . while mediterranean resort areas will be hardest hit by the jellyfish plague this summer , there will also be high concentrations in the baltic and north seas , according to scientists .
they warn that the dramatic increase in jellyfish is a sign that ocean ecosystems are out of whack .
" jellyfish are an excellent bellwether for the environment , " jacqueline goy of the oceanographic institute of paris told afp news agency .

jellyfish predators such as tuna , sharks and turtles are disappearing .
the lack of predators also means a lack of competition for plankton and small fish , which make up the jellyfish diet .
the other cause for the population increase is global warming as higher water temperatures prolong their reproductive cycles .

this summer , marine biologists have already spotted swarms of jellyfish in the waters between corsica and the french mainland .

scientists have also started a jelly-watch off the italian and greek coasts to monitor the movements of the jellyfish , the newspaper reported .
fishing remains a highly politicized topic in europe .
the european union recently ordered a halt on blue fin tuna fishing in the mediterranean , saying that the entire 2008 quota had already been caught .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 05.07.2008 tour de france attempts to polish its tarnished image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teams have been training hard leading up to the race the tour de france kicks off this saturday , marking the beginning of a grueling three-week ride .
the race has been rocked by doping scandals for the past 10 years , and many believe that this time will be no different . in order to stem the widespread abuse of illegal drugs among cyclists , the international cycling union 's -lrb- uci -rrb- has started issuing biological passports , which chart the blood parameters of all professional riders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to blood tests , riders will also be forced to give urine , hair and nail samples in addition to that , the french national anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- will be taking random blood and urine samples , both before and during the race .
these samples will then be combined with the results of the uci tests . while experts have saluted the sport 's most recent efforts to ban drug users from cycling , some feel that more must be done . " the cyclists , and indeed other top athletes , are ultimately two steps ahead of the scientists and anti-doping controllers , " said jean-pierre de mondenard , a top anti-doping expert whose exhaustive " dictionary of doping " is a widely respected work in the field . what 's in your suitcase ? there are still around 20 undetectable products which can be used to enhance performance , which is why de mondenard feels that police should simply search participants ' luggage and other belongings to find any illegal drugs . while this method might sound invasive , it seems to be fruitful . in 2001 , during the giro d 'italia , 100 racers were tested and only two came up positive for performance-enhancing drugs .
later , when the italian police searched the luggage of the racers , they found 52 of the cyclists were in possession of illegal substances . 2007 winner denied entry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2007 tour winner , alberto contador , has been banned from the race despite never being convicted of doping it was in 1998 - during the infamous fatima doping scandal - that the banned hormone epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- was found to be in widespread use .
since then , a seemingly endless succession of cyclists has been found to be users of various performance-enhancing drugs . the uci , based in switzerland , and the tour de france organizers , the amaury sports organization -lrb- aso -rrb- , have bumped heads over team entries and doping in the past few years . aso is taking no chances anymore and has acted tougher than ever before when inviting the teams for the 2008 edition .
they have refused to invite back several big names , including the 2007 winner , alberto contador of spain , who rode for team discovery . despite accusations , contador - who now rides for astana - himself was never actually convicted of doping .
it was other astana riders , in particular alexander vinokourov , who brought the team down .
also banned were american levi leipheimer , who came in third overall in 2007 , and andreas klöden of germany , a two-time tour runner-up . the benefits of extensive testing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour de france runs for three weeks and covers 3,559 kilometers despite all the hype surrounding testing during the race itself , there are actually several substances that can help cyclists along without actually showing up in their system come race day . ulrike spitz of the german national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- said that substances like epo and amphetamines can be used to enhance training even two weeks before the race , but can also disappear from the blood by race day . that 's why , according to spitz , extensive testing would show real benefits . " i think the health risk is very big for the athletes and if you do n't have this anti-doping rule , you will have frankensteins , " spitz said . riders fed up as for the actual athletes , most believe that the testing goes too far . " to go one step further , you would have to move into my house and live with me , " the 36-year old german rider jen voigt , a 10-year veteran of the tour , told a news conference on friday . voigt added that cycling professionals were requested to tell the uci of their whereabouts three months in advance each time they leave home for more than two hours .

the race has been rocked by doping scandals for the past 10 years , and many believe that this time will be no different . in order to stem the widespread abuse of illegal drugs among cyclists , the international cycling union 's -lrb- uci -rrb- has started issuing biological passports , which chart the blood parameters of all professional riders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to blood tests , riders will also be forced to give urine , hair and nail samples in addition to that , the french national anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- will be taking random blood and urine samples , both before and during the race .
these samples will then be combined with the results of the uci tests . while experts have saluted the sport 's most recent efforts to ban drug users from cycling , some feel that more must be done .

they have refused to invite back several big names , including the 2007 winner , alberto contador of spain , who rode for team discovery . despite accusations , contador - who now rides for astana - himself was never actually convicted of doping .
it was other astana riders , in particular alexander vinokourov , who brought the team down .
also banned were american levi leipheimer , who came in third overall in 2007 , and andreas klöden of germany , a two-time tour runner-up . the benefits of extensive testing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour de france runs for three weeks and covers 3,559 kilometers despite all the hype surrounding testing during the race itself , there are actually several substances that can help cyclists along without actually showing up in their system come race day . ulrike spitz of the german national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- said that substances like epo and amphetamines can be used to enhance training even two weeks before the race , but can also disappear from the blood by race day . that 's why , according to spitz , extensive testing would show real benefits .

" the cyclists , and indeed other top athletes , are ultimately two steps ahead of the scientists and anti-doping controllers , " said jean-pierre de mondenard , a top anti-doping expert whose exhaustive " dictionary of doping " is a widely respected work in the field . what 's in your suitcase ? there are still around 20 undetectable products which can be used to enhance performance , which is why de mondenard feels that police should simply search participants ' luggage and other belongings to find any illegal drugs . while this method might sound invasive , it seems to be fruitful . in 2001 , during the giro d 'italia , 100 racers were tested and only two came up positive for performance-enhancing drugs .
later , when the italian police searched the luggage of the racers , they found 52 of the cyclists were in possession of illegal substances . 2007 winner denied entry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2007 tour winner , alberto contador , has been banned from the race despite never being convicted of doping it was in 1998 - during the infamous fatima doping scandal - that the banned hormone epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- was found to be in widespread use .
since then , a seemingly endless succession of cyclists has been found to be users of various performance-enhancing drugs . the uci , based in switzerland , and the tour de france organizers , the amaury sports organization -lrb- aso -rrb- , have bumped heads over team entries and doping in the past few years . aso is taking no chances anymore and has acted tougher than ever before when inviting the teams for the 2008 edition .
they have refused to invite back several big names , including the 2007 winner , alberto contador of spain , who rode for team discovery . despite accusations , contador - who now rides for astana - himself was never actually convicted of doping .
it was other astana riders , in particular alexander vinokourov , who brought the team down .
also banned were american levi leipheimer , who came in third overall in 2007 , and andreas klöden of germany , a two-time tour runner-up . the benefits of extensive testing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour de france runs for three weeks and covers 3,559 kilometers despite all the hype surrounding testing during the race itself , there are actually several substances that can help cyclists along without actually showing up in their system come race day . ulrike spitz of the german national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- said that substances like epo and amphetamines can be used to enhance training even two weeks before the race , but can also disappear from the blood by race day . that 's why , according to spitz , extensive testing would show real benefits . " i think the health risk is very big for the athletes and if you do n't have this anti-doping rule , you will have frankensteins , " spitz said . riders fed up as for the actual athletes , most believe that the testing goes too far . " to go one step further , you would have to move into my house and live with me , " the 36-year old german rider jen voigt , a 10-year veteran of the tour , told a news conference on friday . voigt added that cycling professionals were requested to tell the uci of their whereabouts three months in advance each time they leave home for more than two hours .

" but this is very difficult to evaluate , and so we must work out many details before it can be applied , " borloo told dpa news agency .
the proposal was made on the third , and last , day of an informal meeting of eu environment and energy ministers in paris devoted to drafting a package of laws that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , increase the use of renewable energy sources and make energy use more efficient across europe .
france , which assumed the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , and brussels want to have the package approved by the european parliament by the end of the french term , on december 31 , or at the latest in march 2009 , just ahead of european parliament elections .
feran tarradelles espuny , the spokesman for european energy commissioner andris pibalgs , said that ministers were considering making energy efficiency goals as legally binding as budget deficit ceilings are .
global directive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers called the paris meeting " absolutely crucial " this could be a global directive constraining eu member states to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 or measures directed at specific energy-intensive sectors , he said .
german junior finance minister jochen homann said germany " would have no problem with -lrb- such a directive -rrb- on a european level . "
in addition , tarradelles espuny said , measures were being considered to set minimum efficiency standards for a wide range of equipment , such as light bulbs , electronic standby devices and street and office lighting equipment .
in one year , standby devices across europe consume as much energy as does the country of hungary , he said , and noted that a vote would be taken on monday on the standby device proposal .
huge savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using renewable sources of energy may become a duty for all eu states on friday , pibalgs said a reduction of 20 percent in the eu 's energy consumption would represent annual savings of 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , at an oil price of 60 dollars per barrel .
and it would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 780 million tons .
energy efficiency " is our best tool to mitigate the effect of increasing oil prices on citizens ' welfare , improve the eu 's competitiveness and achieve our goals for security of supply , " pibalgs said .
in addition , borloo said eu members were strongly in favour of the goal of having renewable energy sources represent 20 percent of all energy use by 2020 , with a minimum of 10 percent in transport , whether it be biofuels or electric automobiles .
eu environment ministers were also looking to increase the share of carbon dioxide savings in the production of some biofuels by 35 percent in the near term , and by 50 percent by the year 2015 , borloo said .
a double game with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is highly dependant on russian gas earlier on saturday , the former head of the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- , claude mandil , told participants at the meeting that europe was playing an ineffectual double game with russia and must cease if it wants to better diversify its energy sources . " on the one hand we are horrified that there will be a shortage of russian gas and , on the other hand , we are verbally aggressive with russia , " mandil said .
" let 's be flexible , " he went on .
" let 's stop provoking russian sovereignty in the belief that we can dictate russian behaviour on energy . "
borloo closed the three-day meeting by saying it had been " indispensable " and " absolutely crucial . "
" big objective difficulties remain to be overcome , but the desire to succeed is also big , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

global directive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers called the paris meeting " absolutely crucial " this could be a global directive constraining eu member states to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 or measures directed at specific energy-intensive sectors , he said .
german junior finance minister jochen homann said germany " would have no problem with -lrb- such a directive -rrb- on a european level . "
in addition , tarradelles espuny said , measures were being considered to set minimum efficiency standards for a wide range of equipment , such as light bulbs , electronic standby devices and street and office lighting equipment .
in one year , standby devices across europe consume as much energy as does the country of hungary , he said , and noted that a vote would be taken on monday on the standby device proposal .
huge savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using renewable sources of energy may become a duty for all eu states on friday , pibalgs said a reduction of 20 percent in the eu 's energy consumption would represent annual savings of 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , at an oil price of 60 dollars per barrel .
and it would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 780 million tons .
energy efficiency " is our best tool to mitigate the effect of increasing oil prices on citizens ' welfare , improve the eu 's competitiveness and achieve our goals for security of supply , " pibalgs said .
in addition , borloo said eu members were strongly in favour of the goal of having renewable energy sources represent 20 percent of all energy use by 2020 , with a minimum of 10 percent in transport , whether it be biofuels or electric automobiles .
eu environment ministers were also looking to increase the share of carbon dioxide savings in the production of some biofuels by 35 percent in the near term , and by 50 percent by the year 2015 , borloo said .
a double game with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is highly dependant on russian gas earlier on saturday , the former head of the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- , claude mandil , told participants at the meeting that europe was playing an ineffectual double game with russia and must cease if it wants to better diversify its energy sources . " on the one hand we are horrified that there will be a shortage of russian gas and , on the other hand , we are verbally aggressive with russia , " mandil said .
" let 's be flexible , " he went on .
" let 's stop provoking russian sovereignty in the belief that we can dictate russian behaviour on energy . "
borloo closed the three-day meeting by saying it had been " indispensable " and " absolutely crucial . "
" big objective difficulties remain to be overcome , but the desire to succeed is also big , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.07.2008 eu considering making energy efficiency legally binding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with soaring energy prices , the eu is facing a tough challenge eu energy ministers are considering making energy efficiency legally binding across the union , french environment minister jean-louis borloo said on saturday , july 5 , in paris . " but this is very difficult to evaluate , and so we must work out many details before it can be applied , " borloo told dpa news agency .
the proposal was made on the third , and last , day of an informal meeting of eu environment and energy ministers in paris devoted to drafting a package of laws that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , increase the use of renewable energy sources and make energy use more efficient across europe .
france , which assumed the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , and brussels want to have the package approved by the european parliament by the end of the french term , on december 31 , or at the latest in march 2009 , just ahead of european parliament elections .
feran tarradelles espuny , the spokesman for european energy commissioner andris pibalgs , said that ministers were considering making energy efficiency goals as legally binding as budget deficit ceilings are .
global directive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers called the paris meeting " absolutely crucial " this could be a global directive constraining eu member states to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 or measures directed at specific energy-intensive sectors , he said .
german junior finance minister jochen homann said germany " would have no problem with -lrb- such a directive -rrb- on a european level . "
in addition , tarradelles espuny said , measures were being considered to set minimum efficiency standards for a wide range of equipment , such as light bulbs , electronic standby devices and street and office lighting equipment .
in one year , standby devices across europe consume as much energy as does the country of hungary , he said , and noted that a vote would be taken on monday on the standby device proposal .
huge savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using renewable sources of energy may become a duty for all eu states on friday , pibalgs said a reduction of 20 percent in the eu 's energy consumption would represent annual savings of 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , at an oil price of 60 dollars per barrel .
and it would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 780 million tons .
energy efficiency " is our best tool to mitigate the effect of increasing oil prices on citizens ' welfare , improve the eu 's competitiveness and achieve our goals for security of supply , " pibalgs said .
in addition , borloo said eu members were strongly in favour of the goal of having renewable energy sources represent 20 percent of all energy use by 2020 , with a minimum of 10 percent in transport , whether it be biofuels or electric automobiles .
eu environment ministers were also looking to increase the share of carbon dioxide savings in the production of some biofuels by 35 percent in the near term , and by 50 percent by the year 2015 , borloo said .
a double game with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is highly dependant on russian gas earlier on saturday , the former head of the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- , claude mandil , told participants at the meeting that europe was playing an ineffectual double game with russia and must cease if it wants to better diversify its energy sources . " on the one hand we are horrified that there will be a shortage of russian gas and , on the other hand , we are verbally aggressive with russia , " mandil said .
" let 's be flexible , " he went on .
" let 's stop provoking russian sovereignty in the belief that we can dictate russian behaviour on energy . "
borloo closed the three-day meeting by saying it had been " indispensable " and " absolutely crucial . "
" big objective difficulties remain to be overcome , but the desire to succeed is also big , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

scientists blame climate change and overfishing for the proliferation of the stinging nuisance . while mediterranean resort areas will be hardest hit by the jellyfish plague this summer , there will also be high concentrations in the baltic and north seas , according to scientists .
they warn that the dramatic increase in jellyfish is a sign that ocean ecosystems are out of whack .
" jellyfish are an excellent bellwether for the environment , " jacqueline goy of the oceanographic institute of paris told afp news agency .
" the more jellyfish , the stronger the signal that something has changed . "
jellyfish are a problem because their tentacles , used to paralyze prey , cause burning rashes when they come into contact with humans .
warm waters , overfishing blamed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stinging jellyfish take the fun out of swimming overfishing is one cause for the explosion in jellyfish populations , said ricardo aguilar , research director for the non-governmental organization oceana .
jellyfish predators such as tuna , sharks and turtles are disappearing .
the lack of predators also means a lack of competition for plankton and small fish , which make up the jellyfish diet .
the other cause for the population increase is global warming as higher water temperatures prolong their reproductive cycles .
" jellyfish have come to occupy the place of many other species , " aguilar told afp .
numbers staying high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marine biologists are worried about the increase it used to be that jellyfish would arrive inshore once every decade , stay for a few years , and then go in to a period of decline .
yet for the past eight years , jellyfish numbers have been steadily increasing with no signs of dropping off .
once the population explodes , it might be hard to control , marine biologists say .
this summer , marine biologists have already spotted swarms of jellyfish in the waters between corsica and the french mainland .
cannes , france plans to install booms and nets around its most popular beaches to keep the jellyfish at bay , according to the independent newspaper .
scientists have also started a jelly-watch off the italian and greek coasts to monitor the movements of the jellyfish , the newspaper reported .
fishing remains a highly politicized topic in europe .
the european union recently ordered a halt on blue fin tuna fishing in the mediterranean , saying that the entire 2008 quota had already been caught .
the french government is pushing for the fishery to reopen on an " emergency basis . "
marine biologists have warned that this could further exacerbate the jellyfish population . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but this is very difficult to evaluate , and so we must work out many details before it can be applied , " borloo told dpa news agency .
the proposal was made on the third , and last , day of an informal meeting of eu environment and energy ministers in paris devoted to drafting a package of laws that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , increase the use of renewable energy sources and make energy use more efficient across europe .
france , which assumed the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , and brussels want to have the package approved by the european parliament by the end of the french term , on december 31 , or at the latest in march 2009 , just ahead of european parliament elections .
feran tarradelles espuny , the spokesman for european energy commissioner andris pibalgs , said that ministers were considering making energy efficiency goals as legally binding as budget deficit ceilings are .
global directive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers called the paris meeting " absolutely crucial " this could be a global directive constraining eu member states to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 or measures directed at specific energy-intensive sectors , he said .
german junior finance minister jochen homann said germany " would have no problem with -lrb- such a directive -rrb- on a european level . "
in addition , tarradelles espuny said , measures were being considered to set minimum efficiency standards for a wide range of equipment , such as light bulbs , electronic standby devices and street and office lighting equipment .
in one year , standby devices across europe consume as much energy as does the country of hungary , he said , and noted that a vote would be taken on monday on the standby device proposal .
huge savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using renewable sources of energy may become a duty for all eu states on friday , pibalgs said a reduction of 20 percent in the eu 's energy consumption would represent annual savings of 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , at an oil price of 60 dollars per barrel .
and it would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 780 million tons .
energy efficiency " is our best tool to mitigate the effect of increasing oil prices on citizens ' welfare , improve the eu 's competitiveness and achieve our goals for security of supply , " pibalgs said .
in addition , borloo said eu members were strongly in favour of the goal of having renewable energy sources represent 20 percent of all energy use by 2020 , with a minimum of 10 percent in transport , whether it be biofuels or electric automobiles .
eu environment ministers were also looking to increase the share of carbon dioxide savings in the production of some biofuels by 35 percent in the near term , and by 50 percent by the year 2015 , borloo said .
a double game with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is highly dependant on russian gas earlier on saturday , the former head of the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- , claude mandil , told participants at the meeting that europe was playing an ineffectual double game with russia and must cease if it wants to better diversify its energy sources . " on the one hand we are horrified that there will be a shortage of russian gas and , on the other hand , we are verbally aggressive with russia , " mandil said .
" let 's be flexible , " he went on .
" let 's stop provoking russian sovereignty in the belief that we can dictate russian behaviour on energy . "
borloo closed the three-day meeting by saying it had been " indispensable " and " absolutely crucial . "

eu environment ministers were also looking to increase the share of carbon dioxide savings in the production of some biofuels by 35 percent in the near term , and by 50 percent by the year 2015 , borloo said .
a double game with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is highly dependant on russian gas earlier on saturday , the former head of the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- , claude mandil , told participants at the meeting that europe was playing an ineffectual double game with russia and must cease if it wants to better diversify its energy sources . " on the one hand we are horrified that there will be a shortage of russian gas and , on the other hand , we are verbally aggressive with russia , " mandil said .
" let 's be flexible , " he went on .
" let 's stop provoking russian sovereignty in the belief that we can dictate russian behaviour on energy . "
borloo closed the three-day meeting by saying it had been " indispensable " and " absolutely crucial . "
" big objective difficulties remain to be overcome , but the desire to succeed is also big , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

scientists blame climate change and overfishing for the proliferation of the stinging nuisance . while mediterranean resort areas will be hardest hit by the jellyfish plague this summer , there will also be high concentrations in the baltic and north seas , according to scientists .
they warn that the dramatic increase in jellyfish is a sign that ocean ecosystems are out of whack .
" jellyfish are an excellent bellwether for the environment , " jacqueline goy of the oceanographic institute of paris told afp news agency .
" the more jellyfish , the stronger the signal that something has changed . "
jellyfish are a problem because their tentacles , used to paralyze prey , cause burning rashes when they come into contact with humans .
warm waters , overfishing blamed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stinging jellyfish take the fun out of swimming overfishing is one cause for the explosion in jellyfish populations , said ricardo aguilar , research director for the non-governmental organization oceana .
jellyfish predators such as tuna , sharks and turtles are disappearing .
the lack of predators also means a lack of competition for plankton and small fish , which make up the jellyfish diet .
the other cause for the population increase is global warming as higher water temperatures prolong their reproductive cycles .
" jellyfish have come to occupy the place of many other species , " aguilar told afp .
numbers staying high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marine biologists are worried about the increase it used to be that jellyfish would arrive inshore once every decade , stay for a few years , and then go in to a period of decline .
yet for the past eight years , jellyfish numbers have been steadily increasing with no signs of dropping off .
once the population explodes , it might be hard to control , marine biologists say .
this summer , marine biologists have already spotted swarms of jellyfish in the waters between corsica and the french mainland .
cannes , france plans to install booms and nets around its most popular beaches to keep the jellyfish at bay , according to the independent newspaper .
scientists have also started a jelly-watch off the italian and greek coasts to monitor the movements of the jellyfish , the newspaper reported .
fishing remains a highly politicized topic in europe .
the european union recently ordered a halt on blue fin tuna fishing in the mediterranean , saying that the entire 2008 quota had already been caught .
the french government is pushing for the fishery to reopen on an " emergency basis . "
marine biologists have warned that this could further exacerbate the jellyfish population . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

-lrb- 03.06.2008 -rrb- major changes in store for baltic sea , study shows global warming is causing the air and water temperatures in the baltic sea region to heat up more intensely than other parts of the world , according to a recent study .
-lrb- 23.01.2008 -rrb- illegal fishing still a huge problem as stocks dwindle the eu recently imposed a ban on bluefin tuna fishing because of dwindling stocks .
it 's a move environmental groups say is pointless unless the bloc also gives its backing to effective control mechanisms .

scientists blame climate change and overfishing for the proliferation of the stinging nuisance . while mediterranean resort areas will be hardest hit by the jellyfish plague this summer , there will also be high concentrations in the baltic and north seas , according to scientists .
they warn that the dramatic increase in jellyfish is a sign that ocean ecosystems are out of whack .
" jellyfish are an excellent bellwether for the environment , " jacqueline goy of the oceanographic institute of paris told afp news agency .
" the more jellyfish , the stronger the signal that something has changed . "
jellyfish are a problem because their tentacles , used to paralyze prey , cause burning rashes when they come into contact with humans .
warm waters , overfishing blamed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stinging jellyfish take the fun out of swimming overfishing is one cause for the explosion in jellyfish populations , said ricardo aguilar , research director for the non-governmental organization oceana .
jellyfish predators such as tuna , sharks and turtles are disappearing .
the lack of predators also means a lack of competition for plankton and small fish , which make up the jellyfish diet .
the other cause for the population increase is global warming as higher water temperatures prolong their reproductive cycles .
" jellyfish have come to occupy the place of many other species , " aguilar told afp .
numbers staying high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marine biologists are worried about the increase it used to be that jellyfish would arrive inshore once every decade , stay for a few years , and then go in to a period of decline .
yet for the past eight years , jellyfish numbers have been steadily increasing with no signs of dropping off .
once the population explodes , it might be hard to control , marine biologists say .
this summer , marine biologists have already spotted swarms of jellyfish in the waters between corsica and the french mainland .
cannes , france plans to install booms and nets around its most popular beaches to keep the jellyfish at bay , according to the independent newspaper .
scientists have also started a jelly-watch off the italian and greek coasts to monitor the movements of the jellyfish , the newspaper reported .
fishing remains a highly politicized topic in europe .
the european union recently ordered a halt on blue fin tuna fishing in the mediterranean , saying that the entire 2008 quota had already been caught .
the french government is pushing for the fishery to reopen on an " emergency basis . "
marine biologists have warned that this could further exacerbate the jellyfish population . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de europe 's beaches -lrb- mostly -rrb- clean , says report the vast majority of the european union 's waters are clean enough to swim in , though the number of banned sites in italy has reached record heights , according to an eu report .
-lrb- 03.06.2008 -rrb- major changes in store for baltic sea , study shows global warming is causing the air and water temperatures in the baltic sea region to heat up more intensely than other parts of the world , according to a recent study .
-lrb- 23.01.2008 -rrb- illegal fishing still a huge problem as stocks dwindle the eu recently imposed a ban on bluefin tuna fishing because of dwindling stocks .
it 's a move environmental groups say is pointless unless the bloc also gives its backing to effective control mechanisms .

scientists blame climate change and overfishing for the proliferation of the stinging nuisance . while mediterranean resort areas will be hardest hit by the jellyfish plague this summer , there will also be high concentrations in the baltic and north seas , according to scientists .
they warn that the dramatic increase in jellyfish is a sign that ocean ecosystems are out of whack .
" jellyfish are an excellent bellwether for the environment , " jacqueline goy of the oceanographic institute of paris told afp news agency .
" the more jellyfish , the stronger the signal that something has changed . "
jellyfish are a problem because their tentacles , used to paralyze prey , cause burning rashes when they come into contact with humans .
warm waters , overfishing blamed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stinging jellyfish take the fun out of swimming overfishing is one cause for the explosion in jellyfish populations , said ricardo aguilar , research director for the non-governmental organization oceana .
jellyfish predators such as tuna , sharks and turtles are disappearing .
the lack of predators also means a lack of competition for plankton and small fish , which make up the jellyfish diet .
the other cause for the population increase is global warming as higher water temperatures prolong their reproductive cycles .
" jellyfish have come to occupy the place of many other species , " aguilar told afp .
numbers staying high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marine biologists are worried about the increase it used to be that jellyfish would arrive inshore once every decade , stay for a few years , and then go in to a period of decline .
yet for the past eight years , jellyfish numbers have been steadily increasing with no signs of dropping off .
once the population explodes , it might be hard to control , marine biologists say .
this summer , marine biologists have already spotted swarms of jellyfish in the waters between corsica and the french mainland .
cannes , france plans to install booms and nets around its most popular beaches to keep the jellyfish at bay , according to the independent newspaper .
scientists have also started a jelly-watch off the italian and greek coasts to monitor the movements of the jellyfish , the newspaper reported .
fishing remains a highly politicized topic in europe .
the european union recently ordered a halt on blue fin tuna fishing in the mediterranean , saying that the entire 2008 quota had already been caught .
the french government is pushing for the fishery to reopen on an " emergency basis . "
marine biologists have warned that this could further exacerbate the jellyfish population . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the race has been rocked by doping scandals for the past 10 years , and many believe that this time will be no different . in order to stem the widespread abuse of illegal drugs among cyclists , the international cycling union 's -lrb- uci -rrb- has started issuing biological passports , which chart the blood parameters of all professional riders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to blood tests , riders will also be forced to give urine , hair and nail samples in addition to that , the french national anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- will be taking random blood and urine samples , both before and during the race .
these samples will then be combined with the results of the uci tests . while experts have saluted the sport 's most recent efforts to ban drug users from cycling , some feel that more must be done . " the cyclists , and indeed other top athletes , are ultimately two steps ahead of the scientists and anti-doping controllers , " said jean-pierre de mondenard , a top anti-doping expert whose exhaustive " dictionary of doping " is a widely respected work in the field . what 's in your suitcase ? there are still around 20 undetectable products which can be used to enhance performance , which is why de mondenard feels that police should simply search participants ' luggage and other belongings to find any illegal drugs . while this method might sound invasive , it seems to be fruitful . in 2001 , during the giro d 'italia , 100 racers were tested and only two came up positive for performance-enhancing drugs .
later , when the italian police searched the luggage of the racers , they found 52 of the cyclists were in possession of illegal substances . 2007 winner denied entry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2007 tour winner , alberto contador , has been banned from the race despite never being convicted of doping it was in 1998 - during the infamous fatima doping scandal - that the banned hormone epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- was found to be in widespread use .
since then , a seemingly endless succession of cyclists has been found to be users of various performance-enhancing drugs . the uci , based in switzerland , and the tour de france organizers , the amaury sports organization -lrb- aso -rrb- , have bumped heads over team entries and doping in the past few years . aso is taking no chances anymore and has acted tougher than ever before when inviting the teams for the 2008 edition .
they have refused to invite back several big names , including the 2007 winner , alberto contador of spain , who rode for team discovery . despite accusations , contador - who now rides for astana - himself was never actually convicted of doping .
it was other astana riders , in particular alexander vinokourov , who brought the team down .
also banned were american levi leipheimer , who came in third overall in 2007 , and andreas klöden of germany , a two-time tour runner-up . the benefits of extensive testing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour de france runs for three weeks and covers 3,559 kilometers despite all the hype surrounding testing during the race itself , there are actually several substances that can help cyclists along without actually showing up in their system come race day . ulrike spitz of the german national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- said that substances like epo and amphetamines can be used to enhance training even two weeks before the race , but can also disappear from the blood by race day . that 's why , according to spitz , extensive testing would show real benefits . " i think the health risk is very big for the athletes and if you do n't have this anti-doping rule , you will have frankensteins , " spitz said . riders fed up as for the actual athletes , most believe that the testing goes too far . " to go one step further , you would have to move into my house and live with me , " the 36-year old german rider jen voigt , a 10-year veteran of the tour , told a news conference on friday . voigt added that cycling professionals were requested to tell the uci of their whereabouts three months in advance each time they leave home for more than two hours .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.07.2008 eu considering making energy efficiency legally binding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with soaring energy prices , the eu is facing a tough challenge eu energy ministers are considering making energy efficiency legally binding across the union , french environment minister jean-louis borloo said on saturday , july 5 , in paris . " but this is very difficult to evaluate , and so we must work out many details before it can be applied , " borloo told dpa news agency .
the proposal was made on the third , and last , day of an informal meeting of eu environment and energy ministers in paris devoted to drafting a package of laws that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , increase the use of renewable energy sources and make energy use more efficient across europe .
france , which assumed the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , and brussels want to have the package approved by the european parliament by the end of the french term , on december 31 , or at the latest in march 2009 , just ahead of european parliament elections .
feran tarradelles espuny , the spokesman for european energy commissioner andris pibalgs , said that ministers were considering making energy efficiency goals as legally binding as budget deficit ceilings are .
global directive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers called the paris meeting " absolutely crucial " this could be a global directive constraining eu member states to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 or measures directed at specific energy-intensive sectors , he said .
german junior finance minister jochen homann said germany " would have no problem with -lrb- such a directive -rrb- on a european level . "
in addition , tarradelles espuny said , measures were being considered to set minimum efficiency standards for a wide range of equipment , such as light bulbs , electronic standby devices and street and office lighting equipment .
in one year , standby devices across europe consume as much energy as does the country of hungary , he said , and noted that a vote would be taken on monday on the standby device proposal .
huge savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using renewable sources of energy may become a duty for all eu states on friday , pibalgs said a reduction of 20 percent in the eu 's energy consumption would represent annual savings of 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , at an oil price of 60 dollars per barrel .
and it would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 780 million tons .
energy efficiency " is our best tool to mitigate the effect of increasing oil prices on citizens ' welfare , improve the eu 's competitiveness and achieve our goals for security of supply , " pibalgs said .
in addition , borloo said eu members were strongly in favour of the goal of having renewable energy sources represent 20 percent of all energy use by 2020 , with a minimum of 10 percent in transport , whether it be biofuels or electric automobiles .
eu environment ministers were also looking to increase the share of carbon dioxide savings in the production of some biofuels by 35 percent in the near term , and by 50 percent by the year 2015 , borloo said .
a double game with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is highly dependant on russian gas earlier on saturday , the former head of the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- , claude mandil , told participants at the meeting that europe was playing an ineffectual double game with russia and must cease if it wants to better diversify its energy sources . " on the one hand we are horrified that there will be a shortage of russian gas and , on the other hand , we are verbally aggressive with russia , " mandil said .
" let 's be flexible , " he went on .
" let 's stop provoking russian sovereignty in the belief that we can dictate russian behaviour on energy . "
borloo closed the three-day meeting by saying it had been " indispensable " and " absolutely crucial . "
" big objective difficulties remain to be overcome , but the desire to succeed is also big , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.07.2008 eu considering making energy efficiency legally binding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with soaring energy prices , the eu is facing a tough challenge eu energy ministers are considering making energy efficiency legally binding across the union , french environment minister jean-louis borloo said on saturday , july 5 , in paris . " but this is very difficult to evaluate , and so we must work out many details before it can be applied , " borloo told dpa news agency .
the proposal was made on the third , and last , day of an informal meeting of eu environment and energy ministers in paris devoted to drafting a package of laws that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , increase the use of renewable energy sources and make energy use more efficient across europe .
france , which assumed the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , and brussels want to have the package approved by the european parliament by the end of the french term , on december 31 , or at the latest in march 2009 , just ahead of european parliament elections .
feran tarradelles espuny , the spokesman for european energy commissioner andris pibalgs , said that ministers were considering making energy efficiency goals as legally binding as budget deficit ceilings are .
global directive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers called the paris meeting " absolutely crucial " this could be a global directive constraining eu member states to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 or measures directed at specific energy-intensive sectors , he said .
german junior finance minister jochen homann said germany " would have no problem with -lrb- such a directive -rrb- on a european level . "
in addition , tarradelles espuny said , measures were being considered to set minimum efficiency standards for a wide range of equipment , such as light bulbs , electronic standby devices and street and office lighting equipment .
in one year , standby devices across europe consume as much energy as does the country of hungary , he said , and noted that a vote would be taken on monday on the standby device proposal .
huge savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using renewable sources of energy may become a duty for all eu states on friday , pibalgs said a reduction of 20 percent in the eu 's energy consumption would represent annual savings of 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , at an oil price of 60 dollars per barrel .
and it would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 780 million tons .
energy efficiency " is our best tool to mitigate the effect of increasing oil prices on citizens ' welfare , improve the eu 's competitiveness and achieve our goals for security of supply , " pibalgs said .
in addition , borloo said eu members were strongly in favour of the goal of having renewable energy sources represent 20 percent of all energy use by 2020 , with a minimum of 10 percent in transport , whether it be biofuels or electric automobiles .
eu environment ministers were also looking to increase the share of carbon dioxide savings in the production of some biofuels by 35 percent in the near term , and by 50 percent by the year 2015 , borloo said .
a double game with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is highly dependant on russian gas earlier on saturday , the former head of the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- , claude mandil , told participants at the meeting that europe was playing an ineffectual double game with russia and must cease if it wants to better diversify its energy sources . " on the one hand we are horrified that there will be a shortage of russian gas and , on the other hand , we are verbally aggressive with russia , " mandil said .
" let 's be flexible , " he went on .
" let 's stop provoking russian sovereignty in the belief that we can dictate russian behaviour on energy . "
borloo closed the three-day meeting by saying it had been " indispensable " and " absolutely crucial . "
" big objective difficulties remain to be overcome , but the desire to succeed is also big , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

scientists blame climate change and overfishing for the proliferation of the stinging nuisance . while mediterranean resort areas will be hardest hit by the jellyfish plague this summer , there will also be high concentrations in the baltic and north seas , according to scientists .
they warn that the dramatic increase in jellyfish is a sign that ocean ecosystems are out of whack .
" jellyfish are an excellent bellwether for the environment , " jacqueline goy of the oceanographic institute of paris told afp news agency .
" the more jellyfish , the stronger the signal that something has changed . "
jellyfish are a problem because their tentacles , used to paralyze prey , cause burning rashes when they come into contact with humans .
warm waters , overfishing blamed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stinging jellyfish take the fun out of swimming overfishing is one cause for the explosion in jellyfish populations , said ricardo aguilar , research director for the non-governmental organization oceana .
jellyfish predators such as tuna , sharks and turtles are disappearing .
the lack of predators also means a lack of competition for plankton and small fish , which make up the jellyfish diet .
the other cause for the population increase is global warming as higher water temperatures prolong their reproductive cycles .
" jellyfish have come to occupy the place of many other species , " aguilar told afp .
numbers staying high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marine biologists are worried about the increase it used to be that jellyfish would arrive inshore once every decade , stay for a few years , and then go in to a period of decline .
yet for the past eight years , jellyfish numbers have been steadily increasing with no signs of dropping off .
once the population explodes , it might be hard to control , marine biologists say .
this summer , marine biologists have already spotted swarms of jellyfish in the waters between corsica and the french mainland .
cannes , france plans to install booms and nets around its most popular beaches to keep the jellyfish at bay , according to the independent newspaper .
scientists have also started a jelly-watch off the italian and greek coasts to monitor the movements of the jellyfish , the newspaper reported .
fishing remains a highly politicized topic in europe .
the european union recently ordered a halt on blue fin tuna fishing in the mediterranean , saying that the entire 2008 quota had already been caught .
the french government is pushing for the fishery to reopen on an " emergency basis . "
marine biologists have warned that this could further exacerbate the jellyfish population . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

high street shop staff are fobbing off customers and giving them misleading advice about their rights , according to the consumer organisation which ?
consumers are often told to take their complaint to the manufacturer , when it is the retailer 's responsibility to sort it out , which ? said .
one marketing expert told the bbc that bad advice was often due to a lack of training or the management 's attitude .
the government is planning to simplify consumer protection laws .
i think there are real issues about retailers not understanding their responsibilities gareth thomas consumer affairs minister it says this should mean both consumers and shops are clear about what to expect .
complexity consumer laws have been strengthened and added to over recent years and shoppers have better protection than ever before .
the problem is that as more laws have been added , confusion has grown .
now the government is planning a major overhaul of consumer legislation , with the aim of simplifying it .
consumer affairs minister , gareth thomas , said he hoped that both consumers and retailers would be clearer about their rights and responsibilities .
" i think there are real issues about retailers not understanding their responsibilities - perhaps believing that it 's the responsibility of manufacturers or that there is n't a problem at all , " he said .
" it 's because of the complexity of the existing law .
if we can simplify the law we can make it easier for high street retailers to understand what their responsibilities are to consumers . "
according to which ? , one of the most common problems is retailers telling consumers to take up their complaint with the manufacturer .
but espe feuntes , a lawyer with which ? , said the advice was wrong .
" when people purchase goods and they go wrong , for example , and they take them back to the retailer , the retailer is telling them things like - you have to go back to the manufacturer .
retailers are not in any systematic way telling their staff to fob customers off richard dodd british retail consortium " this is actually not right .
your rights are with the retailer .
they are the people you have the contract with . "
' bad attitude ' the problem can be systemic and in some cases it is down to a lack of training - or worse - said professor robert shaw , an expert in marketing from cass business school said .
" when retailers give out bad information to consumers it can be either due to a lack of training or because of bad attitudes at the top .
" in the case of training , these days it 's very often the first budget to be cut .
" in the other circumstance top managers often have a bad attitude to consumers and that then trickles down to the staff . "
but it is an accusation strongly denied by the retailer 's trade body , the british retail consortium -lrb- brc -rrb- " retailers are not in any systematic way telling their staff to fob customers off or send them to manufacturers when it 's actually the job of the retailer to deal with it , " said the brc 's richard dodd .
retailers spend millions of pounds making sure that staff understand what customers rights are , he added .
the government 's consultation on how to simplify consumer law will continue until the end of july .

standing all alone the former priest very publicly offered his resignation from his position as deputy mayor for young people .
thursday 's allegations about his previous personal conduct had been deemed too damaging for mr lewis to continue in his job .
it was notable that mayor boris johnson was not by his side , not standing by the first man he appointed on taking charge of the capital .
during his campaign for the mayoralty mr johnson had spoken loudly and clearly of the very high importance he gave to tackling london 's plague of knife and gun crime .
mr lewis was deemed to be the man to help save the city 's youngsters , but there was nothing the mayor could do to save his deputy .
it was on thursday that bbc london revealed that three complaints of financial irregularities had been made against ray lewis .
more details have now emerged over how mr lewis , during his time as a vicar in east london in the 1990s , was alleged to have taken control of money belonging to a parishioner with learning difficulties . "
i can not allow the things going on around me to obscure the important business of this very important mayoralty , and for that reason i must step down with immediate affect " ray lewis the man 's social worker was concerned enough to write to the vicar 's superior , the bishop of barking , over what he thought was happening .
city hall dismissed these particular claims as having been made by an unreliable witness .
ray lewis has again flatly denied this allegation along with the other two he is facing .
he said they were " unfounded and untrue " .
the second complaint related to a debt owed to a fellow priest , and the third concerned a sum in excess of £ 25,000 that belonged to a female parishioner .
religious ban one thing that is certain is that the complaints led the archbishop of canterbury to add the name ray lewis to the lambeth and bishopthorpe register , effectively barring him from public ministry and taking any post in the church of england .
ray lewis said on thursday that he was not aware that he had been placed on the list , and had not applied for a post in the church of england since the late 1990s .
he also denied that he was " the person painted by these allegations " , adding " i have never harassed anyone .
i have never defrauded anyone " .
boris johnson considered these denials and the launching of an inquiry into the allegations enough to allow mr lewis to stay in his job .
that has now changed .
one reason why is the revelation that ray lewis is not , and never has been , a magistrate .
on thursday both he and the mayor said he was .
the reality was made clear in a statement to bbc london from the ministry of justice .
mr lewis says that it only matters to members of the " hair-splitters convention " whether he had been appointed or " recommended for appointment " as a justice of the peace .
he 's pledged to make documents available to back up these words .
but that hardly seems to matter now .
the former deputy mayor of london said : " i can not allow the things going on around me to obscure the important business of this very important mayoralty , and for that reason i must step down with immediate affect . "
mayor boris johnson has said : " i can not deny , however , that my confidence in ray was shaken by the discovery that he is not a fully fledged justice of the peace . "
no wrong-doing has been proven but the political pressure of the allegations against ray lewis has evidently been deemed too great for him to stay in post . "
-lsb- ray lewis -rsb- has always been , and remains , an inspiring figure to me " boris johnson to have lost a man so important to his vision for london after just two months will be a huge blow to mr johnson .
when you add to the equation the capital the new mayor made out of allegations against ken livingstone 's adviser lee jasper during this year 's election campaign , there is a certain irony in what has happened .
awkward questions mr johnson will surely be accused of dragging his feet in accepting the resignation .
he said : " it is with extreme reluctance and sadness that i have accepted the resignation of ray lewis .
he has always been , and remains , an inspiring figure to me . "
political opponents are bound to question whether boris johnson was sufficiently prepared to run the capital .
did the conservative party as a whole give him sufficient guidance ?
his leadership style is one of delegation , whether this style is to continue in the same light is something the mayor will surely have to consider .
it is one of his hand-picked delegates that has caused him considerable embarrassment .
that embarrassment will spread further - the conservative party as a whole had embraced ray lewis , championing him as a solution to the problems of britain 's young people .
the party leader david cameron is amongst the senior tory politicians to have endorsed the eastside young leaders academy .
the east london institution that ray lewis founded has been widely praised for its work in helping wayward black youngsters come good .
but it 's clearly boris johnson 's city hall dream that has been dealt the biggest blow .
just nine weeks in and already two important aides , including director of political strategy james mcgrath , have been forced to quit .
in the words of that now famous political song , surely " things can only get better " .

it was on thursday that bbc london revealed that three complaints of financial irregularities had been made against ray lewis .
more details have now emerged over how mr lewis , during his time as a vicar in east london in the 1990s , was alleged to have taken control of money belonging to a parishioner with learning difficulties .
i can not allow the things going on around me to obscure the important business of this very important mayoralty , and for that reason i must step down with immediate affect ray lewis the man 's social worker was concerned enough to write to the vicar 's superior , the bishop of barking , over what he thought was happening .
city hall dismissed these particular claims as having been made by an unreliable witness .
ray lewis has again flatly denied this allegation along with the other two he is facing .
he said they were " unfounded and untrue " .
the second complaint related to a debt owed to a fellow priest , and the third concerned a sum in excess of £ 25,000 that belonged to a female parishioner .
religious ban one thing that is certain is that the complaints led the archbishop of canterbury to add the name ray lewis to the lambeth and bishopthorpe register , effectively barring him from public ministry and taking any post in the church of england .
ray lewis said on thursday that he was not aware that he had been placed on the list , and had not applied for a post in the church of england since the late 1990s .
he also denied that he was " the person painted by these allegations " , adding " i have never harassed anyone .
i have never defrauded anyone " .
boris johnson hired mr lewis to help tackle youth issues boris johnson considered these denials and the launching of an inquiry into the allegations enough to allow mr lewis to stay in his job .
that has now changed .
one reason why is the revelation that ray lewis is not , and never has been , a magistrate .
on thursday both he and the mayor said he was .
the reality was made clear in a statement to bbc london from the ministry of justice .
mr lewis says that it only matters to members of the " hair-splitters convention " whether he had been appointed or " recommended for appointment " as a justice of the peace .
he 's pledged to make documents available to back up these words .
but that hardly seems to matter now .
the former deputy mayor of london said : " i can not allow the things going on around me to obscure the important business of this very important mayoralty , and for that reason i must step down with immediate affect . "
mayor boris johnson has said : " i can not deny , however , that my confidence in ray was shaken by the discovery that he is not a fully fledged justice of the peace . "
no wrong-doing has been proven but the political pressure of the allegations against ray lewis has evidently been deemed too great for him to stay in post .
-lsb- ray lewis -rsb- has always been , and remains , an inspiring figure to me boris johnson to have lost a man so important to his vision for london after just two months will be a huge blow to mr johnson .
when you add to the equation the capital the new mayor made out of allegations against ken livingstone 's adviser lee jasper during this year 's election campaign , there is a certain irony in what has happened .
awkward questions mr johnson will surely be accused of dragging his feet in accepting the resignation .
he said : " it is with extreme reluctance and sadness that i have accepted the resignation of ray lewis .
he has always been , and remains , an inspiring figure to me . "
political opponents are bound to question whether boris johnson was sufficiently prepared to run the capital .
did the conservative party as a whole give him sufficient guidance ?
his leadership style is one of delegation , whether this style is to continue in the same light is something the mayor will surely have to consider .
it is one of his hand-picked delegates that has caused him considerable embarrassment .
that embarrassment will spread further - the conservative party as a whole had embraced ray lewis , championing him as a solution to the problems of britain 's young people .
the party leader david cameron is amongst the senior tory politicians to have endorsed the eastside young leaders academy .
the east london institution that ray lewis founded has been widely praised for its work in helping wayward black youngsters come good .
but it 's clearly boris johnson 's city hall dream that has been dealt the biggest blow .
just nine weeks in and already two important aides , including director of political strategy james mcgrath , have been forced to quit .
in the words of that now famous political song , surely " things can only get better " .

more details have now emerged over how mr lewis , during his time as a vicar in east london in the 1990s , was alleged to have taken control of money belonging to a parishioner with learning difficulties .
i can not allow the things going on around me to obscure the important business of this very important mayoralty , and for that reason i must step down with immediate affect ray lewis the man 's social worker was concerned enough to write to the vicar 's superior , the bishop of barking , over what he thought was happening .
city hall dismissed these particular claims as having been made by an unreliable witness .
ray lewis has again flatly denied this allegation along with the other two he is facing .
he said they were " unfounded and untrue " .
the second complaint related to a debt owed to a fellow priest , and the third concerned a sum in excess of £ 25,000 that belonged to a female parishioner .
religious ban one thing that is certain is that the complaints led the archbishop of canterbury to add the name ray lewis to the lambeth and bishopthorpe register , effectively barring him from public ministry and taking any post in the church of england .
ray lewis said on thursday that he was not aware that he had been placed on the list , and had not applied for a post in the church of england since the late 1990s .
he also denied that he was " the person painted by these allegations " , adding " i have never harassed anyone .
i have never defrauded anyone " .
boris johnson hired mr lewis to help tackle youth issues boris johnson considered these denials and the launching of an inquiry into the allegations enough to allow mr lewis to stay in his job .
that has now changed .
one reason why is the revelation that ray lewis is not , and never has been , a magistrate .
on thursday both he and the mayor said he was .
the reality was made clear in a statement to bbc london from the ministry of justice .
mr lewis says that it only matters to members of the " hair-splitters convention " whether he had been appointed or " recommended for appointment " as a justice of the peace .
he 's pledged to make documents available to back up these words .
but that hardly seems to matter now .
the former deputy mayor of london said : " i can not allow the things going on around me to obscure the important business of this very important mayoralty , and for that reason i must step down with immediate affect . "
mayor boris johnson has said : " i can not deny , however , that my confidence in ray was shaken by the discovery that he is not a fully fledged justice of the peace . "
no wrong-doing has been proven but the political pressure of the allegations against ray lewis has evidently been deemed too great for him to stay in post .
-lsb- ray lewis -rsb- has always been , and remains , an inspiring figure to me boris johnson to have lost a man so important to his vision for london after just two months will be a huge blow to mr johnson .
when you add to the equation the capital the new mayor made out of allegations against ken livingstone 's adviser lee jasper during this year 's election campaign , there is a certain irony in what has happened .
awkward questions mr johnson will surely be accused of dragging his feet in accepting the resignation .
he said : " it is with extreme reluctance and sadness that i have accepted the resignation of ray lewis .
he has always been , and remains , an inspiring figure to me . "
political opponents are bound to question whether boris johnson was sufficiently prepared to run the capital .
did the conservative party as a whole give him sufficient guidance ?
his leadership style is one of delegation , whether this style is to continue in the same light is something the mayor will surely have to consider .
it is one of his hand-picked delegates that has caused him considerable embarrassment .
that embarrassment will spread further - the conservative party as a whole had embraced ray lewis , championing him as a solution to the problems of britain 's young people .
the party leader david cameron is amongst the senior tory politicians to have endorsed the eastside young leaders academy .
the east london institution that ray lewis founded has been widely praised for its work in helping wayward black youngsters come good .
but it 's clearly boris johnson 's city hall dream that has been dealt the biggest blow .
just nine weeks in and already two important aides , including director of political strategy james mcgrath , have been forced to quit .
in the words of that now famous political song , surely " things can only get better " .
