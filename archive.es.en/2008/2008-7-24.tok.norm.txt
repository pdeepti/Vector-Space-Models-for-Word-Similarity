competition allows citizens and companies to identify where to base the services their taxes help provide .

decentralization is a way to prevent governments from collecting extortionate taxes only in order to dole out subsidies and create mountains of debt .
anti-regulation according to my vision , europe recognizes the challenges and opportunities afforded by the principle of subsidiarity .
europe must be able to distinguish between areas in which standardized political structures make sense , and those in which a better alternative is freedom of choice exercised by eu member countries , bodies and citizens .
there are plenty of opportunities to learn from mistakes - such as the watered-down services directive , which saw the old eu countries ' guardians of vested rights succeed in asserting protectionism over competition .

love is blind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dyed-in-the-wool european the europe of the future is a citizens ' europe .
today , europe is much closer to its citizens than they realize .
but they still do n't identify with it .
an ambivalent situation .
on the one hand europe is showered with love , with the younger generation particularly keen to describe themselves as europeans and actively contributing to its ever-evolving identity .
on the other hand , this love can be blind - because the eu , as it stands , is seen as out of touch with its citizens and mired in red tape .
this ambivalence needs to be dealt with .
for there to be a citizens ' europe , its citizens need to identify with it .
transparency , reduced red tape , better law-making , legislation with time limits and an assessment of the follow-up costs of legislation are the least that we can expect .
how can these goals be reached ?
for example , by tackling one key aspect of the eu - its financing .
a reform would create a simpler , more transparent system .
special treatments and exemptions need to be done away with - such as what 's known as the " british discount . "
a customized eu tax should not be tolerated .
so long as the eu remains a not-quite democracy , with decisions regarding the profit and loss accounting of taxpayers ' money made in parliament , the eu should not be granted tax authority .
the europe of the future needs to pursue solid , people-oriented politics which allow the public to experience a common europe first-hand .
only then will it be taking its first steps away from a technocracy and towards its citizens .
a two-speed europe europe will continue to grow - that much is clear .
the balkan countries , turkey , countries in eastern europe - they are all eyeing membership .
can the eu withstand this enlargement ?
there is a simple answer : every country should become as european as it wishes .
there is no doubt that we need to hold on to the basic principles of european success .
but partners can only work together when they want to .
a two-speed europe should be openly welcomed , so that countries deeply committed to the european project do not end up dragged down by ones that are more hesitant and less committed .
a two-speed europe already exists when dealing with the euro and various other political issues , although few will admit it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : euro-visions : debating europe 's future eu should become union of european regions , expert says europe needs better ideas , communication , expert says making the case for a multi-speed europe greens politician : turkish eu entry is in europe 's interest european union -pipe- 24.07.2008 what 's wrong with a two-speed europe , asks koch-mehrin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch-mehrin believes in strength through diversity a member of the european parliament , german politician silvana koch-mehrin would like to see a decentralized europe that puts its citizens first , she writes in an exclusive essay for dw-world.de. silvana koch-mehrin , a member of the european parliament , belongs to germany 's free market liberal party , the fdp , and heads up its european parliament group .
my vision of europe includes lasting diversity .
herein lies its potential .
diversity has characterized europe for centuries , and diversity feeds the common european identity .
it is absurd to think that europe will ever flourish if its roots are enforced equality and shared values dictated from above .
a liberal europe of the future is based on recognition of diversity , and it will continue to promote this principle .
business long ago realized that competition is healthier than monopolies , and the same principle applies to politics . decentralization encourages this competition , which needs to permeate every level of politics .
take competition among business locations .
competition allows citizens and companies to identify where to base the services their taxes help provide .
if these are to be tied to a region or a country in the long-run , their hosts need to budget well and meet their responsibilities .
decentralization is a way to prevent governments from collecting extortionate taxes only in order to dole out subsidies and create mountains of debt .
anti-regulation according to my vision , europe recognizes the challenges and opportunities afforded by the principle of subsidiarity .
europe must be able to distinguish between areas in which standardized political structures make sense , and those in which a better alternative is freedom of choice exercised by eu member countries , bodies and citizens .
there are plenty of opportunities to learn from mistakes - such as the watered-down services directive , which saw the old eu countries ' guardians of vested rights succeed in asserting protectionism over competition .
or the rise in advertising bans , which reflects a growing tendency to regulate from brussels matters that do not requite state regulation . or the anti-globalization fund , which grants " victims " of globalization european aid money .
hardly a positive approach to the many opportunities afforded by globalization .
love is blind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dyed-in-the-wool european the europe of the future is a citizens ' europe .
today , europe is much closer to its citizens than they realize .
but they still do n't identify with it .
an ambivalent situation .
on the one hand europe is showered with love , with the younger generation particularly keen to describe themselves as europeans and actively contributing to its ever-evolving identity .
on the other hand , this love can be blind - because the eu , as it stands , is seen as out of touch with its citizens and mired in red tape .
this ambivalence needs to be dealt with .
for there to be a citizens ' europe , its citizens need to identify with it .
transparency , reduced red tape , better law-making , legislation with time limits and an assessment of the follow-up costs of legislation are the least that we can expect .
how can these goals be reached ?
for example , by tackling one key aspect of the eu - its financing .
a reform would create a simpler , more transparent system .
special treatments and exemptions need to be done away with - such as what 's known as the " british discount . "
a customized eu tax should not be tolerated .
so long as the eu remains a not-quite democracy , with decisions regarding the profit and loss accounting of taxpayers ' money made in parliament , the eu should not be granted tax authority .
the europe of the future needs to pursue solid , people-oriented politics which allow the public to experience a common europe first-hand .
only then will it be taking its first steps away from a technocracy and towards its citizens .
a two-speed europe europe will continue to grow - that much is clear .
the balkan countries , turkey , countries in eastern europe - they are all eyeing membership .
can the eu withstand this enlargement ?
there is a simple answer : every country should become as european as it wishes .
there is no doubt that we need to hold on to the basic principles of european success .
but partners can only work together when they want to .
a two-speed europe should be openly welcomed , so that countries deeply committed to the european project do not end up dragged down by ones that are more hesitant and less committed .
a two-speed europe already exists when dealing with the euro and various other political issues , although few will admit it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if some countries are n't interested , they do n't have to be this reflects the old idea of a core europe of the committed .
first , second and third class europeans ?
that 's not the point .
a europe of varying speeds would have many advantages .
it would do greater justice to the individual countries ' respective stages of development as well as their respective levels of commitment .
it would be up to the individual countries to set their own pace .
every country can choose whether it wants to be an innovator or a straggler .
the sole criterion for progress must remain a desire to propel europe forward .
europe is neither old , nor old-fashioned .
europe is in its prime .

2008 former bosnian serb leader and top war crimes suspect radovan karadzic hid behind the identity of a soldier killed by a sarajevo sniper 15 years ago , serbian media reported thursday , july 24 . karadzic 's alias was part of an elaborate charade that included a long white beard , a mistress and an alternative medicine website .
it ended after 12 years on the run with his arrest monday this week in belgrade .
he had identity papers issued in the name of dragan david dabic , a bosnian serb soldier in his late 30s who was killed in the bosnian capital in 1993 during the country 's ethnic war , serbian media reported .
and karadzic allegedly stole 36 million marks from the bosnian serb region 's central bank in 1997 , when he was already undercover , a bosnian newspaper said thursday .
serbian intelligence involved ?
serb authorities are expected to turn over karadzic within days to the un war crimes tribunal in the hague , where he faces charges including genocide and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1992-95 war .
karadzic , 63 , will tell the tribunal " he is proud of everything he did and for saving serbs in bosnia , " his lawyer svetozar vujacic told the politika daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic , seen here in 1995 , underwent a complete metamorphosis during more than a dozen years in hiding in plain sight karadzic will prove that the accusations are false and that he is charged only because he is a serb , his lawyer added .
serbia 's secret service is widely believed to have helped karadzic with his undercover life .
his fake documents were issued legally in ruma , 50 kilometers north-west of belgrade , most probably with the help of bosnian serb officials , reports said .
false documents were also used by other war crimes suspects arrested in serbia .
stojan zupljanin , who was arrested on june 11 in the serbian town pancevo , had documents under the name of a man who died more than 10 years ago .
zupljanin , a former bosnian serb police commander , has been indicted by the un war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity .
in serbia , proof of citizenship , a birth certificate or an old identity card are needed to obtain identity documents .
one also needs to give a fingerprint .
karadzic was not a citizen of serbia .
karadzic stole funds , paper says a bosnian newspaper thursday quoted a 2005 a interview it conducted with milorad dodik , currently prime minister of the serb entity in bosnia , in which he claimed that karadzic in 1997 stole 36 million german marks from the region 's central bank .
" there are documents that karadzic in the spring of 1997 took 36 million marks in a bag from banja luka , " dnevni avaz quoted dodik as saying .
" he first took 28 million marks from the bank 's safe and then eight more . "
since karadzic 's arrest , dodik has offered to help karadzic 's family travel to the hague and visit him .
the family can not travel without the permission of the international representative in bosnia .
they 've asked for their documents to be returned to them so that they can visit him in belgrade jail , saying that travelling to the hague is too costly .
" after 10 years of hell , i do n't see why somebody will profit from denying us this , " said karadzic 's daughter sonja karadzic jovicevic .
two years ago , karadzic posing as dragan david dabic spent a summer holiday on the croatian adriatic island of ciovo , croatian media reported thursday .
inhabitants say karadzic visited a local church and spent 10 days on the island , the 24sata daily said . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a former film diva and the world 's largest seal hunting nation are not happy with the plan - albeit for different reasons . the eu proposal would ban seal products from the bloc 's market unless they were proven to come from animals that had been killed with " hunting techniques consistent with high animal-welfare standards " and that the animals did not suffer more than necessary . seals are hunted mainly for their pelts but also for meat and fat , which is used in beauty products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hunter clubs a seal in canada " the images of seal hunting that circulate around the globe every year are a reminder of the often gruesome practices used to kill seals , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told journalists . " european citizens find these practices repugnant and in contradiction to our standards of animal welfare , " he added . the ban still has to be approved by eu governments and the european parliament . slippery slope ? the main target country of the ban is canada , where hunters slaughtered some 275,000 seals along the atlantic coast this year .
canada accounts for nearly a third of young seals killed each year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harper is cautioning the eu against a ban canadian premier stephen harper already voiced his opposition to the plan early this month , saying that his country " will not stand by and accept measures that fly in the face of accepted international practices . " his fisheries minister , loyola hearn , on wednesday , july 23 , also warned eu officials against going down a " slippery slope . " " to bow to misinformation and emotional rhetoric in restricting the trade of humanely harvested animals would set a dangerous precedent for all wild hunts , " he said . hearn added that seals were killed humanely in canada and seal products from his country would therefore not be affected by the ban . fisheries department spokesman phil jenkins meanwhile told afp news service that the eu has " not said exactly what they will consider to be humane or inhumane , so we do n't know yet what bar we have to reach to comply . " canada , greenland and namibia account for about 60 percent of the 900,000 seals hunted each year .
seals are also hunted in iceland , norway , russia , and the united states as well as in eu members britain , finland and sweden . " a historic step " animal rights activists meanwhile welcomed the proposal .

" but bardot , who has made headlines in the past few years for supporting ultra-right politicians in france , was still happy about the plan . " a 30-year-long battle ... is about to be won , " bardot told ap news service . french president nicolas sarkozy has reportedly assured bardot that " everything would be done " during the french presidency of the european union to adopt a law banning imports of seal products in the eu . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision could let several bundesliga players off the judicial hook . " the release of players below the age of 23 has always been mandatory for all clubs , " blatter said in a statement on wednesday , july 23 .
" the same principle shall apply for beijing 2008 . " the statement added that blatter had sent an according letter to all member federations on that day . the news comes shortly after germany 's schalke 04 announced the start of proceedings to go before the court of arbitration for sport -lrb- cas -rrb- over their 22-year-old brazilian defender rafinha and comments from the european soccer association eca that clubs can not be forced to send players to the games . confusion reigned for days in the international soccer community over whether or not clubs have to release players for the august 8-24 olympics , which coincide with the league start in england and germany and pre-season activities in spain and italy . the olympic tournament is by definition an under-23 event but each team can field three over-age players , who the clubs are not required to release . an end to legal limbo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke is unhappy that rafinha , right , put the olympics before his club obligations apart from schalke , the bundesliga 's werder bremen had also said before blatter 's statement that they would look to the cas if their brazilian playmaker diego , who qualifies as an under-23 player , has to play in beijing . like schalke 's rafinha , diego traveled to beijing without his team 's authorization . elsewhere , barcelona do n't want to release star forward lionel messi to play for 2004 gold medalists argentina in beijing . barca said in a first reaction to blatter 's letter that the statement was " not satisfactory " for the club 's interest and that a board meeting had been called . the clubs argued that the men 's olympic tournament is not part of the official match calendar - though the women 's tournament is - and that they do n't have to release players . this view was shared , among others , by the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the eca , which represents europe 's clubs . " as the olympics are not included in the harmonized international match calendar , the obligation to release players for national team matches according to the fifa regulations on the status and transfer of players does not apply , " eca chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said in a statement issued earlier wednesday .
" we , therefore , support all clubs that currently face losing important players . " rummenigge also called on fifa and the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- to set up clear rules for future olympic tournaments . fifa : olympics mandatory international tournament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego was instrumental in bremen 's attack on the bundesliga crown last season but blatter said in the letter to the fifa members that the olympic tournament is " deliberately " not included in the calendar , and that this " does not mean that there is no release obligation for the relevant clubs . " in view of the importance of the men 's olympic football tournament for the entire sporting movement in general and football in particular , and given the specific nature of the event , as well as on the basis of customary law , the release of players below the age of 23 has always been mandatory for clubs .
the same principle shall apply for beijing 2008 . " it would appear to be against the spirit of the olympic regulations to hinder players under the age of 23 , who are actually the core of the squads participating in the men 's olympic football tournament , to take part in the final phase of the event . " blatter 's clarification backed up the comments of ioc president jacques rogge who told dpa news agency last week that players must be released . " the law says that if a club does n't release a player then the player will be suspended for the whole period of the games , " rogge said .
" fifa has reminded the clubs of this law .
they sent a letter a couple of days ago to remind them of that . " blatter 's confirmation was good news for the players as well , with diego for instance naming the olympics " a dream . "
it could also affect pending cases such as sv hamburg 's belgian vincent kompany . players benefit from fulfilling olympic dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina are the current olympic gold medal holders according to the german player union vdv , the clubs would even benefit from their players going to the olympics . " participating at an olympic tournament is a career highlight for every player , " the union told dpa .
" players who are not given this chance could be disappointed and that could affect their performance in the league .
releasing a player for the olympics , by contrast , could boost performance , which the clubs in the end will profit from . " teams have acknowledged that players are under huge pressure to represent their countries where the olympic event has great importance . brazil , for instance , wants olympic gold at last .
europe 's big soccer powers are not represented in beijing , with the exception of italy . promoted german bundesliga club hoffenheim bowed to this pressure when it released forward chinedu obasi to play for the 1996 olympic champions nigeria . " the pressure on obasi and his family was unbearable , " said hoffenheim general manager jan schindelmeiser .

the european union 's reliance on unanimous decision-making comes under frequent criticism for paralyzing the bloc . except for issues with military or defense implications , eu treaties allow for pioneer groups but the clause has never been used before . " enhanced cooperation is a very sensitive issue because it has never been implemented , " a french diplomat said , according to reuters news agency .
" it allows several member states to go forward faster than others , and it is not necessarily the image we want to give of the eu . " some 170,000 international marriages end in divorce in the european union each year but there are no common rules dictating which country 's laws to apply .
spouses sometimes rush to court in their country of origin to try to get the law on their side . marriage and divorce laws differ widely across the 27-nation eu , from the liberal nordic nations to catholic poland and ireland .

a former film diva and the world 's largest seal hunting nation are not happy with the plan - albeit for different reasons . the eu proposal would ban seal products from the bloc 's market unless they were proven to come from animals that had been killed with " hunting techniques consistent with high animal-welfare standards " and that the animals did not suffer more than necessary . seals are hunted mainly for their pelts but also for meat and fat , which is used in beauty products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hunter clubs a seal in canada " the images of seal hunting that circulate around the globe every year are a reminder of the often gruesome practices used to kill seals , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told journalists . " european citizens find these practices repugnant and in contradiction to our standards of animal welfare , " he added . the ban still has to be approved by eu governments and the european parliament . slippery slope ? the main target country of the ban is canada , where hunters slaughtered some 275,000 seals along the atlantic coast this year .
canada accounts for nearly a third of young seals killed each year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harper is cautioning the eu against a ban canadian premier stephen harper already voiced his opposition to the plan early this month , saying that his country " will not stand by and accept measures that fly in the face of accepted international practices . " his fisheries minister , loyola hearn , on wednesday , july 23 , also warned eu officials against going down a " slippery slope . " " to bow to misinformation and emotional rhetoric in restricting the trade of humanely harvested animals would set a dangerous precedent for all wild hunts , " he said . hearn added that seals were killed humanely in canada and seal products from his country would therefore not be affected by the ban . fisheries department spokesman phil jenkins meanwhile told afp news service that the eu has " not said exactly what they will consider to be humane or inhumane , so we do n't know yet what bar we have to reach to comply . " canada , greenland and namibia account for about 60 percent of the 900,000 seals hunted each year .
seals are also hunted in iceland , norway , russia , and the united states as well as in eu members britain , finland and sweden . " a historic step " animal rights activists meanwhile welcomed the proposal . " this announcement is a historic step forward in the campaign to end cruel commercial seal hunts , " said mark glover , head of the british arm of the humane society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bardot is generally pleased with the ban french actress-turned-animal-activist brigitte bardot , who has led a campaign against the killing of seals , regretted that " slaughters will continue as long as they are done in a humane way . " but bardot , who has made headlines in the past few years for supporting ultra-right politicians in france , was still happy about the plan . " a 30-year-long battle ... is about to be won , " bardot told ap news service . french president nicolas sarkozy has reportedly assured bardot that " everything would be done " during the french presidency of the european union to adopt a law banning imports of seal products in the eu . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do n't expect the first natural gas to arrive till 2012 , " said andreas hieckmann , the project chief at the gazprom germania company . his comment clashed with a printed news release from nord stream , a consortium with russian , german and dutch involvement , which stated that 2011 was the target for the first flow . he was speaking in waren , north of berlin , where gazprom is studying the suitability of a bed of deep rock to store the gas in after it lands . nord stream said it aimed to complete a multinational environmental review of the undersea route by the end of this year . unfair advantage ? sweden has echoed environmentalists who fear the seabed trench for the pipes may kill sea life and stir up toxic material .
poland has led strategic criticism , saying russia may gain a massive advantage by piping the gas outside the borders of intermediate nations . hieckmann said he expected delays because dumped wartime ammunition would have to be recovered from the baltic seabed before the pipeline is laid and because of the " political friction " in the permissions process . " even if the regulatory procedures go according to plan , it will be a complex construction job , " he said . when complete , the line will transport 27.5 billion cubic meters -lrb- 971 million cubic feet -rrb- of gas annually to western europe .

2008 former bosnian serb leader and top war crimes suspect radovan karadzic hid behind the identity of a soldier killed by a sarajevo sniper 15 years ago , serbian media reported thursday , july 24 . karadzic 's alias was part of an elaborate charade that included a long white beard , a mistress and an alternative medicine website .
it ended after 12 years on the run with his arrest monday this week in belgrade .
he had identity papers issued in the name of dragan david dabic , a bosnian serb soldier in his late 30s who was killed in the bosnian capital in 1993 during the country 's ethnic war , serbian media reported .
and karadzic allegedly stole 36 million marks from the bosnian serb region 's central bank in 1997 , when he was already undercover , a bosnian newspaper said thursday .
serbian intelligence involved ?
serb authorities are expected to turn over karadzic within days to the un war crimes tribunal in the hague , where he faces charges including genocide and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1992-95 war .
karadzic , 63 , will tell the tribunal " he is proud of everything he did and for saving serbs in bosnia , " his lawyer svetozar vujacic told the politika daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic , seen here in 1995 , underwent a complete metamorphosis during more than a dozen years in hiding in plain sight karadzic will prove that the accusations are false and that he is charged only because he is a serb , his lawyer added .
serbia 's secret service is widely believed to have helped karadzic with his undercover life .
his fake documents were issued legally in ruma , 50 kilometers north-west of belgrade , most probably with the help of bosnian serb officials , reports said .
false documents were also used by other war crimes suspects arrested in serbia .
stojan zupljanin , who was arrested on june 11 in the serbian town pancevo , had documents under the name of a man who died more than 10 years ago .
zupljanin , a former bosnian serb police commander , has been indicted by the un war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity .
in serbia , proof of citizenship , a birth certificate or an old identity card are needed to obtain identity documents .

karadzic was not a citizen of serbia .
karadzic stole funds , paper says a bosnian newspaper thursday quoted a 2005 a interview it conducted with milorad dodik , currently prime minister of the serb entity in bosnia , in which he claimed that karadzic in 1997 stole 36 million german marks from the region 's central bank .
" there are documents that karadzic in the spring of 1997 took 36 million marks in a bag from banja luka , " dnevni avaz quoted dodik as saying .
" he first took 28 million marks from the bank 's safe and then eight more . "
since karadzic 's arrest , dodik has offered to help karadzic 's family travel to the hague and visit him .
the family can not travel without the permission of the international representative in bosnia .
they 've asked for their documents to be returned to them so that they can visit him in belgrade jail , saying that travelling to the hague is too costly .
" after 10 years of hell , i do n't see why somebody will profit from denying us this , " said karadzic 's daughter sonja karadzic jovicevic .
two years ago , karadzic posing as dragan david dabic spent a summer holiday on the croatian adriatic island of ciovo , croatian media reported thursday .
inhabitants say karadzic visited a local church and spent 10 days on the island , the 24sata daily said . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" they were presidents , i am a citizen , " he told reporters travelling with him .
" there is no doubt that part of what i want to communicate on both sides of the atlantic is the enormous potential of us restoring a sense of coming together . " the 46-year-old presumptive democratic candidate said he wanted the united states and europe to rediscover their common ground . " obviously berlin is representative of the extraordinary success of the post world war ii effort to bring the continent together and to bring the west together , and later to bring the east and the west together , " he said .
" so i think it is a natural place to talk . " obama 's 45-minute address on trans-atlantic relations is expected to pull in tens of thousands . " hopefully -lsb- the speech -rsb- will be viewed as a substantive articulation of the relationship i 'd like to see between the united states and europe , " obama told reporters in israel shortly before leaving for germany .
" i 'm hoping to communicate across the atlantic the value of that relationship and how we need to build on it . " preparations for obama 's speech were marred after a 40-year man driving a car breached the cordoned off zone where the us presidential candidate is to speak and sprayed red paint around the area . bildunterschrift : police cordoned off the car after the paint attack the man from the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg is now in police custody , pending an investigation . earlier , a suspicious package at the swanky adlon hotel , which is close to both the us embassy and berlin 's historic brandenburg gate , triggered a security scare .
the hotel 's lobby was cleared briefly before the package was examined by explosives experts and declared that it did not represent any threat . election campaigning while berlin was in obama fever ahead of the visit , political commentators stressed that the main aim of the visit was to boost the senator 's fortunes in the us presidential race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's advance team was worried anti-american signs could sour us opinion of the speech in his speech , obama was expected to seek to revive trans-atlantic relations that suffered considerable damage under president george w. bush . europeans are looking to the illinois senator to restore a transatlantic relationship that has been strained , in particular , by president bush 's invasion of iraq . european leaders strongly support obama 's foreign policy goals including closing the guantanamo bay prison camp for terror suspects , fighting nuclear proliferation and tackling climate change with an eu-style emissions cap-and-trade plan . obama 's calls for talking directly to iran over its nuclear program and renewing us engagement in the middle east peace process have also received a warm welcome in european capitals . commentators were watching closely to discern calls for greater european contributions in afghanistan and to hear the senator 's views on pressing iran to abandon its uranium enrichment program . obama is overwhelmingly more popular in europe than his republican adversary , john mccain .
a recent poll put his german support at 76 percent . following his round of engagements in berlin , obama is to visit friday the us ramstein air force base and the us military hospital in landstuhl , which are both in the western part of germany . the presumed us democrat presidential candidate will then travel on to france .
before arriving in germany , obama visited israel , the palestinian territories , kuwait , afghanistan , iraq and jordan . no german troop changes in afghanistan asked about obama 's recent comments that he would press european nato partners for more troops for afghanistan , merkel said wednesday that germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to increase troop commitments in afghanistan " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission , " she told reporters .
" we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president , " merkel added . germany has faced growing pressure to increase the number of troops it has deployed in afghanistan and to move troops from the relatively calm north of the country to the south where us-led forces are battling tenacious taliban insurgents . in response to the calls from the united states and other nato members , berlin announced plans in june to boost its contingent in northern afghanistan later this year by up to 1,000 soldiers to a maximum of 4,500 troops . the mission , however , is extremely unpopular among germans and any move to expand the deployment further would likely provoke a voter backlash ahead of general elections slated for 2009 . us policy continuity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties to the us improved slightly after merkel took over in the chancellery merkel , who has met mccain on several occasions , said she was keen to sit down with his challenger .
she said she was impressed by the grassroots enthusiasm obama managed to spark during his " bold " and extended democratic primary campaign . " from the way he triumphed in the primaries in america , i would say he is a man of many strengths - physical , mental and political , " she said . merkel said she was particularly interested in discussing trans-atlantic political and economic ties with obama , nato , climate change and the doha trade round . but she said she expected broad continuity in the us stance toward europe regardless of whether obama or mccain won in november . " in general the impact of differences on domestic policy is larger than those on foreign policy , " she said .

" something had to happen with the state banks and the crisis sped up that process , " he said , adding that there is a growing tendency among private banks to consolidate .

" allianz never got dresdner bank under control , " said dieter hein , a bank analyst at fairesearch , adding that the combination of an insurance company and bank has seldom proven profitable .
" a new concept needs to be put in place and that is definitely better to implement with a different bank .

" they were presidents , i am a citizen , " he told reporters travelling with him .
" there is no doubt that part of what i want to communicate on both sides of the atlantic is the enormous potential of us restoring a sense of coming together . " the 46-year-old presumptive democratic candidate said he wanted the united states and europe to rediscover their common ground . " obviously berlin is representative of the extraordinary success of the post world war ii effort to bring the continent together and to bring the west together , and later to bring the east and the west together , " he said .
" so i think it is a natural place to talk . " obama 's 45-minute address on trans-atlantic relations is expected to pull in tens of thousands . " hopefully -lsb- the speech -rsb- will be viewed as a substantive articulation of the relationship i 'd like to see between the united states and europe , " obama told reporters in israel shortly before leaving for germany .
" i 'm hoping to communicate across the atlantic the value of that relationship and how we need to build on it . " preparations for obama 's speech were marred after a 40-year man driving a car breached the cordoned off zone where the us presidential candidate is to speak and sprayed red paint around the area . bildunterschrift : police cordoned off the car after the paint attack the man from the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg is now in police custody , pending an investigation . earlier , a suspicious package at the swanky adlon hotel , which is close to both the us embassy and berlin 's historic brandenburg gate , triggered a security scare .
the hotel 's lobby was cleared briefly before the package was examined by explosives experts and declared that it did not represent any threat . election campaigning while berlin was in obama fever ahead of the visit , political commentators stressed that the main aim of the visit was to boost the senator 's fortunes in the us presidential race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's advance team was worried anti-american signs could sour us opinion of the speech in his speech , obama was expected to seek to revive trans-atlantic relations that suffered considerable damage under president george w. bush . europeans are looking to the illinois senator to restore a transatlantic relationship that has been strained , in particular , by president bush 's invasion of iraq . european leaders strongly support obama 's foreign policy goals including closing the guantanamo bay prison camp for terror suspects , fighting nuclear proliferation and tackling climate change with an eu-style emissions cap-and-trade plan . obama 's calls for talking directly to iran over its nuclear program and renewing us engagement in the middle east peace process have also received a warm welcome in european capitals . commentators were watching closely to discern calls for greater european contributions in afghanistan and to hear the senator 's views on pressing iran to abandon its uranium enrichment program . obama is overwhelmingly more popular in europe than his republican adversary , john mccain .
a recent poll put his german support at 76 percent . following his round of engagements in berlin , obama is to visit friday the us ramstein air force base and the us military hospital in landstuhl , which are both in the western part of germany . the presumed us democrat presidential candidate will then travel on to france .
before arriving in germany , obama visited israel , the palestinian territories , kuwait , afghanistan , iraq and jordan . no german troop changes in afghanistan asked about obama 's recent comments that he would press european nato partners for more troops for afghanistan , merkel said wednesday that germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to increase troop commitments in afghanistan " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission , " she told reporters .
" we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president , " merkel added . germany has faced growing pressure to increase the number of troops it has deployed in afghanistan and to move troops from the relatively calm north of the country to the south where us-led forces are battling tenacious taliban insurgents . in response to the calls from the united states and other nato members , berlin announced plans in june to boost its contingent in northern afghanistan later this year by up to 1,000 soldiers to a maximum of 4,500 troops . the mission , however , is extremely unpopular among germans and any move to expand the deployment further would likely provoke a voter backlash ahead of general elections slated for 2009 . us policy continuity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties to the us improved slightly after merkel took over in the chancellery merkel , who has met mccain on several occasions , said she was keen to sit down with his challenger .
she said she was impressed by the grassroots enthusiasm obama managed to spark during his " bold " and extended democratic primary campaign . " from the way he triumphed in the primaries in america , i would say he is a man of many strengths - physical , mental and political , " she said . merkel said she was particularly interested in discussing trans-atlantic political and economic ties with obama , nato , climate change and the doha trade round . but she said she expected broad continuity in the us stance toward europe regardless of whether obama or mccain won in november . " in general the impact of differences on domestic policy is larger than those on foreign policy , " she said .

" and if they did , i think , we should stand strong and indicate that that is something that crosses a threshold , crosses a red line for the united states . " just a thought ? an unnamed russian officer meanwhile told russian newspaper izvestiya that the cuban proposal was just an initial thought . " but that does n't mean there is n't something concrete behind it , " he added . bildunterschrift : russian radar stations are n't exactly a pretty sight the white house refused to directly comment on the report because the russian government has not publicly stated its intentions .
but spokesman dana perino reiterated the view that the stationing of missile defenses in poland and the czech republic does not threaten russia . the united states is working on agreements with the two countries to counter iran 's growing ballistic capability . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a statement issued by france , which currently holds the eu presidency , on thursday , july 24 , reminded tehran it had pledged to introduce a moratorium on stoning and urged it to abide by its commitments and international standards .
" the european union calls on the iranian government and parliament to abolish , in law and in practice , recourse to cruel and degrading punishment and , in particular the use of stoning , as a method of execution , " the statement read .
news reports say the eight women , ranging in age from 27 to 43 , had convictions including prostitution , incest and adultery .
the man , a 50-year-old music teacher , was convicted of illegal sex with a student .
the last officially reported stoning in the islamic republic was carried out on a man a year ago which sparked criticism from rights groups , the european union and a top un official .
iran 's judiciary chief ayatollah mohmoud hashemi-shahroudi ordered a moratorium on stoning in 2002 .
iran , saudi arabia world leaders in executions the eu 's concerns over the death by stoning sentences in iran coincided with the release of a new report by a rome-based anti-death penalty group .
it showed that though a global trend towards abolition of the death penalty continued in 2007 with the number of countries practicing capital punishment dropping to 49 from 51 in the previous year , the number of executions worldwide increased .
the group , called hands off cain , presented its findings in the 2008 edition of its annual report , which covers the first six months of the year and 2007 .
at least 5,851 executions were carried out in 2007 up from the 5,635 registered in 2006 and 5,494 in 2005 , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these two chinese men were executed on drug-related charges in 1996 the surge was " in large part " due to the increased number of executions in iran , up by one-third , and saudi arabia where the number of people executed quadrupled , it said .
china put to death at least 5,000 people , accounting for 85.4 percent of the world total .
iran , which executed at least 355 people , and saudi arabia 166 , filled the other top three places of what the report called the " terrible podium " of capital-punishment practicing countries .
most executions in asia ; us to blame too other countries where the number of people executed numbered more than 10 included pakistan , with at least 134 , the united states where 42 people were put to death , iraq with at least 33 , vietnam with at least 25 , yemen and afghanistan , both with at least 15 , and north korea with at least 13 .
the report noted how the " prevalent situation worldwide " including china , vietnam , belarus and mongolia , was for governments to conceal the number of executions , making it difficult to provide exact figures .
" it points to the fact that the fight against the death penalty entails , beyond the stopping of executions , a battle for democracy , for the respect of the rule of law and for political rights and civil liberties , " the report said .
asia remained the region where the vast majority of executions are carried out , while the americas " would be practically death-penalty free were it not for the united states , the only country on the continent to execute anyone in 2007 , " the report noted .
in africa , the death penalty was carried out in seven countries - botswana -lrb- at least one -rrb- , egypt -lrb- actual number unknown -rrb- , ethiopia -lrb- one -rrb- , equatorial new guinea -lrb- three -rrb- , libya -lrb- at least nine -rrb- , somalia -lrb- at least five -rrb- and sudan -lrb- at least seven -rrb- .
in 2007 and in the first six months of 2008 nine countries moved from retention to a form of abolition of the death penalty .
rwanda went from retentionist to abolitionist in july of 2007 with a law that abolished the death penalty for all crimes , while kyrgyzstan abolished the death penalty in january 2007 , after years of moratorium .
uzbekistan went from retentionist to abolitionist on january 1 , 2008.these moves were partly offset by the resumption of executions in afghanistan and ethiopia after several years of suspension , the report said .
belarus a blemish on europe " in europe , the only blemish on an otherwise completely death penalty-free zone continues to be belarus , where at least one person was executed in 2007 and three in the first five months of 2008 , " the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has led a campaign to abolish capital punishment worldwide hands off cain hailed the december 2007 adoption by the united nations general assembly of a resolution that calls upon all member states that still maintain the death penalty to establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing them .

2008 former bosnian serb leader and top war crimes suspect radovan karadzic hid behind the identity of a soldier killed by a sarajevo sniper 15 years ago , serbian media reported thursday , july 24 . karadzic 's alias was part of an elaborate charade that included a long white beard , a mistress and an alternative medicine website .
it ended after 12 years on the run with his arrest monday this week in belgrade .
he had identity papers issued in the name of dragan david dabic , a bosnian serb soldier in his late 30s who was killed in the bosnian capital in 1993 during the country 's ethnic war , serbian media reported .
and karadzic allegedly stole 36 million marks from the bosnian serb region 's central bank in 1997 , when he was already undercover , a bosnian newspaper said thursday .
serbian intelligence involved ?
serb authorities are expected to turn over karadzic within days to the un war crimes tribunal in the hague , where he faces charges including genocide and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1992-95 war .
karadzic , 63 , will tell the tribunal " he is proud of everything he did and for saving serbs in bosnia , " his lawyer svetozar vujacic told the politika daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic , seen here in 1995 , underwent a complete metamorphosis during more than a dozen years in hiding in plain sight karadzic will prove that the accusations are false and that he is charged only because he is a serb , his lawyer added .
serbia 's secret service is widely believed to have helped karadzic with his undercover life .
his fake documents were issued legally in ruma , 50 kilometers north-west of belgrade , most probably with the help of bosnian serb officials , reports said .
false documents were also used by other war crimes suspects arrested in serbia .
stojan zupljanin , who was arrested on june 11 in the serbian town pancevo , had documents under the name of a man who died more than 10 years ago .
zupljanin , a former bosnian serb police commander , has been indicted by the un war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity .
in serbia , proof of citizenship , a birth certificate or an old identity card are needed to obtain identity documents .
one also needs to give a fingerprint .
karadzic was not a citizen of serbia .
karadzic stole funds , paper says a bosnian newspaper thursday quoted a 2005 a interview it conducted with milorad dodik , currently prime minister of the serb entity in bosnia , in which he claimed that karadzic in 1997 stole 36 million german marks from the region 's central bank .
" there are documents that karadzic in the spring of 1997 took 36 million marks in a bag from banja luka , " dnevni avaz quoted dodik as saying .
" he first took 28 million marks from the bank 's safe and then eight more . "
since karadzic 's arrest , dodik has offered to help karadzic 's family travel to the hague and visit him .
the family can not travel without the permission of the international representative in bosnia .
they 've asked for their documents to be returned to them so that they can visit him in belgrade jail , saying that travelling to the hague is too costly .
" after 10 years of hell , i do n't see why somebody will profit from denying us this , " said karadzic 's daughter sonja karadzic jovicevic .
two years ago , karadzic posing as dragan david dabic spent a summer holiday on the croatian adriatic island of ciovo , croatian media reported thursday .
inhabitants say karadzic visited a local church and spent 10 days on the island , the 24sata daily said . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a statement issued by france , which currently holds the eu presidency , on thursday , july 24 , reminded tehran it had pledged to introduce a moratorium on stoning and urged it to abide by its commitments and international standards .
" the european union calls on the iranian government and parliament to abolish , in law and in practice , recourse to cruel and degrading punishment and , in particular the use of stoning , as a method of execution , " the statement read .
news reports say the eight women , ranging in age from 27 to 43 , had convictions including prostitution , incest and adultery .
the man , a 50-year-old music teacher , was convicted of illegal sex with a student .
the last officially reported stoning in the islamic republic was carried out on a man a year ago which sparked criticism from rights groups , the european union and a top un official .
iran 's judiciary chief ayatollah mohmoud hashemi-shahroudi ordered a moratorium on stoning in 2002 .
iran , saudi arabia world leaders in executions the eu 's concerns over the death by stoning sentences in iran coincided with the release of a new report by a rome-based anti-death penalty group .
it showed that though a global trend towards abolition of the death penalty continued in 2007 with the number of countries practicing capital punishment dropping to 49 from 51 in the previous year , the number of executions worldwide increased .
the group , called hands off cain , presented its findings in the 2008 edition of its annual report , which covers the first six months of the year and 2007 .
at least 5,851 executions were carried out in 2007 up from the 5,635 registered in 2006 and 5,494 in 2005 , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these two chinese men were executed on drug-related charges in 1996 the surge was " in large part " due to the increased number of executions in iran , up by one-third , and saudi arabia where the number of people executed quadrupled , it said .
china put to death at least 5,000 people , accounting for 85.4 percent of the world total .
iran , which executed at least 355 people , and saudi arabia 166 , filled the other top three places of what the report called the " terrible podium " of capital-punishment practicing countries .
most executions in asia ; us to blame too other countries where the number of people executed numbered more than 10 included pakistan , with at least 134 , the united states where 42 people were put to death , iraq with at least 33 , vietnam with at least 25 , yemen and afghanistan , both with at least 15 , and north korea with at least 13 .
the report noted how the " prevalent situation worldwide " including china , vietnam , belarus and mongolia , was for governments to conceal the number of executions , making it difficult to provide exact figures .
" it points to the fact that the fight against the death penalty entails , beyond the stopping of executions , a battle for democracy , for the respect of the rule of law and for political rights and civil liberties , " the report said .
asia remained the region where the vast majority of executions are carried out , while the americas " would be practically death-penalty free were it not for the united states , the only country on the continent to execute anyone in 2007 , " the report noted .
in africa , the death penalty was carried out in seven countries - botswana -lrb- at least one -rrb- , egypt -lrb- actual number unknown -rrb- , ethiopia -lrb- one -rrb- , equatorial new guinea -lrb- three -rrb- , libya -lrb- at least nine -rrb- , somalia -lrb- at least five -rrb- and sudan -lrb- at least seven -rrb- .
in 2007 and in the first six months of 2008 nine countries moved from retention to a form of abolition of the death penalty .
rwanda went from retentionist to abolitionist in july of 2007 with a law that abolished the death penalty for all crimes , while kyrgyzstan abolished the death penalty in january 2007 , after years of moratorium .
uzbekistan went from retentionist to abolitionist on january 1 , 2008.these moves were partly offset by the resumption of executions in afghanistan and ethiopia after several years of suspension , the report said .
belarus a blemish on europe " in europe , the only blemish on an otherwise completely death penalty-free zone continues to be belarus , where at least one person was executed in 2007 and three in the first five months of 2008 , " the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has led a campaign to abolish capital punishment worldwide hands off cain hailed the december 2007 adoption by the united nations general assembly of a resolution that calls upon all member states that still maintain the death penalty to establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing them .
the group announced it had bestowed its " abolitionist of the year 2008 " award on former italian prime minister romano prodi , who during his time in office led a campaign to bring the resolution before the un general assembly . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but the burdens of global citizenship bind us together , " he said , speaking under the central berlin landmark of the victory column facing towards the brandenburg gate . partnership among nations was not a choice but the only way to protect the security of europe and the us , the democratic party presidential hopeful said . obama challenged a new generation of americans and europeans to tear down walls between estranged allies , races , and faiths in his soaring call for global unity . " that is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another , " he said in reference to the berlin wall that divided the city from 1961 to 1989 . " partnerhip is not a choice but a means of survival " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama spoke of partnerships between nations in a speech that risked being seen as presumptuous , considering obama will not even face us voters for another three months , he warned of a world where partnership was not a choice but the only means of survival . " no one nation , no matter how large or powerful , can defeat such challenges alone , " he said , signaling that , if elected president , he would end what many europeans see as the unilateral foreign policy approach of president george w bush . obama also made clear he would not take the us into isolation . " that is why america can not turn inward .
that is why europe can not turn inward , " he said . crowds respond to barack ' n ' roll a party atmosphere gripped the crowds around the victory column monument as people listened to the man many hoped would replace george w bush as leader of the world 's most powerful nation . a roar went up from the multi-ethnic crowd when obama strolled confidently onto the stage to talk of the us-german partnership and the need to strengthen transatlantic relations to meet the challenges of the 21st century . bildunterschrift : supporters had more than the white house in mind around 100,000 lined the boulevard linking the victory column to the brandenburg gate , where obama had originally intended to speak but later dropped the plan after merkel signaled her disapproval at the site being used for foreign election campaign speeches . many of those present queued patiently for over an hour outside 20 airport-style security gates where they were required to empty their pockets and dispense with drinks containers . once inside they were able to refresh themselves with plastic mugs of german beer and snacks as a pop band livened up the audience on a warm mid-summer evening . no banners or placards were allowed on the strip guarded by around 1,000 police and other security officers as the obama team sought to ensure that no unwelcome slogans were aired on us television . but democrats inside distributed us flags to their supporters and a green poster was held aloft by an obama fan with the words " i love barack ' n ' roll . " outside the entrance gates to the security zone , us democrats wearing obama ' 08 buttons launched a recruitment drive , yelling out " us citizens register to vote . " obama talks of breaking down global walls the strikingly audacious speech , in a fevered atmosphere in berlin 's famed tiergarten , took the white house race out of us borders in a way never seen before , and was designed to portray obama as a leader with unique global appeal . bildunterschrift : the huge crowd responded to obama 's calls for unity " the walls between old allies on either side of the atlantic can not stand , " he said , referring to festering divisions between europe and the united states opened up by the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . " the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least can not stand , " said obama , in an address beamed live on us and german television channels and to viewers around the world . " the walls between races and tribes ; natives and immigrants ; christian and muslim and jew can not stand .
these now are the walls we must tear down , " obama said , drawing cheers and applause . obama 's speech was a clear echo of former us president ronald reagan 's call to then soviet leader mikhael gorbachev in berlin in 1987 to " tear down this wall , " before the fall of communism . full of passion , short of specifics despite its soaring cadences however , the speech was short on specifics .
obama 's aides said he would not talk policy as that is the job of a president but his critics will likely slam him for empty rhetoric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands stood listening in the balmy berlin evening the illinois senator rebuked both his country and europe for blaming one another for strains in their relations , but took pains to insulate himself from critics back home who doubt his patriotism .
" i also know how much i love america .
i know that for more than two centuries , we have strived , at great cost and great sacrifice , to form a more perfect union ; to seek , with other nations , a more hopeful world , " he said . " in europe , the view that america is part of what has gone wrong in our world , rather than a force to help make it right , has become all too common , " the 46-year-old first term senator said . " in america , there are voices that deride and deny the importance of europe 's role in our security and our future .
both views miss the truth . " obama , who has a narrow lead in most polls of the us race , but trails mccain when voters are asked who would be the most credible commander in chief , used berlin 's triumph over division and totalitarianism as a metaphor for the world he hoped to forge . " people of the world - look at berlin , where a wall came down , a continent came together , and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one , " obama said . he also promised america under his watch would be serious about tackling global warning , a huge concern in europe and a cause of rifts between the continent and the united states during the bush administration . europe needs to do its part , obama urges but he also signaled he would demand europe live up to its side of the bargain , asking for more help in the struggle against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan . " america can not do this alone , " obama said .
" the afghan people need our troops and your troops ; our support and your support to defeat the taliban and al-qaeda , to develop their economy , and to help them rebuild their nation . " we have too much at stake to turn back now . " obama is vowing to pour at least two more combat brigades into afghanistan , which is currently being pummeled by a rise in extremist violence and attacks , if he is elected president - with some troops to be redeployed from iraq . his aides have said that he believes nato nations should provide more troops for the conflict , and remove operating restrictions on forces that are already there . in an interview with cbs news on monday during his first-ever trip to the war-torn nation , obama warned conditions were " precarious and urgent " and also called on the afghan government to do more to stabilize the country . merkel resists obama pressure over troops bildunterschrift : merkel was firm on troops during the cordial meeting before giving his speech , obama on thursday met german chancellor angela merkel , who signaled clearly a day before that she would resist any pressure to send more troops to afghanistan . merkel said germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission .
we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- , " she said . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president . " an apparently worsening security situation in afghanistan has seen troop deaths there exceed those in iraq for the second month in a row . forty-nine soldiers from the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and the separate us-led coalition died in combat , attacks or accidents in june , according to an afp tally based on military statements . by contrast , 31 soldiers including 29 americans , were killed in iraq in june despite the fact that there are more than twice as many troops there as in afghanistan , icasualties.org figures showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a statement issued by france , which currently holds the eu presidency , on thursday , july 24 , reminded tehran it had pledged to introduce a moratorium on stoning and urged it to abide by its commitments and international standards .
" the european union calls on the iranian government and parliament to abolish , in law and in practice , recourse to cruel and degrading punishment and , in particular the use of stoning , as a method of execution , " the statement read .
news reports say the eight women , ranging in age from 27 to 43 , had convictions including prostitution , incest and adultery .
the man , a 50-year-old music teacher , was convicted of illegal sex with a student .
the last officially reported stoning in the islamic republic was carried out on a man a year ago which sparked criticism from rights groups , the european union and a top un official .
iran 's judiciary chief ayatollah mohmoud hashemi-shahroudi ordered a moratorium on stoning in 2002 .
iran , saudi arabia world leaders in executions the eu 's concerns over the death by stoning sentences in iran coincided with the release of a new report by a rome-based anti-death penalty group .
it showed that though a global trend towards abolition of the death penalty continued in 2007 with the number of countries practicing capital punishment dropping to 49 from 51 in the previous year , the number of executions worldwide increased .
the group , called hands off cain , presented its findings in the 2008 edition of its annual report , which covers the first six months of the year and 2007 .
at least 5,851 executions were carried out in 2007 up from the 5,635 registered in 2006 and 5,494 in 2005 , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these two chinese men were executed on drug-related charges in 1996 the surge was " in large part " due to the increased number of executions in iran , up by one-third , and saudi arabia where the number of people executed quadrupled , it said .
china put to death at least 5,000 people , accounting for 85.4 percent of the world total .
iran , which executed at least 355 people , and saudi arabia 166 , filled the other top three places of what the report called the " terrible podium " of capital-punishment practicing countries .
most executions in asia ; us to blame too other countries where the number of people executed numbered more than 10 included pakistan , with at least 134 , the united states where 42 people were put to death , iraq with at least 33 , vietnam with at least 25 , yemen and afghanistan , both with at least 15 , and north korea with at least 13 .
the report noted how the " prevalent situation worldwide " including china , vietnam , belarus and mongolia , was for governments to conceal the number of executions , making it difficult to provide exact figures .
" it points to the fact that the fight against the death penalty entails , beyond the stopping of executions , a battle for democracy , for the respect of the rule of law and for political rights and civil liberties , " the report said .
asia remained the region where the vast majority of executions are carried out , while the americas " would be practically death-penalty free were it not for the united states , the only country on the continent to execute anyone in 2007 , " the report noted .
in africa , the death penalty was carried out in seven countries - botswana -lrb- at least one -rrb- , egypt -lrb- actual number unknown -rrb- , ethiopia -lrb- one -rrb- , equatorial new guinea -lrb- three -rrb- , libya -lrb- at least nine -rrb- , somalia -lrb- at least five -rrb- and sudan -lrb- at least seven -rrb- .
in 2007 and in the first six months of 2008 nine countries moved from retention to a form of abolition of the death penalty .
rwanda went from retentionist to abolitionist in july of 2007 with a law that abolished the death penalty for all crimes , while kyrgyzstan abolished the death penalty in january 2007 , after years of moratorium .
uzbekistan went from retentionist to abolitionist on january 1 , 2008.these moves were partly offset by the resumption of executions in afghanistan and ethiopia after several years of suspension , the report said .
belarus a blemish on europe " in europe , the only blemish on an otherwise completely death penalty-free zone continues to be belarus , where at least one person was executed in 2007 and three in the first five months of 2008 , " the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has led a campaign to abolish capital punishment worldwide hands off cain hailed the december 2007 adoption by the united nations general assembly of a resolution that calls upon all member states that still maintain the death penalty to establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing them .
the group announced it had bestowed its " abolitionist of the year 2008 " award on former italian prime minister romano prodi , who during his time in office led a campaign to bring the resolution before the un general assembly . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am confident we will implement the lisbon treaty , " merkel said before going on summer vacation . the treaty of lisbon , signed at the end of last year and currently undergoing ratification by the individual members , was necessary not only if the eu was to expand , but also to enhance democracy within the bloc and to make it more effective , merkel said . the irish rejection of the lisbon treaty has left the bloc searching for a new way to move forward as the treaty must be unanimously ratified in order to go into effect . merkel was one of the driving forces behind the new treaty under germany 's eu presidency in the first half of last year . the treaty faces obstacles in germany , poland and the czech republic . german president horst koehler has said he will await a decision by the constitutional court on the treaty 's compatibility with the german constitution before signing into law the necessary legislation , which has been passed by both houses of parliament . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu family law requires unanimous support in order to be enacted . provided that the european commission accepts the divorce initiative , it then has to be approved by a qualified majority of the bloc 's 27 member states . small factions lead the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu politicians are considering how to proceed after the irish rejected the lisbon treaty enhanced cooperation is regarded as one of the ways the eu can stem off paralysis across the bloc , which may increasingly come into play if it fails to quickly overcome ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty . that treaty , which also requires unanimous ratification to go into effect , would have simplified voting procedures in addition to changing the eu 's approach to foreign policy .
the european union 's reliance on unanimous decision-making comes under frequent criticism for paralyzing the bloc . except for issues with military or defense implications , eu treaties allow for pioneer groups but the clause has never been used before . " enhanced cooperation is a very sensitive issue because it has never been implemented , " a french diplomat said , according to reuters news agency .
" it allows several member states to go forward faster than others , and it is not necessarily the image we want to give of the eu . " some 170,000 international marriages end in divorce in the european union each year but there are no common rules dictating which country 's laws to apply .
spouses sometimes rush to court in their country of origin to try to get the law on their side . marriage and divorce laws differ widely across the 27-nation eu , from the liberal nordic nations to catholic poland and ireland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 24.07.2008 eu proposes partial ban on seal products großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials have n't clearly defined ' humane ' killing the european commission has proposed banning products made from seals killed in inhumane ways .
a former film diva and the world 's largest seal hunting nation are not happy with the plan - albeit for different reasons . the eu proposal would ban seal products from the bloc 's market unless they were proven to come from animals that had been killed with " hunting techniques consistent with high animal-welfare standards " and that the animals did not suffer more than necessary . seals are hunted mainly for their pelts but also for meat and fat , which is used in beauty products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hunter clubs a seal in canada " the images of seal hunting that circulate around the globe every year are a reminder of the often gruesome practices used to kill seals , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told journalists . " european citizens find these practices repugnant and in contradiction to our standards of animal welfare , " he added . the ban still has to be approved by eu governments and the european parliament . slippery slope ? the main target country of the ban is canada , where hunters slaughtered some 275,000 seals along the atlantic coast this year .
canada accounts for nearly a third of young seals killed each year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harper is cautioning the eu against a ban canadian premier stephen harper already voiced his opposition to the plan early this month , saying that his country " will not stand by and accept measures that fly in the face of accepted international practices . " his fisheries minister , loyola hearn , on wednesday , july 23 , also warned eu officials against going down a " slippery slope . " " to bow to misinformation and emotional rhetoric in restricting the trade of humanely harvested animals would set a dangerous precedent for all wild hunts , " he said . hearn added that seals were killed humanely in canada and seal products from his country would therefore not be affected by the ban . fisheries department spokesman phil jenkins meanwhile told afp news service that the eu has " not said exactly what they will consider to be humane or inhumane , so we do n't know yet what bar we have to reach to comply . " canada , greenland and namibia account for about 60 percent of the 900,000 seals hunted each year .
seals are also hunted in iceland , norway , russia , and the united states as well as in eu members britain , finland and sweden . " a historic step " animal rights activists meanwhile welcomed the proposal . " this announcement is a historic step forward in the campaign to end cruel commercial seal hunts , " said mark glover , head of the british arm of the humane society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bardot is generally pleased with the ban french actress-turned-animal-activist brigitte bardot , who has led a campaign against the killing of seals , regretted that " slaughters will continue as long as they are done in a humane way . " but bardot , who has made headlines in the past few years for supporting ultra-right politicians in france , was still happy about the plan . " a 30-year-long battle ... is about to be won , " bardot told ap news service . french president nicolas sarkozy has reportedly assured bardot that " everything would be done " during the french presidency of the european union to adopt a law banning imports of seal products in the eu . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but the burdens of global citizenship bind us together , " he said , speaking under the central berlin landmark of the victory column facing towards the brandenburg gate . partnership among nations was not a choice but the only way to protect the security of europe and the us , the democratic party presidential hopeful said . obama challenged a new generation of americans and europeans to tear down walls between estranged allies , races , and faiths in his soaring call for global unity . " that is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another , " he said in reference to the berlin wall that divided the city from 1961 to 1989 . " partnerhip is not a choice but a means of survival " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama spoke of partnerships between nations in a speech that risked being seen as presumptuous , considering obama will not even face us voters for another three months , he warned of a world where partnership was not a choice but the only means of survival . " no one nation , no matter how large or powerful , can defeat such challenges alone , " he said , signaling that , if elected president , he would end what many europeans see as the unilateral foreign policy approach of president george w bush . obama also made clear he would not take the us into isolation .

that is why europe can not turn inward , " he said . crowds respond to barack ' n ' roll a party atmosphere gripped the crowds around the victory column monument as people listened to the man many hoped would replace george w bush as leader of the world 's most powerful nation . a roar went up from the multi-ethnic crowd when obama strolled confidently onto the stage to talk of the us-german partnership and the need to strengthen transatlantic relations to meet the challenges of the 21st century . bildunterschrift : supporters had more than the white house in mind around 100,000 lined the boulevard linking the victory column to the brandenburg gate , where obama had originally intended to speak but later dropped the plan after merkel signaled her disapproval at the site being used for foreign election campaign speeches . many of those present queued patiently for over an hour outside 20 airport-style security gates where they were required to empty their pockets and dispense with drinks containers . once inside they were able to refresh themselves with plastic mugs of german beer and snacks as a pop band livened up the audience on a warm mid-summer evening . no banners or placards were allowed on the strip guarded by around 1,000 police and other security officers as the obama team sought to ensure that no unwelcome slogans were aired on us television . but democrats inside distributed us flags to their supporters and a green poster was held aloft by an obama fan with the words " i love barack ' n ' roll . " outside the entrance gates to the security zone , us democrats wearing obama ' 08 buttons launched a recruitment drive , yelling out " us citizens register to vote . " obama talks of breaking down global walls the strikingly audacious speech , in a fevered atmosphere in berlin 's famed tiergarten , took the white house race out of us borders in a way never seen before , and was designed to portray obama as a leader with unique global appeal . bildunterschrift : the huge crowd responded to obama 's calls for unity " the walls between old allies on either side of the atlantic can not stand , " he said , referring to festering divisions between europe and the united states opened up by the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . " the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least can not stand , " said obama , in an address beamed live on us and german television channels and to viewers around the world . " the walls between races and tribes ; natives and immigrants ; christian and muslim and jew can not stand .
these now are the walls we must tear down , " obama said , drawing cheers and applause . obama 's speech was a clear echo of former us president ronald reagan 's call to then soviet leader mikhael gorbachev in berlin in 1987 to " tear down this wall , " before the fall of communism . full of passion , short of specifics despite its soaring cadences however , the speech was short on specifics .
obama 's aides said he would not talk policy as that is the job of a president but his critics will likely slam him for empty rhetoric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands stood listening in the balmy berlin evening the illinois senator rebuked both his country and europe for blaming one another for strains in their relations , but took pains to insulate himself from critics back home who doubt his patriotism .

" in europe , the view that america is part of what has gone wrong in our world , rather than a force to help make it right , has become all too common , " the 46-year-old first term senator said . " in america , there are voices that deride and deny the importance of europe 's role in our security and our future .
both views miss the truth . " obama , who has a narrow lead in most polls of the us race , but trails mccain when voters are asked who would be the most credible commander in chief , used berlin 's triumph over division and totalitarianism as a metaphor for the world he hoped to forge . " people of the world - look at berlin , where a wall came down , a continent came together , and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one , " obama said . he also promised america under his watch would be serious about tackling global warning , a huge concern in europe and a cause of rifts between the continent and the united states during the bush administration . europe needs to do its part , obama urges but he also signaled he would demand europe live up to its side of the bargain , asking for more help in the struggle against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan . " america can not do this alone , " obama said .
" the afghan people need our troops and your troops ; our support and your support to defeat the taliban and al-qaeda , to develop their economy , and to help them rebuild their nation . " we have too much at stake to turn back now . " obama is vowing to pour at least two more combat brigades into afghanistan , which is currently being pummeled by a rise in extremist violence and attacks , if he is elected president - with some troops to be redeployed from iraq . his aides have said that he believes nato nations should provide more troops for the conflict , and remove operating restrictions on forces that are already there . in an interview with cbs news on monday during his first-ever trip to the war-torn nation , obama warned conditions were " precarious and urgent " and also called on the afghan government to do more to stabilize the country . merkel resists obama pressure over troops bildunterschrift : merkel was firm on troops during the cordial meeting before giving his speech , obama on thursday met german chancellor angela merkel , who signaled clearly a day before that she would resist any pressure to send more troops to afghanistan . merkel said germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission .
we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- , " she said . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 24.07.2008 eu proposes partial ban on seal products großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials have n't clearly defined ' humane ' killing the european commission has proposed banning products made from seals killed in inhumane ways .
a former film diva and the world 's largest seal hunting nation are not happy with the plan - albeit for different reasons . the eu proposal would ban seal products from the bloc 's market unless they were proven to come from animals that had been killed with " hunting techniques consistent with high animal-welfare standards " and that the animals did not suffer more than necessary . seals are hunted mainly for their pelts but also for meat and fat , which is used in beauty products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hunter clubs a seal in canada " the images of seal hunting that circulate around the globe every year are a reminder of the often gruesome practices used to kill seals , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told journalists . " european citizens find these practices repugnant and in contradiction to our standards of animal welfare , " he added . the ban still has to be approved by eu governments and the european parliament . slippery slope ? the main target country of the ban is canada , where hunters slaughtered some 275,000 seals along the atlantic coast this year .
canada accounts for nearly a third of young seals killed each year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harper is cautioning the eu against a ban canadian premier stephen harper already voiced his opposition to the plan early this month , saying that his country " will not stand by and accept measures that fly in the face of accepted international practices . " his fisheries minister , loyola hearn , on wednesday , july 23 , also warned eu officials against going down a " slippery slope . " " to bow to misinformation and emotional rhetoric in restricting the trade of humanely harvested animals would set a dangerous precedent for all wild hunts , " he said . hearn added that seals were killed humanely in canada and seal products from his country would therefore not be affected by the ban . fisheries department spokesman phil jenkins meanwhile told afp news service that the eu has " not said exactly what they will consider to be humane or inhumane , so we do n't know yet what bar we have to reach to comply . " canada , greenland and namibia account for about 60 percent of the 900,000 seals hunted each year .
seals are also hunted in iceland , norway , russia , and the united states as well as in eu members britain , finland and sweden . " a historic step " animal rights activists meanwhile welcomed the proposal . " this announcement is a historic step forward in the campaign to end cruel commercial seal hunts , " said mark glover , head of the british arm of the humane society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bardot is generally pleased with the ban french actress-turned-animal-activist brigitte bardot , who has led a campaign against the killing of seals , regretted that " slaughters will continue as long as they are done in a humane way . " but bardot , who has made headlines in the past few years for supporting ultra-right politicians in france , was still happy about the plan . " a 30-year-long battle ... is about to be won , " bardot told ap news service . french president nicolas sarkozy has reportedly assured bardot that " everything would be done " during the french presidency of the european union to adopt a law banning imports of seal products in the eu . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

my vision of europe includes lasting diversity .
herein lies its potential .
diversity has characterized europe for centuries , and diversity feeds the common european identity .
it is absurd to think that europe will ever flourish if its roots are enforced equality and shared values dictated from above .
a liberal europe of the future is based on recognition of diversity , and it will continue to promote this principle .
business long ago realized that competition is healthier than monopolies , and the same principle applies to politics . decentralization encourages this competition , which needs to permeate every level of politics .
take competition among business locations .
competition allows citizens and companies to identify where to base the services their taxes help provide .
if these are to be tied to a region or a country in the long-run , their hosts need to budget well and meet their responsibilities .
decentralization is a way to prevent governments from collecting extortionate taxes only in order to dole out subsidies and create mountains of debt .
anti-regulation according to my vision , europe recognizes the challenges and opportunities afforded by the principle of subsidiarity .
europe must be able to distinguish between areas in which standardized political structures make sense , and those in which a better alternative is freedom of choice exercised by eu member countries , bodies and citizens .
there are plenty of opportunities to learn from mistakes - such as the watered-down services directive , which saw the old eu countries ' guardians of vested rights succeed in asserting protectionism over competition .
or the rise in advertising bans , which reflects a growing tendency to regulate from brussels matters that do not requite state regulation . or the anti-globalization fund , which grants " victims " of globalization european aid money .
hardly a positive approach to the many opportunities afforded by globalization .
love is blind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dyed-in-the-wool european the europe of the future is a citizens ' europe .
today , europe is much closer to its citizens than they realize .
but they still do n't identify with it .
an ambivalent situation .
on the one hand europe is showered with love , with the younger generation particularly keen to describe themselves as europeans and actively contributing to its ever-evolving identity .
on the other hand , this love can be blind - because the eu , as it stands , is seen as out of touch with its citizens and mired in red tape .
this ambivalence needs to be dealt with .
for there to be a citizens ' europe , its citizens need to identify with it .
transparency , reduced red tape , better law-making , legislation with time limits and an assessment of the follow-up costs of legislation are the least that we can expect .
how can these goals be reached ?
for example , by tackling one key aspect of the eu - its financing .
a reform would create a simpler , more transparent system .
special treatments and exemptions need to be done away with - such as what 's known as the " british discount . "
a customized eu tax should not be tolerated .
so long as the eu remains a not-quite democracy , with decisions regarding the profit and loss accounting of taxpayers ' money made in parliament , the eu should not be granted tax authority .
the europe of the future needs to pursue solid , people-oriented politics which allow the public to experience a common europe first-hand .
only then will it be taking its first steps away from a technocracy and towards its citizens .
a two-speed europe europe will continue to grow - that much is clear .
the balkan countries , turkey , countries in eastern europe - they are all eyeing membership .
can the eu withstand this enlargement ?
there is a simple answer : every country should become as european as it wishes .
there is no doubt that we need to hold on to the basic principles of european success .
but partners can only work together when they want to .
a two-speed europe should be openly welcomed , so that countries deeply committed to the european project do not end up dragged down by ones that are more hesitant and less committed .
a two-speed europe already exists when dealing with the euro and various other political issues , although few will admit it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if some countries are n't interested , they do n't have to be this reflects the old idea of a core europe of the committed .
first , second and third class europeans ?
that 's not the point .
a europe of varying speeds would have many advantages .
it would do greater justice to the individual countries ' respective stages of development as well as their respective levels of commitment .
it would be up to the individual countries to set their own pace .
every country can choose whether it wants to be an innovator or a straggler .
the sole criterion for progress must remain a desire to propel europe forward .
europe is neither old , nor old-fashioned .
europe is in its prime .
however you look at it , europe is a great success . silvana koch-mehrin -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" they were presidents , i am a citizen , " he told reporters travelling with him .
" there is no doubt that part of what i want to communicate on both sides of the atlantic is the enormous potential of us restoring a sense of coming together . " the 46-year-old presumptive democratic candidate said he wanted the united states and europe to rediscover their common ground . " obviously berlin is representative of the extraordinary success of the post world war ii effort to bring the continent together and to bring the west together , and later to bring the east and the west together , " he said .
" so i think it is a natural place to talk . " obama 's 45-minute address on trans-atlantic relations is expected to pull in tens of thousands . " hopefully -lsb- the speech -rsb- will be viewed as a substantive articulation of the relationship i 'd like to see between the united states and europe , " obama told reporters in israel shortly before leaving for germany .
" i 'm hoping to communicate across the atlantic the value of that relationship and how we need to build on it . " preparations for obama 's speech were marred after a 40-year man driving a car breached the cordoned off zone where the us presidential candidate is to speak and sprayed red paint around the area . bildunterschrift : police cordoned off the car after the paint attack the man from the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg is now in police custody , pending an investigation . earlier , a suspicious package at the swanky adlon hotel , which is close to both the us embassy and berlin 's historic brandenburg gate , triggered a security scare .
the hotel 's lobby was cleared briefly before the package was examined by explosives experts and declared that it did not represent any threat . election campaigning while berlin was in obama fever ahead of the visit , political commentators stressed that the main aim of the visit was to boost the senator 's fortunes in the us presidential race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's advance team was worried anti-american signs could sour us opinion of the speech in his speech , obama was expected to seek to revive trans-atlantic relations that suffered considerable damage under president george w. bush . europeans are looking to the illinois senator to restore a transatlantic relationship that has been strained , in particular , by president bush 's invasion of iraq . european leaders strongly support obama 's foreign policy goals including closing the guantanamo bay prison camp for terror suspects , fighting nuclear proliferation and tackling climate change with an eu-style emissions cap-and-trade plan . obama 's calls for talking directly to iran over its nuclear program and renewing us engagement in the middle east peace process have also received a warm welcome in european capitals . commentators were watching closely to discern calls for greater european contributions in afghanistan and to hear the senator 's views on pressing iran to abandon its uranium enrichment program . obama is overwhelmingly more popular in europe than his republican adversary , john mccain .
a recent poll put his german support at 76 percent . following his round of engagements in berlin , obama is to visit friday the us ramstein air force base and the us military hospital in landstuhl , which are both in the western part of germany . the presumed us democrat presidential candidate will then travel on to france .
before arriving in germany , obama visited israel , the palestinian territories , kuwait , afghanistan , iraq and jordan . no german troop changes in afghanistan asked about obama 's recent comments that he would press european nato partners for more troops for afghanistan , merkel said wednesday that germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to increase troop commitments in afghanistan " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission , " she told reporters .
" we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president , " merkel added . germany has faced growing pressure to increase the number of troops it has deployed in afghanistan and to move troops from the relatively calm north of the country to the south where us-led forces are battling tenacious taliban insurgents . in response to the calls from the united states and other nato members , berlin announced plans in june to boost its contingent in northern afghanistan later this year by up to 1,000 soldiers to a maximum of 4,500 troops . the mission , however , is extremely unpopular among germans and any move to expand the deployment further would likely provoke a voter backlash ahead of general elections slated for 2009 . us policy continuity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties to the us improved slightly after merkel took over in the chancellery merkel , who has met mccain on several occasions , said she was keen to sit down with his challenger .
she said she was impressed by the grassroots enthusiasm obama managed to spark during his " bold " and extended democratic primary campaign . " from the way he triumphed in the primaries in america , i would say he is a man of many strengths - physical , mental and political , " she said . merkel said she was particularly interested in discussing trans-atlantic political and economic ties with obama , nato , climate change and the doha trade round . but she said she expected broad continuity in the us stance toward europe regardless of whether obama or mccain won in november . " in general the impact of differences on domestic policy is larger than those on foreign policy , " she said .
" we will continue to defend our interests and , in specific cases , find compromises . " dw staff -lrb- sms / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hotel 's lobby was cleared briefly before the package was examined by explosives experts and declared that it did not represent any threat . election campaigning while berlin was in obama fever ahead of the visit , political commentators stressed that the main aim of the visit was to boost the senator 's fortunes in the us presidential race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's advance team was worried anti-american signs could sour us opinion of the speech in his speech , obama was expected to seek to revive trans-atlantic relations that suffered considerable damage under president george w. bush . europeans are looking to the illinois senator to restore a transatlantic relationship that has been strained , in particular , by president bush 's invasion of iraq . european leaders strongly support obama 's foreign policy goals including closing the guantanamo bay prison camp for terror suspects , fighting nuclear proliferation and tackling climate change with an eu-style emissions cap-and-trade plan . obama 's calls for talking directly to iran over its nuclear program and renewing us engagement in the middle east peace process have also received a warm welcome in european capitals . commentators were watching closely to discern calls for greater european contributions in afghanistan and to hear the senator 's views on pressing iran to abandon its uranium enrichment program . obama is overwhelmingly more popular in europe than his republican adversary , john mccain .
a recent poll put his german support at 76 percent . following his round of engagements in berlin , obama is to visit friday the us ramstein air force base and the us military hospital in landstuhl , which are both in the western part of germany . the presumed us democrat presidential candidate will then travel on to france .
before arriving in germany , obama visited israel , the palestinian territories , kuwait , afghanistan , iraq and jordan . no german troop changes in afghanistan asked about obama 's recent comments that he would press european nato partners for more troops for afghanistan , merkel said wednesday that germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to increase troop commitments in afghanistan " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission , " she told reporters .

" thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president , " merkel added . germany has faced growing pressure to increase the number of troops it has deployed in afghanistan and to move troops from the relatively calm north of the country to the south where us-led forces are battling tenacious taliban insurgents . in response to the calls from the united states and other nato members , berlin announced plans in june to boost its contingent in northern afghanistan later this year by up to 1,000 soldiers to a maximum of 4,500 troops . the mission , however , is extremely unpopular among germans and any move to expand the deployment further would likely provoke a voter backlash ahead of general elections slated for 2009 . us policy continuity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties to the us improved slightly after merkel took over in the chancellery merkel , who has met mccain on several occasions , said she was keen to sit down with his challenger .
she said she was impressed by the grassroots enthusiasm obama managed to spark during his " bold " and extended democratic primary campaign . " from the way he triumphed in the primaries in america , i would say he is a man of many strengths - physical , mental and political , " she said . merkel said she was particularly interested in discussing trans-atlantic political and economic ties with obama , nato , climate change and the doha trade round . but she said she expected broad continuity in the us stance toward europe regardless of whether obama or mccain won in november .

the hotel 's lobby was cleared briefly before the package was examined by explosives experts and declared that it did not represent any threat . election campaigning while berlin was in obama fever ahead of the visit , political commentators stressed that the main aim of the visit was to boost the senator 's fortunes in the us presidential race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's advance team was worried anti-american signs could sour us opinion of the speech in his speech , obama was expected to seek to revive trans-atlantic relations that suffered considerable damage under president george w. bush . europeans are looking to the illinois senator to restore a transatlantic relationship that has been strained , in particular , by president bush 's invasion of iraq . european leaders strongly support obama 's foreign policy goals including closing the guantanamo bay prison camp for terror suspects , fighting nuclear proliferation and tackling climate change with an eu-style emissions cap-and-trade plan . obama 's calls for talking directly to iran over its nuclear program and renewing us engagement in the middle east peace process have also received a warm welcome in european capitals . commentators were watching closely to discern calls for greater european contributions in afghanistan and to hear the senator 's views on pressing iran to abandon its uranium enrichment program . obama is overwhelmingly more popular in europe than his republican adversary , john mccain .
a recent poll put his german support at 76 percent . following his round of engagements in berlin , obama is to visit friday the us ramstein air force base and the us military hospital in landstuhl , which are both in the western part of germany . the presumed us democrat presidential candidate will then travel on to france .
before arriving in germany , obama visited israel , the palestinian territories , kuwait , afghanistan , iraq and jordan . no german troop changes in afghanistan asked about obama 's recent comments that he would press european nato partners for more troops for afghanistan , merkel said wednesday that germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to increase troop commitments in afghanistan " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission , " she told reporters .
" we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president , " merkel added . germany has faced growing pressure to increase the number of troops it has deployed in afghanistan and to move troops from the relatively calm north of the country to the south where us-led forces are battling tenacious taliban insurgents . in response to the calls from the united states and other nato members , berlin announced plans in june to boost its contingent in northern afghanistan later this year by up to 1,000 soldiers to a maximum of 4,500 troops . the mission , however , is extremely unpopular among germans and any move to expand the deployment further would likely provoke a voter backlash ahead of general elections slated for 2009 . us policy continuity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties to the us improved slightly after merkel took over in the chancellery merkel , who has met mccain on several occasions , said she was keen to sit down with his challenger .
she said she was impressed by the grassroots enthusiasm obama managed to spark during his " bold " and extended democratic primary campaign . " from the way he triumphed in the primaries in america , i would say he is a man of many strengths - physical , mental and political , " she said . merkel said she was particularly interested in discussing trans-atlantic political and economic ties with obama , nato , climate change and the doha trade round . but she said she expected broad continuity in the us stance toward europe regardless of whether obama or mccain won in november . " in general the impact of differences on domestic policy is larger than those on foreign policy , " she said .

my vision of europe includes lasting diversity .
herein lies its potential .
diversity has characterized europe for centuries , and diversity feeds the common european identity .
it is absurd to think that europe will ever flourish if its roots are enforced equality and shared values dictated from above .
a liberal europe of the future is based on recognition of diversity , and it will continue to promote this principle .
business long ago realized that competition is healthier than monopolies , and the same principle applies to politics . decentralization encourages this competition , which needs to permeate every level of politics .
take competition among business locations .
competition allows citizens and companies to identify where to base the services their taxes help provide .
if these are to be tied to a region or a country in the long-run , their hosts need to budget well and meet their responsibilities .
decentralization is a way to prevent governments from collecting extortionate taxes only in order to dole out subsidies and create mountains of debt .
anti-regulation according to my vision , europe recognizes the challenges and opportunities afforded by the principle of subsidiarity .
europe must be able to distinguish between areas in which standardized political structures make sense , and those in which a better alternative is freedom of choice exercised by eu member countries , bodies and citizens .
there are plenty of opportunities to learn from mistakes - such as the watered-down services directive , which saw the old eu countries ' guardians of vested rights succeed in asserting protectionism over competition .
or the rise in advertising bans , which reflects a growing tendency to regulate from brussels matters that do not requite state regulation . or the anti-globalization fund , which grants " victims " of globalization european aid money .
hardly a positive approach to the many opportunities afforded by globalization .
love is blind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dyed-in-the-wool european the europe of the future is a citizens ' europe .
today , europe is much closer to its citizens than they realize .
but they still do n't identify with it .
an ambivalent situation .
on the one hand europe is showered with love , with the younger generation particularly keen to describe themselves as europeans and actively contributing to its ever-evolving identity .
on the other hand , this love can be blind - because the eu , as it stands , is seen as out of touch with its citizens and mired in red tape .
this ambivalence needs to be dealt with .
for there to be a citizens ' europe , its citizens need to identify with it .
transparency , reduced red tape , better law-making , legislation with time limits and an assessment of the follow-up costs of legislation are the least that we can expect .
how can these goals be reached ?
for example , by tackling one key aspect of the eu - its financing .
a reform would create a simpler , more transparent system .
special treatments and exemptions need to be done away with - such as what 's known as the " british discount . "
a customized eu tax should not be tolerated .
so long as the eu remains a not-quite democracy , with decisions regarding the profit and loss accounting of taxpayers ' money made in parliament , the eu should not be granted tax authority .
the europe of the future needs to pursue solid , people-oriented politics which allow the public to experience a common europe first-hand .
only then will it be taking its first steps away from a technocracy and towards its citizens .
a two-speed europe europe will continue to grow - that much is clear .
the balkan countries , turkey , countries in eastern europe - they are all eyeing membership .
can the eu withstand this enlargement ?
there is a simple answer : every country should become as european as it wishes .
there is no doubt that we need to hold on to the basic principles of european success .
but partners can only work together when they want to .
a two-speed europe should be openly welcomed , so that countries deeply committed to the european project do not end up dragged down by ones that are more hesitant and less committed .
a two-speed europe already exists when dealing with the euro and various other political issues , although few will admit it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if some countries are n't interested , they do n't have to be this reflects the old idea of a core europe of the committed .
first , second and third class europeans ?
that 's not the point .
a europe of varying speeds would have many advantages .
it would do greater justice to the individual countries ' respective stages of development as well as their respective levels of commitment .
it would be up to the individual countries to set their own pace .
every country can choose whether it wants to be an innovator or a straggler .
the sole criterion for progress must remain a desire to propel europe forward .
europe is neither old , nor old-fashioned .
europe is in its prime .
however you look at it , europe is a great success . silvana koch-mehrin -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 24.07.2008 fifa tells soccer teams to release players for olympics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa wants teams to let their eligible players take part in the 2008 olympic games soccer clubs must release under-23 players for the beijing olympics , said fifa president joseph blatter .
the decision could let several bundesliga players off the judicial hook . " the release of players below the age of 23 has always been mandatory for all clubs , " blatter said in a statement on wednesday , july 23 .
" the same principle shall apply for beijing 2008 . " the statement added that blatter had sent an according letter to all member federations on that day . the news comes shortly after germany 's schalke 04 announced the start of proceedings to go before the court of arbitration for sport -lrb- cas -rrb- over their 22-year-old brazilian defender rafinha and comments from the european soccer association eca that clubs can not be forced to send players to the games . confusion reigned for days in the international soccer community over whether or not clubs have to release players for the august 8-24 olympics , which coincide with the league start in england and germany and pre-season activities in spain and italy . the olympic tournament is by definition an under-23 event but each team can field three over-age players , who the clubs are not required to release . an end to legal limbo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke is unhappy that rafinha , right , put the olympics before his club obligations apart from schalke , the bundesliga 's werder bremen had also said before blatter 's statement that they would look to the cas if their brazilian playmaker diego , who qualifies as an under-23 player , has to play in beijing . like schalke 's rafinha , diego traveled to beijing without his team 's authorization . elsewhere , barcelona do n't want to release star forward lionel messi to play for 2004 gold medalists argentina in beijing . barca said in a first reaction to blatter 's letter that the statement was " not satisfactory " for the club 's interest and that a board meeting had been called . the clubs argued that the men 's olympic tournament is not part of the official match calendar - though the women 's tournament is - and that they do n't have to release players . this view was shared , among others , by the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the eca , which represents europe 's clubs . " as the olympics are not included in the harmonized international match calendar , the obligation to release players for national team matches according to the fifa regulations on the status and transfer of players does not apply , " eca chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said in a statement issued earlier wednesday .
" we , therefore , support all clubs that currently face losing important players . " rummenigge also called on fifa and the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- to set up clear rules for future olympic tournaments . fifa : olympics mandatory international tournament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego was instrumental in bremen 's attack on the bundesliga crown last season but blatter said in the letter to the fifa members that the olympic tournament is " deliberately " not included in the calendar , and that this " does not mean that there is no release obligation for the relevant clubs . " in view of the importance of the men 's olympic football tournament for the entire sporting movement in general and football in particular , and given the specific nature of the event , as well as on the basis of customary law , the release of players below the age of 23 has always been mandatory for clubs .
the same principle shall apply for beijing 2008 . " it would appear to be against the spirit of the olympic regulations to hinder players under the age of 23 , who are actually the core of the squads participating in the men 's olympic football tournament , to take part in the final phase of the event . " blatter 's clarification backed up the comments of ioc president jacques rogge who told dpa news agency last week that players must be released . " the law says that if a club does n't release a player then the player will be suspended for the whole period of the games , " rogge said .
" fifa has reminded the clubs of this law .
they sent a letter a couple of days ago to remind them of that . " blatter 's confirmation was good news for the players as well , with diego for instance naming the olympics " a dream . "
it could also affect pending cases such as sv hamburg 's belgian vincent kompany . players benefit from fulfilling olympic dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina are the current olympic gold medal holders according to the german player union vdv , the clubs would even benefit from their players going to the olympics . " participating at an olympic tournament is a career highlight for every player , " the union told dpa .
" players who are not given this chance could be disappointed and that could affect their performance in the league .
releasing a player for the olympics , by contrast , could boost performance , which the clubs in the end will profit from . " teams have acknowledged that players are under huge pressure to represent their countries where the olympic event has great importance . brazil , for instance , wants olympic gold at last .
europe 's big soccer powers are not represented in beijing , with the exception of italy . promoted german bundesliga club hoffenheim bowed to this pressure when it released forward chinedu obasi to play for the 1996 olympic champions nigeria . " the pressure on obasi and his family was unbearable , " said hoffenheim general manager jan schindelmeiser .

eu family law requires unanimous support in order to be enacted . provided that the european commission accepts the divorce initiative , it then has to be approved by a qualified majority of the bloc 's 27 member states . small factions lead the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu politicians are considering how to proceed after the irish rejected the lisbon treaty enhanced cooperation is regarded as one of the ways the eu can stem off paralysis across the bloc , which may increasingly come into play if it fails to quickly overcome ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty . that treaty , which also requires unanimous ratification to go into effect , would have simplified voting procedures in addition to changing the eu 's approach to foreign policy .
the european union 's reliance on unanimous decision-making comes under frequent criticism for paralyzing the bloc . except for issues with military or defense implications , eu treaties allow for pioneer groups but the clause has never been used before . " enhanced cooperation is a very sensitive issue because it has never been implemented , " a french diplomat said , according to reuters news agency .
" it allows several member states to go forward faster than others , and it is not necessarily the image we want to give of the eu . " some 170,000 international marriages end in divorce in the european union each year but there are no common rules dictating which country 's laws to apply .
spouses sometimes rush to court in their country of origin to try to get the law on their side . marriage and divorce laws differ widely across the 27-nation eu , from the liberal nordic nations to catholic poland and ireland .

2008 former bosnian serb leader and top war crimes suspect radovan karadzic hid behind the identity of a soldier killed by a sarajevo sniper 15 years ago , serbian media reported thursday , july 24 . karadzic 's alias was part of an elaborate charade that included a long white beard , a mistress and an alternative medicine website .
it ended after 12 years on the run with his arrest monday this week in belgrade .
he had identity papers issued in the name of dragan david dabic , a bosnian serb soldier in his late 30s who was killed in the bosnian capital in 1993 during the country 's ethnic war , serbian media reported .
and karadzic allegedly stole 36 million marks from the bosnian serb region 's central bank in 1997 , when he was already undercover , a bosnian newspaper said thursday .
serbian intelligence involved ?
serb authorities are expected to turn over karadzic within days to the un war crimes tribunal in the hague , where he faces charges including genocide and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1992-95 war .
karadzic , 63 , will tell the tribunal " he is proud of everything he did and for saving serbs in bosnia , " his lawyer svetozar vujacic told the politika daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic , seen here in 1995 , underwent a complete metamorphosis during more than a dozen years in hiding in plain sight karadzic will prove that the accusations are false and that he is charged only because he is a serb , his lawyer added .
serbia 's secret service is widely believed to have helped karadzic with his undercover life .
his fake documents were issued legally in ruma , 50 kilometers north-west of belgrade , most probably with the help of bosnian serb officials , reports said .
false documents were also used by other war crimes suspects arrested in serbia .
stojan zupljanin , who was arrested on june 11 in the serbian town pancevo , had documents under the name of a man who died more than 10 years ago .
zupljanin , a former bosnian serb police commander , has been indicted by the un war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity .
in serbia , proof of citizenship , a birth certificate or an old identity card are needed to obtain identity documents .
one also needs to give a fingerprint .
karadzic was not a citizen of serbia .
karadzic stole funds , paper says a bosnian newspaper thursday quoted a 2005 a interview it conducted with milorad dodik , currently prime minister of the serb entity in bosnia , in which he claimed that karadzic in 1997 stole 36 million german marks from the region 's central bank .
" there are documents that karadzic in the spring of 1997 took 36 million marks in a bag from banja luka , " dnevni avaz quoted dodik as saying .
" he first took 28 million marks from the bank 's safe and then eight more . "
since karadzic 's arrest , dodik has offered to help karadzic 's family travel to the hague and visit him .
the family can not travel without the permission of the international representative in bosnia .
they 've asked for their documents to be returned to them so that they can visit him in belgrade jail , saying that travelling to the hague is too costly .
" after 10 years of hell , i do n't see why somebody will profit from denying us this , " said karadzic 's daughter sonja karadzic jovicevic .
two years ago , karadzic posing as dragan david dabic spent a summer holiday on the croatian adriatic island of ciovo , croatian media reported thursday .
inhabitants say karadzic visited a local church and spent 10 days on the island , the 24sata daily said . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2008 former bosnian serb leader and top war crimes suspect radovan karadzic hid behind the identity of a soldier killed by a sarajevo sniper 15 years ago , serbian media reported thursday , july 24 . karadzic 's alias was part of an elaborate charade that included a long white beard , a mistress and an alternative medicine website .
it ended after 12 years on the run with his arrest monday this week in belgrade .
he had identity papers issued in the name of dragan david dabic , a bosnian serb soldier in his late 30s who was killed in the bosnian capital in 1993 during the country 's ethnic war , serbian media reported .
and karadzic allegedly stole 36 million marks from the bosnian serb region 's central bank in 1997 , when he was already undercover , a bosnian newspaper said thursday .
serbian intelligence involved ?
serb authorities are expected to turn over karadzic within days to the un war crimes tribunal in the hague , where he faces charges including genocide and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1992-95 war .
karadzic , 63 , will tell the tribunal " he is proud of everything he did and for saving serbs in bosnia , " his lawyer svetozar vujacic told the politika daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic , seen here in 1995 , underwent a complete metamorphosis during more than a dozen years in hiding in plain sight karadzic will prove that the accusations are false and that he is charged only because he is a serb , his lawyer added .
serbia 's secret service is widely believed to have helped karadzic with his undercover life .
his fake documents were issued legally in ruma , 50 kilometers north-west of belgrade , most probably with the help of bosnian serb officials , reports said .
false documents were also used by other war crimes suspects arrested in serbia .
stojan zupljanin , who was arrested on june 11 in the serbian town pancevo , had documents under the name of a man who died more than 10 years ago .
zupljanin , a former bosnian serb police commander , has been indicted by the un war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity .
in serbia , proof of citizenship , a birth certificate or an old identity card are needed to obtain identity documents .
one also needs to give a fingerprint .
karadzic was not a citizen of serbia .
karadzic stole funds , paper says a bosnian newspaper thursday quoted a 2005 a interview it conducted with milorad dodik , currently prime minister of the serb entity in bosnia , in which he claimed that karadzic in 1997 stole 36 million german marks from the region 's central bank .
" there are documents that karadzic in the spring of 1997 took 36 million marks in a bag from banja luka , " dnevni avaz quoted dodik as saying .
" he first took 28 million marks from the bank 's safe and then eight more . "
since karadzic 's arrest , dodik has offered to help karadzic 's family travel to the hague and visit him .
the family can not travel without the permission of the international representative in bosnia .
they 've asked for their documents to be returned to them so that they can visit him in belgrade jail , saying that travelling to the hague is too costly .
" after 10 years of hell , i do n't see why somebody will profit from denying us this , " said karadzic 's daughter sonja karadzic jovicevic .
two years ago , karadzic posing as dragan david dabic spent a summer holiday on the croatian adriatic island of ciovo , croatian media reported thursday .

eu family law requires unanimous support in order to be enacted . provided that the european commission accepts the divorce initiative , it then has to be approved by a qualified majority of the bloc 's 27 member states . small factions lead the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu politicians are considering how to proceed after the irish rejected the lisbon treaty enhanced cooperation is regarded as one of the ways the eu can stem off paralysis across the bloc , which may increasingly come into play if it fails to quickly overcome ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty . that treaty , which also requires unanimous ratification to go into effect , would have simplified voting procedures in addition to changing the eu 's approach to foreign policy .
the european union 's reliance on unanimous decision-making comes under frequent criticism for paralyzing the bloc . except for issues with military or defense implications , eu treaties allow for pioneer groups but the clause has never been used before . " enhanced cooperation is a very sensitive issue because it has never been implemented , " a french diplomat said , according to reuters news agency .
" it allows several member states to go forward faster than others , and it is not necessarily the image we want to give of the eu . " some 170,000 international marriages end in divorce in the european union each year but there are no common rules dictating which country 's laws to apply .
spouses sometimes rush to court in their country of origin to try to get the law on their side . marriage and divorce laws differ widely across the 27-nation eu , from the liberal nordic nations to catholic poland and ireland .

" we do n't expect the first natural gas to arrive till 2012 , " said andreas hieckmann , the project chief at the gazprom germania company . his comment clashed with a printed news release from nord stream , a consortium with russian , german and dutch involvement , which stated that 2011 was the target for the first flow . he was speaking in waren , north of berlin , where gazprom is studying the suitability of a bed of deep rock to store the gas in after it lands . nord stream said it aimed to complete a multinational environmental review of the undersea route by the end of this year . unfair advantage ? sweden has echoed environmentalists who fear the seabed trench for the pipes may kill sea life and stir up toxic material .
poland has led strategic criticism , saying russia may gain a massive advantage by piping the gas outside the borders of intermediate nations . hieckmann said he expected delays because dumped wartime ammunition would have to be recovered from the baltic seabed before the pipeline is laid and because of the " political friction " in the permissions process . " even if the regulatory procedures go according to plan , it will be a complex construction job , " he said . when complete , the line will transport 27.5 billion cubic meters -lrb- 971 million cubic feet -rrb- of gas annually to western europe .

" i am confident we will implement the lisbon treaty , " merkel said before going on summer vacation . the treaty of lisbon , signed at the end of last year and currently undergoing ratification by the individual members , was necessary not only if the eu was to expand , but also to enhance democracy within the bloc and to make it more effective , merkel said . the irish rejection of the lisbon treaty has left the bloc searching for a new way to move forward as the treaty must be unanimously ratified in order to go into effect . merkel was one of the driving forces behind the new treaty under germany 's eu presidency in the first half of last year . the treaty faces obstacles in germany , poland and the czech republic . german president horst koehler has said he will await a decision by the constitutional court on the treaty 's compatibility with the german constitution before signing into law the necessary legislation , which has been passed by both houses of parliament . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a former film diva and the world 's largest seal hunting nation are not happy with the plan - albeit for different reasons . the eu proposal would ban seal products from the bloc 's market unless they were proven to come from animals that had been killed with " hunting techniques consistent with high animal-welfare standards " and that the animals did not suffer more than necessary . seals are hunted mainly for their pelts but also for meat and fat , which is used in beauty products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hunter clubs a seal in canada " the images of seal hunting that circulate around the globe every year are a reminder of the often gruesome practices used to kill seals , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told journalists . " european citizens find these practices repugnant and in contradiction to our standards of animal welfare , " he added . the ban still has to be approved by eu governments and the european parliament . slippery slope ? the main target country of the ban is canada , where hunters slaughtered some 275,000 seals along the atlantic coast this year .
canada accounts for nearly a third of young seals killed each year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harper is cautioning the eu against a ban canadian premier stephen harper already voiced his opposition to the plan early this month , saying that his country " will not stand by and accept measures that fly in the face of accepted international practices . " his fisheries minister , loyola hearn , on wednesday , july 23 , also warned eu officials against going down a " slippery slope . " " to bow to misinformation and emotional rhetoric in restricting the trade of humanely harvested animals would set a dangerous precedent for all wild hunts , " he said . hearn added that seals were killed humanely in canada and seal products from his country would therefore not be affected by the ban . fisheries department spokesman phil jenkins meanwhile told afp news service that the eu has " not said exactly what they will consider to be humane or inhumane , so we do n't know yet what bar we have to reach to comply . " canada , greenland and namibia account for about 60 percent of the 900,000 seals hunted each year .
seals are also hunted in iceland , norway , russia , and the united states as well as in eu members britain , finland and sweden . " a historic step " animal rights activists meanwhile welcomed the proposal .

the decision could let several bundesliga players off the judicial hook . " the release of players below the age of 23 has always been mandatory for all clubs , " blatter said in a statement on wednesday , july 23 .
" the same principle shall apply for beijing 2008 . " the statement added that blatter had sent an according letter to all member federations on that day . the news comes shortly after germany 's schalke 04 announced the start of proceedings to go before the court of arbitration for sport -lrb- cas -rrb- over their 22-year-old brazilian defender rafinha and comments from the european soccer association eca that clubs can not be forced to send players to the games . confusion reigned for days in the international soccer community over whether or not clubs have to release players for the august 8-24 olympics , which coincide with the league start in england and germany and pre-season activities in spain and italy . the olympic tournament is by definition an under-23 event but each team can field three over-age players , who the clubs are not required to release . an end to legal limbo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke is unhappy that rafinha , right , put the olympics before his club obligations apart from schalke , the bundesliga 's werder bremen had also said before blatter 's statement that they would look to the cas if their brazilian playmaker diego , who qualifies as an under-23 player , has to play in beijing . like schalke 's rafinha , diego traveled to beijing without his team 's authorization . elsewhere , barcelona do n't want to release star forward lionel messi to play for 2004 gold medalists argentina in beijing . barca said in a first reaction to blatter 's letter that the statement was " not satisfactory " for the club 's interest and that a board meeting had been called . the clubs argued that the men 's olympic tournament is not part of the official match calendar - though the women 's tournament is - and that they do n't have to release players . this view was shared , among others , by the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the eca , which represents europe 's clubs . " as the olympics are not included in the harmonized international match calendar , the obligation to release players for national team matches according to the fifa regulations on the status and transfer of players does not apply , " eca chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said in a statement issued earlier wednesday .
" we , therefore , support all clubs that currently face losing important players . " rummenigge also called on fifa and the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- to set up clear rules for future olympic tournaments . fifa : olympics mandatory international tournament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego was instrumental in bremen 's attack on the bundesliga crown last season but blatter said in the letter to the fifa members that the olympic tournament is " deliberately " not included in the calendar , and that this " does not mean that there is no release obligation for the relevant clubs . " in view of the importance of the men 's olympic football tournament for the entire sporting movement in general and football in particular , and given the specific nature of the event , as well as on the basis of customary law , the release of players below the age of 23 has always been mandatory for clubs .
the same principle shall apply for beijing 2008 . " it would appear to be against the spirit of the olympic regulations to hinder players under the age of 23 , who are actually the core of the squads participating in the men 's olympic football tournament , to take part in the final phase of the event . " blatter 's clarification backed up the comments of ioc president jacques rogge who told dpa news agency last week that players must be released . " the law says that if a club does n't release a player then the player will be suspended for the whole period of the games , " rogge said .
" fifa has reminded the clubs of this law .
they sent a letter a couple of days ago to remind them of that . " blatter 's confirmation was good news for the players as well , with diego for instance naming the olympics " a dream . "
it could also affect pending cases such as sv hamburg 's belgian vincent kompany . players benefit from fulfilling olympic dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina are the current olympic gold medal holders according to the german player union vdv , the clubs would even benefit from their players going to the olympics . " participating at an olympic tournament is a career highlight for every player , " the union told dpa .
" players who are not given this chance could be disappointed and that could affect their performance in the league .
releasing a player for the olympics , by contrast , could boost performance , which the clubs in the end will profit from . " teams have acknowledged that players are under huge pressure to represent their countries where the olympic event has great importance . brazil , for instance , wants olympic gold at last .
europe 's big soccer powers are not represented in beijing , with the exception of italy . promoted german bundesliga club hoffenheim bowed to this pressure when it released forward chinedu obasi to play for the 1996 olympic champions nigeria . " the pressure on obasi and his family was unbearable , " said hoffenheim general manager jan schindelmeiser .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : euro-visions : debating europe 's future eu should become union of european regions , expert says europe needs better ideas , communication , expert says making the case for a multi-speed europe greens politician : turkish eu entry is in europe 's interest european union -pipe- 24.07.2008 what 's wrong with a two-speed europe , asks koch-mehrin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch-mehrin believes in strength through diversity a member of the european parliament , german politician silvana koch-mehrin would like to see a decentralized europe that puts its citizens first , she writes in an exclusive essay for dw-world.de. silvana koch-mehrin , a member of the european parliament , belongs to germany 's free market liberal party , the fdp , and heads up its european parliament group .
my vision of europe includes lasting diversity .
herein lies its potential .
diversity has characterized europe for centuries , and diversity feeds the common european identity .
it is absurd to think that europe will ever flourish if its roots are enforced equality and shared values dictated from above .
a liberal europe of the future is based on recognition of diversity , and it will continue to promote this principle .
business long ago realized that competition is healthier than monopolies , and the same principle applies to politics . decentralization encourages this competition , which needs to permeate every level of politics .
take competition among business locations .
competition allows citizens and companies to identify where to base the services their taxes help provide .
if these are to be tied to a region or a country in the long-run , their hosts need to budget well and meet their responsibilities .
decentralization is a way to prevent governments from collecting extortionate taxes only in order to dole out subsidies and create mountains of debt .
anti-regulation according to my vision , europe recognizes the challenges and opportunities afforded by the principle of subsidiarity .
europe must be able to distinguish between areas in which standardized political structures make sense , and those in which a better alternative is freedom of choice exercised by eu member countries , bodies and citizens .
there are plenty of opportunities to learn from mistakes - such as the watered-down services directive , which saw the old eu countries ' guardians of vested rights succeed in asserting protectionism over competition .
or the rise in advertising bans , which reflects a growing tendency to regulate from brussels matters that do not requite state regulation . or the anti-globalization fund , which grants " victims " of globalization european aid money .
hardly a positive approach to the many opportunities afforded by globalization .
love is blind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dyed-in-the-wool european the europe of the future is a citizens ' europe .
today , europe is much closer to its citizens than they realize .
but they still do n't identify with it .
an ambivalent situation .
on the one hand europe is showered with love , with the younger generation particularly keen to describe themselves as europeans and actively contributing to its ever-evolving identity .
on the other hand , this love can be blind - because the eu , as it stands , is seen as out of touch with its citizens and mired in red tape .
this ambivalence needs to be dealt with .
for there to be a citizens ' europe , its citizens need to identify with it .
transparency , reduced red tape , better law-making , legislation with time limits and an assessment of the follow-up costs of legislation are the least that we can expect .
how can these goals be reached ?
for example , by tackling one key aspect of the eu - its financing .
a reform would create a simpler , more transparent system .
special treatments and exemptions need to be done away with - such as what 's known as the " british discount . "
a customized eu tax should not be tolerated .
so long as the eu remains a not-quite democracy , with decisions regarding the profit and loss accounting of taxpayers ' money made in parliament , the eu should not be granted tax authority .
the europe of the future needs to pursue solid , people-oriented politics which allow the public to experience a common europe first-hand .
only then will it be taking its first steps away from a technocracy and towards its citizens .
a two-speed europe europe will continue to grow - that much is clear .
the balkan countries , turkey , countries in eastern europe - they are all eyeing membership .
can the eu withstand this enlargement ?
there is a simple answer : every country should become as european as it wishes .
there is no doubt that we need to hold on to the basic principles of european success .
but partners can only work together when they want to .
a two-speed europe should be openly welcomed , so that countries deeply committed to the european project do not end up dragged down by ones that are more hesitant and less committed .
a two-speed europe already exists when dealing with the euro and various other political issues , although few will admit it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if some countries are n't interested , they do n't have to be this reflects the old idea of a core europe of the committed .
first , second and third class europeans ?
that 's not the point .
a europe of varying speeds would have many advantages .
it would do greater justice to the individual countries ' respective stages of development as well as their respective levels of commitment .
it would be up to the individual countries to set their own pace .
every country can choose whether it wants to be an innovator or a straggler .
the sole criterion for progress must remain a desire to propel europe forward .
europe is neither old , nor old-fashioned .
europe is in its prime .

my vision of europe includes lasting diversity .

diversity has characterized europe for centuries , and diversity feeds the common european identity .

competition allows citizens and companies to identify where to base the services their taxes help provide .
if these are to be tied to a region or a country in the long-run , their hosts need to budget well and meet their responsibilities .
decentralization is a way to prevent governments from collecting extortionate taxes only in order to dole out subsidies and create mountains of debt .
anti-regulation according to my vision , europe recognizes the challenges and opportunities afforded by the principle of subsidiarity .
europe must be able to distinguish between areas in which standardized political structures make sense , and those in which a better alternative is freedom of choice exercised by eu member countries , bodies and citizens .
there are plenty of opportunities to learn from mistakes - such as the watered-down services directive , which saw the old eu countries ' guardians of vested rights succeed in asserting protectionism over competition .

love is blind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dyed-in-the-wool european the europe of the future is a citizens ' europe .
today , europe is much closer to its citizens than they realize .
but they still do n't identify with it .
an ambivalent situation .
on the one hand europe is showered with love , with the younger generation particularly keen to describe themselves as europeans and actively contributing to its ever-evolving identity .
on the other hand , this love can be blind - because the eu , as it stands , is seen as out of touch with its citizens and mired in red tape .
this ambivalence needs to be dealt with .
for there to be a citizens ' europe , its citizens need to identify with it .
transparency , reduced red tape , better law-making , legislation with time limits and an assessment of the follow-up costs of legislation are the least that we can expect .
how can these goals be reached ?
for example , by tackling one key aspect of the eu - its financing .
a reform would create a simpler , more transparent system .
special treatments and exemptions need to be done away with - such as what 's known as the " british discount . "
a customized eu tax should not be tolerated .
so long as the eu remains a not-quite democracy , with decisions regarding the profit and loss accounting of taxpayers ' money made in parliament , the eu should not be granted tax authority .
the europe of the future needs to pursue solid , people-oriented politics which allow the public to experience a common europe first-hand .
only then will it be taking its first steps away from a technocracy and towards its citizens .
a two-speed europe europe will continue to grow - that much is clear .
the balkan countries , turkey , countries in eastern europe - they are all eyeing membership .
can the eu withstand this enlargement ?
there is a simple answer : every country should become as european as it wishes .
there is no doubt that we need to hold on to the basic principles of european success .
but partners can only work together when they want to .
a two-speed europe should be openly welcomed , so that countries deeply committed to the european project do not end up dragged down by ones that are more hesitant and less committed .
a two-speed europe already exists when dealing with the euro and various other political issues , although few will admit it .

" something had to happen with the state banks and the crisis sped up that process , " he said , adding that there is a growing tendency among private banks to consolidate .

" allianz never got dresdner bank under control , " said dieter hein , a bank analyst at fairesearch , adding that the combination of an insurance company and bank has seldom proven profitable .
" a new concept needs to be put in place and that is definitely better to implement with a different bank . " employees to pay the price ? such a merger would likely end up with thousands of bank employees being made redundant as services and branch offices were combined , according to franz scheidel , a member of dresdner 's workers council .
german media have reported that as many as 16,000 people could lose their jobs in a commerzbank-dresdner tie up . french banking giant bnp paribas has also been named as a potential dresdener suitor .

" but the burdens of global citizenship bind us together , " he said , speaking under the central berlin landmark of the victory column facing towards the brandenburg gate . partnership among nations was not a choice but the only way to protect the security of europe and the us , the democratic party presidential hopeful said . obama challenged a new generation of americans and europeans to tear down walls between estranged allies , races , and faiths in his soaring call for global unity . " that is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another , " he said in reference to the berlin wall that divided the city from 1961 to 1989 . " partnerhip is not a choice but a means of survival " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama spoke of partnerships between nations in a speech that risked being seen as presumptuous , considering obama will not even face us voters for another three months , he warned of a world where partnership was not a choice but the only means of survival . " no one nation , no matter how large or powerful , can defeat such challenges alone , " he said , signaling that , if elected president , he would end what many europeans see as the unilateral foreign policy approach of president george w bush . obama also made clear he would not take the us into isolation . " that is why america can not turn inward .
that is why europe can not turn inward , " he said . crowds respond to barack ' n ' roll a party atmosphere gripped the crowds around the victory column monument as people listened to the man many hoped would replace george w bush as leader of the world 's most powerful nation . a roar went up from the multi-ethnic crowd when obama strolled confidently onto the stage to talk of the us-german partnership and the need to strengthen transatlantic relations to meet the challenges of the 21st century . bildunterschrift : supporters had more than the white house in mind around 100,000 lined the boulevard linking the victory column to the brandenburg gate , where obama had originally intended to speak but later dropped the plan after merkel signaled her disapproval at the site being used for foreign election campaign speeches . many of those present queued patiently for over an hour outside 20 airport-style security gates where they were required to empty their pockets and dispense with drinks containers . once inside they were able to refresh themselves with plastic mugs of german beer and snacks as a pop band livened up the audience on a warm mid-summer evening . no banners or placards were allowed on the strip guarded by around 1,000 police and other security officers as the obama team sought to ensure that no unwelcome slogans were aired on us television . but democrats inside distributed us flags to their supporters and a green poster was held aloft by an obama fan with the words " i love barack ' n ' roll . " outside the entrance gates to the security zone , us democrats wearing obama ' 08 buttons launched a recruitment drive , yelling out " us citizens register to vote . " obama talks of breaking down global walls the strikingly audacious speech , in a fevered atmosphere in berlin 's famed tiergarten , took the white house race out of us borders in a way never seen before , and was designed to portray obama as a leader with unique global appeal . bildunterschrift : the huge crowd responded to obama 's calls for unity " the walls between old allies on either side of the atlantic can not stand , " he said , referring to festering divisions between europe and the united states opened up by the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . " the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least can not stand , " said obama , in an address beamed live on us and german television channels and to viewers around the world . " the walls between races and tribes ; natives and immigrants ; christian and muslim and jew can not stand .
these now are the walls we must tear down , " obama said , drawing cheers and applause . obama 's speech was a clear echo of former us president ronald reagan 's call to then soviet leader mikhael gorbachev in berlin in 1987 to " tear down this wall , " before the fall of communism . full of passion , short of specifics despite its soaring cadences however , the speech was short on specifics .

2008 former bosnian serb leader and top war crimes suspect radovan karadzic hid behind the identity of a soldier killed by a sarajevo sniper 15 years ago , serbian media reported thursday , july 24 . karadzic 's alias was part of an elaborate charade that included a long white beard , a mistress and an alternative medicine website .
it ended after 12 years on the run with his arrest monday this week in belgrade .
he had identity papers issued in the name of dragan david dabic , a bosnian serb soldier in his late 30s who was killed in the bosnian capital in 1993 during the country 's ethnic war , serbian media reported .
and karadzic allegedly stole 36 million marks from the bosnian serb region 's central bank in 1997 , when he was already undercover , a bosnian newspaper said thursday .
serbian intelligence involved ?
serb authorities are expected to turn over karadzic within days to the un war crimes tribunal in the hague , where he faces charges including genocide and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1992-95 war .
karadzic , 63 , will tell the tribunal " he is proud of everything he did and for saving serbs in bosnia , " his lawyer svetozar vujacic told the politika daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic , seen here in 1995 , underwent a complete metamorphosis during more than a dozen years in hiding in plain sight karadzic will prove that the accusations are false and that he is charged only because he is a serb , his lawyer added .
serbia 's secret service is widely believed to have helped karadzic with his undercover life .
his fake documents were issued legally in ruma , 50 kilometers north-west of belgrade , most probably with the help of bosnian serb officials , reports said .
false documents were also used by other war crimes suspects arrested in serbia .
stojan zupljanin , who was arrested on june 11 in the serbian town pancevo , had documents under the name of a man who died more than 10 years ago .
zupljanin , a former bosnian serb police commander , has been indicted by the un war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity .
in serbia , proof of citizenship , a birth certificate or an old identity card are needed to obtain identity documents .
one also needs to give a fingerprint .
karadzic was not a citizen of serbia .
karadzic stole funds , paper says a bosnian newspaper thursday quoted a 2005 a interview it conducted with milorad dodik , currently prime minister of the serb entity in bosnia , in which he claimed that karadzic in 1997 stole 36 million german marks from the region 's central bank .
" there are documents that karadzic in the spring of 1997 took 36 million marks in a bag from banja luka , " dnevni avaz quoted dodik as saying .
" he first took 28 million marks from the bank 's safe and then eight more . "
since karadzic 's arrest , dodik has offered to help karadzic 's family travel to the hague and visit him .
the family can not travel without the permission of the international representative in bosnia .
they 've asked for their documents to be returned to them so that they can visit him in belgrade jail , saying that travelling to the hague is too costly .
" after 10 years of hell , i do n't see why somebody will profit from denying us this , " said karadzic 's daughter sonja karadzic jovicevic .
two years ago , karadzic posing as dragan david dabic spent a summer holiday on the croatian adriatic island of ciovo , croatian media reported thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 24.07.2008 eu proposes partial ban on seal products großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials have n't clearly defined ' humane ' killing the european commission has proposed banning products made from seals killed in inhumane ways .
a former film diva and the world 's largest seal hunting nation are not happy with the plan - albeit for different reasons . the eu proposal would ban seal products from the bloc 's market unless they were proven to come from animals that had been killed with " hunting techniques consistent with high animal-welfare standards " and that the animals did not suffer more than necessary . seals are hunted mainly for their pelts but also for meat and fat , which is used in beauty products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hunter clubs a seal in canada " the images of seal hunting that circulate around the globe every year are a reminder of the often gruesome practices used to kill seals , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told journalists . " european citizens find these practices repugnant and in contradiction to our standards of animal welfare , " he added . the ban still has to be approved by eu governments and the european parliament . slippery slope ? the main target country of the ban is canada , where hunters slaughtered some 275,000 seals along the atlantic coast this year .
canada accounts for nearly a third of young seals killed each year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harper is cautioning the eu against a ban canadian premier stephen harper already voiced his opposition to the plan early this month , saying that his country " will not stand by and accept measures that fly in the face of accepted international practices . " his fisheries minister , loyola hearn , on wednesday , july 23 , also warned eu officials against going down a " slippery slope . " " to bow to misinformation and emotional rhetoric in restricting the trade of humanely harvested animals would set a dangerous precedent for all wild hunts , " he said . hearn added that seals were killed humanely in canada and seal products from his country would therefore not be affected by the ban . fisheries department spokesman phil jenkins meanwhile told afp news service that the eu has " not said exactly what they will consider to be humane or inhumane , so we do n't know yet what bar we have to reach to comply . " canada , greenland and namibia account for about 60 percent of the 900,000 seals hunted each year .
seals are also hunted in iceland , norway , russia , and the united states as well as in eu members britain , finland and sweden . " a historic step " animal rights activists meanwhile welcomed the proposal . " this announcement is a historic step forward in the campaign to end cruel commercial seal hunts , " said mark glover , head of the british arm of the humane society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bardot is generally pleased with the ban french actress-turned-animal-activist brigitte bardot , who has led a campaign against the killing of seals , regretted that " slaughters will continue as long as they are done in a humane way . " but bardot , who has made headlines in the past few years for supporting ultra-right politicians in france , was still happy about the plan . " a 30-year-long battle ... is about to be won , " bardot told ap news service . french president nicolas sarkozy has reportedly assured bardot that " everything would be done " during the french presidency of the european union to adopt a law banning imports of seal products in the eu . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poland has led strategic criticism , saying russia may gain a massive advantage by piping the gas outside the borders of intermediate nations . hieckmann said he expected delays because dumped wartime ammunition would have to be recovered from the baltic seabed before the pipeline is laid and because of the " political friction " in the permissions process .

it ended after 12 years on the run with his arrest monday this week in belgrade .
he had identity papers issued in the name of dragan david dabic , a bosnian serb soldier in his late 30s who was killed in the bosnian capital in 1993 during the country 's ethnic war , serbian media reported .
and karadzic allegedly stole 36 million marks from the bosnian serb region 's central bank in 1997 , when he was already undercover , a bosnian newspaper said thursday .

" there are documents that karadzic in the spring of 1997 took 36 million marks in a bag from banja luka , " dnevni avaz quoted dodik as saying .
" he first took 28 million marks from the bank 's safe and then eight more . "
since karadzic 's arrest , dodik has offered to help karadzic 's family travel to the hague and visit him .
the family can not travel without the permission of the international representative in bosnia .
they 've asked for their documents to be returned to them so that they can visit him in belgrade jail , saying that travelling to the hague is too costly .
" after 10 years of hell , i do n't see why somebody will profit from denying us this , " said karadzic 's daughter sonja karadzic jovicevic .
two years ago , karadzic posing as dragan david dabic spent a summer holiday on the croatian adriatic island of ciovo , croatian media reported thursday .

2008 former bosnian serb leader and top war crimes suspect radovan karadzic hid behind the identity of a soldier killed by a sarajevo sniper 15 years ago , serbian media reported thursday , july 24 . karadzic 's alias was part of an elaborate charade that included a long white beard , a mistress and an alternative medicine website .
it ended after 12 years on the run with his arrest monday this week in belgrade .
he had identity papers issued in the name of dragan david dabic , a bosnian serb soldier in his late 30s who was killed in the bosnian capital in 1993 during the country 's ethnic war , serbian media reported .
and karadzic allegedly stole 36 million marks from the bosnian serb region 's central bank in 1997 , when he was already undercover , a bosnian newspaper said thursday .
serbian intelligence involved ?
serb authorities are expected to turn over karadzic within days to the un war crimes tribunal in the hague , where he faces charges including genocide and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1992-95 war .
karadzic , 63 , will tell the tribunal " he is proud of everything he did and for saving serbs in bosnia , " his lawyer svetozar vujacic told the politika daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic , seen here in 1995 , underwent a complete metamorphosis during more than a dozen years in hiding in plain sight karadzic will prove that the accusations are false and that he is charged only because he is a serb , his lawyer added .
serbia 's secret service is widely believed to have helped karadzic with his undercover life .
his fake documents were issued legally in ruma , 50 kilometers north-west of belgrade , most probably with the help of bosnian serb officials , reports said .
false documents were also used by other war crimes suspects arrested in serbia .
stojan zupljanin , who was arrested on june 11 in the serbian town pancevo , had documents under the name of a man who died more than 10 years ago .

" there are documents that karadzic in the spring of 1997 took 36 million marks in a bag from banja luka , " dnevni avaz quoted dodik as saying .
" he first took 28 million marks from the bank 's safe and then eight more . "
since karadzic 's arrest , dodik has offered to help karadzic 's family travel to the hague and visit him .
the family can not travel without the permission of the international representative in bosnia .
they 've asked for their documents to be returned to them so that they can visit him in belgrade jail , saying that travelling to the hague is too costly .
" after 10 years of hell , i do n't see why somebody will profit from denying us this , " said karadzic 's daughter sonja karadzic jovicevic .

a statement issued by france , which currently holds the eu presidency , on thursday , july 24 , reminded tehran it had pledged to introduce a moratorium on stoning and urged it to abide by its commitments and international standards .
" the european union calls on the iranian government and parliament to abolish , in law and in practice , recourse to cruel and degrading punishment and , in particular the use of stoning , as a method of execution , " the statement read .
news reports say the eight women , ranging in age from 27 to 43 , had convictions including prostitution , incest and adultery .
the man , a 50-year-old music teacher , was convicted of illegal sex with a student .
the last officially reported stoning in the islamic republic was carried out on a man a year ago which sparked criticism from rights groups , the european union and a top un official .
iran 's judiciary chief ayatollah mohmoud hashemi-shahroudi ordered a moratorium on stoning in 2002 .
iran , saudi arabia world leaders in executions the eu 's concerns over the death by stoning sentences in iran coincided with the release of a new report by a rome-based anti-death penalty group .
it showed that though a global trend towards abolition of the death penalty continued in 2007 with the number of countries practicing capital punishment dropping to 49 from 51 in the previous year , the number of executions worldwide increased .
the group , called hands off cain , presented its findings in the 2008 edition of its annual report , which covers the first six months of the year and 2007 .
at least 5,851 executions were carried out in 2007 up from the 5,635 registered in 2006 and 5,494 in 2005 , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these two chinese men were executed on drug-related charges in 1996 the surge was " in large part " due to the increased number of executions in iran , up by one-third , and saudi arabia where the number of people executed quadrupled , it said .
china put to death at least 5,000 people , accounting for 85.4 percent of the world total .
iran , which executed at least 355 people , and saudi arabia 166 , filled the other top three places of what the report called the " terrible podium " of capital-punishment practicing countries .
most executions in asia ; us to blame too other countries where the number of people executed numbered more than 10 included pakistan , with at least 134 , the united states where 42 people were put to death , iraq with at least 33 , vietnam with at least 25 , yemen and afghanistan , both with at least 15 , and north korea with at least 13 .
the report noted how the " prevalent situation worldwide " including china , vietnam , belarus and mongolia , was for governments to conceal the number of executions , making it difficult to provide exact figures .
" it points to the fact that the fight against the death penalty entails , beyond the stopping of executions , a battle for democracy , for the respect of the rule of law and for political rights and civil liberties , " the report said .
asia remained the region where the vast majority of executions are carried out , while the americas " would be practically death-penalty free were it not for the united states , the only country on the continent to execute anyone in 2007 , " the report noted .
in africa , the death penalty was carried out in seven countries - botswana -lrb- at least one -rrb- , egypt -lrb- actual number unknown -rrb- , ethiopia -lrb- one -rrb- , equatorial new guinea -lrb- three -rrb- , libya -lrb- at least nine -rrb- , somalia -lrb- at least five -rrb- and sudan -lrb- at least seven -rrb- .
in 2007 and in the first six months of 2008 nine countries moved from retention to a form of abolition of the death penalty .
rwanda went from retentionist to abolitionist in july of 2007 with a law that abolished the death penalty for all crimes , while kyrgyzstan abolished the death penalty in january 2007 , after years of moratorium .
uzbekistan went from retentionist to abolitionist on january 1 , 2008.these moves were partly offset by the resumption of executions in afghanistan and ethiopia after several years of suspension , the report said .
belarus a blemish on europe " in europe , the only blemish on an otherwise completely death penalty-free zone continues to be belarus , where at least one person was executed in 2007 and three in the first five months of 2008 , " the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has led a campaign to abolish capital punishment worldwide hands off cain hailed the december 2007 adoption by the united nations general assembly of a resolution that calls upon all member states that still maintain the death penalty to establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing them .
the group announced it had bestowed its " abolitionist of the year 2008 " award on former italian prime minister romano prodi , who during his time in office led a campaign to bring the resolution before the un general assembly . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu family law requires unanimous support in order to be enacted . provided that the european commission accepts the divorce initiative , it then has to be approved by a qualified majority of the bloc 's 27 member states . small factions lead the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu politicians are considering how to proceed after the irish rejected the lisbon treaty enhanced cooperation is regarded as one of the ways the eu can stem off paralysis across the bloc , which may increasingly come into play if it fails to quickly overcome ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty . that treaty , which also requires unanimous ratification to go into effect , would have simplified voting procedures in addition to changing the eu 's approach to foreign policy .
the european union 's reliance on unanimous decision-making comes under frequent criticism for paralyzing the bloc . except for issues with military or defense implications , eu treaties allow for pioneer groups but the clause has never been used before . " enhanced cooperation is a very sensitive issue because it has never been implemented , " a french diplomat said , according to reuters news agency .
" it allows several member states to go forward faster than others , and it is not necessarily the image we want to give of the eu . " some 170,000 international marriages end in divorce in the european union each year but there are no common rules dictating which country 's laws to apply .
spouses sometimes rush to court in their country of origin to try to get the law on their side . marriage and divorce laws differ widely across the 27-nation eu , from the liberal nordic nations to catholic poland and ireland .

" but the burdens of global citizenship bind us together , " he said , speaking under the central berlin landmark of the victory column facing towards the brandenburg gate . partnership among nations was not a choice but the only way to protect the security of europe and the us , the democratic party presidential hopeful said . obama challenged a new generation of americans and europeans to tear down walls between estranged allies , races , and faiths in his soaring call for global unity . " that is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another , " he said in reference to the berlin wall that divided the city from 1961 to 1989 .

" obama talks of breaking down global walls the strikingly audacious speech , in a fevered atmosphere in berlin 's famed tiergarten , took the white house race out of us borders in a way never seen before , and was designed to portray obama as a leader with unique global appeal . bildunterschrift : the huge crowd responded to obama 's calls for unity " the walls between old allies on either side of the atlantic can not stand , " he said , referring to festering divisions between europe and the united states opened up by the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . " the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least can not stand , " said obama , in an address beamed live on us and german television channels and to viewers around the world . " the walls between races and tribes ; natives and immigrants ; christian and muslim and jew can not stand .
these now are the walls we must tear down , " obama said , drawing cheers and applause . obama 's speech was a clear echo of former us president ronald reagan 's call to then soviet leader mikhael gorbachev in berlin in 1987 to " tear down this wall , " before the fall of communism . full of passion , short of specifics despite its soaring cadences however , the speech was short on specifics .

" i also know how much i love america .
i know that for more than two centuries , we have strived , at great cost and great sacrifice , to form a more perfect union ; to seek , with other nations , a more hopeful world , " he said . " in europe , the view that america is part of what has gone wrong in our world , rather than a force to help make it right , has become all too common , " the 46-year-old first term senator said . " in america , there are voices that deride and deny the importance of europe 's role in our security and our future .
both views miss the truth . " obama , who has a narrow lead in most polls of the us race , but trails mccain when voters are asked who would be the most credible commander in chief , used berlin 's triumph over division and totalitarianism as a metaphor for the world he hoped to forge . " people of the world - look at berlin , where a wall came down , a continent came together , and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one , " obama said . he also promised america under his watch would be serious about tackling global warning , a huge concern in europe and a cause of rifts between the continent and the united states during the bush administration . europe needs to do its part , obama urges but he also signaled he would demand europe live up to its side of the bargain , asking for more help in the struggle against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan . " america can not do this alone , " obama said .
" the afghan people need our troops and your troops ; our support and your support to defeat the taliban and al-qaeda , to develop their economy , and to help them rebuild their nation . " we have too much at stake to turn back now . " obama is vowing to pour at least two more combat brigades into afghanistan , which is currently being pummeled by a rise in extremist violence and attacks , if he is elected president - with some troops to be redeployed from iraq . his aides have said that he believes nato nations should provide more troops for the conflict , and remove operating restrictions on forces that are already there . in an interview with cbs news on monday during his first-ever trip to the war-torn nation , obama warned conditions were " precarious and urgent " and also called on the afghan government to do more to stabilize the country . merkel resists obama pressure over troops bildunterschrift : merkel was firm on troops during the cordial meeting before giving his speech , obama on thursday met german chancellor angela merkel , who signaled clearly a day before that she would resist any pressure to send more troops to afghanistan . merkel said germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission .
we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- , " she said . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president . " an apparently worsening security situation in afghanistan has seen troop deaths there exceed those in iraq for the second month in a row . forty-nine soldiers from the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and the separate us-led coalition died in combat , attacks or accidents in june , according to an afp tally based on military statements . by contrast , 31 soldiers including 29 americans , were killed in iraq in june despite the fact that there are more than twice as many troops there as in afghanistan , icasualties.org figures showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do n't expect the first natural gas to arrive till 2012 , " said andreas hieckmann , the project chief at the gazprom germania company . his comment clashed with a printed news release from nord stream , a consortium with russian , german and dutch involvement , which stated that 2011 was the target for the first flow . he was speaking in waren , north of berlin , where gazprom is studying the suitability of a bed of deep rock to store the gas in after it lands . nord stream said it aimed to complete a multinational environmental review of the undersea route by the end of this year . unfair advantage ? sweden has echoed environmentalists who fear the seabed trench for the pipes may kill sea life and stir up toxic material .
poland has led strategic criticism , saying russia may gain a massive advantage by piping the gas outside the borders of intermediate nations . hieckmann said he expected delays because dumped wartime ammunition would have to be recovered from the baltic seabed before the pipeline is laid and because of the " political friction " in the permissions process . " even if the regulatory procedures go according to plan , it will be a complex construction job , " he said . when complete , the line will transport 27.5 billion cubic meters -lrb- 971 million cubic feet -rrb- of gas annually to western europe .
after landing on the german coast , the line will split , with one , codenamed nel , bound west , and the other , the opal , bound south . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but the burdens of global citizenship bind us together , " he said , speaking under the central berlin landmark of the victory column facing towards the brandenburg gate . partnership among nations was not a choice but the only way to protect the security of europe and the us , the democratic party presidential hopeful said . obama challenged a new generation of americans and europeans to tear down walls between estranged allies , races , and faiths in his soaring call for global unity . " that is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another , " he said in reference to the berlin wall that divided the city from 1961 to 1989 . " partnerhip is not a choice but a means of survival " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama spoke of partnerships between nations in a speech that risked being seen as presumptuous , considering obama will not even face us voters for another three months , he warned of a world where partnership was not a choice but the only means of survival . " no one nation , no matter how large or powerful , can defeat such challenges alone , " he said , signaling that , if elected president , he would end what many europeans see as the unilateral foreign policy approach of president george w bush . obama also made clear he would not take the us into isolation . " that is why america can not turn inward .
that is why europe can not turn inward , " he said . crowds respond to barack ' n ' roll a party atmosphere gripped the crowds around the victory column monument as people listened to the man many hoped would replace george w bush as leader of the world 's most powerful nation . a roar went up from the multi-ethnic crowd when obama strolled confidently onto the stage to talk of the us-german partnership and the need to strengthen transatlantic relations to meet the challenges of the 21st century . bildunterschrift : supporters had more than the white house in mind around 100,000 lined the boulevard linking the victory column to the brandenburg gate , where obama had originally intended to speak but later dropped the plan after merkel signaled her disapproval at the site being used for foreign election campaign speeches . many of those present queued patiently for over an hour outside 20 airport-style security gates where they were required to empty their pockets and dispense with drinks containers . once inside they were able to refresh themselves with plastic mugs of german beer and snacks as a pop band livened up the audience on a warm mid-summer evening . no banners or placards were allowed on the strip guarded by around 1,000 police and other security officers as the obama team sought to ensure that no unwelcome slogans were aired on us television . but democrats inside distributed us flags to their supporters and a green poster was held aloft by an obama fan with the words " i love barack ' n ' roll . " outside the entrance gates to the security zone , us democrats wearing obama ' 08 buttons launched a recruitment drive , yelling out " us citizens register to vote . " obama talks of breaking down global walls the strikingly audacious speech , in a fevered atmosphere in berlin 's famed tiergarten , took the white house race out of us borders in a way never seen before , and was designed to portray obama as a leader with unique global appeal . bildunterschrift : the huge crowd responded to obama 's calls for unity " the walls between old allies on either side of the atlantic can not stand , " he said , referring to festering divisions between europe and the united states opened up by the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . " the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least can not stand , " said obama , in an address beamed live on us and german television channels and to viewers around the world . " the walls between races and tribes ; natives and immigrants ; christian and muslim and jew can not stand .
these now are the walls we must tear down , " obama said , drawing cheers and applause . obama 's speech was a clear echo of former us president ronald reagan 's call to then soviet leader mikhael gorbachev in berlin in 1987 to " tear down this wall , " before the fall of communism . full of passion , short of specifics despite its soaring cadences however , the speech was short on specifics .
obama 's aides said he would not talk policy as that is the job of a president but his critics will likely slam him for empty rhetoric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands stood listening in the balmy berlin evening the illinois senator rebuked both his country and europe for blaming one another for strains in their relations , but took pains to insulate himself from critics back home who doubt his patriotism .
" i also know how much i love america .
i know that for more than two centuries , we have strived , at great cost and great sacrifice , to form a more perfect union ; to seek , with other nations , a more hopeful world , " he said . " in europe , the view that america is part of what has gone wrong in our world , rather than a force to help make it right , has become all too common , " the 46-year-old first term senator said . " in america , there are voices that deride and deny the importance of europe 's role in our security and our future .
both views miss the truth . " obama , who has a narrow lead in most polls of the us race , but trails mccain when voters are asked who would be the most credible commander in chief , used berlin 's triumph over division and totalitarianism as a metaphor for the world he hoped to forge . " people of the world - look at berlin , where a wall came down , a continent came together , and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one , " obama said . he also promised america under his watch would be serious about tackling global warning , a huge concern in europe and a cause of rifts between the continent and the united states during the bush administration . europe needs to do its part , obama urges but he also signaled he would demand europe live up to its side of the bargain , asking for more help in the struggle against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan . " america can not do this alone , " obama said .
" the afghan people need our troops and your troops ; our support and your support to defeat the taliban and al-qaeda , to develop their economy , and to help them rebuild their nation . " we have too much at stake to turn back now . " obama is vowing to pour at least two more combat brigades into afghanistan , which is currently being pummeled by a rise in extremist violence and attacks , if he is elected president - with some troops to be redeployed from iraq . his aides have said that he believes nato nations should provide more troops for the conflict , and remove operating restrictions on forces that are already there . in an interview with cbs news on monday during his first-ever trip to the war-torn nation , obama warned conditions were " precarious and urgent " and also called on the afghan government to do more to stabilize the country . merkel resists obama pressure over troops bildunterschrift : merkel was firm on troops during the cordial meeting before giving his speech , obama on thursday met german chancellor angela merkel , who signaled clearly a day before that she would resist any pressure to send more troops to afghanistan . merkel said germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission .
we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- , " she said . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president . " an apparently worsening security situation in afghanistan has seen troop deaths there exceed those in iraq for the second month in a row . forty-nine soldiers from the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and the separate us-led coalition died in combat , attacks or accidents in june , according to an afp tally based on military statements . by contrast , 31 soldiers including 29 americans , were killed in iraq in june despite the fact that there are more than twice as many troops there as in afghanistan , icasualties.org figures showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a statement issued by france , which currently holds the eu presidency , on thursday , july 24 , reminded tehran it had pledged to introduce a moratorium on stoning and urged it to abide by its commitments and international standards .
" the european union calls on the iranian government and parliament to abolish , in law and in practice , recourse to cruel and degrading punishment and , in particular the use of stoning , as a method of execution , " the statement read .
news reports say the eight women , ranging in age from 27 to 43 , had convictions including prostitution , incest and adultery .
the man , a 50-year-old music teacher , was convicted of illegal sex with a student .
the last officially reported stoning in the islamic republic was carried out on a man a year ago which sparked criticism from rights groups , the european union and a top un official .
iran 's judiciary chief ayatollah mohmoud hashemi-shahroudi ordered a moratorium on stoning in 2002 .
iran , saudi arabia world leaders in executions the eu 's concerns over the death by stoning sentences in iran coincided with the release of a new report by a rome-based anti-death penalty group .
it showed that though a global trend towards abolition of the death penalty continued in 2007 with the number of countries practicing capital punishment dropping to 49 from 51 in the previous year , the number of executions worldwide increased .
the group , called hands off cain , presented its findings in the 2008 edition of its annual report , which covers the first six months of the year and 2007 .
at least 5,851 executions were carried out in 2007 up from the 5,635 registered in 2006 and 5,494 in 2005 , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these two chinese men were executed on drug-related charges in 1996 the surge was " in large part " due to the increased number of executions in iran , up by one-third , and saudi arabia where the number of people executed quadrupled , it said .
china put to death at least 5,000 people , accounting for 85.4 percent of the world total .
iran , which executed at least 355 people , and saudi arabia 166 , filled the other top three places of what the report called the " terrible podium " of capital-punishment practicing countries .
most executions in asia ; us to blame too other countries where the number of people executed numbered more than 10 included pakistan , with at least 134 , the united states where 42 people were put to death , iraq with at least 33 , vietnam with at least 25 , yemen and afghanistan , both with at least 15 , and north korea with at least 13 .
the report noted how the " prevalent situation worldwide " including china , vietnam , belarus and mongolia , was for governments to conceal the number of executions , making it difficult to provide exact figures .
" it points to the fact that the fight against the death penalty entails , beyond the stopping of executions , a battle for democracy , for the respect of the rule of law and for political rights and civil liberties , " the report said .
asia remained the region where the vast majority of executions are carried out , while the americas " would be practically death-penalty free were it not for the united states , the only country on the continent to execute anyone in 2007 , " the report noted .
in africa , the death penalty was carried out in seven countries - botswana -lrb- at least one -rrb- , egypt -lrb- actual number unknown -rrb- , ethiopia -lrb- one -rrb- , equatorial new guinea -lrb- three -rrb- , libya -lrb- at least nine -rrb- , somalia -lrb- at least five -rrb- and sudan -lrb- at least seven -rrb- .
in 2007 and in the first six months of 2008 nine countries moved from retention to a form of abolition of the death penalty .
rwanda went from retentionist to abolitionist in july of 2007 with a law that abolished the death penalty for all crimes , while kyrgyzstan abolished the death penalty in january 2007 , after years of moratorium .
uzbekistan went from retentionist to abolitionist on january 1 , 2008.these moves were partly offset by the resumption of executions in afghanistan and ethiopia after several years of suspension , the report said .
belarus a blemish on europe " in europe , the only blemish on an otherwise completely death penalty-free zone continues to be belarus , where at least one person was executed in 2007 and three in the first five months of 2008 , " the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has led a campaign to abolish capital punishment worldwide hands off cain hailed the december 2007 adoption by the united nations general assembly of a resolution that calls upon all member states that still maintain the death penalty to establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing them .
the group announced it had bestowed its " abolitionist of the year 2008 " award on former italian prime minister romano prodi , who during his time in office led a campaign to bring the resolution before the un general assembly . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the man , a 50-year-old music teacher , was convicted of illegal sex with a student .
the last officially reported stoning in the islamic republic was carried out on a man a year ago which sparked criticism from rights groups , the european union and a top un official .
iran 's judiciary chief ayatollah mohmoud hashemi-shahroudi ordered a moratorium on stoning in 2002 .
iran , saudi arabia world leaders in executions the eu 's concerns over the death by stoning sentences in iran coincided with the release of a new report by a rome-based anti-death penalty group .
it showed that though a global trend towards abolition of the death penalty continued in 2007 with the number of countries practicing capital punishment dropping to 49 from 51 in the previous year , the number of executions worldwide increased .
the group , called hands off cain , presented its findings in the 2008 edition of its annual report , which covers the first six months of the year and 2007 .
at least 5,851 executions were carried out in 2007 up from the 5,635 registered in 2006 and 5,494 in 2005 , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these two chinese men were executed on drug-related charges in 1996 the surge was " in large part " due to the increased number of executions in iran , up by one-third , and saudi arabia where the number of people executed quadrupled , it said .
china put to death at least 5,000 people , accounting for 85.4 percent of the world total .
iran , which executed at least 355 people , and saudi arabia 166 , filled the other top three places of what the report called the " terrible podium " of capital-punishment practicing countries .
most executions in asia ; us to blame too other countries where the number of people executed numbered more than 10 included pakistan , with at least 134 , the united states where 42 people were put to death , iraq with at least 33 , vietnam with at least 25 , yemen and afghanistan , both with at least 15 , and north korea with at least 13 .
the report noted how the " prevalent situation worldwide " including china , vietnam , belarus and mongolia , was for governments to conceal the number of executions , making it difficult to provide exact figures .
" it points to the fact that the fight against the death penalty entails , beyond the stopping of executions , a battle for democracy , for the respect of the rule of law and for political rights and civil liberties , " the report said .
asia remained the region where the vast majority of executions are carried out , while the americas " would be practically death-penalty free were it not for the united states , the only country on the continent to execute anyone in 2007 , " the report noted .
in africa , the death penalty was carried out in seven countries - botswana -lrb- at least one -rrb- , egypt -lrb- actual number unknown -rrb- , ethiopia -lrb- one -rrb- , equatorial new guinea -lrb- three -rrb- , libya -lrb- at least nine -rrb- , somalia -lrb- at least five -rrb- and sudan -lrb- at least seven -rrb- .
in 2007 and in the first six months of 2008 nine countries moved from retention to a form of abolition of the death penalty .
rwanda went from retentionist to abolitionist in july of 2007 with a law that abolished the death penalty for all crimes , while kyrgyzstan abolished the death penalty in january 2007 , after years of moratorium .
uzbekistan went from retentionist to abolitionist on january 1 , 2008.these moves were partly offset by the resumption of executions in afghanistan and ethiopia after several years of suspension , the report said .
belarus a blemish on europe " in europe , the only blemish on an otherwise completely death penalty-free zone continues to be belarus , where at least one person was executed in 2007 and three in the first five months of 2008 , " the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has led a campaign to abolish capital punishment worldwide hands off cain hailed the december 2007 adoption by the united nations general assembly of a resolution that calls upon all member states that still maintain the death penalty to establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing them .
the group announced it had bestowed its " abolitionist of the year 2008 " award on former italian prime minister romano prodi , who during his time in office led a campaign to bring the resolution before the un general assembly . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu family law requires unanimous support in order to be enacted . provided that the european commission accepts the divorce initiative , it then has to be approved by a qualified majority of the bloc 's 27 member states . small factions lead the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu politicians are considering how to proceed after the irish rejected the lisbon treaty enhanced cooperation is regarded as one of the ways the eu can stem off paralysis across the bloc , which may increasingly come into play if it fails to quickly overcome ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty . that treaty , which also requires unanimous ratification to go into effect , would have simplified voting procedures in addition to changing the eu 's approach to foreign policy .
the european union 's reliance on unanimous decision-making comes under frequent criticism for paralyzing the bloc . except for issues with military or defense implications , eu treaties allow for pioneer groups but the clause has never been used before . " enhanced cooperation is a very sensitive issue because it has never been implemented , " a french diplomat said , according to reuters news agency .
" it allows several member states to go forward faster than others , and it is not necessarily the image we want to give of the eu . " some 170,000 international marriages end in divorce in the european union each year but there are no common rules dictating which country 's laws to apply .
spouses sometimes rush to court in their country of origin to try to get the law on their side . marriage and divorce laws differ widely across the 27-nation eu , from the liberal nordic nations to catholic poland and ireland .

eu family law requires unanimous support in order to be enacted . provided that the european commission accepts the divorce initiative , it then has to be approved by a qualified majority of the bloc 's 27 member states . small factions lead the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu politicians are considering how to proceed after the irish rejected the lisbon treaty enhanced cooperation is regarded as one of the ways the eu can stem off paralysis across the bloc , which may increasingly come into play if it fails to quickly overcome ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty . that treaty , which also requires unanimous ratification to go into effect , would have simplified voting procedures in addition to changing the eu 's approach to foreign policy .
the european union 's reliance on unanimous decision-making comes under frequent criticism for paralyzing the bloc . except for issues with military or defense implications , eu treaties allow for pioneer groups but the clause has never been used before . " enhanced cooperation is a very sensitive issue because it has never been implemented , " a french diplomat said , according to reuters news agency .
" it allows several member states to go forward faster than others , and it is not necessarily the image we want to give of the eu . " some 170,000 international marriages end in divorce in the european union each year but there are no common rules dictating which country 's laws to apply .
spouses sometimes rush to court in their country of origin to try to get the law on their side . marriage and divorce laws differ widely across the 27-nation eu , from the liberal nordic nations to catholic poland and ireland .

" but the burdens of global citizenship bind us together , " he said , speaking under the central berlin landmark of the victory column facing towards the brandenburg gate . partnership among nations was not a choice but the only way to protect the security of europe and the us , the democratic party presidential hopeful said . obama challenged a new generation of americans and europeans to tear down walls between estranged allies , races , and faiths in his soaring call for global unity . " that is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another , " he said in reference to the berlin wall that divided the city from 1961 to 1989 . " partnerhip is not a choice but a means of survival " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama spoke of partnerships between nations in a speech that risked being seen as presumptuous , considering obama will not even face us voters for another three months , he warned of a world where partnership was not a choice but the only means of survival . " no one nation , no matter how large or powerful , can defeat such challenges alone , " he said , signaling that , if elected president , he would end what many europeans see as the unilateral foreign policy approach of president george w bush . obama also made clear he would not take the us into isolation . " that is why america can not turn inward .
that is why europe can not turn inward , " he said . crowds respond to barack ' n ' roll a party atmosphere gripped the crowds around the victory column monument as people listened to the man many hoped would replace george w bush as leader of the world 's most powerful nation . a roar went up from the multi-ethnic crowd when obama strolled confidently onto the stage to talk of the us-german partnership and the need to strengthen transatlantic relations to meet the challenges of the 21st century . bildunterschrift : supporters had more than the white house in mind around 100,000 lined the boulevard linking the victory column to the brandenburg gate , where obama had originally intended to speak but later dropped the plan after merkel signaled her disapproval at the site being used for foreign election campaign speeches . many of those present queued patiently for over an hour outside 20 airport-style security gates where they were required to empty their pockets and dispense with drinks containers . once inside they were able to refresh themselves with plastic mugs of german beer and snacks as a pop band livened up the audience on a warm mid-summer evening . no banners or placards were allowed on the strip guarded by around 1,000 police and other security officers as the obama team sought to ensure that no unwelcome slogans were aired on us television . but democrats inside distributed us flags to their supporters and a green poster was held aloft by an obama fan with the words " i love barack ' n ' roll . " outside the entrance gates to the security zone , us democrats wearing obama ' 08 buttons launched a recruitment drive , yelling out " us citizens register to vote . " obama talks of breaking down global walls the strikingly audacious speech , in a fevered atmosphere in berlin 's famed tiergarten , took the white house race out of us borders in a way never seen before , and was designed to portray obama as a leader with unique global appeal . bildunterschrift : the huge crowd responded to obama 's calls for unity " the walls between old allies on either side of the atlantic can not stand , " he said , referring to festering divisions between europe and the united states opened up by the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . " the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least can not stand , " said obama , in an address beamed live on us and german television channels and to viewers around the world . " the walls between races and tribes ; natives and immigrants ; christian and muslim and jew can not stand .
these now are the walls we must tear down , " obama said , drawing cheers and applause . obama 's speech was a clear echo of former us president ronald reagan 's call to then soviet leader mikhael gorbachev in berlin in 1987 to " tear down this wall , " before the fall of communism . full of passion , short of specifics despite its soaring cadences however , the speech was short on specifics .
obama 's aides said he would not talk policy as that is the job of a president but his critics will likely slam him for empty rhetoric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands stood listening in the balmy berlin evening the illinois senator rebuked both his country and europe for blaming one another for strains in their relations , but took pains to insulate himself from critics back home who doubt his patriotism .
" i also know how much i love america .
i know that for more than two centuries , we have strived , at great cost and great sacrifice , to form a more perfect union ; to seek , with other nations , a more hopeful world , " he said . " in europe , the view that america is part of what has gone wrong in our world , rather than a force to help make it right , has become all too common , " the 46-year-old first term senator said . " in america , there are voices that deride and deny the importance of europe 's role in our security and our future .
both views miss the truth . " obama , who has a narrow lead in most polls of the us race , but trails mccain when voters are asked who would be the most credible commander in chief , used berlin 's triumph over division and totalitarianism as a metaphor for the world he hoped to forge . " people of the world - look at berlin , where a wall came down , a continent came together , and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one , " obama said . he also promised america under his watch would be serious about tackling global warning , a huge concern in europe and a cause of rifts between the continent and the united states during the bush administration . europe needs to do its part , obama urges but he also signaled he would demand europe live up to its side of the bargain , asking for more help in the struggle against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan . " america can not do this alone , " obama said .
" the afghan people need our troops and your troops ; our support and your support to defeat the taliban and al-qaeda , to develop their economy , and to help them rebuild their nation . " we have too much at stake to turn back now . " obama is vowing to pour at least two more combat brigades into afghanistan , which is currently being pummeled by a rise in extremist violence and attacks , if he is elected president - with some troops to be redeployed from iraq . his aides have said that he believes nato nations should provide more troops for the conflict , and remove operating restrictions on forces that are already there . in an interview with cbs news on monday during his first-ever trip to the war-torn nation , obama warned conditions were " precarious and urgent " and also called on the afghan government to do more to stabilize the country . merkel resists obama pressure over troops bildunterschrift : merkel was firm on troops during the cordial meeting before giving his speech , obama on thursday met german chancellor angela merkel , who signaled clearly a day before that she would resist any pressure to send more troops to afghanistan . merkel said germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission .
we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- , " she said . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president . " an apparently worsening security situation in afghanistan has seen troop deaths there exceed those in iraq for the second month in a row . forty-nine soldiers from the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and the separate us-led coalition died in combat , attacks or accidents in june , according to an afp tally based on military statements . by contrast , 31 soldiers including 29 americans , were killed in iraq in june despite the fact that there are more than twice as many troops there as in afghanistan , icasualties.org figures showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a statement issued by france , which currently holds the eu presidency , on thursday , july 24 , reminded tehran it had pledged to introduce a moratorium on stoning and urged it to abide by its commitments and international standards .
" the european union calls on the iranian government and parliament to abolish , in law and in practice , recourse to cruel and degrading punishment and , in particular the use of stoning , as a method of execution , " the statement read .
news reports say the eight women , ranging in age from 27 to 43 , had convictions including prostitution , incest and adultery .
the man , a 50-year-old music teacher , was convicted of illegal sex with a student .
the last officially reported stoning in the islamic republic was carried out on a man a year ago which sparked criticism from rights groups , the european union and a top un official .
iran 's judiciary chief ayatollah mohmoud hashemi-shahroudi ordered a moratorium on stoning in 2002 .
iran , saudi arabia world leaders in executions the eu 's concerns over the death by stoning sentences in iran coincided with the release of a new report by a rome-based anti-death penalty group .
it showed that though a global trend towards abolition of the death penalty continued in 2007 with the number of countries practicing capital punishment dropping to 49 from 51 in the previous year , the number of executions worldwide increased .
the group , called hands off cain , presented its findings in the 2008 edition of its annual report , which covers the first six months of the year and 2007 .
at least 5,851 executions were carried out in 2007 up from the 5,635 registered in 2006 and 5,494 in 2005 , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these two chinese men were executed on drug-related charges in 1996 the surge was " in large part " due to the increased number of executions in iran , up by one-third , and saudi arabia where the number of people executed quadrupled , it said .
china put to death at least 5,000 people , accounting for 85.4 percent of the world total .
iran , which executed at least 355 people , and saudi arabia 166 , filled the other top three places of what the report called the " terrible podium " of capital-punishment practicing countries .
most executions in asia ; us to blame too other countries where the number of people executed numbered more than 10 included pakistan , with at least 134 , the united states where 42 people were put to death , iraq with at least 33 , vietnam with at least 25 , yemen and afghanistan , both with at least 15 , and north korea with at least 13 .
the report noted how the " prevalent situation worldwide " including china , vietnam , belarus and mongolia , was for governments to conceal the number of executions , making it difficult to provide exact figures .
" it points to the fact that the fight against the death penalty entails , beyond the stopping of executions , a battle for democracy , for the respect of the rule of law and for political rights and civil liberties , " the report said .
asia remained the region where the vast majority of executions are carried out , while the americas " would be practically death-penalty free were it not for the united states , the only country on the continent to execute anyone in 2007 , " the report noted .
in africa , the death penalty was carried out in seven countries - botswana -lrb- at least one -rrb- , egypt -lrb- actual number unknown -rrb- , ethiopia -lrb- one -rrb- , equatorial new guinea -lrb- three -rrb- , libya -lrb- at least nine -rrb- , somalia -lrb- at least five -rrb- and sudan -lrb- at least seven -rrb- .
in 2007 and in the first six months of 2008 nine countries moved from retention to a form of abolition of the death penalty .
rwanda went from retentionist to abolitionist in july of 2007 with a law that abolished the death penalty for all crimes , while kyrgyzstan abolished the death penalty in january 2007 , after years of moratorium .
uzbekistan went from retentionist to abolitionist on january 1 , 2008.these moves were partly offset by the resumption of executions in afghanistan and ethiopia after several years of suspension , the report said .

" they were presidents , i am a citizen , " he told reporters travelling with him .
" there is no doubt that part of what i want to communicate on both sides of the atlantic is the enormous potential of us restoring a sense of coming together . " the 46-year-old presumptive democratic candidate said he wanted the united states and europe to rediscover their common ground . " obviously berlin is representative of the extraordinary success of the post world war ii effort to bring the continent together and to bring the west together , and later to bring the east and the west together , " he said .
" so i think it is a natural place to talk . " obama 's 45-minute address on trans-atlantic relations is expected to pull in tens of thousands . " hopefully -lsb- the speech -rsb- will be viewed as a substantive articulation of the relationship i 'd like to see between the united states and europe , " obama told reporters in israel shortly before leaving for germany .
" i 'm hoping to communicate across the atlantic the value of that relationship and how we need to build on it . " preparations for obama 's speech were marred after a 40-year man driving a car breached the cordoned off zone where the us presidential candidate is to speak and sprayed red paint around the area . bildunterschrift : police cordoned off the car after the paint attack the man from the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg is now in police custody , pending an investigation . earlier , a suspicious package at the swanky adlon hotel , which is close to both the us embassy and berlin 's historic brandenburg gate , triggered a security scare .
the hotel 's lobby was cleared briefly before the package was examined by explosives experts and declared that it did not represent any threat . election campaigning while berlin was in obama fever ahead of the visit , political commentators stressed that the main aim of the visit was to boost the senator 's fortunes in the us presidential race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's advance team was worried anti-american signs could sour us opinion of the speech in his speech , obama was expected to seek to revive trans-atlantic relations that suffered considerable damage under president george w. bush . europeans are looking to the illinois senator to restore a transatlantic relationship that has been strained , in particular , by president bush 's invasion of iraq . european leaders strongly support obama 's foreign policy goals including closing the guantanamo bay prison camp for terror suspects , fighting nuclear proliferation and tackling climate change with an eu-style emissions cap-and-trade plan . obama 's calls for talking directly to iran over its nuclear program and renewing us engagement in the middle east peace process have also received a warm welcome in european capitals . commentators were watching closely to discern calls for greater european contributions in afghanistan and to hear the senator 's views on pressing iran to abandon its uranium enrichment program . obama is overwhelmingly more popular in europe than his republican adversary , john mccain .
a recent poll put his german support at 76 percent . following his round of engagements in berlin , obama is to visit friday the us ramstein air force base and the us military hospital in landstuhl , which are both in the western part of germany . the presumed us democrat presidential candidate will then travel on to france .
before arriving in germany , obama visited israel , the palestinian territories , kuwait , afghanistan , iraq and jordan . no german troop changes in afghanistan asked about obama 's recent comments that he would press european nato partners for more troops for afghanistan , merkel said wednesday that germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to increase troop commitments in afghanistan " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission , " she told reporters .
" we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president , " merkel added . germany has faced growing pressure to increase the number of troops it has deployed in afghanistan and to move troops from the relatively calm north of the country to the south where us-led forces are battling tenacious taliban insurgents . in response to the calls from the united states and other nato members , berlin announced plans in june to boost its contingent in northern afghanistan later this year by up to 1,000 soldiers to a maximum of 4,500 troops . the mission , however , is extremely unpopular among germans and any move to expand the deployment further would likely provoke a voter backlash ahead of general elections slated for 2009 . us policy continuity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties to the us improved slightly after merkel took over in the chancellery merkel , who has met mccain on several occasions , said she was keen to sit down with his challenger .
she said she was impressed by the grassroots enthusiasm obama managed to spark during his " bold " and extended democratic primary campaign . " from the way he triumphed in the primaries in america , i would say he is a man of many strengths - physical , mental and political , " she said . merkel said she was particularly interested in discussing trans-atlantic political and economic ties with obama , nato , climate change and the doha trade round . but she said she expected broad continuity in the us stance toward europe regardless of whether obama or mccain won in november .

" obviously berlin is representative of the extraordinary success of the post world war ii effort to bring the continent together and to bring the west together , and later to bring the east and the west together , " he said .
" so i think it is a natural place to talk . " obama 's 45-minute address on trans-atlantic relations is expected to pull in tens of thousands . " hopefully -lsb- the speech -rsb- will be viewed as a substantive articulation of the relationship i 'd like to see between the united states and europe , " obama told reporters in israel shortly before leaving for germany .
" i 'm hoping to communicate across the atlantic the value of that relationship and how we need to build on it . " preparations for obama 's speech were marred after a 40-year man driving a car breached the cordoned off zone where the us presidential candidate is to speak and sprayed red paint around the area . bildunterschrift : police cordoned off the car after the paint attack the man from the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg is now in police custody , pending an investigation . earlier , a suspicious package at the swanky adlon hotel , which is close to both the us embassy and berlin 's historic brandenburg gate , triggered a security scare .
the hotel 's lobby was cleared briefly before the package was examined by explosives experts and declared that it did not represent any threat . election campaigning while berlin was in obama fever ahead of the visit , political commentators stressed that the main aim of the visit was to boost the senator 's fortunes in the us presidential race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's advance team was worried anti-american signs could sour us opinion of the speech in his speech , obama was expected to seek to revive trans-atlantic relations that suffered considerable damage under president george w. bush . europeans are looking to the illinois senator to restore a transatlantic relationship that has been strained , in particular , by president bush 's invasion of iraq . european leaders strongly support obama 's foreign policy goals including closing the guantanamo bay prison camp for terror suspects , fighting nuclear proliferation and tackling climate change with an eu-style emissions cap-and-trade plan . obama 's calls for talking directly to iran over its nuclear program and renewing us engagement in the middle east peace process have also received a warm welcome in european capitals . commentators were watching closely to discern calls for greater european contributions in afghanistan and to hear the senator 's views on pressing iran to abandon its uranium enrichment program . obama is overwhelmingly more popular in europe than his republican adversary , john mccain .
a recent poll put his german support at 76 percent . following his round of engagements in berlin , obama is to visit friday the us ramstein air force base and the us military hospital in landstuhl , which are both in the western part of germany . the presumed us democrat presidential candidate will then travel on to france .
before arriving in germany , obama visited israel , the palestinian territories , kuwait , afghanistan , iraq and jordan . no german troop changes in afghanistan asked about obama 's recent comments that he would press european nato partners for more troops for afghanistan , merkel said wednesday that germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to increase troop commitments in afghanistan " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission , " she told reporters .

" thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president , " merkel added . germany has faced growing pressure to increase the number of troops it has deployed in afghanistan and to move troops from the relatively calm north of the country to the south where us-led forces are battling tenacious taliban insurgents . in response to the calls from the united states and other nato members , berlin announced plans in june to boost its contingent in northern afghanistan later this year by up to 1,000 soldiers to a maximum of 4,500 troops . the mission , however , is extremely unpopular among germans and any move to expand the deployment further would likely provoke a voter backlash ahead of general elections slated for 2009 . us policy continuity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties to the us improved slightly after merkel took over in the chancellery merkel , who has met mccain on several occasions , said she was keen to sit down with his challenger .

" i am confident we will implement the lisbon treaty , " merkel said before going on summer vacation . the treaty of lisbon , signed at the end of last year and currently undergoing ratification by the individual members , was necessary not only if the eu was to expand , but also to enhance democracy within the bloc and to make it more effective , merkel said . the irish rejection of the lisbon treaty has left the bloc searching for a new way to move forward as the treaty must be unanimously ratified in order to go into effect . merkel was one of the driving forces behind the new treaty under germany 's eu presidency in the first half of last year . the treaty faces obstacles in germany , poland and the czech republic . german president horst koehler has said he will await a decision by the constitutional court on the treaty 's compatibility with the german constitution before signing into law the necessary legislation , which has been passed by both houses of parliament . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-tv will be available in the olympic village , the press center , the broadcasting center , hotels and venues until september 20 .
for one of the most censored media markets in the world , according to reporters without borders , deutsche welle produces radio and internet content in chinese – including information from china with analysis of political and societal events and opinions about china from a german and european perspective .
in doing so , ger-many ’ s international broadcaster communicates news from germany , europe and the world with its chinese programming .
dw-radio -lrb- on-air since 1965 -rrb- broadcasts three shows in chinese daily , for a total of 160 minutes , via shortwave and satellite as well as on the internet .
the chinese ver-sion of dw-world.de -lrb- www.dw-world.de / chinese -rrb- has been regularly censored by authorities for the last few years .
however , those interested often use the many pos-sibilities to go around the technological blockade , for example by using a proxy-server or reading posted articles in forums .
the complete programming from dw-tv can ’ t officially be received in the people ’ s republic of china .
a corresponding license has never been approved .
nevertheless it is becoming more and more available .
individual shows are being broadcast due to cooperation with chinese partners , like the hong kong station atv in the southern province guangdong and the taiwanese station eastern .
it is also available on the internet via tvu and the video platform uusee .
deutsche welle is available to the chinese mobile market via dragon new media . july 24 2008 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9797 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

" something had to happen with the state banks and the crisis sped up that process , " he said , adding that there is a growing tendency among private banks to consolidate .

my vision of europe includes lasting diversity .
herein lies its potential .
diversity has characterized europe for centuries , and diversity feeds the common european identity .
it is absurd to think that europe will ever flourish if its roots are enforced equality and shared values dictated from above .
a liberal europe of the future is based on recognition of diversity , and it will continue to promote this principle .
business long ago realized that competition is healthier than monopolies , and the same principle applies to politics . decentralization encourages this competition , which needs to permeate every level of politics .
take competition among business locations .
competition allows citizens and companies to identify where to base the services their taxes help provide .
if these are to be tied to a region or a country in the long-run , their hosts need to budget well and meet their responsibilities .
decentralization is a way to prevent governments from collecting extortionate taxes only in order to dole out subsidies and create mountains of debt .
anti-regulation according to my vision , europe recognizes the challenges and opportunities afforded by the principle of subsidiarity .
europe must be able to distinguish between areas in which standardized political structures make sense , and those in which a better alternative is freedom of choice exercised by eu member countries , bodies and citizens .
there are plenty of opportunities to learn from mistakes - such as the watered-down services directive , which saw the old eu countries ' guardians of vested rights succeed in asserting protectionism over competition .
or the rise in advertising bans , which reflects a growing tendency to regulate from brussels matters that do not requite state regulation . or the anti-globalization fund , which grants " victims " of globalization european aid money .
hardly a positive approach to the many opportunities afforded by globalization .
love is blind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dyed-in-the-wool european the europe of the future is a citizens ' europe .
today , europe is much closer to its citizens than they realize .
but they still do n't identify with it .
an ambivalent situation .
on the one hand europe is showered with love , with the younger generation particularly keen to describe themselves as europeans and actively contributing to its ever-evolving identity .
on the other hand , this love can be blind - because the eu , as it stands , is seen as out of touch with its citizens and mired in red tape .
this ambivalence needs to be dealt with .
for there to be a citizens ' europe , its citizens need to identify with it .
transparency , reduced red tape , better law-making , legislation with time limits and an assessment of the follow-up costs of legislation are the least that we can expect .
how can these goals be reached ?
for example , by tackling one key aspect of the eu - its financing .
a reform would create a simpler , more transparent system .
special treatments and exemptions need to be done away with - such as what 's known as the " british discount . "
a customized eu tax should not be tolerated .
so long as the eu remains a not-quite democracy , with decisions regarding the profit and loss accounting of taxpayers ' money made in parliament , the eu should not be granted tax authority .
the europe of the future needs to pursue solid , people-oriented politics which allow the public to experience a common europe first-hand .
only then will it be taking its first steps away from a technocracy and towards its citizens .
a two-speed europe europe will continue to grow - that much is clear .
the balkan countries , turkey , countries in eastern europe - they are all eyeing membership .
can the eu withstand this enlargement ?
there is a simple answer : every country should become as european as it wishes .
there is no doubt that we need to hold on to the basic principles of european success .
but partners can only work together when they want to .
a two-speed europe should be openly welcomed , so that countries deeply committed to the european project do not end up dragged down by ones that are more hesitant and less committed .
a two-speed europe already exists when dealing with the euro and various other political issues , although few will admit it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if some countries are n't interested , they do n't have to be this reflects the old idea of a core europe of the committed .
first , second and third class europeans ?
that 's not the point .
a europe of varying speeds would have many advantages .
it would do greater justice to the individual countries ' respective stages of development as well as their respective levels of commitment .
it would be up to the individual countries to set their own pace .
every country can choose whether it wants to be an innovator or a straggler .
the sole criterion for progress must remain a desire to propel europe forward .
europe is neither old , nor old-fashioned .
europe is in its prime .
however you look at it , europe is a great success . silvana koch-mehrin -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thousands of jobs may hang in the balance . while saxony 's sachsenlb gave up its independence to its fellow state-run bank landesbank baden-wuettemberg and billions of euros worth of support keep the dusseldorf-based ikb afloat by the state-owned development bank kfw other smaller banks , like the weserbank , have quietly closed their doors . the global markets crisis has led to a consolidation in the german banking sector but has not shook the country of its system of state banks , according to reinhard schmidt , who heads the university of frankfurt 's chair of international banking and finance . " something had to happen with the state banks and the crisis sped up that process , " he said , adding that there is a growing tendency among private banks to consolidate .
" but i do not see the banks being unable to function in their old , fundamental ways as a possible consequence of the crisis . " foreign banks want in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milan 's unicredit bought a german bank three years ago though germany is often regarded as " overbanked " with too many banks fighting for a limited amount of business , foreign institutions are eager to enter the german market . three years ago , italy 's unicredit bought the german hypovereinsbank three years ago and citibank 's german subsidiary was taken over by france 's credit mutuel . the french bank was willing to pay over 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.8 billion -rrb- , outbidding deutsche bank , for the us banking giant 's german operations . but deutsche quickly licked it wounds and is reportedly now eying germany 's postbank , which needs a fiscal injection to support faltering delivery services in the united states . but as much as the postbank needs the money - and as eager as the german government , the bank 's indirect main shareholder , would be to turn the bank into national financial powerhouse - postbank executives have said they are n't willing to accept an offer that undervalues the bank . postbank board member wolfgang klein said he has an ideal partner in mind but would not confirm whether deutsche was who he had in mind .
the bank 's large base of customers who keep their money in simply checking and savings accounts make postbank attractive to institutions eager to sell additional investment services . dresdner another takeover target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if postbank and deutsche join up , it could set off a spree of mergers according to the german banking rumor mill in frankfurt , if deutsch postbank tie the knot , a merger between commerzbank and dresdner bank would n't be far behind .
the allianz group would reportedly be willing to part ways with the bank it bought for 24 million euros in 2001 . " allianz never got dresdner bank under control , " said dieter hein , a bank analyst at fairesearch , adding that the combination of an insurance company and bank has seldom proven profitable .
" a new concept needs to be put in place and that is definitely better to implement with a different bank . " employees to pay the price ? such a merger would likely end up with thousands of bank employees being made redundant as services and branch offices were combined , according to franz scheidel , a member of dresdner 's workers council .
german media have reported that as many as 16,000 people could lose their jobs in a commerzbank-dresdner tie up . french banking giant bnp paribas has also been named as a potential dresdener suitor .

" they were presidents , i am a citizen , " he told reporters travelling with him .
" there is no doubt that part of what i want to communicate on both sides of the atlantic is the enormous potential of us restoring a sense of coming together . " the 46-year-old presumptive democratic candidate said he wanted the united states and europe to rediscover their common ground . " obviously berlin is representative of the extraordinary success of the post world war ii effort to bring the continent together and to bring the west together , and later to bring the east and the west together , " he said .
" so i think it is a natural place to talk . " obama 's 45-minute address on trans-atlantic relations is expected to pull in tens of thousands . " hopefully -lsb- the speech -rsb- will be viewed as a substantive articulation of the relationship i 'd like to see between the united states and europe , " obama told reporters in israel shortly before leaving for germany .
" i 'm hoping to communicate across the atlantic the value of that relationship and how we need to build on it . " preparations for obama 's speech were marred after a 40-year man driving a car breached the cordoned off zone where the us presidential candidate is to speak and sprayed red paint around the area . bildunterschrift : police cordoned off the car after the paint attack the man from the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg is now in police custody , pending an investigation . earlier , a suspicious package at the swanky adlon hotel , which is close to both the us embassy and berlin 's historic brandenburg gate , triggered a security scare .
the hotel 's lobby was cleared briefly before the package was examined by explosives experts and declared that it did not represent any threat . election campaigning while berlin was in obama fever ahead of the visit , political commentators stressed that the main aim of the visit was to boost the senator 's fortunes in the us presidential race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's advance team was worried anti-american signs could sour us opinion of the speech in his speech , obama was expected to seek to revive trans-atlantic relations that suffered considerable damage under president george w. bush . europeans are looking to the illinois senator to restore a transatlantic relationship that has been strained , in particular , by president bush 's invasion of iraq . european leaders strongly support obama 's foreign policy goals including closing the guantanamo bay prison camp for terror suspects , fighting nuclear proliferation and tackling climate change with an eu-style emissions cap-and-trade plan . obama 's calls for talking directly to iran over its nuclear program and renewing us engagement in the middle east peace process have also received a warm welcome in european capitals . commentators were watching closely to discern calls for greater european contributions in afghanistan and to hear the senator 's views on pressing iran to abandon its uranium enrichment program . obama is overwhelmingly more popular in europe than his republican adversary , john mccain .
a recent poll put his german support at 76 percent . following his round of engagements in berlin , obama is to visit friday the us ramstein air force base and the us military hospital in landstuhl , which are both in the western part of germany . the presumed us democrat presidential candidate will then travel on to france .
before arriving in germany , obama visited israel , the palestinian territories , kuwait , afghanistan , iraq and jordan . no german troop changes in afghanistan asked about obama 's recent comments that he would press european nato partners for more troops for afghanistan , merkel said wednesday that germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to increase troop commitments in afghanistan " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission , " she told reporters .
" we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president , " merkel added . germany has faced growing pressure to increase the number of troops it has deployed in afghanistan and to move troops from the relatively calm north of the country to the south where us-led forces are battling tenacious taliban insurgents . in response to the calls from the united states and other nato members , berlin announced plans in june to boost its contingent in northern afghanistan later this year by up to 1,000 soldiers to a maximum of 4,500 troops . the mission , however , is extremely unpopular among germans and any move to expand the deployment further would likely provoke a voter backlash ahead of general elections slated for 2009 . us policy continuity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties to the us improved slightly after merkel took over in the chancellery merkel , who has met mccain on several occasions , said she was keen to sit down with his challenger .
she said she was impressed by the grassroots enthusiasm obama managed to spark during his " bold " and extended democratic primary campaign . " from the way he triumphed in the primaries in america , i would say he is a man of many strengths - physical , mental and political , " she said . merkel said she was particularly interested in discussing trans-atlantic political and economic ties with obama , nato , climate change and the doha trade round . but she said she expected broad continuity in the us stance toward europe regardless of whether obama or mccain won in november . " in general the impact of differences on domestic policy is larger than those on foreign policy , " she said .
" we will continue to defend our interests and , in specific cases , find compromises . " dw staff -lrb- sms / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we should engage the russians not to pursue that approach , " general norton schwartz , nominated by bush to become the top air force officer , told a senate committee .
" and if they did , i think , we should stand strong and indicate that that is something that crosses a threshold , crosses a red line for the united states .

" but that does n't mean there is n't something concrete behind it , " he added . bildunterschrift : russian radar stations are n't exactly a pretty sight the white house refused to directly comment on the report because the russian government has not publicly stated its intentions .

he made this statement to assure berliner 's of america 's unflinching support after communist east berlin had built the berlin wall shortly before . john kornblum , a former united states ambassador to germany , warned the democrat senator against using the german language for rhetoric stunts .

it ended after 12 years on the run with his arrest monday this week in belgrade .

" there are documents that karadzic in the spring of 1997 took 36 million marks in a bag from banja luka , " dnevni avaz quoted dodik as saying .
" he first took 28 million marks from the bank 's safe and then eight more . "
since karadzic 's arrest , dodik has offered to help karadzic 's family travel to the hague and visit him .
the family can not travel without the permission of the international representative in bosnia .
they 've asked for their documents to be returned to them so that they can visit him in belgrade jail , saying that travelling to the hague is too costly .
" after 10 years of hell , i do n't see why somebody will profit from denying us this , " said karadzic 's daughter sonja karadzic jovicevic .
two years ago , karadzic posing as dragan david dabic spent a summer holiday on the croatian adriatic island of ciovo , croatian media reported thursday .

2008 former bosnian serb leader and top war crimes suspect radovan karadzic hid behind the identity of a soldier killed by a sarajevo sniper 15 years ago , serbian media reported thursday , july 24 . karadzic 's alias was part of an elaborate charade that included a long white beard , a mistress and an alternative medicine website .
it ended after 12 years on the run with his arrest monday this week in belgrade .
he had identity papers issued in the name of dragan david dabic , a bosnian serb soldier in his late 30s who was killed in the bosnian capital in 1993 during the country 's ethnic war , serbian media reported .
and karadzic allegedly stole 36 million marks from the bosnian serb region 's central bank in 1997 , when he was already undercover , a bosnian newspaper said thursday .
serbian intelligence involved ?
serb authorities are expected to turn over karadzic within days to the un war crimes tribunal in the hague , where he faces charges including genocide and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1992-95 war .
karadzic , 63 , will tell the tribunal " he is proud of everything he did and for saving serbs in bosnia , " his lawyer svetozar vujacic told the politika daily .

serbia 's secret service is widely believed to have helped karadzic with his undercover life .
his fake documents were issued legally in ruma , 50 kilometers north-west of belgrade , most probably with the help of bosnian serb officials , reports said .
false documents were also used by other war crimes suspects arrested in serbia .
stojan zupljanin , who was arrested on june 11 in the serbian town pancevo , had documents under the name of a man who died more than 10 years ago .
zupljanin , a former bosnian serb police commander , has been indicted by the un war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity .

karadzic stole funds , paper says a bosnian newspaper thursday quoted a 2005 a interview it conducted with milorad dodik , currently prime minister of the serb entity in bosnia , in which he claimed that karadzic in 1997 stole 36 million german marks from the region 's central bank .
" there are documents that karadzic in the spring of 1997 took 36 million marks in a bag from banja luka , " dnevni avaz quoted dodik as saying .
" he first took 28 million marks from the bank 's safe and then eight more . "
since karadzic 's arrest , dodik has offered to help karadzic 's family travel to the hague and visit him .
the family can not travel without the permission of the international representative in bosnia .

" i am confident we will implement the lisbon treaty , " merkel said before going on summer vacation . the treaty of lisbon , signed at the end of last year and currently undergoing ratification by the individual members , was necessary not only if the eu was to expand , but also to enhance democracy within the bloc and to make it more effective , merkel said . the irish rejection of the lisbon treaty has left the bloc searching for a new way to move forward as the treaty must be unanimously ratified in order to go into effect . merkel was one of the driving forces behind the new treaty under germany 's eu presidency in the first half of last year . the treaty faces obstacles in germany , poland and the czech republic . german president horst koehler has said he will await a decision by the constitutional court on the treaty 's compatibility with the german constitution before signing into law the necessary legislation , which has been passed by both houses of parliament . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am confident we will implement the lisbon treaty , " merkel said before going on summer vacation . the treaty of lisbon , signed at the end of last year and currently undergoing ratification by the individual members , was necessary not only if the eu was to expand , but also to enhance democracy within the bloc and to make it more effective , merkel said . the irish rejection of the lisbon treaty has left the bloc searching for a new way to move forward as the treaty must be unanimously ratified in order to go into effect . merkel was one of the driving forces behind the new treaty under germany 's eu presidency in the first half of last year . the treaty faces obstacles in germany , poland and the czech republic . german president horst koehler has said he will await a decision by the constitutional court on the treaty 's compatibility with the german constitution before signing into law the necessary legislation , which has been passed by both houses of parliament . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" they were presidents , i am a citizen , " he told reporters travelling with him .
" there is no doubt that part of what i want to communicate on both sides of the atlantic is the enormous potential of us restoring a sense of coming together . " the 46-year-old presumptive democratic candidate said he wanted the united states and europe to rediscover their common ground . " obviously berlin is representative of the extraordinary success of the post world war ii effort to bring the continent together and to bring the west together , and later to bring the east and the west together , " he said .
" so i think it is a natural place to talk . " obama 's 45-minute address on trans-atlantic relations is expected to pull in tens of thousands . " hopefully -lsb- the speech -rsb- will be viewed as a substantive articulation of the relationship i 'd like to see between the united states and europe , " obama told reporters in israel shortly before leaving for germany .
" i 'm hoping to communicate across the atlantic the value of that relationship and how we need to build on it . " preparations for obama 's speech were marred after a 40-year man driving a car breached the cordoned off zone where the us presidential candidate is to speak and sprayed red paint around the area . bildunterschrift : police cordoned off the car after the paint attack the man from the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg is now in police custody , pending an investigation . earlier , a suspicious package at the swanky adlon hotel , which is close to both the us embassy and berlin 's historic brandenburg gate , triggered a security scare .
the hotel 's lobby was cleared briefly before the package was examined by explosives experts and declared that it did not represent any threat . election campaigning while berlin was in obama fever ahead of the visit , political commentators stressed that the main aim of the visit was to boost the senator 's fortunes in the us presidential race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's advance team was worried anti-american signs could sour us opinion of the speech in his speech , obama was expected to seek to revive trans-atlantic relations that suffered considerable damage under president george w. bush . europeans are looking to the illinois senator to restore a transatlantic relationship that has been strained , in particular , by president bush 's invasion of iraq . european leaders strongly support obama 's foreign policy goals including closing the guantanamo bay prison camp for terror suspects , fighting nuclear proliferation and tackling climate change with an eu-style emissions cap-and-trade plan . obama 's calls for talking directly to iran over its nuclear program and renewing us engagement in the middle east peace process have also received a warm welcome in european capitals . commentators were watching closely to discern calls for greater european contributions in afghanistan and to hear the senator 's views on pressing iran to abandon its uranium enrichment program . obama is overwhelmingly more popular in europe than his republican adversary , john mccain .
a recent poll put his german support at 76 percent . following his round of engagements in berlin , obama is to visit friday the us ramstein air force base and the us military hospital in landstuhl , which are both in the western part of germany . the presumed us democrat presidential candidate will then travel on to france .
before arriving in germany , obama visited israel , the palestinian territories , kuwait , afghanistan , iraq and jordan . no german troop changes in afghanistan asked about obama 's recent comments that he would press european nato partners for more troops for afghanistan , merkel said wednesday that germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to increase troop commitments in afghanistan " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission , " she told reporters .

" thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president , " merkel added . germany has faced growing pressure to increase the number of troops it has deployed in afghanistan and to move troops from the relatively calm north of the country to the south where us-led forces are battling tenacious taliban insurgents . in response to the calls from the united states and other nato members , berlin announced plans in june to boost its contingent in northern afghanistan later this year by up to 1,000 soldiers to a maximum of 4,500 troops . the mission , however , is extremely unpopular among germans and any move to expand the deployment further would likely provoke a voter backlash ahead of general elections slated for 2009 . us policy continuity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties to the us improved slightly after merkel took over in the chancellery merkel , who has met mccain on several occasions , said she was keen to sit down with his challenger .

a statement issued by france , which currently holds the eu presidency , on thursday , july 24 , reminded tehran it had pledged to introduce a moratorium on stoning and urged it to abide by its commitments and international standards .
" the european union calls on the iranian government and parliament to abolish , in law and in practice , recourse to cruel and degrading punishment and , in particular the use of stoning , as a method of execution , " the statement read .
news reports say the eight women , ranging in age from 27 to 43 , had convictions including prostitution , incest and adultery .
the man , a 50-year-old music teacher , was convicted of illegal sex with a student .
the last officially reported stoning in the islamic republic was carried out on a man a year ago which sparked criticism from rights groups , the european union and a top un official .
iran 's judiciary chief ayatollah mohmoud hashemi-shahroudi ordered a moratorium on stoning in 2002 .
iran , saudi arabia world leaders in executions the eu 's concerns over the death by stoning sentences in iran coincided with the release of a new report by a rome-based anti-death penalty group .
it showed that though a global trend towards abolition of the death penalty continued in 2007 with the number of countries practicing capital punishment dropping to 49 from 51 in the previous year , the number of executions worldwide increased .
the group , called hands off cain , presented its findings in the 2008 edition of its annual report , which covers the first six months of the year and 2007 .
at least 5,851 executions were carried out in 2007 up from the 5,635 registered in 2006 and 5,494 in 2005 , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these two chinese men were executed on drug-related charges in 1996 the surge was " in large part " due to the increased number of executions in iran , up by one-third , and saudi arabia where the number of people executed quadrupled , it said .
china put to death at least 5,000 people , accounting for 85.4 percent of the world total .
iran , which executed at least 355 people , and saudi arabia 166 , filled the other top three places of what the report called the " terrible podium " of capital-punishment practicing countries .
most executions in asia ; us to blame too other countries where the number of people executed numbered more than 10 included pakistan , with at least 134 , the united states where 42 people were put to death , iraq with at least 33 , vietnam with at least 25 , yemen and afghanistan , both with at least 15 , and north korea with at least 13 .
the report noted how the " prevalent situation worldwide " including china , vietnam , belarus and mongolia , was for governments to conceal the number of executions , making it difficult to provide exact figures .
" it points to the fact that the fight against the death penalty entails , beyond the stopping of executions , a battle for democracy , for the respect of the rule of law and for political rights and civil liberties , " the report said .
asia remained the region where the vast majority of executions are carried out , while the americas " would be practically death-penalty free were it not for the united states , the only country on the continent to execute anyone in 2007 , " the report noted .
in africa , the death penalty was carried out in seven countries - botswana -lrb- at least one -rrb- , egypt -lrb- actual number unknown -rrb- , ethiopia -lrb- one -rrb- , equatorial new guinea -lrb- three -rrb- , libya -lrb- at least nine -rrb- , somalia -lrb- at least five -rrb- and sudan -lrb- at least seven -rrb- .
in 2007 and in the first six months of 2008 nine countries moved from retention to a form of abolition of the death penalty .
rwanda went from retentionist to abolitionist in july of 2007 with a law that abolished the death penalty for all crimes , while kyrgyzstan abolished the death penalty in january 2007 , after years of moratorium .
uzbekistan went from retentionist to abolitionist on january 1 , 2008.these moves were partly offset by the resumption of executions in afghanistan and ethiopia after several years of suspension , the report said .
belarus a blemish on europe " in europe , the only blemish on an otherwise completely death penalty-free zone continues to be belarus , where at least one person was executed in 2007 and three in the first five months of 2008 , " the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has led a campaign to abolish capital punishment worldwide hands off cain hailed the december 2007 adoption by the united nations general assembly of a resolution that calls upon all member states that still maintain the death penalty to establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing them .
the group announced it had bestowed its " abolitionist of the year 2008 " award on former italian prime minister romano prodi , who during his time in office led a campaign to bring the resolution before the un general assembly . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but the burdens of global citizenship bind us together , " he said , speaking under the central berlin landmark of the victory column facing towards the brandenburg gate . partnership among nations was not a choice but the only way to protect the security of europe and the us , the democratic party presidential hopeful said . obama challenged a new generation of americans and europeans to tear down walls between estranged allies , races , and faiths in his soaring call for global unity . " that is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another , " he said in reference to the berlin wall that divided the city from 1961 to 1989 . " partnerhip is not a choice but a means of survival " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama spoke of partnerships between nations in a speech that risked being seen as presumptuous , considering obama will not even face us voters for another three months , he warned of a world where partnership was not a choice but the only means of survival . " no one nation , no matter how large or powerful , can defeat such challenges alone , " he said , signaling that , if elected president , he would end what many europeans see as the unilateral foreign policy approach of president george w bush . obama also made clear he would not take the us into isolation . " that is why america can not turn inward .
that is why europe can not turn inward , " he said . crowds respond to barack ' n ' roll a party atmosphere gripped the crowds around the victory column monument as people listened to the man many hoped would replace george w bush as leader of the world 's most powerful nation . a roar went up from the multi-ethnic crowd when obama strolled confidently onto the stage to talk of the us-german partnership and the need to strengthen transatlantic relations to meet the challenges of the 21st century . bildunterschrift : supporters had more than the white house in mind around 100,000 lined the boulevard linking the victory column to the brandenburg gate , where obama had originally intended to speak but later dropped the plan after merkel signaled her disapproval at the site being used for foreign election campaign speeches . many of those present queued patiently for over an hour outside 20 airport-style security gates where they were required to empty their pockets and dispense with drinks containers . once inside they were able to refresh themselves with plastic mugs of german beer and snacks as a pop band livened up the audience on a warm mid-summer evening . no banners or placards were allowed on the strip guarded by around 1,000 police and other security officers as the obama team sought to ensure that no unwelcome slogans were aired on us television . but democrats inside distributed us flags to their supporters and a green poster was held aloft by an obama fan with the words " i love barack ' n ' roll . " outside the entrance gates to the security zone , us democrats wearing obama ' 08 buttons launched a recruitment drive , yelling out " us citizens register to vote . " obama talks of breaking down global walls the strikingly audacious speech , in a fevered atmosphere in berlin 's famed tiergarten , took the white house race out of us borders in a way never seen before , and was designed to portray obama as a leader with unique global appeal . bildunterschrift : the huge crowd responded to obama 's calls for unity " the walls between old allies on either side of the atlantic can not stand , " he said , referring to festering divisions between europe and the united states opened up by the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . " the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least can not stand , " said obama , in an address beamed live on us and german television channels and to viewers around the world . " the walls between races and tribes ; natives and immigrants ; christian and muslim and jew can not stand .
these now are the walls we must tear down , " obama said , drawing cheers and applause . obama 's speech was a clear echo of former us president ronald reagan 's call to then soviet leader mikhael gorbachev in berlin in 1987 to " tear down this wall , " before the fall of communism . full of passion , short of specifics despite its soaring cadences however , the speech was short on specifics .
obama 's aides said he would not talk policy as that is the job of a president but his critics will likely slam him for empty rhetoric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands stood listening in the balmy berlin evening the illinois senator rebuked both his country and europe for blaming one another for strains in their relations , but took pains to insulate himself from critics back home who doubt his patriotism .
" i also know how much i love america .
i know that for more than two centuries , we have strived , at great cost and great sacrifice , to form a more perfect union ; to seek , with other nations , a more hopeful world , " he said . " in europe , the view that america is part of what has gone wrong in our world , rather than a force to help make it right , has become all too common , " the 46-year-old first term senator said . " in america , there are voices that deride and deny the importance of europe 's role in our security and our future .
both views miss the truth . " obama , who has a narrow lead in most polls of the us race , but trails mccain when voters are asked who would be the most credible commander in chief , used berlin 's triumph over division and totalitarianism as a metaphor for the world he hoped to forge . " people of the world - look at berlin , where a wall came down , a continent came together , and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one , " obama said . he also promised america under his watch would be serious about tackling global warning , a huge concern in europe and a cause of rifts between the continent and the united states during the bush administration . europe needs to do its part , obama urges but he also signaled he would demand europe live up to its side of the bargain , asking for more help in the struggle against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan . " america can not do this alone , " obama said .
" the afghan people need our troops and your troops ; our support and your support to defeat the taliban and al-qaeda , to develop their economy , and to help them rebuild their nation . " we have too much at stake to turn back now . " obama is vowing to pour at least two more combat brigades into afghanistan , which is currently being pummeled by a rise in extremist violence and attacks , if he is elected president - with some troops to be redeployed from iraq . his aides have said that he believes nato nations should provide more troops for the conflict , and remove operating restrictions on forces that are already there . in an interview with cbs news on monday during his first-ever trip to the war-torn nation , obama warned conditions were " precarious and urgent " and also called on the afghan government to do more to stabilize the country . merkel resists obama pressure over troops bildunterschrift : merkel was firm on troops during the cordial meeting before giving his speech , obama on thursday met german chancellor angela merkel , who signaled clearly a day before that she would resist any pressure to send more troops to afghanistan . merkel said germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission .
we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- , " she said . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president . " an apparently worsening security situation in afghanistan has seen troop deaths there exceed those in iraq for the second month in a row . forty-nine soldiers from the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and the separate us-led coalition died in combat , attacks or accidents in june , according to an afp tally based on military statements . by contrast , 31 soldiers including 29 americans , were killed in iraq in june despite the fact that there are more than twice as many troops there as in afghanistan , icasualties.org figures showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision could let several bundesliga players off the judicial hook . " the release of players below the age of 23 has always been mandatory for all clubs , " blatter said in a statement on wednesday , july 23 .
" the same principle shall apply for beijing 2008 . " the statement added that blatter had sent an according letter to all member federations on that day . the news comes shortly after germany 's schalke 04 announced the start of proceedings to go before the court of arbitration for sport -lrb- cas -rrb- over their 22-year-old brazilian defender rafinha and comments from the european soccer association eca that clubs can not be forced to send players to the games . confusion reigned for days in the international soccer community over whether or not clubs have to release players for the august 8-24 olympics , which coincide with the league start in england and germany and pre-season activities in spain and italy . the olympic tournament is by definition an under-23 event but each team can field three over-age players , who the clubs are not required to release . an end to legal limbo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke is unhappy that rafinha , right , put the olympics before his club obligations apart from schalke , the bundesliga 's werder bremen had also said before blatter 's statement that they would look to the cas if their brazilian playmaker diego , who qualifies as an under-23 player , has to play in beijing . like schalke 's rafinha , diego traveled to beijing without his team 's authorization . elsewhere , barcelona do n't want to release star forward lionel messi to play for 2004 gold medalists argentina in beijing . barca said in a first reaction to blatter 's letter that the statement was " not satisfactory " for the club 's interest and that a board meeting had been called . the clubs argued that the men 's olympic tournament is not part of the official match calendar - though the women 's tournament is - and that they do n't have to release players . this view was shared , among others , by the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the eca , which represents europe 's clubs . " as the olympics are not included in the harmonized international match calendar , the obligation to release players for national team matches according to the fifa regulations on the status and transfer of players does not apply , " eca chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said in a statement issued earlier wednesday .
" we , therefore , support all clubs that currently face losing important players . " rummenigge also called on fifa and the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- to set up clear rules for future olympic tournaments . fifa : olympics mandatory international tournament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego was instrumental in bremen 's attack on the bundesliga crown last season but blatter said in the letter to the fifa members that the olympic tournament is " deliberately " not included in the calendar , and that this " does not mean that there is no release obligation for the relevant clubs . " in view of the importance of the men 's olympic football tournament for the entire sporting movement in general and football in particular , and given the specific nature of the event , as well as on the basis of customary law , the release of players below the age of 23 has always been mandatory for clubs .
the same principle shall apply for beijing 2008 . " it would appear to be against the spirit of the olympic regulations to hinder players under the age of 23 , who are actually the core of the squads participating in the men 's olympic football tournament , to take part in the final phase of the event . " blatter 's clarification backed up the comments of ioc president jacques rogge who told dpa news agency last week that players must be released . " the law says that if a club does n't release a player then the player will be suspended for the whole period of the games , " rogge said .
" fifa has reminded the clubs of this law .
they sent a letter a couple of days ago to remind them of that . " blatter 's confirmation was good news for the players as well , with diego for instance naming the olympics " a dream . "
it could also affect pending cases such as sv hamburg 's belgian vincent kompany . players benefit from fulfilling olympic dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina are the current olympic gold medal holders according to the german player union vdv , the clubs would even benefit from their players going to the olympics . " participating at an olympic tournament is a career highlight for every player , " the union told dpa .
" players who are not given this chance could be disappointed and that could affect their performance in the league .
releasing a player for the olympics , by contrast , could boost performance , which the clubs in the end will profit from . " teams have acknowledged that players are under huge pressure to represent their countries where the olympic event has great importance . brazil , for instance , wants olympic gold at last .
europe 's big soccer powers are not represented in beijing , with the exception of italy . promoted german bundesliga club hoffenheim bowed to this pressure when it released forward chinedu obasi to play for the 1996 olympic champions nigeria . " the pressure on obasi and his family was unbearable , " said hoffenheim general manager jan schindelmeiser .

thousands of jobs may hang in the balance . while saxony 's sachsenlb gave up its independence to its fellow state-run bank landesbank baden-wuettemberg and billions of euros worth of support keep the dusseldorf-based ikb afloat by the state-owned development bank kfw other smaller banks , like the weserbank , have quietly closed their doors . the global markets crisis has led to a consolidation in the german banking sector but has not shook the country of its system of state banks , according to reinhard schmidt , who heads the university of frankfurt 's chair of international banking and finance .

2008 former bosnian serb leader and top war crimes suspect radovan karadzic hid behind the identity of a soldier killed by a sarajevo sniper 15 years ago , serbian media reported thursday , july 24 . karadzic 's alias was part of an elaborate charade that included a long white beard , a mistress and an alternative medicine website .
it ended after 12 years on the run with his arrest monday this week in belgrade .
he had identity papers issued in the name of dragan david dabic , a bosnian serb soldier in his late 30s who was killed in the bosnian capital in 1993 during the country 's ethnic war , serbian media reported .
and karadzic allegedly stole 36 million marks from the bosnian serb region 's central bank in 1997 , when he was already undercover , a bosnian newspaper said thursday .
serbian intelligence involved ?
serb authorities are expected to turn over karadzic within days to the un war crimes tribunal in the hague , where he faces charges including genocide and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1992-95 war .
karadzic , 63 , will tell the tribunal " he is proud of everything he did and for saving serbs in bosnia , " his lawyer svetozar vujacic told the politika daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic , seen here in 1995 , underwent a complete metamorphosis during more than a dozen years in hiding in plain sight karadzic will prove that the accusations are false and that he is charged only because he is a serb , his lawyer added .
serbia 's secret service is widely believed to have helped karadzic with his undercover life .
his fake documents were issued legally in ruma , 50 kilometers north-west of belgrade , most probably with the help of bosnian serb officials , reports said .
false documents were also used by other war crimes suspects arrested in serbia .
stojan zupljanin , who was arrested on june 11 in the serbian town pancevo , had documents under the name of a man who died more than 10 years ago .
zupljanin , a former bosnian serb police commander , has been indicted by the un war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity .
in serbia , proof of citizenship , a birth certificate or an old identity card are needed to obtain identity documents .
one also needs to give a fingerprint .
karadzic was not a citizen of serbia .
karadzic stole funds , paper says a bosnian newspaper thursday quoted a 2005 a interview it conducted with milorad dodik , currently prime minister of the serb entity in bosnia , in which he claimed that karadzic in 1997 stole 36 million german marks from the region 's central bank .
" there are documents that karadzic in the spring of 1997 took 36 million marks in a bag from banja luka , " dnevni avaz quoted dodik as saying .
" he first took 28 million marks from the bank 's safe and then eight more . "
since karadzic 's arrest , dodik has offered to help karadzic 's family travel to the hague and visit him .
the family can not travel without the permission of the international representative in bosnia .
they 've asked for their documents to be returned to them so that they can visit him in belgrade jail , saying that travelling to the hague is too costly .
" after 10 years of hell , i do n't see why somebody will profit from denying us this , " said karadzic 's daughter sonja karadzic jovicevic .
two years ago , karadzic posing as dragan david dabic spent a summer holiday on the croatian adriatic island of ciovo , croatian media reported thursday .
inhabitants say karadzic visited a local church and spent 10 days on the island , the 24sata daily said . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a former film diva and the world 's largest seal hunting nation are not happy with the plan - albeit for different reasons . the eu proposal would ban seal products from the bloc 's market unless they were proven to come from animals that had been killed with " hunting techniques consistent with high animal-welfare standards " and that the animals did not suffer more than necessary . seals are hunted mainly for their pelts but also for meat and fat , which is used in beauty products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hunter clubs a seal in canada " the images of seal hunting that circulate around the globe every year are a reminder of the often gruesome practices used to kill seals , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told journalists . " european citizens find these practices repugnant and in contradiction to our standards of animal welfare , " he added . the ban still has to be approved by eu governments and the european parliament . slippery slope ? the main target country of the ban is canada , where hunters slaughtered some 275,000 seals along the atlantic coast this year .
canada accounts for nearly a third of young seals killed each year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harper is cautioning the eu against a ban canadian premier stephen harper already voiced his opposition to the plan early this month , saying that his country " will not stand by and accept measures that fly in the face of accepted international practices . " his fisheries minister , loyola hearn , on wednesday , july 23 , also warned eu officials against going down a " slippery slope . " " to bow to misinformation and emotional rhetoric in restricting the trade of humanely harvested animals would set a dangerous precedent for all wild hunts , " he said . hearn added that seals were killed humanely in canada and seal products from his country would therefore not be affected by the ban . fisheries department spokesman phil jenkins meanwhile told afp news service that the eu has " not said exactly what they will consider to be humane or inhumane , so we do n't know yet what bar we have to reach to comply . " canada , greenland and namibia account for about 60 percent of the 900,000 seals hunted each year .
seals are also hunted in iceland , norway , russia , and the united states as well as in eu members britain , finland and sweden . " a historic step " animal rights activists meanwhile welcomed the proposal . " this announcement is a historic step forward in the campaign to end cruel commercial seal hunts , " said mark glover , head of the british arm of the humane society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bardot is generally pleased with the ban french actress-turned-animal-activist brigitte bardot , who has led a campaign against the killing of seals , regretted that " slaughters will continue as long as they are done in a humane way . " but bardot , who has made headlines in the past few years for supporting ultra-right politicians in france , was still happy about the plan . " a 30-year-long battle ... is about to be won , " bardot told ap news service . french president nicolas sarkozy has reportedly assured bardot that " everything would be done " during the french presidency of the european union to adopt a law banning imports of seal products in the eu . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

my vision of europe includes lasting diversity .
herein lies its potential .
diversity has characterized europe for centuries , and diversity feeds the common european identity .
it is absurd to think that europe will ever flourish if its roots are enforced equality and shared values dictated from above .
a liberal europe of the future is based on recognition of diversity , and it will continue to promote this principle .
business long ago realized that competition is healthier than monopolies , and the same principle applies to politics . decentralization encourages this competition , which needs to permeate every level of politics .
take competition among business locations .
competition allows citizens and companies to identify where to base the services their taxes help provide .
if these are to be tied to a region or a country in the long-run , their hosts need to budget well and meet their responsibilities .
decentralization is a way to prevent governments from collecting extortionate taxes only in order to dole out subsidies and create mountains of debt .
anti-regulation according to my vision , europe recognizes the challenges and opportunities afforded by the principle of subsidiarity .
europe must be able to distinguish between areas in which standardized political structures make sense , and those in which a better alternative is freedom of choice exercised by eu member countries , bodies and citizens .
there are plenty of opportunities to learn from mistakes - such as the watered-down services directive , which saw the old eu countries ' guardians of vested rights succeed in asserting protectionism over competition .
or the rise in advertising bans , which reflects a growing tendency to regulate from brussels matters that do not requite state regulation . or the anti-globalization fund , which grants " victims " of globalization european aid money .
hardly a positive approach to the many opportunities afforded by globalization .
love is blind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dyed-in-the-wool european the europe of the future is a citizens ' europe .
today , europe is much closer to its citizens than they realize .
but they still do n't identify with it .
an ambivalent situation .
on the one hand europe is showered with love , with the younger generation particularly keen to describe themselves as europeans and actively contributing to its ever-evolving identity .
on the other hand , this love can be blind - because the eu , as it stands , is seen as out of touch with its citizens and mired in red tape .
this ambivalence needs to be dealt with .
for there to be a citizens ' europe , its citizens need to identify with it .
transparency , reduced red tape , better law-making , legislation with time limits and an assessment of the follow-up costs of legislation are the least that we can expect .
how can these goals be reached ?
for example , by tackling one key aspect of the eu - its financing .
a reform would create a simpler , more transparent system .
special treatments and exemptions need to be done away with - such as what 's known as the " british discount . "
a customized eu tax should not be tolerated .
so long as the eu remains a not-quite democracy , with decisions regarding the profit and loss accounting of taxpayers ' money made in parliament , the eu should not be granted tax authority .
the europe of the future needs to pursue solid , people-oriented politics which allow the public to experience a common europe first-hand .
only then will it be taking its first steps away from a technocracy and towards its citizens .
a two-speed europe europe will continue to grow - that much is clear .
the balkan countries , turkey , countries in eastern europe - they are all eyeing membership .
can the eu withstand this enlargement ?
there is a simple answer : every country should become as european as it wishes .
there is no doubt that we need to hold on to the basic principles of european success .
but partners can only work together when they want to .
a two-speed europe should be openly welcomed , so that countries deeply committed to the european project do not end up dragged down by ones that are more hesitant and less committed .
a two-speed europe already exists when dealing with the euro and various other political issues , although few will admit it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if some countries are n't interested , they do n't have to be this reflects the old idea of a core europe of the committed .

love is blind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dyed-in-the-wool european the europe of the future is a citizens ' europe .
today , europe is much closer to its citizens than they realize .
but they still do n't identify with it .
an ambivalent situation .
on the one hand europe is showered with love , with the younger generation particularly keen to describe themselves as europeans and actively contributing to its ever-evolving identity .
on the other hand , this love can be blind - because the eu , as it stands , is seen as out of touch with its citizens and mired in red tape .
this ambivalence needs to be dealt with .
for there to be a citizens ' europe , its citizens need to identify with it .
transparency , reduced red tape , better law-making , legislation with time limits and an assessment of the follow-up costs of legislation are the least that we can expect .
how can these goals be reached ?
for example , by tackling one key aspect of the eu - its financing .
a reform would create a simpler , more transparent system .

a customized eu tax should not be tolerated .
so long as the eu remains a not-quite democracy , with decisions regarding the profit and loss accounting of taxpayers ' money made in parliament , the eu should not be granted tax authority .

" but the burdens of global citizenship bind us together , " he said , speaking under the central berlin landmark of the victory column facing towards the brandenburg gate . partnership among nations was not a choice but the only way to protect the security of europe and the us , the democratic party presidential hopeful said . obama challenged a new generation of americans and europeans to tear down walls between estranged allies , races , and faiths in his soaring call for global unity . " that is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another , " he said in reference to the berlin wall that divided the city from 1961 to 1989 . " partnerhip is not a choice but a means of survival " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama spoke of partnerships between nations in a speech that risked being seen as presumptuous , considering obama will not even face us voters for another three months , he warned of a world where partnership was not a choice but the only means of survival . " no one nation , no matter how large or powerful , can defeat such challenges alone , " he said , signaling that , if elected president , he would end what many europeans see as the unilateral foreign policy approach of president george w bush . obama also made clear he would not take the us into isolation . " that is why america can not turn inward .
that is why europe can not turn inward , " he said . crowds respond to barack ' n ' roll a party atmosphere gripped the crowds around the victory column monument as people listened to the man many hoped would replace george w bush as leader of the world 's most powerful nation . a roar went up from the multi-ethnic crowd when obama strolled confidently onto the stage to talk of the us-german partnership and the need to strengthen transatlantic relations to meet the challenges of the 21st century . bildunterschrift : supporters had more than the white house in mind around 100,000 lined the boulevard linking the victory column to the brandenburg gate , where obama had originally intended to speak but later dropped the plan after merkel signaled her disapproval at the site being used for foreign election campaign speeches . many of those present queued patiently for over an hour outside 20 airport-style security gates where they were required to empty their pockets and dispense with drinks containers . once inside they were able to refresh themselves with plastic mugs of german beer and snacks as a pop band livened up the audience on a warm mid-summer evening . no banners or placards were allowed on the strip guarded by around 1,000 police and other security officers as the obama team sought to ensure that no unwelcome slogans were aired on us television . but democrats inside distributed us flags to their supporters and a green poster was held aloft by an obama fan with the words " i love barack ' n ' roll . " outside the entrance gates to the security zone , us democrats wearing obama ' 08 buttons launched a recruitment drive , yelling out " us citizens register to vote . " obama talks of breaking down global walls the strikingly audacious speech , in a fevered atmosphere in berlin 's famed tiergarten , took the white house race out of us borders in a way never seen before , and was designed to portray obama as a leader with unique global appeal . bildunterschrift : the huge crowd responded to obama 's calls for unity " the walls between old allies on either side of the atlantic can not stand , " he said , referring to festering divisions between europe and the united states opened up by the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . " the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least can not stand , " said obama , in an address beamed live on us and german television channels and to viewers around the world . " the walls between races and tribes ; natives and immigrants ; christian and muslim and jew can not stand .
these now are the walls we must tear down , " obama said , drawing cheers and applause . obama 's speech was a clear echo of former us president ronald reagan 's call to then soviet leader mikhael gorbachev in berlin in 1987 to " tear down this wall , " before the fall of communism . full of passion , short of specifics despite its soaring cadences however , the speech was short on specifics .
obama 's aides said he would not talk policy as that is the job of a president but his critics will likely slam him for empty rhetoric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands stood listening in the balmy berlin evening the illinois senator rebuked both his country and europe for blaming one another for strains in their relations , but took pains to insulate himself from critics back home who doubt his patriotism .
" i also know how much i love america .
i know that for more than two centuries , we have strived , at great cost and great sacrifice , to form a more perfect union ; to seek , with other nations , a more hopeful world , " he said . " in europe , the view that america is part of what has gone wrong in our world , rather than a force to help make it right , has become all too common , " the 46-year-old first term senator said . " in america , there are voices that deride and deny the importance of europe 's role in our security and our future .
both views miss the truth . " obama , who has a narrow lead in most polls of the us race , but trails mccain when voters are asked who would be the most credible commander in chief , used berlin 's triumph over division and totalitarianism as a metaphor for the world he hoped to forge . " people of the world - look at berlin , where a wall came down , a continent came together , and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one , " obama said . he also promised america under his watch would be serious about tackling global warning , a huge concern in europe and a cause of rifts between the continent and the united states during the bush administration . europe needs to do its part , obama urges but he also signaled he would demand europe live up to its side of the bargain , asking for more help in the struggle against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan . " america can not do this alone , " obama said .
" the afghan people need our troops and your troops ; our support and your support to defeat the taliban and al-qaeda , to develop their economy , and to help them rebuild their nation . " we have too much at stake to turn back now . " obama is vowing to pour at least two more combat brigades into afghanistan , which is currently being pummeled by a rise in extremist violence and attacks , if he is elected president - with some troops to be redeployed from iraq . his aides have said that he believes nato nations should provide more troops for the conflict , and remove operating restrictions on forces that are already there . in an interview with cbs news on monday during his first-ever trip to the war-torn nation , obama warned conditions were " precarious and urgent " and also called on the afghan government to do more to stabilize the country . merkel resists obama pressure over troops bildunterschrift : merkel was firm on troops during the cordial meeting before giving his speech , obama on thursday met german chancellor angela merkel , who signaled clearly a day before that she would resist any pressure to send more troops to afghanistan . merkel said germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission .
we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- , " she said . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president . " an apparently worsening security situation in afghanistan has seen troop deaths there exceed those in iraq for the second month in a row . forty-nine soldiers from the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and the separate us-led coalition died in combat , attacks or accidents in june , according to an afp tally based on military statements . by contrast , 31 soldiers including 29 americans , were killed in iraq in june despite the fact that there are more than twice as many troops there as in afghanistan , icasualties.org figures showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the european union calls on the iranian government and parliament to abolish , in law and in practice , recourse to cruel and degrading punishment and , in particular the use of stoning , as a method of execution , " the statement read .
news reports say the eight women , ranging in age from 27 to 43 , had convictions including prostitution , incest and adultery .
the man , a 50-year-old music teacher , was convicted of illegal sex with a student .

the report noted how the " prevalent situation worldwide " including china , vietnam , belarus and mongolia , was for governments to conceal the number of executions , making it difficult to provide exact figures .
" it points to the fact that the fight against the death penalty entails , beyond the stopping of executions , a battle for democracy , for the respect of the rule of law and for political rights and civil liberties , " the report said .
asia remained the region where the vast majority of executions are carried out , while the americas " would be practically death-penalty free were it not for the united states , the only country on the continent to execute anyone in 2007 , " the report noted .

" they were presidents , i am a citizen , " he told reporters travelling with him .
" there is no doubt that part of what i want to communicate on both sides of the atlantic is the enormous potential of us restoring a sense of coming together . " the 46-year-old presumptive democratic candidate said he wanted the united states and europe to rediscover their common ground . " obviously berlin is representative of the extraordinary success of the post world war ii effort to bring the continent together and to bring the west together , and later to bring the east and the west together , " he said .
" so i think it is a natural place to talk . " obama 's 45-minute address on trans-atlantic relations is expected to pull in tens of thousands . " hopefully -lsb- the speech -rsb- will be viewed as a substantive articulation of the relationship i 'd like to see between the united states and europe , " obama told reporters in israel shortly before leaving for germany .
" i 'm hoping to communicate across the atlantic the value of that relationship and how we need to build on it . " preparations for obama 's speech were marred after a 40-year man driving a car breached the cordoned off zone where the us presidential candidate is to speak and sprayed red paint around the area . bildunterschrift : police cordoned off the car after the paint attack the man from the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg is now in police custody , pending an investigation . earlier , a suspicious package at the swanky adlon hotel , which is close to both the us embassy and berlin 's historic brandenburg gate , triggered a security scare .
the hotel 's lobby was cleared briefly before the package was examined by explosives experts and declared that it did not represent any threat . election campaigning while berlin was in obama fever ahead of the visit , political commentators stressed that the main aim of the visit was to boost the senator 's fortunes in the us presidential race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's advance team was worried anti-american signs could sour us opinion of the speech in his speech , obama was expected to seek to revive trans-atlantic relations that suffered considerable damage under president george w. bush . europeans are looking to the illinois senator to restore a transatlantic relationship that has been strained , in particular , by president bush 's invasion of iraq . european leaders strongly support obama 's foreign policy goals including closing the guantanamo bay prison camp for terror suspects , fighting nuclear proliferation and tackling climate change with an eu-style emissions cap-and-trade plan . obama 's calls for talking directly to iran over its nuclear program and renewing us engagement in the middle east peace process have also received a warm welcome in european capitals . commentators were watching closely to discern calls for greater european contributions in afghanistan and to hear the senator 's views on pressing iran to abandon its uranium enrichment program . obama is overwhelmingly more popular in europe than his republican adversary , john mccain .
a recent poll put his german support at 76 percent . following his round of engagements in berlin , obama is to visit friday the us ramstein air force base and the us military hospital in landstuhl , which are both in the western part of germany . the presumed us democrat presidential candidate will then travel on to france .
before arriving in germany , obama visited israel , the palestinian territories , kuwait , afghanistan , iraq and jordan . no german troop changes in afghanistan asked about obama 's recent comments that he would press european nato partners for more troops for afghanistan , merkel said wednesday that germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to increase troop commitments in afghanistan " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission , " she told reporters .
" we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president , " merkel added . germany has faced growing pressure to increase the number of troops it has deployed in afghanistan and to move troops from the relatively calm north of the country to the south where us-led forces are battling tenacious taliban insurgents . in response to the calls from the united states and other nato members , berlin announced plans in june to boost its contingent in northern afghanistan later this year by up to 1,000 soldiers to a maximum of 4,500 troops . the mission , however , is extremely unpopular among germans and any move to expand the deployment further would likely provoke a voter backlash ahead of general elections slated for 2009 . us policy continuity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties to the us improved slightly after merkel took over in the chancellery merkel , who has met mccain on several occasions , said she was keen to sit down with his challenger .
she said she was impressed by the grassroots enthusiasm obama managed to spark during his " bold " and extended democratic primary campaign . " from the way he triumphed in the primaries in america , i would say he is a man of many strengths - physical , mental and political , " she said . merkel said she was particularly interested in discussing trans-atlantic political and economic ties with obama , nato , climate change and the doha trade round . but she said she expected broad continuity in the us stance toward europe regardless of whether obama or mccain won in november . " in general the impact of differences on domestic policy is larger than those on foreign policy , " she said .
" we will continue to defend our interests and , in specific cases , find compromises . " dw staff -lrb- sms / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a statement issued by france , which currently holds the eu presidency , on thursday , july 24 , reminded tehran it had pledged to introduce a moratorium on stoning and urged it to abide by its commitments and international standards .
" the european union calls on the iranian government and parliament to abolish , in law and in practice , recourse to cruel and degrading punishment and , in particular the use of stoning , as a method of execution , " the statement read .
news reports say the eight women , ranging in age from 27 to 43 , had convictions including prostitution , incest and adultery .
the man , a 50-year-old music teacher , was convicted of illegal sex with a student .
the last officially reported stoning in the islamic republic was carried out on a man a year ago which sparked criticism from rights groups , the european union and a top un official .
iran 's judiciary chief ayatollah mohmoud hashemi-shahroudi ordered a moratorium on stoning in 2002 .
iran , saudi arabia world leaders in executions the eu 's concerns over the death by stoning sentences in iran coincided with the release of a new report by a rome-based anti-death penalty group .
it showed that though a global trend towards abolition of the death penalty continued in 2007 with the number of countries practicing capital punishment dropping to 49 from 51 in the previous year , the number of executions worldwide increased .
the group , called hands off cain , presented its findings in the 2008 edition of its annual report , which covers the first six months of the year and 2007 .
at least 5,851 executions were carried out in 2007 up from the 5,635 registered in 2006 and 5,494 in 2005 , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these two chinese men were executed on drug-related charges in 1996 the surge was " in large part " due to the increased number of executions in iran , up by one-third , and saudi arabia where the number of people executed quadrupled , it said .
china put to death at least 5,000 people , accounting for 85.4 percent of the world total .
iran , which executed at least 355 people , and saudi arabia 166 , filled the other top three places of what the report called the " terrible podium " of capital-punishment practicing countries .
most executions in asia ; us to blame too other countries where the number of people executed numbered more than 10 included pakistan , with at least 134 , the united states where 42 people were put to death , iraq with at least 33 , vietnam with at least 25 , yemen and afghanistan , both with at least 15 , and north korea with at least 13 .
the report noted how the " prevalent situation worldwide " including china , vietnam , belarus and mongolia , was for governments to conceal the number of executions , making it difficult to provide exact figures .
" it points to the fact that the fight against the death penalty entails , beyond the stopping of executions , a battle for democracy , for the respect of the rule of law and for political rights and civil liberties , " the report said .
asia remained the region where the vast majority of executions are carried out , while the americas " would be practically death-penalty free were it not for the united states , the only country on the continent to execute anyone in 2007 , " the report noted .
in africa , the death penalty was carried out in seven countries - botswana -lrb- at least one -rrb- , egypt -lrb- actual number unknown -rrb- , ethiopia -lrb- one -rrb- , equatorial new guinea -lrb- three -rrb- , libya -lrb- at least nine -rrb- , somalia -lrb- at least five -rrb- and sudan -lrb- at least seven -rrb- .
in 2007 and in the first six months of 2008 nine countries moved from retention to a form of abolition of the death penalty .

uzbekistan went from retentionist to abolitionist on january 1 , 2008.these moves were partly offset by the resumption of executions in afghanistan and ethiopia after several years of suspension , the report said .
belarus a blemish on europe " in europe , the only blemish on an otherwise completely death penalty-free zone continues to be belarus , where at least one person was executed in 2007 and three in the first five months of 2008 , " the report said .

" they were presidents , i am a citizen , " he told reporters travelling with him .
" there is no doubt that part of what i want to communicate on both sides of the atlantic is the enormous potential of us restoring a sense of coming together . " the 46-year-old presumptive democratic candidate said he wanted the united states and europe to rediscover their common ground . " obviously berlin is representative of the extraordinary success of the post world war ii effort to bring the continent together and to bring the west together , and later to bring the east and the west together , " he said .
" so i think it is a natural place to talk . " obama 's 45-minute address on trans-atlantic relations is expected to pull in tens of thousands . " hopefully -lsb- the speech -rsb- will be viewed as a substantive articulation of the relationship i 'd like to see between the united states and europe , " obama told reporters in israel shortly before leaving for germany .
" i 'm hoping to communicate across the atlantic the value of that relationship and how we need to build on it . " preparations for obama 's speech were marred after a 40-year man driving a car breached the cordoned off zone where the us presidential candidate is to speak and sprayed red paint around the area . bildunterschrift : police cordoned off the car after the paint attack the man from the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg is now in police custody , pending an investigation . earlier , a suspicious package at the swanky adlon hotel , which is close to both the us embassy and berlin 's historic brandenburg gate , triggered a security scare .
the hotel 's lobby was cleared briefly before the package was examined by explosives experts and declared that it did not represent any threat . election campaigning while berlin was in obama fever ahead of the visit , political commentators stressed that the main aim of the visit was to boost the senator 's fortunes in the us presidential race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's advance team was worried anti-american signs could sour us opinion of the speech in his speech , obama was expected to seek to revive trans-atlantic relations that suffered considerable damage under president george w. bush . europeans are looking to the illinois senator to restore a transatlantic relationship that has been strained , in particular , by president bush 's invasion of iraq . european leaders strongly support obama 's foreign policy goals including closing the guantanamo bay prison camp for terror suspects , fighting nuclear proliferation and tackling climate change with an eu-style emissions cap-and-trade plan . obama 's calls for talking directly to iran over its nuclear program and renewing us engagement in the middle east peace process have also received a warm welcome in european capitals . commentators were watching closely to discern calls for greater european contributions in afghanistan and to hear the senator 's views on pressing iran to abandon its uranium enrichment program . obama is overwhelmingly more popular in europe than his republican adversary , john mccain .
a recent poll put his german support at 76 percent . following his round of engagements in berlin , obama is to visit friday the us ramstein air force base and the us military hospital in landstuhl , which are both in the western part of germany . the presumed us democrat presidential candidate will then travel on to france .
before arriving in germany , obama visited israel , the palestinian territories , kuwait , afghanistan , iraq and jordan . no german troop changes in afghanistan asked about obama 's recent comments that he would press european nato partners for more troops for afghanistan , merkel said wednesday that germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to increase troop commitments in afghanistan " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission , " she told reporters .
" we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president , " merkel added . germany has faced growing pressure to increase the number of troops it has deployed in afghanistan and to move troops from the relatively calm north of the country to the south where us-led forces are battling tenacious taliban insurgents . in response to the calls from the united states and other nato members , berlin announced plans in june to boost its contingent in northern afghanistan later this year by up to 1,000 soldiers to a maximum of 4,500 troops . the mission , however , is extremely unpopular among germans and any move to expand the deployment further would likely provoke a voter backlash ahead of general elections slated for 2009 . us policy continuity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties to the us improved slightly after merkel took over in the chancellery merkel , who has met mccain on several occasions , said she was keen to sit down with his challenger .
she said she was impressed by the grassroots enthusiasm obama managed to spark during his " bold " and extended democratic primary campaign . " from the way he triumphed in the primaries in america , i would say he is a man of many strengths - physical , mental and political , " she said . merkel said she was particularly interested in discussing trans-atlantic political and economic ties with obama , nato , climate change and the doha trade round . but she said she expected broad continuity in the us stance toward europe regardless of whether obama or mccain won in november . " in general the impact of differences on domestic policy is larger than those on foreign policy , " she said .
" we will continue to defend our interests and , in specific cases , find compromises . " dw staff -lrb- sms / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am confident we will implement the lisbon treaty , " merkel said before going on summer vacation . the treaty of lisbon , signed at the end of last year and currently undergoing ratification by the individual members , was necessary not only if the eu was to expand , but also to enhance democracy within the bloc and to make it more effective , merkel said . the irish rejection of the lisbon treaty has left the bloc searching for a new way to move forward as the treaty must be unanimously ratified in order to go into effect . merkel was one of the driving forces behind the new treaty under germany 's eu presidency in the first half of last year . the treaty faces obstacles in germany , poland and the czech republic . german president horst koehler has said he will await a decision by the constitutional court on the treaty 's compatibility with the german constitution before signing into law the necessary legislation , which has been passed by both houses of parliament . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but the burdens of global citizenship bind us together , " he said , speaking under the central berlin landmark of the victory column facing towards the brandenburg gate . partnership among nations was not a choice but the only way to protect the security of europe and the us , the democratic party presidential hopeful said . obama challenged a new generation of americans and europeans to tear down walls between estranged allies , races , and faiths in his soaring call for global unity . " that is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another , " he said in reference to the berlin wall that divided the city from 1961 to 1989 . " partnerhip is not a choice but a means of survival " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama spoke of partnerships between nations in a speech that risked being seen as presumptuous , considering obama will not even face us voters for another three months , he warned of a world where partnership was not a choice but the only means of survival . " no one nation , no matter how large or powerful , can defeat such challenges alone , " he said , signaling that , if elected president , he would end what many europeans see as the unilateral foreign policy approach of president george w bush . obama also made clear he would not take the us into isolation .

that is why europe can not turn inward , " he said . crowds respond to barack ' n ' roll a party atmosphere gripped the crowds around the victory column monument as people listened to the man many hoped would replace george w bush as leader of the world 's most powerful nation . a roar went up from the multi-ethnic crowd when obama strolled confidently onto the stage to talk of the us-german partnership and the need to strengthen transatlantic relations to meet the challenges of the 21st century . bildunterschrift : supporters had more than the white house in mind around 100,000 lined the boulevard linking the victory column to the brandenburg gate , where obama had originally intended to speak but later dropped the plan after merkel signaled her disapproval at the site being used for foreign election campaign speeches . many of those present queued patiently for over an hour outside 20 airport-style security gates where they were required to empty their pockets and dispense with drinks containers . once inside they were able to refresh themselves with plastic mugs of german beer and snacks as a pop band livened up the audience on a warm mid-summer evening . no banners or placards were allowed on the strip guarded by around 1,000 police and other security officers as the obama team sought to ensure that no unwelcome slogans were aired on us television . but democrats inside distributed us flags to their supporters and a green poster was held aloft by an obama fan with the words " i love barack ' n ' roll . " outside the entrance gates to the security zone , us democrats wearing obama ' 08 buttons launched a recruitment drive , yelling out " us citizens register to vote . " obama talks of breaking down global walls the strikingly audacious speech , in a fevered atmosphere in berlin 's famed tiergarten , took the white house race out of us borders in a way never seen before , and was designed to portray obama as a leader with unique global appeal . bildunterschrift : the huge crowd responded to obama 's calls for unity " the walls between old allies on either side of the atlantic can not stand , " he said , referring to festering divisions between europe and the united states opened up by the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . " the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least can not stand , " said obama , in an address beamed live on us and german television channels and to viewers around the world . " the walls between races and tribes ; natives and immigrants ; christian and muslim and jew can not stand .
these now are the walls we must tear down , " obama said , drawing cheers and applause . obama 's speech was a clear echo of former us president ronald reagan 's call to then soviet leader mikhael gorbachev in berlin in 1987 to " tear down this wall , " before the fall of communism . full of passion , short of specifics despite its soaring cadences however , the speech was short on specifics .
obama 's aides said he would not talk policy as that is the job of a president but his critics will likely slam him for empty rhetoric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands stood listening in the balmy berlin evening the illinois senator rebuked both his country and europe for blaming one another for strains in their relations , but took pains to insulate himself from critics back home who doubt his patriotism .

" in europe , the view that america is part of what has gone wrong in our world , rather than a force to help make it right , has become all too common , " the 46-year-old first term senator said .

both views miss the truth .

" people of the world - look at berlin , where a wall came down , a continent came together , and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one , " obama said . he also promised america under his watch would be serious about tackling global warning , a huge concern in europe and a cause of rifts between the continent and the united states during the bush administration . europe needs to do its part , obama urges but he also signaled he would demand europe live up to its side of the bargain , asking for more help in the struggle against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan . " america can not do this alone , " obama said .
" the afghan people need our troops and your troops ; our support and your support to defeat the taliban and al-qaeda , to develop their economy , and to help them rebuild their nation . " we have too much at stake to turn back now . " obama is vowing to pour at least two more combat brigades into afghanistan , which is currently being pummeled by a rise in extremist violence and attacks , if he is elected president - with some troops to be redeployed from iraq . his aides have said that he believes nato nations should provide more troops for the conflict , and remove operating restrictions on forces that are already there . in an interview with cbs news on monday during his first-ever trip to the war-torn nation , obama warned conditions were " precarious and urgent " and also called on the afghan government to do more to stabilize the country . merkel resists obama pressure over troops bildunterschrift : merkel was firm on troops during the cordial meeting before giving his speech , obama on thursday met german chancellor angela merkel , who signaled clearly a day before that she would resist any pressure to send more troops to afghanistan . merkel said germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission .
we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- , " she said .

eu family law requires unanimous support in order to be enacted . provided that the european commission accepts the divorce initiative , it then has to be approved by a qualified majority of the bloc 's 27 member states . small factions lead the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu politicians are considering how to proceed after the irish rejected the lisbon treaty enhanced cooperation is regarded as one of the ways the eu can stem off paralysis across the bloc , which may increasingly come into play if it fails to quickly overcome ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty . that treaty , which also requires unanimous ratification to go into effect , would have simplified voting procedures in addition to changing the eu 's approach to foreign policy .
the european union 's reliance on unanimous decision-making comes under frequent criticism for paralyzing the bloc . except for issues with military or defense implications , eu treaties allow for pioneer groups but the clause has never been used before . " enhanced cooperation is a very sensitive issue because it has never been implemented , " a french diplomat said , according to reuters news agency .
" it allows several member states to go forward faster than others , and it is not necessarily the image we want to give of the eu . " some 170,000 international marriages end in divorce in the european union each year but there are no common rules dictating which country 's laws to apply .
spouses sometimes rush to court in their country of origin to try to get the law on their side . marriage and divorce laws differ widely across the 27-nation eu , from the liberal nordic nations to catholic poland and ireland .

" they were presidents , i am a citizen , " he told reporters travelling with him .
" there is no doubt that part of what i want to communicate on both sides of the atlantic is the enormous potential of us restoring a sense of coming together . " the 46-year-old presumptive democratic candidate said he wanted the united states and europe to rediscover their common ground . " obviously berlin is representative of the extraordinary success of the post world war ii effort to bring the continent together and to bring the west together , and later to bring the east and the west together , " he said .
" so i think it is a natural place to talk . " obama 's 45-minute address on trans-atlantic relations is expected to pull in tens of thousands . " hopefully -lsb- the speech -rsb- will be viewed as a substantive articulation of the relationship i 'd like to see between the united states and europe , " obama told reporters in israel shortly before leaving for germany .
" i 'm hoping to communicate across the atlantic the value of that relationship and how we need to build on it . " preparations for obama 's speech were marred after a 40-year man driving a car breached the cordoned off zone where the us presidential candidate is to speak and sprayed red paint around the area . bildunterschrift : police cordoned off the car after the paint attack the man from the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg is now in police custody , pending an investigation . earlier , a suspicious package at the swanky adlon hotel , which is close to both the us embassy and berlin 's historic brandenburg gate , triggered a security scare .
the hotel 's lobby was cleared briefly before the package was examined by explosives experts and declared that it did not represent any threat . election campaigning while berlin was in obama fever ahead of the visit , political commentators stressed that the main aim of the visit was to boost the senator 's fortunes in the us presidential race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's advance team was worried anti-american signs could sour us opinion of the speech in his speech , obama was expected to seek to revive trans-atlantic relations that suffered considerable damage under president george w. bush . europeans are looking to the illinois senator to restore a transatlantic relationship that has been strained , in particular , by president bush 's invasion of iraq . european leaders strongly support obama 's foreign policy goals including closing the guantanamo bay prison camp for terror suspects , fighting nuclear proliferation and tackling climate change with an eu-style emissions cap-and-trade plan . obama 's calls for talking directly to iran over its nuclear program and renewing us engagement in the middle east peace process have also received a warm welcome in european capitals . commentators were watching closely to discern calls for greater european contributions in afghanistan and to hear the senator 's views on pressing iran to abandon its uranium enrichment program . obama is overwhelmingly more popular in europe than his republican adversary , john mccain .
a recent poll put his german support at 76 percent . following his round of engagements in berlin , obama is to visit friday the us ramstein air force base and the us military hospital in landstuhl , which are both in the western part of germany . the presumed us democrat presidential candidate will then travel on to france .
before arriving in germany , obama visited israel , the palestinian territories , kuwait , afghanistan , iraq and jordan . no german troop changes in afghanistan asked about obama 's recent comments that he would press european nato partners for more troops for afghanistan , merkel said wednesday that germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to increase troop commitments in afghanistan " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission , " she told reporters .
" we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president , " merkel added . germany has faced growing pressure to increase the number of troops it has deployed in afghanistan and to move troops from the relatively calm north of the country to the south where us-led forces are battling tenacious taliban insurgents . in response to the calls from the united states and other nato members , berlin announced plans in june to boost its contingent in northern afghanistan later this year by up to 1,000 soldiers to a maximum of 4,500 troops . the mission , however , is extremely unpopular among germans and any move to expand the deployment further would likely provoke a voter backlash ahead of general elections slated for 2009 . us policy continuity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties to the us improved slightly after merkel took over in the chancellery merkel , who has met mccain on several occasions , said she was keen to sit down with his challenger .
she said she was impressed by the grassroots enthusiasm obama managed to spark during his " bold " and extended democratic primary campaign . " from the way he triumphed in the primaries in america , i would say he is a man of many strengths - physical , mental and political , " she said . merkel said she was particularly interested in discussing trans-atlantic political and economic ties with obama , nato , climate change and the doha trade round . but she said she expected broad continuity in the us stance toward europe regardless of whether obama or mccain won in november . " in general the impact of differences on domestic policy is larger than those on foreign policy , " she said .
" we will continue to defend our interests and , in specific cases , find compromises . " dw staff -lrb- sms / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is no doubt that part of what i want to communicate on both sides of the atlantic is the enormous potential of us restoring a sense of coming together . " the 46-year-old presumptive democratic candidate said he wanted the united states and europe to rediscover their common ground . " obviously berlin is representative of the extraordinary success of the post world war ii effort to bring the continent together and to bring the west together , and later to bring the east and the west together , " he said .
" so i think it is a natural place to talk . " obama 's 45-minute address on trans-atlantic relations is expected to pull in tens of thousands . " hopefully -lsb- the speech -rsb- will be viewed as a substantive articulation of the relationship i 'd like to see between the united states and europe , " obama told reporters in israel shortly before leaving for germany .
" i 'm hoping to communicate across the atlantic the value of that relationship and how we need to build on it . " preparations for obama 's speech were marred after a 40-year man driving a car breached the cordoned off zone where the us presidential candidate is to speak and sprayed red paint around the area . bildunterschrift : police cordoned off the car after the paint attack the man from the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg is now in police custody , pending an investigation . earlier , a suspicious package at the swanky adlon hotel , which is close to both the us embassy and berlin 's historic brandenburg gate , triggered a security scare .
the hotel 's lobby was cleared briefly before the package was examined by explosives experts and declared that it did not represent any threat . election campaigning while berlin was in obama fever ahead of the visit , political commentators stressed that the main aim of the visit was to boost the senator 's fortunes in the us presidential race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's advance team was worried anti-american signs could sour us opinion of the speech in his speech , obama was expected to seek to revive trans-atlantic relations that suffered considerable damage under president george w. bush . europeans are looking to the illinois senator to restore a transatlantic relationship that has been strained , in particular , by president bush 's invasion of iraq . european leaders strongly support obama 's foreign policy goals including closing the guantanamo bay prison camp for terror suspects , fighting nuclear proliferation and tackling climate change with an eu-style emissions cap-and-trade plan . obama 's calls for talking directly to iran over its nuclear program and renewing us engagement in the middle east peace process have also received a warm welcome in european capitals . commentators were watching closely to discern calls for greater european contributions in afghanistan and to hear the senator 's views on pressing iran to abandon its uranium enrichment program . obama is overwhelmingly more popular in europe than his republican adversary , john mccain .
a recent poll put his german support at 76 percent . following his round of engagements in berlin , obama is to visit friday the us ramstein air force base and the us military hospital in landstuhl , which are both in the western part of germany . the presumed us democrat presidential candidate will then travel on to france .
before arriving in germany , obama visited israel , the palestinian territories , kuwait , afghanistan , iraq and jordan . no german troop changes in afghanistan asked about obama 's recent comments that he would press european nato partners for more troops for afghanistan , merkel said wednesday that germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to increase troop commitments in afghanistan " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission , " she told reporters .
" we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president , " merkel added . germany has faced growing pressure to increase the number of troops it has deployed in afghanistan and to move troops from the relatively calm north of the country to the south where us-led forces are battling tenacious taliban insurgents . in response to the calls from the united states and other nato members , berlin announced plans in june to boost its contingent in northern afghanistan later this year by up to 1,000 soldiers to a maximum of 4,500 troops . the mission , however , is extremely unpopular among germans and any move to expand the deployment further would likely provoke a voter backlash ahead of general elections slated for 2009 . us policy continuity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties to the us improved slightly after merkel took over in the chancellery merkel , who has met mccain on several occasions , said she was keen to sit down with his challenger .
she said she was impressed by the grassroots enthusiasm obama managed to spark during his " bold " and extended democratic primary campaign . " from the way he triumphed in the primaries in america , i would say he is a man of many strengths - physical , mental and political , " she said . merkel said she was particularly interested in discussing trans-atlantic political and economic ties with obama , nato , climate change and the doha trade round . but she said she expected broad continuity in the us stance toward europe regardless of whether obama or mccain won in november . " in general the impact of differences on domestic policy is larger than those on foreign policy , " she said .
" we will continue to defend our interests and , in specific cases , find compromises . " dw staff -lrb- sms / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 24.07.2008 eu proposes partial ban on seal products großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials have n't clearly defined ' humane ' killing the european commission has proposed banning products made from seals killed in inhumane ways .
a former film diva and the world 's largest seal hunting nation are not happy with the plan - albeit for different reasons . the eu proposal would ban seal products from the bloc 's market unless they were proven to come from animals that had been killed with " hunting techniques consistent with high animal-welfare standards " and that the animals did not suffer more than necessary . seals are hunted mainly for their pelts but also for meat and fat , which is used in beauty products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hunter clubs a seal in canada " the images of seal hunting that circulate around the globe every year are a reminder of the often gruesome practices used to kill seals , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told journalists . " european citizens find these practices repugnant and in contradiction to our standards of animal welfare , " he added . the ban still has to be approved by eu governments and the european parliament . slippery slope ? the main target country of the ban is canada , where hunters slaughtered some 275,000 seals along the atlantic coast this year .
canada accounts for nearly a third of young seals killed each year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harper is cautioning the eu against a ban canadian premier stephen harper already voiced his opposition to the plan early this month , saying that his country " will not stand by and accept measures that fly in the face of accepted international practices . " his fisheries minister , loyola hearn , on wednesday , july 23 , also warned eu officials against going down a " slippery slope . " " to bow to misinformation and emotional rhetoric in restricting the trade of humanely harvested animals would set a dangerous precedent for all wild hunts , " he said . hearn added that seals were killed humanely in canada and seal products from his country would therefore not be affected by the ban . fisheries department spokesman phil jenkins meanwhile told afp news service that the eu has " not said exactly what they will consider to be humane or inhumane , so we do n't know yet what bar we have to reach to comply . " canada , greenland and namibia account for about 60 percent of the 900,000 seals hunted each year .
seals are also hunted in iceland , norway , russia , and the united states as well as in eu members britain , finland and sweden . " a historic step " animal rights activists meanwhile welcomed the proposal . " this announcement is a historic step forward in the campaign to end cruel commercial seal hunts , " said mark glover , head of the british arm of the humane society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bardot is generally pleased with the ban french actress-turned-animal-activist brigitte bardot , who has led a campaign against the killing of seals , regretted that " slaughters will continue as long as they are done in a humane way . " but bardot , who has made headlines in the past few years for supporting ultra-right politicians in france , was still happy about the plan . " a 30-year-long battle ... is about to be won , " bardot told ap news service . french president nicolas sarkozy has reportedly assured bardot that " everything would be done " during the french presidency of the european union to adopt a law banning imports of seal products in the eu . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 24.07.2008 eu proposes partial ban on seal products großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials have n't clearly defined ' humane ' killing the european commission has proposed banning products made from seals killed in inhumane ways .
a former film diva and the world 's largest seal hunting nation are not happy with the plan - albeit for different reasons . the eu proposal would ban seal products from the bloc 's market unless they were proven to come from animals that had been killed with " hunting techniques consistent with high animal-welfare standards " and that the animals did not suffer more than necessary . seals are hunted mainly for their pelts but also for meat and fat , which is used in beauty products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hunter clubs a seal in canada " the images of seal hunting that circulate around the globe every year are a reminder of the often gruesome practices used to kill seals , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told journalists . " european citizens find these practices repugnant and in contradiction to our standards of animal welfare , " he added . the ban still has to be approved by eu governments and the european parliament . slippery slope ? the main target country of the ban is canada , where hunters slaughtered some 275,000 seals along the atlantic coast this year .
canada accounts for nearly a third of young seals killed each year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harper is cautioning the eu against a ban canadian premier stephen harper already voiced his opposition to the plan early this month , saying that his country " will not stand by and accept measures that fly in the face of accepted international practices . " his fisheries minister , loyola hearn , on wednesday , july 23 , also warned eu officials against going down a " slippery slope . " " to bow to misinformation and emotional rhetoric in restricting the trade of humanely harvested animals would set a dangerous precedent for all wild hunts , " he said . hearn added that seals were killed humanely in canada and seal products from his country would therefore not be affected by the ban . fisheries department spokesman phil jenkins meanwhile told afp news service that the eu has " not said exactly what they will consider to be humane or inhumane , so we do n't know yet what bar we have to reach to comply . " canada , greenland and namibia account for about 60 percent of the 900,000 seals hunted each year .
seals are also hunted in iceland , norway , russia , and the united states as well as in eu members britain , finland and sweden . " a historic step " animal rights activists meanwhile welcomed the proposal . " this announcement is a historic step forward in the campaign to end cruel commercial seal hunts , " said mark glover , head of the british arm of the humane society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bardot is generally pleased with the ban french actress-turned-animal-activist brigitte bardot , who has led a campaign against the killing of seals , regretted that " slaughters will continue as long as they are done in a humane way . " but bardot , who has made headlines in the past few years for supporting ultra-right politicians in france , was still happy about the plan . " a 30-year-long battle ... is about to be won , " bardot told ap news service . french president nicolas sarkozy has reportedly assured bardot that " everything would be done " during the french presidency of the european union to adopt a law banning imports of seal products in the eu . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do n't expect the first natural gas to arrive till 2012 , " said andreas hieckmann , the project chief at the gazprom germania company . his comment clashed with a printed news release from nord stream , a consortium with russian , german and dutch involvement , which stated that 2011 was the target for the first flow . he was speaking in waren , north of berlin , where gazprom is studying the suitability of a bed of deep rock to store the gas in after it lands . nord stream said it aimed to complete a multinational environmental review of the undersea route by the end of this year . unfair advantage ? sweden has echoed environmentalists who fear the seabed trench for the pipes may kill sea life and stir up toxic material .
poland has led strategic criticism , saying russia may gain a massive advantage by piping the gas outside the borders of intermediate nations . hieckmann said he expected delays because dumped wartime ammunition would have to be recovered from the baltic seabed before the pipeline is laid and because of the " political friction " in the permissions process . " even if the regulatory procedures go according to plan , it will be a complex construction job , " he said . when complete , the line will transport 27.5 billion cubic meters -lrb- 971 million cubic feet -rrb- of gas annually to western europe .

my vision of europe includes lasting diversity .
herein lies its potential .
diversity has characterized europe for centuries , and diversity feeds the common european identity .
it is absurd to think that europe will ever flourish if its roots are enforced equality and shared values dictated from above .
a liberal europe of the future is based on recognition of diversity , and it will continue to promote this principle .
business long ago realized that competition is healthier than monopolies , and the same principle applies to politics . decentralization encourages this competition , which needs to permeate every level of politics .
take competition among business locations .
competition allows citizens and companies to identify where to base the services their taxes help provide .
if these are to be tied to a region or a country in the long-run , their hosts need to budget well and meet their responsibilities .
decentralization is a way to prevent governments from collecting extortionate taxes only in order to dole out subsidies and create mountains of debt .
anti-regulation according to my vision , europe recognizes the challenges and opportunities afforded by the principle of subsidiarity .
europe must be able to distinguish between areas in which standardized political structures make sense , and those in which a better alternative is freedom of choice exercised by eu member countries , bodies and citizens .
there are plenty of opportunities to learn from mistakes - such as the watered-down services directive , which saw the old eu countries ' guardians of vested rights succeed in asserting protectionism over competition .
or the rise in advertising bans , which reflects a growing tendency to regulate from brussels matters that do not requite state regulation . or the anti-globalization fund , which grants " victims " of globalization european aid money .
hardly a positive approach to the many opportunities afforded by globalization .
love is blind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dyed-in-the-wool european the europe of the future is a citizens ' europe .
today , europe is much closer to its citizens than they realize .
but they still do n't identify with it .
an ambivalent situation .
on the one hand europe is showered with love , with the younger generation particularly keen to describe themselves as europeans and actively contributing to its ever-evolving identity .
on the other hand , this love can be blind - because the eu , as it stands , is seen as out of touch with its citizens and mired in red tape .
this ambivalence needs to be dealt with .
for there to be a citizens ' europe , its citizens need to identify with it .
transparency , reduced red tape , better law-making , legislation with time limits and an assessment of the follow-up costs of legislation are the least that we can expect .
how can these goals be reached ?
for example , by tackling one key aspect of the eu - its financing .
a reform would create a simpler , more transparent system .
special treatments and exemptions need to be done away with - such as what 's known as the " british discount . "
a customized eu tax should not be tolerated .
so long as the eu remains a not-quite democracy , with decisions regarding the profit and loss accounting of taxpayers ' money made in parliament , the eu should not be granted tax authority .
the europe of the future needs to pursue solid , people-oriented politics which allow the public to experience a common europe first-hand .
only then will it be taking its first steps away from a technocracy and towards its citizens .
a two-speed europe europe will continue to grow - that much is clear .
the balkan countries , turkey , countries in eastern europe - they are all eyeing membership .
can the eu withstand this enlargement ?
there is a simple answer : every country should become as european as it wishes .
there is no doubt that we need to hold on to the basic principles of european success .
but partners can only work together when they want to .
a two-speed europe should be openly welcomed , so that countries deeply committed to the european project do not end up dragged down by ones that are more hesitant and less committed .
a two-speed europe already exists when dealing with the euro and various other political issues , although few will admit it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if some countries are n't interested , they do n't have to be this reflects the old idea of a core europe of the committed .
first , second and third class europeans ?
that 's not the point .
a europe of varying speeds would have many advantages .
it would do greater justice to the individual countries ' respective stages of development as well as their respective levels of commitment .
it would be up to the individual countries to set their own pace .
every country can choose whether it wants to be an innovator or a straggler .
the sole criterion for progress must remain a desire to propel europe forward .
europe is neither old , nor old-fashioned .
europe is in its prime .
however you look at it , europe is a great success . silvana koch-mehrin -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a statement issued by france , which currently holds the eu presidency , on thursday , july 24 , reminded tehran it had pledged to introduce a moratorium on stoning and urged it to abide by its commitments and international standards .
" the european union calls on the iranian government and parliament to abolish , in law and in practice , recourse to cruel and degrading punishment and , in particular the use of stoning , as a method of execution , " the statement read .
news reports say the eight women , ranging in age from 27 to 43 , had convictions including prostitution , incest and adultery .
the man , a 50-year-old music teacher , was convicted of illegal sex with a student .
the last officially reported stoning in the islamic republic was carried out on a man a year ago which sparked criticism from rights groups , the european union and a top un official .

" it points to the fact that the fight against the death penalty entails , beyond the stopping of executions , a battle for democracy , for the respect of the rule of law and for political rights and civil liberties , " the report said .
asia remained the region where the vast majority of executions are carried out , while the americas " would be practically death-penalty free were it not for the united states , the only country on the continent to execute anyone in 2007 , " the report noted .

a statement issued by france , which currently holds the eu presidency , on thursday , july 24 , reminded tehran it had pledged to introduce a moratorium on stoning and urged it to abide by its commitments and international standards .
" the european union calls on the iranian government and parliament to abolish , in law and in practice , recourse to cruel and degrading punishment and , in particular the use of stoning , as a method of execution , " the statement read .
news reports say the eight women , ranging in age from 27 to 43 , had convictions including prostitution , incest and adultery .
the man , a 50-year-old music teacher , was convicted of illegal sex with a student .
the last officially reported stoning in the islamic republic was carried out on a man a year ago which sparked criticism from rights groups , the european union and a top un official .
iran 's judiciary chief ayatollah mohmoud hashemi-shahroudi ordered a moratorium on stoning in 2002 .
iran , saudi arabia world leaders in executions the eu 's concerns over the death by stoning sentences in iran coincided with the release of a new report by a rome-based anti-death penalty group .
it showed that though a global trend towards abolition of the death penalty continued in 2007 with the number of countries practicing capital punishment dropping to 49 from 51 in the previous year , the number of executions worldwide increased .
the group , called hands off cain , presented its findings in the 2008 edition of its annual report , which covers the first six months of the year and 2007 .
at least 5,851 executions were carried out in 2007 up from the 5,635 registered in 2006 and 5,494 in 2005 , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these two chinese men were executed on drug-related charges in 1996 the surge was " in large part " due to the increased number of executions in iran , up by one-third , and saudi arabia where the number of people executed quadrupled , it said .
china put to death at least 5,000 people , accounting for 85.4 percent of the world total .
iran , which executed at least 355 people , and saudi arabia 166 , filled the other top three places of what the report called the " terrible podium " of capital-punishment practicing countries .

the report noted how the " prevalent situation worldwide " including china , vietnam , belarus and mongolia , was for governments to conceal the number of executions , making it difficult to provide exact figures .
" it points to the fact that the fight against the death penalty entails , beyond the stopping of executions , a battle for democracy , for the respect of the rule of law and for political rights and civil liberties , " the report said .
asia remained the region where the vast majority of executions are carried out , while the americas " would be practically death-penalty free were it not for the united states , the only country on the continent to execute anyone in 2007 , " the report noted .
in africa , the death penalty was carried out in seven countries - botswana -lrb- at least one -rrb- , egypt -lrb- actual number unknown -rrb- , ethiopia -lrb- one -rrb- , equatorial new guinea -lrb- three -rrb- , libya -lrb- at least nine -rrb- , somalia -lrb- at least five -rrb- and sudan -lrb- at least seven -rrb- .
in 2007 and in the first six months of 2008 nine countries moved from retention to a form of abolition of the death penalty .
rwanda went from retentionist to abolitionist in july of 2007 with a law that abolished the death penalty for all crimes , while kyrgyzstan abolished the death penalty in january 2007 , after years of moratorium .

my vision of europe includes lasting diversity .
herein lies its potential .
diversity has characterized europe for centuries , and diversity feeds the common european identity .
it is absurd to think that europe will ever flourish if its roots are enforced equality and shared values dictated from above .
a liberal europe of the future is based on recognition of diversity , and it will continue to promote this principle .
business long ago realized that competition is healthier than monopolies , and the same principle applies to politics . decentralization encourages this competition , which needs to permeate every level of politics .
take competition among business locations .
competition allows citizens and companies to identify where to base the services their taxes help provide .
if these are to be tied to a region or a country in the long-run , their hosts need to budget well and meet their responsibilities .
decentralization is a way to prevent governments from collecting extortionate taxes only in order to dole out subsidies and create mountains of debt .
anti-regulation according to my vision , europe recognizes the challenges and opportunities afforded by the principle of subsidiarity .
europe must be able to distinguish between areas in which standardized political structures make sense , and those in which a better alternative is freedom of choice exercised by eu member countries , bodies and citizens .
there are plenty of opportunities to learn from mistakes - such as the watered-down services directive , which saw the old eu countries ' guardians of vested rights succeed in asserting protectionism over competition .
or the rise in advertising bans , which reflects a growing tendency to regulate from brussels matters that do not requite state regulation . or the anti-globalization fund , which grants " victims " of globalization european aid money .
hardly a positive approach to the many opportunities afforded by globalization .
love is blind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dyed-in-the-wool european the europe of the future is a citizens ' europe .
today , europe is much closer to its citizens than they realize .
but they still do n't identify with it .
an ambivalent situation .
on the one hand europe is showered with love , with the younger generation particularly keen to describe themselves as europeans and actively contributing to its ever-evolving identity .
on the other hand , this love can be blind - because the eu , as it stands , is seen as out of touch with its citizens and mired in red tape .

my vision of europe includes lasting diversity .
herein lies its potential .
diversity has characterized europe for centuries , and diversity feeds the common european identity .
it is absurd to think that europe will ever flourish if its roots are enforced equality and shared values dictated from above .
a liberal europe of the future is based on recognition of diversity , and it will continue to promote this principle .
business long ago realized that competition is healthier than monopolies , and the same principle applies to politics . decentralization encourages this competition , which needs to permeate every level of politics .
take competition among business locations .
competition allows citizens and companies to identify where to base the services their taxes help provide .
if these are to be tied to a region or a country in the long-run , their hosts need to budget well and meet their responsibilities .
decentralization is a way to prevent governments from collecting extortionate taxes only in order to dole out subsidies and create mountains of debt .
anti-regulation according to my vision , europe recognizes the challenges and opportunities afforded by the principle of subsidiarity .
europe must be able to distinguish between areas in which standardized political structures make sense , and those in which a better alternative is freedom of choice exercised by eu member countries , bodies and citizens .
there are plenty of opportunities to learn from mistakes - such as the watered-down services directive , which saw the old eu countries ' guardians of vested rights succeed in asserting protectionism over competition .
or the rise in advertising bans , which reflects a growing tendency to regulate from brussels matters that do not requite state regulation . or the anti-globalization fund , which grants " victims " of globalization european aid money .
hardly a positive approach to the many opportunities afforded by globalization .

today , europe is much closer to its citizens than they realize .
but they still do n't identify with it .
an ambivalent situation .
on the one hand europe is showered with love , with the younger generation particularly keen to describe themselves as europeans and actively contributing to its ever-evolving identity .
on the other hand , this love can be blind - because the eu , as it stands , is seen as out of touch with its citizens and mired in red tape .

" but the burdens of global citizenship bind us together , " he said , speaking under the central berlin landmark of the victory column facing towards the brandenburg gate . partnership among nations was not a choice but the only way to protect the security of europe and the us , the democratic party presidential hopeful said . obama challenged a new generation of americans and europeans to tear down walls between estranged allies , races , and faiths in his soaring call for global unity . " that is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another , " he said in reference to the berlin wall that divided the city from 1961 to 1989 . " partnerhip is not a choice but a means of survival " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama spoke of partnerships between nations in a speech that risked being seen as presumptuous , considering obama will not even face us voters for another three months , he warned of a world where partnership was not a choice but the only means of survival . " no one nation , no matter how large or powerful , can defeat such challenges alone , " he said , signaling that , if elected president , he would end what many europeans see as the unilateral foreign policy approach of president george w bush . obama also made clear he would not take the us into isolation . " that is why america can not turn inward .
that is why europe can not turn inward , " he said . crowds respond to barack ' n ' roll a party atmosphere gripped the crowds around the victory column monument as people listened to the man many hoped would replace george w bush as leader of the world 's most powerful nation . a roar went up from the multi-ethnic crowd when obama strolled confidently onto the stage to talk of the us-german partnership and the need to strengthen transatlantic relations to meet the challenges of the 21st century . bildunterschrift : supporters had more than the white house in mind around 100,000 lined the boulevard linking the victory column to the brandenburg gate , where obama had originally intended to speak but later dropped the plan after merkel signaled her disapproval at the site being used for foreign election campaign speeches . many of those present queued patiently for over an hour outside 20 airport-style security gates where they were required to empty their pockets and dispense with drinks containers . once inside they were able to refresh themselves with plastic mugs of german beer and snacks as a pop band livened up the audience on a warm mid-summer evening . no banners or placards were allowed on the strip guarded by around 1,000 police and other security officers as the obama team sought to ensure that no unwelcome slogans were aired on us television . but democrats inside distributed us flags to their supporters and a green poster was held aloft by an obama fan with the words " i love barack ' n ' roll . " outside the entrance gates to the security zone , us democrats wearing obama ' 08 buttons launched a recruitment drive , yelling out " us citizens register to vote . " obama talks of breaking down global walls the strikingly audacious speech , in a fevered atmosphere in berlin 's famed tiergarten , took the white house race out of us borders in a way never seen before , and was designed to portray obama as a leader with unique global appeal . bildunterschrift : the huge crowd responded to obama 's calls for unity " the walls between old allies on either side of the atlantic can not stand , " he said , referring to festering divisions between europe and the united states opened up by the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . " the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least can not stand , " said obama , in an address beamed live on us and german television channels and to viewers around the world . " the walls between races and tribes ; natives and immigrants ; christian and muslim and jew can not stand .
these now are the walls we must tear down , " obama said , drawing cheers and applause . obama 's speech was a clear echo of former us president ronald reagan 's call to then soviet leader mikhael gorbachev in berlin in 1987 to " tear down this wall , " before the fall of communism . full of passion , short of specifics despite its soaring cadences however , the speech was short on specifics .
obama 's aides said he would not talk policy as that is the job of a president but his critics will likely slam him for empty rhetoric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands stood listening in the balmy berlin evening the illinois senator rebuked both his country and europe for blaming one another for strains in their relations , but took pains to insulate himself from critics back home who doubt his patriotism .
" i also know how much i love america .
i know that for more than two centuries , we have strived , at great cost and great sacrifice , to form a more perfect union ; to seek , with other nations , a more hopeful world , " he said . " in europe , the view that america is part of what has gone wrong in our world , rather than a force to help make it right , has become all too common , " the 46-year-old first term senator said . " in america , there are voices that deride and deny the importance of europe 's role in our security and our future .
both views miss the truth . " obama , who has a narrow lead in most polls of the us race , but trails mccain when voters are asked who would be the most credible commander in chief , used berlin 's triumph over division and totalitarianism as a metaphor for the world he hoped to forge . " people of the world - look at berlin , where a wall came down , a continent came together , and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one , " obama said . he also promised america under his watch would be serious about tackling global warning , a huge concern in europe and a cause of rifts between the continent and the united states during the bush administration . europe needs to do its part , obama urges but he also signaled he would demand europe live up to its side of the bargain , asking for more help in the struggle against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan . " america can not do this alone , " obama said .
" the afghan people need our troops and your troops ; our support and your support to defeat the taliban and al-qaeda , to develop their economy , and to help them rebuild their nation . " we have too much at stake to turn back now . " obama is vowing to pour at least two more combat brigades into afghanistan , which is currently being pummeled by a rise in extremist violence and attacks , if he is elected president - with some troops to be redeployed from iraq . his aides have said that he believes nato nations should provide more troops for the conflict , and remove operating restrictions on forces that are already there . in an interview with cbs news on monday during his first-ever trip to the war-torn nation , obama warned conditions were " precarious and urgent " and also called on the afghan government to do more to stabilize the country . merkel resists obama pressure over troops bildunterschrift : merkel was firm on troops during the cordial meeting before giving his speech , obama on thursday met german chancellor angela merkel , who signaled clearly a day before that she would resist any pressure to send more troops to afghanistan . merkel said germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission .
we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- , " she said . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president . " an apparently worsening security situation in afghanistan has seen troop deaths there exceed those in iraq for the second month in a row . forty-nine soldiers from the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and the separate us-led coalition died in combat , attacks or accidents in june , according to an afp tally based on military statements . by contrast , 31 soldiers including 29 americans , were killed in iraq in june despite the fact that there are more than twice as many troops there as in afghanistan , icasualties.org figures showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but the burdens of global citizenship bind us together , " he said , speaking under the central berlin landmark of the victory column facing towards the brandenburg gate . partnership among nations was not a choice but the only way to protect the security of europe and the us , the democratic party presidential hopeful said . obama challenged a new generation of americans and europeans to tear down walls between estranged allies , races , and faiths in his soaring call for global unity . " that is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another , " he said in reference to the berlin wall that divided the city from 1961 to 1989 . " partnerhip is not a choice but a means of survival " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama spoke of partnerships between nations in a speech that risked being seen as presumptuous , considering obama will not even face us voters for another three months , he warned of a world where partnership was not a choice but the only means of survival . " no one nation , no matter how large or powerful , can defeat such challenges alone , " he said , signaling that , if elected president , he would end what many europeans see as the unilateral foreign policy approach of president george w bush . obama also made clear he would not take the us into isolation .

that is why europe can not turn inward , " he said . crowds respond to barack ' n ' roll a party atmosphere gripped the crowds around the victory column monument as people listened to the man many hoped would replace george w bush as leader of the world 's most powerful nation . a roar went up from the multi-ethnic crowd when obama strolled confidently onto the stage to talk of the us-german partnership and the need to strengthen transatlantic relations to meet the challenges of the 21st century . bildunterschrift : supporters had more than the white house in mind around 100,000 lined the boulevard linking the victory column to the brandenburg gate , where obama had originally intended to speak but later dropped the plan after merkel signaled her disapproval at the site being used for foreign election campaign speeches . many of those present queued patiently for over an hour outside 20 airport-style security gates where they were required to empty their pockets and dispense with drinks containers . once inside they were able to refresh themselves with plastic mugs of german beer and snacks as a pop band livened up the audience on a warm mid-summer evening . no banners or placards were allowed on the strip guarded by around 1,000 police and other security officers as the obama team sought to ensure that no unwelcome slogans were aired on us television . but democrats inside distributed us flags to their supporters and a green poster was held aloft by an obama fan with the words " i love barack ' n ' roll . " outside the entrance gates to the security zone , us democrats wearing obama ' 08 buttons launched a recruitment drive , yelling out " us citizens register to vote . " obama talks of breaking down global walls the strikingly audacious speech , in a fevered atmosphere in berlin 's famed tiergarten , took the white house race out of us borders in a way never seen before , and was designed to portray obama as a leader with unique global appeal . bildunterschrift : the huge crowd responded to obama 's calls for unity " the walls between old allies on either side of the atlantic can not stand , " he said , referring to festering divisions between europe and the united states opened up by the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . " the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least can not stand , " said obama , in an address beamed live on us and german television channels and to viewers around the world . " the walls between races and tribes ; natives and immigrants ; christian and muslim and jew can not stand .
these now are the walls we must tear down , " obama said , drawing cheers and applause . obama 's speech was a clear echo of former us president ronald reagan 's call to then soviet leader mikhael gorbachev in berlin in 1987 to " tear down this wall , " before the fall of communism . full of passion , short of specifics despite its soaring cadences however , the speech was short on specifics .
obama 's aides said he would not talk policy as that is the job of a president but his critics will likely slam him for empty rhetoric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands stood listening in the balmy berlin evening the illinois senator rebuked both his country and europe for blaming one another for strains in their relations , but took pains to insulate himself from critics back home who doubt his patriotism .

" in america , there are voices that deride and deny the importance of europe 's role in our security and our future .
both views miss the truth .

" people of the world - look at berlin , where a wall came down , a continent came together , and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one , " obama said . he also promised america under his watch would be serious about tackling global warning , a huge concern in europe and a cause of rifts between the continent and the united states during the bush administration . europe needs to do its part , obama urges but he also signaled he would demand europe live up to its side of the bargain , asking for more help in the struggle against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan . " america can not do this alone , " obama said .
" the afghan people need our troops and your troops ; our support and your support to defeat the taliban and al-qaeda , to develop their economy , and to help them rebuild their nation . " we have too much at stake to turn back now . " obama is vowing to pour at least two more combat brigades into afghanistan , which is currently being pummeled by a rise in extremist violence and attacks , if he is elected president - with some troops to be redeployed from iraq . his aides have said that he believes nato nations should provide more troops for the conflict , and remove operating restrictions on forces that are already there . in an interview with cbs news on monday during his first-ever trip to the war-torn nation , obama warned conditions were " precarious and urgent " and also called on the afghan government to do more to stabilize the country . merkel resists obama pressure over troops bildunterschrift : merkel was firm on troops during the cordial meeting before giving his speech , obama on thursday met german chancellor angela merkel , who signaled clearly a day before that she would resist any pressure to send more troops to afghanistan . merkel said germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission .
we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- , " she said . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president .

" but the burdens of global citizenship bind us together , " he said , speaking under the central berlin landmark of the victory column facing towards the brandenburg gate . partnership among nations was not a choice but the only way to protect the security of europe and the us , the democratic party presidential hopeful said . obama challenged a new generation of americans and europeans to tear down walls between estranged allies , races , and faiths in his soaring call for global unity . " that is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another , " he said in reference to the berlin wall that divided the city from 1961 to 1989 .

" no one nation , no matter how large or powerful , can defeat such challenges alone , " he said , signaling that , if elected president , he would end what many europeans see as the unilateral foreign policy approach of president george w bush . obama also made clear he would not take the us into isolation .

" outside the entrance gates to the security zone , us democrats wearing obama ' 08 buttons launched a recruitment drive , yelling out " us citizens register to vote . " obama talks of breaking down global walls the strikingly audacious speech , in a fevered atmosphere in berlin 's famed tiergarten , took the white house race out of us borders in a way never seen before , and was designed to portray obama as a leader with unique global appeal . bildunterschrift : the huge crowd responded to obama 's calls for unity " the walls between old allies on either side of the atlantic can not stand , " he said , referring to festering divisions between europe and the united states opened up by the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .

" the walls between races and tribes ; natives and immigrants ; christian and muslim and jew can not stand .
these now are the walls we must tear down , " obama said , drawing cheers and applause . obama 's speech was a clear echo of former us president ronald reagan 's call to then soviet leader mikhael gorbachev in berlin in 1987 to " tear down this wall , " before the fall of communism . full of passion , short of specifics despite its soaring cadences however , the speech was short on specifics .

" i am confident we will implement the lisbon treaty , " merkel said before going on summer vacation . the treaty of lisbon , signed at the end of last year and currently undergoing ratification by the individual members , was necessary not only if the eu was to expand , but also to enhance democracy within the bloc and to make it more effective , merkel said . the irish rejection of the lisbon treaty has left the bloc searching for a new way to move forward as the treaty must be unanimously ratified in order to go into effect . merkel was one of the driving forces behind the new treaty under germany 's eu presidency in the first half of last year . the treaty faces obstacles in germany , poland and the czech republic . german president horst koehler has said he will await a decision by the constitutional court on the treaty 's compatibility with the german constitution before signing into law the necessary legislation , which has been passed by both houses of parliament . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" they were presidents , i am a citizen , " he told reporters travelling with him .
" there is no doubt that part of what i want to communicate on both sides of the atlantic is the enormous potential of us restoring a sense of coming together . " the 46-year-old presumptive democratic candidate said he wanted the united states and europe to rediscover their common ground . " obviously berlin is representative of the extraordinary success of the post world war ii effort to bring the continent together and to bring the west together , and later to bring the east and the west together , " he said .
" so i think it is a natural place to talk . " obama 's 45-minute address on trans-atlantic relations is expected to pull in tens of thousands . " hopefully -lsb- the speech -rsb- will be viewed as a substantive articulation of the relationship i 'd like to see between the united states and europe , " obama told reporters in israel shortly before leaving for germany .
" i 'm hoping to communicate across the atlantic the value of that relationship and how we need to build on it . " preparations for obama 's speech were marred after a 40-year man driving a car breached the cordoned off zone where the us presidential candidate is to speak and sprayed red paint around the area . bildunterschrift : police cordoned off the car after the paint attack the man from the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg is now in police custody , pending an investigation . earlier , a suspicious package at the swanky adlon hotel , which is close to both the us embassy and berlin 's historic brandenburg gate , triggered a security scare .
the hotel 's lobby was cleared briefly before the package was examined by explosives experts and declared that it did not represent any threat . election campaigning while berlin was in obama fever ahead of the visit , political commentators stressed that the main aim of the visit was to boost the senator 's fortunes in the us presidential race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's advance team was worried anti-american signs could sour us opinion of the speech in his speech , obama was expected to seek to revive trans-atlantic relations that suffered considerable damage under president george w. bush . europeans are looking to the illinois senator to restore a transatlantic relationship that has been strained , in particular , by president bush 's invasion of iraq . european leaders strongly support obama 's foreign policy goals including closing the guantanamo bay prison camp for terror suspects , fighting nuclear proliferation and tackling climate change with an eu-style emissions cap-and-trade plan . obama 's calls for talking directly to iran over its nuclear program and renewing us engagement in the middle east peace process have also received a warm welcome in european capitals . commentators were watching closely to discern calls for greater european contributions in afghanistan and to hear the senator 's views on pressing iran to abandon its uranium enrichment program . obama is overwhelmingly more popular in europe than his republican adversary , john mccain .
a recent poll put his german support at 76 percent . following his round of engagements in berlin , obama is to visit friday the us ramstein air force base and the us military hospital in landstuhl , which are both in the western part of germany . the presumed us democrat presidential candidate will then travel on to france .
before arriving in germany , obama visited israel , the palestinian territories , kuwait , afghanistan , iraq and jordan . no german troop changes in afghanistan asked about obama 's recent comments that he would press european nato partners for more troops for afghanistan , merkel said wednesday that germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to increase troop commitments in afghanistan " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission , " she told reporters .
" we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president , " merkel added . germany has faced growing pressure to increase the number of troops it has deployed in afghanistan and to move troops from the relatively calm north of the country to the south where us-led forces are battling tenacious taliban insurgents . in response to the calls from the united states and other nato members , berlin announced plans in june to boost its contingent in northern afghanistan later this year by up to 1,000 soldiers to a maximum of 4,500 troops . the mission , however , is extremely unpopular among germans and any move to expand the deployment further would likely provoke a voter backlash ahead of general elections slated for 2009 . us policy continuity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties to the us improved slightly after merkel took over in the chancellery merkel , who has met mccain on several occasions , said she was keen to sit down with his challenger .
she said she was impressed by the grassroots enthusiasm obama managed to spark during his " bold " and extended democratic primary campaign . " from the way he triumphed in the primaries in america , i would say he is a man of many strengths - physical , mental and political , " she said . merkel said she was particularly interested in discussing trans-atlantic political and economic ties with obama , nato , climate change and the doha trade round . but she said she expected broad continuity in the us stance toward europe regardless of whether obama or mccain won in november . " in general the impact of differences on domestic policy is larger than those on foreign policy , " she said .

" they were presidents , i am a citizen , " he told reporters travelling with him .
" there is no doubt that part of what i want to communicate on both sides of the atlantic is the enormous potential of us restoring a sense of coming together . " the 46-year-old presumptive democratic candidate said he wanted the united states and europe to rediscover their common ground . " obviously berlin is representative of the extraordinary success of the post world war ii effort to bring the continent together and to bring the west together , and later to bring the east and the west together , " he said .
" so i think it is a natural place to talk . " obama 's 45-minute address on trans-atlantic relations is expected to pull in tens of thousands . " hopefully -lsb- the speech -rsb- will be viewed as a substantive articulation of the relationship i 'd like to see between the united states and europe , " obama told reporters in israel shortly before leaving for germany .
" i 'm hoping to communicate across the atlantic the value of that relationship and how we need to build on it . " preparations for obama 's speech were marred after a 40-year man driving a car breached the cordoned off zone where the us presidential candidate is to speak and sprayed red paint around the area . bildunterschrift : police cordoned off the car after the paint attack the man from the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg is now in police custody , pending an investigation . earlier , a suspicious package at the swanky adlon hotel , which is close to both the us embassy and berlin 's historic brandenburg gate , triggered a security scare .
the hotel 's lobby was cleared briefly before the package was examined by explosives experts and declared that it did not represent any threat . election campaigning while berlin was in obama fever ahead of the visit , political commentators stressed that the main aim of the visit was to boost the senator 's fortunes in the us presidential race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's advance team was worried anti-american signs could sour us opinion of the speech in his speech , obama was expected to seek to revive trans-atlantic relations that suffered considerable damage under president george w. bush . europeans are looking to the illinois senator to restore a transatlantic relationship that has been strained , in particular , by president bush 's invasion of iraq . european leaders strongly support obama 's foreign policy goals including closing the guantanamo bay prison camp for terror suspects , fighting nuclear proliferation and tackling climate change with an eu-style emissions cap-and-trade plan . obama 's calls for talking directly to iran over its nuclear program and renewing us engagement in the middle east peace process have also received a warm welcome in european capitals . commentators were watching closely to discern calls for greater european contributions in afghanistan and to hear the senator 's views on pressing iran to abandon its uranium enrichment program . obama is overwhelmingly more popular in europe than his republican adversary , john mccain .
a recent poll put his german support at 76 percent . following his round of engagements in berlin , obama is to visit friday the us ramstein air force base and the us military hospital in landstuhl , which are both in the western part of germany . the presumed us democrat presidential candidate will then travel on to france .
before arriving in germany , obama visited israel , the palestinian territories , kuwait , afghanistan , iraq and jordan . no german troop changes in afghanistan asked about obama 's recent comments that he would press european nato partners for more troops for afghanistan , merkel said wednesday that germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to increase troop commitments in afghanistan " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission , " she told reporters .
" we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president , " merkel added . germany has faced growing pressure to increase the number of troops it has deployed in afghanistan and to move troops from the relatively calm north of the country to the south where us-led forces are battling tenacious taliban insurgents . in response to the calls from the united states and other nato members , berlin announced plans in june to boost its contingent in northern afghanistan later this year by up to 1,000 soldiers to a maximum of 4,500 troops . the mission , however , is extremely unpopular among germans and any move to expand the deployment further would likely provoke a voter backlash ahead of general elections slated for 2009 . us policy continuity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties to the us improved slightly after merkel took over in the chancellery merkel , who has met mccain on several occasions , said she was keen to sit down with his challenger .
she said she was impressed by the grassroots enthusiasm obama managed to spark during his " bold " and extended democratic primary campaign . " from the way he triumphed in the primaries in america , i would say he is a man of many strengths - physical , mental and political , " she said . merkel said she was particularly interested in discussing trans-atlantic political and economic ties with obama , nato , climate change and the doha trade round . but she said she expected broad continuity in the us stance toward europe regardless of whether obama or mccain won in november . " in general the impact of differences on domestic policy is larger than those on foreign policy , " she said .

2008 former bosnian serb leader and top war crimes suspect radovan karadzic hid behind the identity of a soldier killed by a sarajevo sniper 15 years ago , serbian media reported thursday , july 24 . karadzic 's alias was part of an elaborate charade that included a long white beard , a mistress and an alternative medicine website .
it ended after 12 years on the run with his arrest monday this week in belgrade .
he had identity papers issued in the name of dragan david dabic , a bosnian serb soldier in his late 30s who was killed in the bosnian capital in 1993 during the country 's ethnic war , serbian media reported .
and karadzic allegedly stole 36 million marks from the bosnian serb region 's central bank in 1997 , when he was already undercover , a bosnian newspaper said thursday .
serbian intelligence involved ?
serb authorities are expected to turn over karadzic within days to the un war crimes tribunal in the hague , where he faces charges including genocide and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1992-95 war .
karadzic , 63 , will tell the tribunal " he is proud of everything he did and for saving serbs in bosnia , " his lawyer svetozar vujacic told the politika daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic , seen here in 1995 , underwent a complete metamorphosis during more than a dozen years in hiding in plain sight karadzic will prove that the accusations are false and that he is charged only because he is a serb , his lawyer added .
serbia 's secret service is widely believed to have helped karadzic with his undercover life .
his fake documents were issued legally in ruma , 50 kilometers north-west of belgrade , most probably with the help of bosnian serb officials , reports said .
false documents were also used by other war crimes suspects arrested in serbia .
stojan zupljanin , who was arrested on june 11 in the serbian town pancevo , had documents under the name of a man who died more than 10 years ago .
zupljanin , a former bosnian serb police commander , has been indicted by the un war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity .
in serbia , proof of citizenship , a birth certificate or an old identity card are needed to obtain identity documents .
one also needs to give a fingerprint .
karadzic was not a citizen of serbia .
karadzic stole funds , paper says a bosnian newspaper thursday quoted a 2005 a interview it conducted with milorad dodik , currently prime minister of the serb entity in bosnia , in which he claimed that karadzic in 1997 stole 36 million german marks from the region 's central bank .
" there are documents that karadzic in the spring of 1997 took 36 million marks in a bag from banja luka , " dnevni avaz quoted dodik as saying .
" he first took 28 million marks from the bank 's safe and then eight more . "
since karadzic 's arrest , dodik has offered to help karadzic 's family travel to the hague and visit him .
the family can not travel without the permission of the international representative in bosnia .
they 've asked for their documents to be returned to them so that they can visit him in belgrade jail , saying that travelling to the hague is too costly .
" after 10 years of hell , i do n't see why somebody will profit from denying us this , " said karadzic 's daughter sonja karadzic jovicevic .
two years ago , karadzic posing as dragan david dabic spent a summer holiday on the croatian adriatic island of ciovo , croatian media reported thursday .
inhabitants say karadzic visited a local church and spent 10 days on the island , the 24sata daily said . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2008 former bosnian serb leader and top war crimes suspect radovan karadzic hid behind the identity of a soldier killed by a sarajevo sniper 15 years ago , serbian media reported thursday , july 24 . karadzic 's alias was part of an elaborate charade that included a long white beard , a mistress and an alternative medicine website .
it ended after 12 years on the run with his arrest monday this week in belgrade .
he had identity papers issued in the name of dragan david dabic , a bosnian serb soldier in his late 30s who was killed in the bosnian capital in 1993 during the country 's ethnic war , serbian media reported .
and karadzic allegedly stole 36 million marks from the bosnian serb region 's central bank in 1997 , when he was already undercover , a bosnian newspaper said thursday .
serbian intelligence involved ?
serb authorities are expected to turn over karadzic within days to the un war crimes tribunal in the hague , where he faces charges including genocide and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1992-95 war .
karadzic , 63 , will tell the tribunal " he is proud of everything he did and for saving serbs in bosnia , " his lawyer svetozar vujacic told the politika daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic , seen here in 1995 , underwent a complete metamorphosis during more than a dozen years in hiding in plain sight karadzic will prove that the accusations are false and that he is charged only because he is a serb , his lawyer added .
serbia 's secret service is widely believed to have helped karadzic with his undercover life .
his fake documents were issued legally in ruma , 50 kilometers north-west of belgrade , most probably with the help of bosnian serb officials , reports said .
false documents were also used by other war crimes suspects arrested in serbia .
stojan zupljanin , who was arrested on june 11 in the serbian town pancevo , had documents under the name of a man who died more than 10 years ago .
zupljanin , a former bosnian serb police commander , has been indicted by the un war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity .

karadzic was not a citizen of serbia .
karadzic stole funds , paper says a bosnian newspaper thursday quoted a 2005 a interview it conducted with milorad dodik , currently prime minister of the serb entity in bosnia , in which he claimed that karadzic in 1997 stole 36 million german marks from the region 's central bank .
" there are documents that karadzic in the spring of 1997 took 36 million marks in a bag from banja luka , " dnevni avaz quoted dodik as saying .
" he first took 28 million marks from the bank 's safe and then eight more . "
since karadzic 's arrest , dodik has offered to help karadzic 's family travel to the hague and visit him .
the family can not travel without the permission of the international representative in bosnia .
they 've asked for their documents to be returned to them so that they can visit him in belgrade jail , saying that travelling to the hague is too costly .
" after 10 years of hell , i do n't see why somebody will profit from denying us this , " said karadzic 's daughter sonja karadzic jovicevic .
two years ago , karadzic posing as dragan david dabic spent a summer holiday on the croatian adriatic island of ciovo , croatian media reported thursday .

thousands of jobs may hang in the balance . while saxony 's sachsenlb gave up its independence to its fellow state-run bank landesbank baden-wuettemberg and billions of euros worth of support keep the dusseldorf-based ikb afloat by the state-owned development bank kfw other smaller banks , like the weserbank , have quietly closed their doors . the global markets crisis has led to a consolidation in the german banking sector but has not shook the country of its system of state banks , according to reinhard schmidt , who heads the university of frankfurt 's chair of international banking and finance . " something had to happen with the state banks and the crisis sped up that process , " he said , adding that there is a growing tendency among private banks to consolidate .
" but i do not see the banks being unable to function in their old , fundamental ways as a possible consequence of the crisis . " foreign banks want in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milan 's unicredit bought a german bank three years ago though germany is often regarded as " overbanked " with too many banks fighting for a limited amount of business , foreign institutions are eager to enter the german market . three years ago , italy 's unicredit bought the german hypovereinsbank three years ago and citibank 's german subsidiary was taken over by france 's credit mutuel . the french bank was willing to pay over 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.8 billion -rrb- , outbidding deutsche bank , for the us banking giant 's german operations . but deutsche quickly licked it wounds and is reportedly now eying germany 's postbank , which needs a fiscal injection to support faltering delivery services in the united states . but as much as the postbank needs the money - and as eager as the german government , the bank 's indirect main shareholder , would be to turn the bank into national financial powerhouse - postbank executives have said they are n't willing to accept an offer that undervalues the bank . postbank board member wolfgang klein said he has an ideal partner in mind but would not confirm whether deutsche was who he had in mind .
the bank 's large base of customers who keep their money in simply checking and savings accounts make postbank attractive to institutions eager to sell additional investment services . dresdner another takeover target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if postbank and deutsche join up , it could set off a spree of mergers according to the german banking rumor mill in frankfurt , if deutsch postbank tie the knot , a merger between commerzbank and dresdner bank would n't be far behind .
the allianz group would reportedly be willing to part ways with the bank it bought for 24 million euros in 2001 . " allianz never got dresdner bank under control , " said dieter hein , a bank analyst at fairesearch , adding that the combination of an insurance company and bank has seldom proven profitable .

" we should engage the russians not to pursue that approach , " general norton schwartz , nominated by bush to become the top air force officer , told a senate committee .
" and if they did , i think , we should stand strong and indicate that that is something that crosses a threshold , crosses a red line for the united states . " just a thought ? an unnamed russian officer meanwhile told russian newspaper izvestiya that the cuban proposal was just an initial thought . " but that does n't mean there is n't something concrete behind it , " he added . bildunterschrift : russian radar stations are n't exactly a pretty sight the white house refused to directly comment on the report because the russian government has not publicly stated its intentions .
but spokesman dana perino reiterated the view that the stationing of missile defenses in poland and the czech republic does not threaten russia . the united states is working on agreements with the two countries to counter iran 's growing ballistic capability . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-tv will be available in the olympic village , the press center , the broadcasting center , hotels and venues until september 20 .
for one of the most censored media markets in the world , according to reporters without borders , deutsche welle produces radio and internet content in chinese – including information from china with analysis of political and societal events and opinions about china from a german and european perspective .
in doing so , ger-many ’ s international broadcaster communicates news from germany , europe and the world with its chinese programming .
dw-radio -lrb- on-air since 1965 -rrb- broadcasts three shows in chinese daily , for a total of 160 minutes , via shortwave and satellite as well as on the internet .
the chinese ver-sion of dw-world.de -lrb- www.dw-world.de / chinese -rrb- has been regularly censored by authorities for the last few years .
however , those interested often use the many pos-sibilities to go around the technological blockade , for example by using a proxy-server or reading posted articles in forums .
the complete programming from dw-tv can ’ t officially be received in the people ’ s republic of china .
a corresponding license has never been approved .
nevertheless it is becoming more and more available .
individual shows are being broadcast due to cooperation with chinese partners , like the hong kong station atv in the southern province guangdong and the taiwanese station eastern .
it is also available on the internet via tvu and the video platform uusee .

" we should engage the russians not to pursue that approach , " general norton schwartz , nominated by bush to become the top air force officer , told a senate committee .
" and if they did , i think , we should stand strong and indicate that that is something that crosses a threshold , crosses a red line for the united states . " just a thought ? an unnamed russian officer meanwhile told russian newspaper izvestiya that the cuban proposal was just an initial thought . " but that does n't mean there is n't something concrete behind it , " he added . bildunterschrift : russian radar stations are n't exactly a pretty sight the white house refused to directly comment on the report because the russian government has not publicly stated its intentions .
but spokesman dana perino reiterated the view that the stationing of missile defenses in poland and the czech republic does not threaten russia . the united states is working on agreements with the two countries to counter iran 's growing ballistic capability . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a former film diva and the world 's largest seal hunting nation are not happy with the plan - albeit for different reasons . the eu proposal would ban seal products from the bloc 's market unless they were proven to come from animals that had been killed with " hunting techniques consistent with high animal-welfare standards " and that the animals did not suffer more than necessary . seals are hunted mainly for their pelts but also for meat and fat , which is used in beauty products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hunter clubs a seal in canada " the images of seal hunting that circulate around the globe every year are a reminder of the often gruesome practices used to kill seals , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told journalists . " european citizens find these practices repugnant and in contradiction to our standards of animal welfare , " he added . the ban still has to be approved by eu governments and the european parliament . slippery slope ? the main target country of the ban is canada , where hunters slaughtered some 275,000 seals along the atlantic coast this year .
canada accounts for nearly a third of young seals killed each year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harper is cautioning the eu against a ban canadian premier stephen harper already voiced his opposition to the plan early this month , saying that his country " will not stand by and accept measures that fly in the face of accepted international practices . " his fisheries minister , loyola hearn , on wednesday , july 23 , also warned eu officials against going down a " slippery slope . " " to bow to misinformation and emotional rhetoric in restricting the trade of humanely harvested animals would set a dangerous precedent for all wild hunts , " he said . hearn added that seals were killed humanely in canada and seal products from his country would therefore not be affected by the ban . fisheries department spokesman phil jenkins meanwhile told afp news service that the eu has " not said exactly what they will consider to be humane or inhumane , so we do n't know yet what bar we have to reach to comply . " canada , greenland and namibia account for about 60 percent of the 900,000 seals hunted each year .
seals are also hunted in iceland , norway , russia , and the united states as well as in eu members britain , finland and sweden .

a former film diva and the world 's largest seal hunting nation are not happy with the plan - albeit for different reasons . the eu proposal would ban seal products from the bloc 's market unless they were proven to come from animals that had been killed with " hunting techniques consistent with high animal-welfare standards " and that the animals did not suffer more than necessary . seals are hunted mainly for their pelts but also for meat and fat , which is used in beauty products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hunter clubs a seal in canada " the images of seal hunting that circulate around the globe every year are a reminder of the often gruesome practices used to kill seals , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told journalists . " european citizens find these practices repugnant and in contradiction to our standards of animal welfare , " he added . the ban still has to be approved by eu governments and the european parliament . slippery slope ? the main target country of the ban is canada , where hunters slaughtered some 275,000 seals along the atlantic coast this year .
canada accounts for nearly a third of young seals killed each year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harper is cautioning the eu against a ban canadian premier stephen harper already voiced his opposition to the plan early this month , saying that his country " will not stand by and accept measures that fly in the face of accepted international practices . " his fisheries minister , loyola hearn , on wednesday , july 23 , also warned eu officials against going down a " slippery slope . " " to bow to misinformation and emotional rhetoric in restricting the trade of humanely harvested animals would set a dangerous precedent for all wild hunts , " he said . hearn added that seals were killed humanely in canada and seal products from his country would therefore not be affected by the ban . fisheries department spokesman phil jenkins meanwhile told afp news service that the eu has " not said exactly what they will consider to be humane or inhumane , so we do n't know yet what bar we have to reach to comply . " canada , greenland and namibia account for about 60 percent of the 900,000 seals hunted each year .
seals are also hunted in iceland , norway , russia , and the united states as well as in eu members britain , finland and sweden . " a historic step " animal rights activists meanwhile welcomed the proposal . " this announcement is a historic step forward in the campaign to end cruel commercial seal hunts , " said mark glover , head of the british arm of the humane society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bardot is generally pleased with the ban french actress-turned-animal-activist brigitte bardot , who has led a campaign against the killing of seals , regretted that " slaughters will continue as long as they are done in a humane way . " but bardot , who has made headlines in the past few years for supporting ultra-right politicians in france , was still happy about the plan . " a 30-year-long battle ... is about to be won , " bardot told ap news service . french president nicolas sarkozy has reportedly assured bardot that " everything would be done " during the french presidency of the european union to adopt a law banning imports of seal products in the eu . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu family law requires unanimous support in order to be enacted . provided that the european commission accepts the divorce initiative , it then has to be approved by a qualified majority of the bloc 's 27 member states . small factions lead the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu politicians are considering how to proceed after the irish rejected the lisbon treaty enhanced cooperation is regarded as one of the ways the eu can stem off paralysis across the bloc , which may increasingly come into play if it fails to quickly overcome ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty . that treaty , which also requires unanimous ratification to go into effect , would have simplified voting procedures in addition to changing the eu 's approach to foreign policy .
the european union 's reliance on unanimous decision-making comes under frequent criticism for paralyzing the bloc . except for issues with military or defense implications , eu treaties allow for pioneer groups but the clause has never been used before . " enhanced cooperation is a very sensitive issue because it has never been implemented , " a french diplomat said , according to reuters news agency .
" it allows several member states to go forward faster than others , and it is not necessarily the image we want to give of the eu . " some 170,000 international marriages end in divorce in the european union each year but there are no common rules dictating which country 's laws to apply .
spouses sometimes rush to court in their country of origin to try to get the law on their side . marriage and divorce laws differ widely across the 27-nation eu , from the liberal nordic nations to catholic poland and ireland .

" but the burdens of global citizenship bind us together , " he said , speaking under the central berlin landmark of the victory column facing towards the brandenburg gate . partnership among nations was not a choice but the only way to protect the security of europe and the us , the democratic party presidential hopeful said . obama challenged a new generation of americans and europeans to tear down walls between estranged allies , races , and faiths in his soaring call for global unity . " that is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another , " he said in reference to the berlin wall that divided the city from 1961 to 1989 . " partnerhip is not a choice but a means of survival " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama spoke of partnerships between nations in a speech that risked being seen as presumptuous , considering obama will not even face us voters for another three months , he warned of a world where partnership was not a choice but the only means of survival . " no one nation , no matter how large or powerful , can defeat such challenges alone , " he said , signaling that , if elected president , he would end what many europeans see as the unilateral foreign policy approach of president george w bush . obama also made clear he would not take the us into isolation . " that is why america can not turn inward .
that is why europe can not turn inward , " he said . crowds respond to barack ' n ' roll a party atmosphere gripped the crowds around the victory column monument as people listened to the man many hoped would replace george w bush as leader of the world 's most powerful nation . a roar went up from the multi-ethnic crowd when obama strolled confidently onto the stage to talk of the us-german partnership and the need to strengthen transatlantic relations to meet the challenges of the 21st century . bildunterschrift : supporters had more than the white house in mind around 100,000 lined the boulevard linking the victory column to the brandenburg gate , where obama had originally intended to speak but later dropped the plan after merkel signaled her disapproval at the site being used for foreign election campaign speeches . many of those present queued patiently for over an hour outside 20 airport-style security gates where they were required to empty their pockets and dispense with drinks containers . once inside they were able to refresh themselves with plastic mugs of german beer and snacks as a pop band livened up the audience on a warm mid-summer evening . no banners or placards were allowed on the strip guarded by around 1,000 police and other security officers as the obama team sought to ensure that no unwelcome slogans were aired on us television . but democrats inside distributed us flags to their supporters and a green poster was held aloft by an obama fan with the words " i love barack ' n ' roll . " outside the entrance gates to the security zone , us democrats wearing obama ' 08 buttons launched a recruitment drive , yelling out " us citizens register to vote . " obama talks of breaking down global walls the strikingly audacious speech , in a fevered atmosphere in berlin 's famed tiergarten , took the white house race out of us borders in a way never seen before , and was designed to portray obama as a leader with unique global appeal . bildunterschrift : the huge crowd responded to obama 's calls for unity " the walls between old allies on either side of the atlantic can not stand , " he said , referring to festering divisions between europe and the united states opened up by the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . " the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least can not stand , " said obama , in an address beamed live on us and german television channels and to viewers around the world . " the walls between races and tribes ; natives and immigrants ; christian and muslim and jew can not stand .
these now are the walls we must tear down , " obama said , drawing cheers and applause . obama 's speech was a clear echo of former us president ronald reagan 's call to then soviet leader mikhael gorbachev in berlin in 1987 to " tear down this wall , " before the fall of communism . full of passion , short of specifics despite its soaring cadences however , the speech was short on specifics .
obama 's aides said he would not talk policy as that is the job of a president but his critics will likely slam him for empty rhetoric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands stood listening in the balmy berlin evening the illinois senator rebuked both his country and europe for blaming one another for strains in their relations , but took pains to insulate himself from critics back home who doubt his patriotism .
" i also know how much i love america .
i know that for more than two centuries , we have strived , at great cost and great sacrifice , to form a more perfect union ; to seek , with other nations , a more hopeful world , " he said . " in europe , the view that america is part of what has gone wrong in our world , rather than a force to help make it right , has become all too common , " the 46-year-old first term senator said . " in america , there are voices that deride and deny the importance of europe 's role in our security and our future .
both views miss the truth . " obama , who has a narrow lead in most polls of the us race , but trails mccain when voters are asked who would be the most credible commander in chief , used berlin 's triumph over division and totalitarianism as a metaphor for the world he hoped to forge . " people of the world - look at berlin , where a wall came down , a continent came together , and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one , " obama said . he also promised america under his watch would be serious about tackling global warning , a huge concern in europe and a cause of rifts between the continent and the united states during the bush administration . europe needs to do its part , obama urges but he also signaled he would demand europe live up to its side of the bargain , asking for more help in the struggle against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan . " america can not do this alone , " obama said .
" the afghan people need our troops and your troops ; our support and your support to defeat the taliban and al-qaeda , to develop their economy , and to help them rebuild their nation . " we have too much at stake to turn back now . " obama is vowing to pour at least two more combat brigades into afghanistan , which is currently being pummeled by a rise in extremist violence and attacks , if he is elected president - with some troops to be redeployed from iraq . his aides have said that he believes nato nations should provide more troops for the conflict , and remove operating restrictions on forces that are already there . in an interview with cbs news on monday during his first-ever trip to the war-torn nation , obama warned conditions were " precarious and urgent " and also called on the afghan government to do more to stabilize the country . merkel resists obama pressure over troops bildunterschrift : merkel was firm on troops during the cordial meeting before giving his speech , obama on thursday met german chancellor angela merkel , who signaled clearly a day before that she would resist any pressure to send more troops to afghanistan . merkel said germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission .
we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- , " she said . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president . " an apparently worsening security situation in afghanistan has seen troop deaths there exceed those in iraq for the second month in a row . forty-nine soldiers from the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and the separate us-led coalition died in combat , attacks or accidents in june , according to an afp tally based on military statements . by contrast , 31 soldiers including 29 americans , were killed in iraq in june despite the fact that there are more than twice as many troops there as in afghanistan , icasualties.org figures showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" they were presidents , i am a citizen , " he told reporters travelling with him .
" there is no doubt that part of what i want to communicate on both sides of the atlantic is the enormous potential of us restoring a sense of coming together . " the 46-year-old presumptive democratic candidate said he wanted the united states and europe to rediscover their common ground . " obviously berlin is representative of the extraordinary success of the post world war ii effort to bring the continent together and to bring the west together , and later to bring the east and the west together , " he said .
" so i think it is a natural place to talk . " obama 's 45-minute address on trans-atlantic relations is expected to pull in tens of thousands . " hopefully -lsb- the speech -rsb- will be viewed as a substantive articulation of the relationship i 'd like to see between the united states and europe , " obama told reporters in israel shortly before leaving for germany .
" i 'm hoping to communicate across the atlantic the value of that relationship and how we need to build on it . " preparations for obama 's speech were marred after a 40-year man driving a car breached the cordoned off zone where the us presidential candidate is to speak and sprayed red paint around the area . bildunterschrift : police cordoned off the car after the paint attack the man from the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg is now in police custody , pending an investigation . earlier , a suspicious package at the swanky adlon hotel , which is close to both the us embassy and berlin 's historic brandenburg gate , triggered a security scare .
the hotel 's lobby was cleared briefly before the package was examined by explosives experts and declared that it did not represent any threat . election campaigning while berlin was in obama fever ahead of the visit , political commentators stressed that the main aim of the visit was to boost the senator 's fortunes in the us presidential race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's advance team was worried anti-american signs could sour us opinion of the speech in his speech , obama was expected to seek to revive trans-atlantic relations that suffered considerable damage under president george w. bush . europeans are looking to the illinois senator to restore a transatlantic relationship that has been strained , in particular , by president bush 's invasion of iraq . european leaders strongly support obama 's foreign policy goals including closing the guantanamo bay prison camp for terror suspects , fighting nuclear proliferation and tackling climate change with an eu-style emissions cap-and-trade plan . obama 's calls for talking directly to iran over its nuclear program and renewing us engagement in the middle east peace process have also received a warm welcome in european capitals . commentators were watching closely to discern calls for greater european contributions in afghanistan and to hear the senator 's views on pressing iran to abandon its uranium enrichment program . obama is overwhelmingly more popular in europe than his republican adversary , john mccain .
a recent poll put his german support at 76 percent . following his round of engagements in berlin , obama is to visit friday the us ramstein air force base and the us military hospital in landstuhl , which are both in the western part of germany . the presumed us democrat presidential candidate will then travel on to france .
before arriving in germany , obama visited israel , the palestinian territories , kuwait , afghanistan , iraq and jordan . no german troop changes in afghanistan asked about obama 's recent comments that he would press european nato partners for more troops for afghanistan , merkel said wednesday that germany had no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the nato-led isaf mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to increase troop commitments in afghanistan " i can give barack obama the good news that we will be boosting the mandate to include 1,000 more troops for the isaf mission , " she told reporters .
" we also just took over the command of the quick reaction force -lrb- in northern afghanistan -rrb- . " thus i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear , just as i have done with the current president , " merkel added . germany has faced growing pressure to increase the number of troops it has deployed in afghanistan and to move troops from the relatively calm north of the country to the south where us-led forces are battling tenacious taliban insurgents . in response to the calls from the united states and other nato members , berlin announced plans in june to boost its contingent in northern afghanistan later this year by up to 1,000 soldiers to a maximum of 4,500 troops . the mission , however , is extremely unpopular among germans and any move to expand the deployment further would likely provoke a voter backlash ahead of general elections slated for 2009 . us policy continuity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties to the us improved slightly after merkel took over in the chancellery merkel , who has met mccain on several occasions , said she was keen to sit down with his challenger .
she said she was impressed by the grassroots enthusiasm obama managed to spark during his " bold " and extended democratic primary campaign . " from the way he triumphed in the primaries in america , i would say he is a man of many strengths - physical , mental and political , " she said . merkel said she was particularly interested in discussing trans-atlantic political and economic ties with obama , nato , climate change and the doha trade round . but she said she expected broad continuity in the us stance toward europe regardless of whether obama or mccain won in november . " in general the impact of differences on domestic policy is larger than those on foreign policy , " she said .
" we will continue to defend our interests and , in specific cases , find compromises . " dw staff -lrb- sms / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the maasdam is the first transatlantic liner to visit and , with nearly 2,000 holidaymakers , by far the largest .
it will be worth up to £ 170,000 to the local economy , according to milford haven port authority .
it is aiming to double the number of cruise ships it handles within the next three years .
the port authority started promoting pembrokeshire as a cruise destination five years ago .
passenger numbers have steadily increased since but with the arrival of the maasdam , part of the holland america line , numbers will grow dramatically .
it is a drive tourism leaders in pembrokeshire are hoping will help add to the £ 300m the industry is estimated to be worth to the county at present .
milford haven and cruises the average spend in wales is £ 85 per passenger and £ 55 per crew member milford haven welcomed seven ships during 2006-07 with a total of 3,673 passengers this year will see seven cruise ships dock and six bookings have been taken for 2009 milford haven is the sixth largest port in the uk and this year is the port authority 's golden jubilee source : milford haven port authority rachel hicks , chief executive of pembrokeshire tourism , said the ship 's visit was exciting for the area .
" we know they will get a very warm welsh welcome and i hope it shows other cruise companies what a wonderful , diverse offering , we have so they are encouraged to include pembrokeshire in their itineraries .
" the port authority has achieved a magnificent feat building the cruise trade here and with even more visits due next year we could see the boom of a new form of tourism . "
she said she hoped efforts would be made to encourage ships to stay longer and hoped passengers would return " under their own steam " when they saw what the area had to offer .
milford has joined forces with the ports of cardiff , swansea , holyhead and fishguard to form cruise wales , aimed at attracting more ships to visit .
' excursions ' recently it also became the first port in the uk to stage seminars for businesses to raise the standard of the shore-side welcome and to show companies how they could benefit from the trade .
many passengers on the maasdam have pre-booked a variety of excursions including coach trips to st davids , the national botanic gardens , pembroke , carew castle and caldey island near tenby .
a port authority spokeswoman said : " other independent passengers , who have not booked excursions , will be offered the opportunity to look around milford haven town and marina , with free shuttle buses available for them .
" we get a great response to this service , with passengers wandering around the town , the museum and the shops on the marina . "

this is also the largest year-on-year increase since 1991 , when the country was deep in economic turmoil .
yet experts warn the worst is still to come as this week ’ s hike in fuel prices takes its toll .
the government statistics office said the consumer price index -lrb- cpi -rrb- for july alone had risen 1.13 % on june 's figure , slightly lower than in previous months .
however , prices are on the rise and august ’ s figures are expected to be much higher due to the impact of fuel prices .
last monday , hanoi unexpectedly raised the petrol price by more than 30 % , citing high costs in the world market .
the decision was met by widespread public discontent .
among the hardest hit are the poor and company workers , who have seen their wages melting fast in the heat of inflation .
but economists warn higher fuel costs will increase pressure on other commodities and services , thus making inflation rocket .
some estimate that the cpi increase for the whole year may exceed 30 % .
they also warn public grievances may lead to social unrest , something the hanoi government is extremely worried about .
prime minister nguyen tan dung has ordered state companies to tighten their belts and cut back on their expenses as well as " unnecessary new investments " .
he also promised a stricter monetary policy , making price control the " utmost priority " of his cabinet .
mr dung hopes to cut the inflation rate to a single digit in a year ’ s time .
but in order to achieve that target , the vietnamese government may have to sacrifice high economic growth rates .
the asia development bank has recently reduced their growth forecast for vietnam in 2008 to 6.5 % from the previous 7 % .

this is also the largest year-on-year increase since 1991 , when the country was deep in economic turmoil .
yet experts warn the worst is still to come as this week ’ s hike in fuel prices takes its toll .
the government statistics office said the consumer price index -lrb- cpi -rrb- for july alone had risen 1.13 % on june 's figure , slightly lower than in previous months .
however , prices are on the rise and august ’ s figures are expected to be much higher due to the impact of fuel prices .
last monday , hanoi unexpectedly raised the petrol price by more than 30 % , citing high costs in the world market .
the decision was met by widespread public discontent .
among the hardest hit are the poor and company workers , who have seen their wages melting fast in the heat of inflation .
but economists warn higher fuel costs will increase pressure on other commodities and services , thus making inflation rocket .
some estimate that the cpi increase for the whole year may exceed 30 % .
they also warn public grievances may lead to social unrest , something the hanoi government is extremely worried about .
prime minister nguyen tan dung has ordered state companies to tighten their belts and cut back on their expenses as well as " unnecessary new investments " .
he also promised a stricter monetary policy , making price control the " utmost priority " of his cabinet .
mr dung hopes to cut the inflation rate to a single digit in a year ’ s time .
but in order to achieve that target , the vietnamese government may have to sacrifice high economic growth rates .

there has been a lot of talk about whether the late heath ledger 's turn as the joker in the dark knight deserves an oscar .
ledger 's exuberant performance is of the kind loved by the academy well , there is an outstanding performance in the film , but it actually comes not from ledger , but from christian bale .
that is not to say ledger is not impressive .
he is .
but his is a one-note performance - a pretty good note , it must be said - but one note nonetheless .
bale 's bruce wayne / batman has layers of subtlety to it , and his portrayal of the superhero is so grounded in reality that you almost take it for granted , especially if you are being distracted by the sinister pyrotechnics of his nemesis .
that said , ledger will still probably win , and bale will not even be nominated .
ledger 's joker is one of those performances that the academy loves to reward , and the public loves to applaud , because it screams " look at me i 'm acting " .
it is a similar situation to the film rain man .
there , everyone heaped praise on dustin hoffman 's raymond , while ignoring the much more subtle portrayal of his brother by tom cruise - the performance that grounds the film and makes it work .
the dark knight picks up soon after the events of batman begins , developing many of the themes of the first film .
there is a power struggle between the organised crime bosses of the city and the joker .
the subtlety of christian bale is bound to be overlooked and you know there is only ever going to be one winner .
at the same time , a new district attorney is taking on gotham 's criminal elements , allowing bruce wayne to hope for a time when the city will no longer need batman .
director chris nolan 's vision of a city in turmoil is suitably bleak , and takes the time to explore the moral ambiguities of the main characters against a background of superb action set pieces .
unusually for a sequel , it does not just repeat the first movie with a different villain .
and that is something to be applauded .
occasionally the gadgetry and special effects go slightly too far .
but that is a small price to pay for what is deservedly one of the best films of the summer .
and if you do see it , just take a second to look past ledger 's joker at bale 's bruce wayne / batman , and appreciate what will almost certainly turn out to be the most overlooked performance of the year .
the dark knight opens across the uk on 25 july .

there has been a lot of talk about whether the late heath ledger 's turn as the joker in the dark knight deserves an oscar .
well , there is an outstanding performance in the film , but it actually comes not from ledger , but from christian bale .
that is not to say ledger is not impressive .
he is .
but his is a one-note performance - a pretty good note , it must be said - but one note nonetheless .
bale 's bruce wayne / batman has layers of subtlety to it , and his portrayal of the superhero is so grounded in reality that you almost take it for granted , especially if you are being distracted by the sinister pyrotechnics of his nemesis .
that said , ledger will still probably win , and bale will not even be nominated .

judge rob murfitt said that the name embarrassed the nine-year-old and could expose her to teasing .
he attacked a trend of giving children bizarre names , citing several examples .
officials had blocked sex fruit , keenan got lucy and yeah detroit , he said , but number 16 bus shelter , violence and midnight chardonnay had been allowed .
one mother wanted to name her child o.crnia using text language , but was later persuaded to use oceania , he said .
' social handicap ' the ruling , in the city of new plymouth on the north island , was handed down in february but only made public now .
unusual names allowed : violence ; number 16 bus shelter ; midnight chardonnay ; benson and hedges -lrb- twins -rrb- blocked : yeah detroit ; stallion ; twisty poi ; keenan got lucy ; sex fruit ; fat boy ; cinderella beauty blossom ; fish and chips -lrb- twins -rrb- the name issue emerged during a custody hearing for the young girl - who had refused to tell her friends her name and went simply by " k " .
" the court is profoundly concerned about the very poor judgment which this child 's parents have shown in choosing this name , " judge murfitt wrote .
" it makes a fool of the child and sets her up with a social disability and handicap , unnecessarily . "
talula does the hula from hawaii 's name has now been changed and the custody case resolved , court officials said .
new zealand does not allow names that would cause offence or that are longer than 100 characters , registrar-general brian clarke said .
officials often tried to talk parents out of particularly unusual choices that could embarrass their offspring , the associated press news agency quoted him as saying .
you 've been telling us about your unusual names .
below are a selection of your comments : my unusual name has n't affected me at all ; in fact , it has helped me make friends and improve my confidence , especially since leaving school .
russell sprout , london , uk i often get jokes about my names as i am named after the western isle that my family originally come from .
although i am proud of the name , shortening to eris , as i normally do gets some strange looks .
eriskay toreen , england what kind of parents would name their child after a bus shelter ?
i could only understand it if they had been trying for a baby for years without success and then , out of the blue , octuplets came along .
and as for the twins called benson & hedges , does that mean they not allowed in any enclosed public space ?
jonathan , leicester my name is chris morley .
it 's just about the most common name in britain and i 've got no problem with it whatsoever .
in fact i like it .
who do these people think they are , afflicting other human beings with ridiculous names that are almost certainly going to open them up to ridicule and , at worst , bullying ?
true parents , loving parents , try to give their offspring the best start in life .
instead these selfish idiots - who either find such names funny or who are so desperate to gain attention that they are willing to use their children as a tool - are socially handicapping their children from the very moment of birth .
talula does the hula from hawaii is utterly ridiculous and insulting , and i am both happy with , and unsurprised by , the judges decision .
i hope her ' parents ' are ashamed .
chris morley , oxford , uk i hated my parents for what they named me up until i was a teenager , but then i just became comfortable with it .
i suppose it was just bad for me as my sister was called judy .
ftango molasses , london england funny the number of people who when hearing my name for the first time still think they 're the first to come up with the ' how 's liz 'gag !
been happening for best part of 50 years now ! !
richard burton , london shanmuga velu palani velu , my father name is chinnaswamy palani velu .
my father kept my name as shanmuga velu .
now because of that my full name is shanmuga velu palani velu .
many of my friends known me as velu , becasue of the lengthy unusual name .
shanmuga i have been teased mercilessly from childhood to my adult years ... you wo n't believe the amount of times people have burst out laughing right in my face when they ask my name ..
craig gogay , london , uk my name is relatively unusual but it has not caused me any problems in life - apart from the frustration caused by the constant mis-spelling of laslo .
i have been called " lasio " , " lazlo " and one time " lazio " .
laslo panaflex , belgium i have had my future kids names picked out for the last 5 years : spoon marie , toaster thadious , and grayson basin mason ... maybe i should have 4 now that tullulah does the hula from hawaii has become free !
cassie , cardiff we have three children two girls named storm and skye and a boy named blade ... if we have another boy , his name will be raven , river or rayne .
tj , hampshire , uk i have recently changed my name from bruce , james , spencer robinson to jackson , james robinson .
i got bullied at school for being called bruce , at the time mr forsyth was on the tv a lot and kids do n't need much to tease and bully .
my family and work friends have adjusted quickly to the change .
jackson robinson , exeter uk my full name is : elisabeth , anne , helene , catherine , genevieve , cecile , marguerite , marie szentkereszty de zagon -lrb- baroness -rrb- .
my passport and id only have my initials on them .
my driver 's licence -lrb- american -rrb- did not have room enough for the entire last name .
my names are common -lrb- except last name and means holy cross of zagon - which is in transylvania -rrb- i do love my name , but usually only use elisabeth de zagon ...
elisabeth , brussels , belgium my grandmother was perhaps a bit ahead of her time in 1927 in naming her first child , my father , after a popular recording star of the time .
she was a fan of ivor norvello , but obviously did n't link the first name ivor , with her surname payne before the birth was registered .
my father was therefore christened ivor payne .
he said that he really was the forerunner of the unfortunately named hero of the jonny cash song , a boy named sue , in that there were n't too many days at school when he was n't involved in a fight because someone had teased him about his name .
sadly he died in 1999 , and one of the questions i never asked him was whether he felt having that particular name had affected his life .
ivor payne 1927 1999 r.i.p. martin payne , norwich , norfolk i changed my name by deed poll to jenna dana bananarama rater .
i 'm now the jenna rater !
jenna dana bananarama rater , cardiff , wales i fell into this trap completely by accident with my son connor .
it was only when his first piece of post arrived that we realised he was c. shaw .
phil shaw , portsmouth although my name is becoming more common when i was young i was often teased because of my unusual name that was when people actually got it right .
the usual comment was " where 's hardy then ? " but i think the best one was when i was seven my teacher had had enough of having to correct herself when she called me laura , lauren , laurence and so decided that she was going to call me daisy as it was simpler !
thankfully now i love my name as it is uncommon but i really think parents should think about how their children will be treated rather than jumping onboard the weird name band wagon laurel , swansea my name has been a source of angst my entire life .
to this day i have to repeat ad nauseum ; often times spelling my name , in a futile effort to have it pronounced correctly .
sadly my middle name is no better and i was left with no choices in school .
i was bullied , ridiculed and mocked and to this day supposedly mature adults still have a snicker at my expense .
i approve whole heartedly of the new zealand law that offers some recourse to children so benighted .
naming your child is not an exercise in creative writing or an avenue for personal expression ; if you want that take a class or write a book .
the psychological effects of an odd name are painful , deep and lasting .
kurleigh martin , san fernando , trinidad and tobago my sister -lrb- che -rrb- and i both have unusual names and we love them !
it 's nice to be unique in your school / college or place of work .
it can also be an ice-breaker when meeting new people .
lots of people comment favourably about my name and i 've never been bullied as a consequence of it .
chula bishop , newbury england its easy to see the embarrassment at an early age but as soon as she is old enough she will recall the tale fondly with people saying ' did your parents really call you that ? ' .
i 'd look back and wish i kept it , but then i like my credit cards reading ' mr d vine ' .
darren vine , warwick being called slick has its advantages and disadvantages but i get along just fine , in fact i 've learned to love my name .
slick bryn davies , manchester no-one ever considered that the child might like the quirkiness of their name .
nothing has ever held back my development or progress in the world .
i 'm now working in the catering trade and everyone calls me eggy .
i do n't see the problem !
egnorwiddle waldstrom , london , uk my name is varithamby jeyahprakash tharamakulaseelarajan my brother 's name is sathiyasothilegaeswaran thramakulaseelerajan , we still struggle to fill-in legal forms because they never have enough space .
parents do not think long term when naming their children specially in south asia .
i think they should be given lessons in naming their offsprings .

elisabeth , brussels , belgium my grandmother was perhaps a bit ahead of her time in 1927 in naming her first child , my father , after a popular recording star of the time .
she was a fan of ivor norvello , but obviously did n't link the first name ivor , with her surname payne before the birth was registered .
my father was therefore christened ivor payne .
he said that he really was the forerunner of the unfortunately named hero of the jonny cash song , a boy named sue , in that there were n't too many days at school when he was n't involved in a fight because someone had teased him about his name .
sadly he died in 1999 , and one of the questions i never asked him was whether he felt having that particular name had affected his life .

sadly my middle name is no better and i was left with no choices in school .
i was bullied , ridiculed and mocked and to this day supposedly mature adults still have a snicker at my expense .
i approve whole heartedly of the new zealand law that offers some recourse to children so benighted .
naming your child is not an exercise in creative writing or an avenue for personal expression ; if you want that take a class or write a book .
the psychological effects of an odd name are painful , deep and lasting .

judge rob murfitt said that the name embarrassed the nine-year-old and could expose her to teasing .
he attacked a trend of giving children bizarre names , citing several examples .
officials had blocked sex fruit , keenan got lucy and yeah detroit , he said , but number 16 bus shelter , violence and midnight chardonnay had been allowed .
one mother wanted to name her child o.crnia using text language , but was later persuaded to use oceania , he said .

unusual names allowed : violence ; number 16 bus shelter ; midnight chardonnay ; benson and hedges -lrb- twins -rrb- blocked : yeah detroit ; stallion ; twisty poi ; keenan got lucy ; sex fruit ; fat boy ; cinderella beauty blossom ; fish and chips -lrb- twins -rrb- the name issue emerged during a custody hearing for the young girl - who had refused to tell her friends her name and went simply by " k " .
" the court is profoundly concerned about the very poor judgment which this child 's parents have shown in choosing this name , " judge murfitt wrote .
" it makes a fool of the child and sets her up with a social disability and handicap , unnecessarily . "
talula does the hula from hawaii 's name has now been changed and the custody case resolved , court officials said .
new zealand does not allow names that would cause offence or that are longer than 100 characters , registrar-general brian clarke said .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- q & a : music and file-sharing bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 08:54 gmt , thursday , 24 july 2008 09:54 uk q & a : music and file-sharing hundreds of thousands of uk net users could soon find a letter on their mat from their net supplier saying their account is being used to illegally share files .
the letters are one of the most tangible elements of an anti-piracy plan brokered by the government .
here we explain some of the background to the agreement .
what is file-sharing ?
as its name implies it involves using the net to distribute or get hold of data files .
the most popular files being shared online are mp3 music tracks because their small size means they can be uploaded and downloaded quickly .
as broadband speeds have increased the size of files available on file-sharing networks has grown .
tv shows and movies are becoming increasingly popular .
most file-sharing networks are organised on a peer-to-peer basis .
this means that they do not have a central store of files .
instead , the files remain on the computers of a network 's members .
anyone downloading a particular file gets it in chunks from all the machines on the network possessing a copy of that music track , video , game or tv show .
once a person has a copy of a file it usually remains available for others in the network .
the more people with a copy of a file the faster it can be spread to others .
there are many file-sharing networks and users typically get hold of a client , which acts like a web browser , that lets them use that network .
who is file-sharing ?
lots of people .
and many are file-sharing perfectly legally .
many broadcasters and content firms are using file-sharing networks to overcome the inherent problems of using the net to distribute large files such as tv shows and films .
many online game firms use file-sharing systems to distribute updates to players .
however , many people have turned to file-sharing networks to get hold of pirated content - be it music tracks , videos or games .
typically teenagers are the biggest users of file-sharing networks that hold lots of pirated pop music .
why does the music industry want to stop it ?
because they believe that the growth of file-sharing has cut their profits and is ruining their industry .
the music industry , as well as other content makers , argue that anyone who gets hold of a pirated copy of music track , video or game is unlikely to go out and buy a legitimate retail copy .
critics say the music industry is paying the price for being late to see the impact the net would have on the buying and selling of music .
lacking legitimate places to turn to find music , online fans migrated to file-sharing networks to get hold of pirated tracks .
what does this agreement mean for consumers ?
for hundreds of thousands of uk net users it will mean that they get a letter from their isp telling them that their account has been identified as one used to illegally share files .
at the moment that is all it will mean .
so far no uk net firm has pledged to back the bpi 's call to cut the net connections of persistent pirates .
how is the music industry targeting file-sharers ?
the british phonographic industry is monitoring the most popular file-sharing tools and is looking for people who are uploading -lrb- i.e. actively sharing -rrb- music tracks .
the ip address , or unique online identifier , of the computer that is being used to share tracks can be seen on many of these tools .
ip addresses are distributed by your isp and so the bpi contacts the isp which allocated that address , who in turn matches it to the computer , and the account holder .
have other countries tried this ?
there have been a lot of different attempts to curb piracy .
currently france is on the verge of adopting a " three strikes " law that will see the net connections of persistent pirates unplugged .
in the us the riaa , which represents record labels , has favoured lawsuits against pirates and has taken tens of thousands of people to court seeking damages .
in germany the courts are currently debating the legality of using data culled from file-sharing networks to identify and chastise suspected pirates .
many other nations impose a levy on recordable media on which copies of copyrighted content could be stored .

the letters are one of the most tangible elements of an anti-piracy plan brokered by the government .
here we explain some of the background to the agreement .
what is file-sharing ?
as its name implies it involves using the net to distribute or get hold of data files .
the most popular files being shared online are mp3 music tracks because their small size means they can be uploaded and downloaded quickly .
as broadband speeds have increased the size of files available on file-sharing networks has grown .
tv shows and movies are becoming increasingly popular .
most file-sharing networks are organised on a peer-to-peer basis .
this means that they do not have a central store of files .
instead , the files remain on the computers of a network 's members .
anyone downloading a particular file gets it in chunks from all the machines on the network possessing a copy of that music track , video , game or tv show .
once a person has a copy of a file it usually remains available for others in the network .
the more people with a copy of a file the faster it can be spread to others .
there are many file-sharing networks and users typically get hold of a client , which acts like a web browser , that lets them use that network .
who is file-sharing ?
lots of people .
and many are file-sharing perfectly legally .
many broadcasters and content firms are using file-sharing networks to overcome the inherent problems of using the net to distribute large files such as tv shows and films .
many online game firms use file-sharing systems to distribute updates to players .
however , many people have turned to file-sharing networks to get hold of pirated content - be it music tracks , videos or games .
typically teenagers are the biggest users of file-sharing networks that hold lots of pirated pop music .

the letters are one of the most tangible elements of an anti-piracy plan brokered by the government .
here we explain some of the background to the agreement .
what is file-sharing ?
as its name implies it involves using the net to distribute or get hold of data files .
the most popular files being shared online are mp3 music tracks because their small size means they can be uploaded and downloaded quickly .
as broadband speeds have increased the size of files available on file-sharing networks has grown .
tv shows and movies are becoming increasingly popular .
most file-sharing networks are organised on a peer-to-peer basis .
this means that they do not have a central store of files .
instead , the files remain on the computers of a network 's members .
anyone downloading a particular file gets it in chunks from all the machines on the network possessing a copy of that music track , video , game or tv show .
once a person has a copy of a file it usually remains available for others in the network .
the more people with a copy of a file the faster it can be spread to others .
there are many file-sharing networks and users typically get hold of a client , which acts like a web browser , that lets them use that network .
who is file-sharing ?
lots of people .
and many are file-sharing perfectly legally .
many broadcasters and content firms are using file-sharing networks to overcome the inherent problems of using the net to distribute large files such as tv shows and films .
many online game firms use file-sharing systems to distribute updates to players .
however , many people have turned to file-sharing networks to get hold of pirated content - be it music tracks , videos or games .
typically teenagers are the biggest users of file-sharing networks that hold lots of pirated pop music .
why does the music industry want to stop it ?
because they believe that the growth of file-sharing has cut their profits and is ruining their industry .
the music industry , as well as other content makers , argue that anyone who gets hold of a pirated copy of music track , video or game is unlikely to go out and buy a legitimate retail copy .
critics say the music industry is paying the price for being late to see the impact the net would have on the buying and selling of music .
lacking legitimate places to turn to find music , online fans migrated to file-sharing networks to get hold of pirated tracks .
what does this agreement mean for consumers ?
for hundreds of thousands of uk net users it will mean that they get a letter from their isp telling them that their account has been identified as one used to illegally share files .
at the moment that is all it will mean .
so far no uk net firm has pledged to back the bpi 's call to cut the net connections of persistent pirates .
how is the music industry targeting file-sharers ?
the british phonographic industry is monitoring the most popular file-sharing tools and is looking for people who are uploading -lrb- i.e. actively sharing -rrb- music tracks .
the ip address , or unique online identifier , of the computer that is being used to share tracks can be seen on many of these tools .
ip addresses are distributed by your isp and so the bpi contacts the isp which allocated that address , who in turn matches it to the computer , and the account holder .
have other countries tried this ?
there have been a lot of different attempts to curb piracy .
currently france is on the verge of adopting a " three strikes " law that will see the net connections of persistent pirates unplugged .
in the us the riaa , which represents record labels , has favoured lawsuits against pirates and has taken tens of thousands of people to court seeking damages .
in germany the courts are currently debating the legality of using data culled from file-sharing networks to identify and chastise suspected pirates .
many other nations impose a levy on recordable media on which copies of copyrighted content could be stored .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- q & a : music and file-sharing british broadcasting corporation home accessibility links mobile version skip to content skip to local navigation skip to bbc.co.uk navigation skip to bbc.co.uk search help accessibility help bbc news updated every minute of every day one-minute world news news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog bbc world service page last updated at 08:54 gmt , thursday , 24 july 2008 09:54 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version q & a : music and file-sharing hundreds of thousands of uk net users could soon find a letter on their mat from their net supplier saying their account is being used to illegally share files .
the letters are one of the most tangible elements of an anti-piracy plan brokered by the government .
here we explain some of the background to the agreement .
what is file-sharing ?
as its name implies it involves using the net to distribute or get hold of data files .
the most popular files being shared online are mp3 music tracks because their small size means they can be uploaded and downloaded quickly .
as broadband speeds have increased the size of files available on file-sharing networks has grown .
tv shows and movies are becoming increasingly popular .
most file-sharing networks are organised on a peer-to-peer basis .
this means that they do not have a central store of files .
instead , the files remain on the computers of a network 's members .
anyone downloading a particular file gets it in chunks from all the machines on the network possessing a copy of that music track , video , game or tv show .
once a person has a copy of a file it usually remains available for others in the network .
the more people with a copy of a file the faster it can be spread to others .
there are many file-sharing networks and users typically get hold of a client , which acts like a web browser , that lets them use that network .
who is file-sharing ?
lots of people .
and many are file-sharing perfectly legally .
many broadcasters and content firms are using file-sharing networks to overcome the inherent problems of using the net to distribute large files such as tv shows and films .
many online game firms use file-sharing systems to distribute updates to players .
however , many people have turned to file-sharing networks to get hold of pirated content - be it music tracks , videos or games .
typically teenagers are the biggest users of file-sharing networks that hold lots of pirated pop music .
why does the music industry want to stop it ?
because they believe that the growth of file-sharing has cut their profits and is ruining their industry .
the music industry , as well as other content makers , argue that anyone who gets hold of a pirated copy of music track , video or game is unlikely to go out and buy a legitimate retail copy .
critics say the music industry is paying the price for being late to see the impact the net would have on the buying and selling of music .
lacking legitimate places to turn to find music , online fans migrated to file-sharing networks to get hold of pirated tracks .
what does this agreement mean for consumers ?
for hundreds of thousands of uk net users it will mean that they get a letter from their isp telling them that their account has been identified as one used to illegally share files .
at the moment that is all it will mean .
so far no uk net firm has pledged to back the bpi 's call to cut the net connections of persistent pirates .
how is the music industry targeting file-sharers ?
the british phonographic industry is monitoring the most popular file-sharing tools and is looking for people who are uploading -lrb- i.e. actively sharing -rrb- music tracks .
the ip address , or unique online identifier , of the computer that is being used to share tracks can be seen on many of these tools .
ip addresses are distributed by your isp and so the bpi contacts the isp which allocated that address , who in turn matches it to the computer , and the account holder .
have other countries tried this ?
there have been a lot of different attempts to curb piracy .
currently france is on the verge of adopting a " three strikes " law that will see the net connections of persistent pirates unplugged .
in the us the riaa , which represents record labels , has favoured lawsuits against pirates and has taken tens of thousands of people to court seeking damages .

new york court papers say the advert features the star , real name curtis jackson , being encouraged to change his name to 79 cent , 89 cent or 99 cent .
the rapper is accusing the chain of " diluting the value of his good name " .
the advertisement is part of taco bell 's " why pay more ? " campaign , which promotes items for under a dollar .
50 cent also accuses taco bell of employing a guerrilla advertising campaign to fool consumers into thinking he had endorsed the chain .
the lawsuit says the mexican-themed chain sent a letter to media organisations encouraging the rapper to change his name for one day to promote its advertising campaign .
the letter said that , if the star agreed , taco bell would donate $ 10,000 -lrb- £ 5,000 -rrb- to the charity of his choice .
' good faith ' 50 cent 's lawyer , peter d raymond , said his client did not learn about the letter or that he was featured in the campaign until he saw a news report about it .
" without seeking or obtaining jackson 's authorisation , defendant taco bell made him the star and focus of its nationwide advertising campaign by using his name , persona and trademark to promote taco bell 's business and products , " court papers said .
mr raymond said his client was seeking $ 4m -lrb- £ 2m -rrb- in damages .
" we made a good faith , charitable offer to 50 cent to change his name to either 79 , 89 or 99 cent for one day by rapping his order at a taco bell , " taco bell spokesman rob poetsch said in a statement .
" we would have been very pleased to make the $ 10,000 donation to the charity of his choice . "
