the financial crisis is no longer just on the horizon , it 's being felt full-on in europe .
i 'm afraid that this will absorb a great deal of our presidency and that will be something we 'll really have to deal with .
there are also numerous foreign policy problems that threaten us on the horizon . to put it simply , you can set yourself a lot of goals at the start of a presidency , but life can take you in a different direction .
i do n't think the french presidency would have predicted that their main tasks would involve handling the conflict in the caucasus and the beginning of the economic crisis . i 'd like to come back to these topics individually .
but i 'm also interested in the future of the lisbon reform treaty .
the czech republic is one of two countries that has not approved it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzenberg said the financial crisis will remain a major focus god knows that 's true .
that 's been delayed now , firstly because of the proceedings at the constitutional court , and arguments in parliament .
but i 'm assuming it will happen within the next six weeks . the czech president vaclav klaus is a decided opponent to the reform treaty , and he 's also said the eu presidency is a totally unimportant thing. hhow do you live , how do you work with a president that is so disrespectful toward the european union ? well look , i do n't live with him .
the president knows that i have different opinions to him , and i know that about him .
we 've had almost two years now to get used to this situation .
foreign policy is dictated by the government , not by the president .
you ca n't choose the kind of relationship you have with a head of state , it 's there and you have to live with it . in france , there 's been public speculation about whether the czech republic is even in a position to lead the european union in this very critical time .
did it hurt you to hear what was coming from the french president 's circle ? no , not in the least .
i 'm not that easily hurt .
i 've been through a lot in my life , i 've seen a lot .
we 'll see if such statements are still being made by the end of our presidency .
i 'm well aware that many smaller countries have had to deal with similar sentiments at the start of their presidencies .
i think it 's just part of the political banter that comes with a presidency and i do n't take it that seriously . you yourself once referred to french president nicolas sarkozy with much admiration as the " spirit of restlessness in politics . "
how satisfied are you with the restlessness that france has brought to the eu in its six-month presidency ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy gets kudos for his handling of the financial crisis i think , all in all , we should be very grateful to the french president .
there were single steps , isolated remarks that i was n't particularly thrilled about .
but i think we have to say that the sarkozy 's energetic handling of the crisis in the caucasus is something europe can be very thankful for , as were his efforts to do something about the economic crisis .
we 'll have to see if the measures he took were the right ones .
that 's beyond my economic expertise , but in any case , it was a presidency that took action . the global economic crisis was n't foreseeable when france took over .
you 're inheriting this problem now .
what are your expectations ?
how bad do you think this crisis will get ? i think it 's something we have to take very , very seriously .
that does n't mean - and i would like to emphasize this - that we should start to panic .
given the situation , that would be the worst thing we could do .
the tried and trusted rules of economics should n't be thrown overboard in a moment of panic . but we should be aware that emergency measures are sometimes needed .
and if i were to break my leg today , i would have to accept that i would have to wear a cast for a while .
but we all know that if you wear a cast for too long , the muscles start to weaken to the point that it could cause lasting damage .
so , like i said , all these emergency measures and regulations should be used very carefully .
they should not be used permanently , and only goal-oriented measures should be used to combat the crisis . an important matter for the eu is always its relations with its eastern neighbors .
should countries such as moldova or ukraine be introduced as members of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty remains a sticking point this will take very , very long , i fear , very long .
but i believe it is in our greatest interests that this prospect stays alive .
it is an engine for reform , real motivation .
whether it concerns the western european states or also these states , this prospect is the strongest motivation to push the necessary reforms . and these reforms are in our greatest interests .
in discussions we forget over and over again that reaching out to these countries is not a charitable activity , exclusively to the advantage of these states , but that we would be pre-empting difficulties we will inevitably have . what role should russia play in this concept ?
is it only a strategic energy supplier or is moscow also a part of this idea of political partnership ? russia is and will remain a world in itself , with which we should search for a healthy , fair relationship .
what does not simplify things is that certain developments in russia , even a return to an authoritarian system , worry us .
we are anxious about certain revisionist statements which are somewhat unsettling . but this changes nothing about the fact that not only as an energy supplier , but also as a security discussion partner in countless elements of policy and international politics , russia is a much-needed partner with whom we should have dialog and lead .

16 , that the government 's stimulus package " might not suffice . " but merkel hinted that she wants to coordinate future efforts with the incoming barack obama administration .
if the financial crisis is such that the us will consider further measures after obama takes office on jan .
20 , " it will also be right to put together a second program in germany at a similar time , " she added .
merkel remains under pressure from other european countries to move quickly with cut taxes or vouchers to encourage spending .
merkel continues to oppose such plans , even though they are being undertaken elsewhere in europe .
paving the road to recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some want merkel to put more money in consumers ' hands instead , merkel favors tackling a backlog of road projects to stimulating the economy , she said in a speech tuesday to the center for european economic research , a think tank in mannheim , germany .
she called on germany 's states to send in their project lists as soon as possible , wanting to get going by the early spring .
most of the states have a backlog of detailed engineering proposals for projects that have been waiting for federal funding .
quoting government sources , press reports have said berlin is preparing to invest 20 billion to 30 billion euros in a fresh economic stimulus plan that will include public investment and consumer incentives , according to afp news agency .
" we will take action again in january - another few billion could come together , " merkel was quoted as saying by the dow jones newswires .
merkel said the fresh investment could go toward infrastructure improvements including roads , broadband communications networks and renovation of schools , as well as subsidies for temporary jobs .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists are predicting that 2009 will be a rough year for germany a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said on tuesday that the government fears the german economy could contract by 3.0 percent or more next year , marking the worst recession in german post-war history .
the bdb commercial banks ' association backed up this assessment , predicting that germany will suffer its deepest recession since world war two next year .
as long as the bad news about germany 's economy continues , it 's unlikely that european allies such as france will let up pressure on merkel to do more and do it quickly .
yet with national elections scheduled for next fall , merkel is taking a cautious approach .
that has lead to criticism from those in her party who want to see the government do more .
economy minister michael glos emphasized that the government still has the scope to increase its economic stimulus package if necessary .
glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has repeatedly argued in favor of cutting taxes .
a poll done for germany 's stern magazine and rtl television showed that support for merkel and her party continues to drop due to concerns over the financial crisis . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

foreign policy is dictated by the government , not by the president .
you ca n't choose the kind of relationship you have with a head of state , it 's there and you have to live with it . in france , there 's been public speculation about whether the czech republic is even in a position to lead the european union in this very critical time .
did it hurt you to hear what was coming from the french president 's circle ? no , not in the least .
i 'm not that easily hurt .
i 've been through a lot in my life , i 've seen a lot .
we 'll see if such statements are still being made by the end of our presidency .
i 'm well aware that many smaller countries have had to deal with similar sentiments at the start of their presidencies .
i think it 's just part of the political banter that comes with a presidency and i do n't take it that seriously . you yourself once referred to french president nicolas sarkozy with much admiration as the " spirit of restlessness in politics . "
how satisfied are you with the restlessness that france has brought to the eu in its six-month presidency ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy gets kudos for his handling of the financial crisis i think , all in all , we should be very grateful to the french president .
there were single steps , isolated remarks that i was n't particularly thrilled about .
but i think we have to say that the sarkozy 's energetic handling of the crisis in the caucasus is something europe can be very thankful for , as were his efforts to do something about the economic crisis .
we 'll have to see if the measures he took were the right ones .
that 's beyond my economic expertise , but in any case , it was a presidency that took action . the global economic crisis was n't foreseeable when france took over .
you 're inheriting this problem now .
what are your expectations ?
how bad do you think this crisis will get ? i think it 's something we have to take very , very seriously .
that does n't mean - and i would like to emphasize this - that we should start to panic .
given the situation , that would be the worst thing we could do .
the tried and trusted rules of economics should n't be thrown overboard in a moment of panic . but we should be aware that emergency measures are sometimes needed .
and if i were to break my leg today , i would have to accept that i would have to wear a cast for a while .
but we all know that if you wear a cast for too long , the muscles start to weaken to the point that it could cause lasting damage .
so , like i said , all these emergency measures and regulations should be used very carefully .
they should not be used permanently , and only goal-oriented measures should be used to combat the crisis . an important matter for the eu is always its relations with its eastern neighbors .
should countries such as moldova or ukraine be introduced as members of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty remains a sticking point this will take very , very long , i fear , very long .
but i believe it is in our greatest interests that this prospect stays alive .
it is an engine for reform , real motivation .
whether it concerns the western european states or also these states , this prospect is the strongest motivation to push the necessary reforms . and these reforms are in our greatest interests .
in discussions we forget over and over again that reaching out to these countries is not a charitable activity , exclusively to the advantage of these states , but that we would be pre-empting difficulties we will inevitably have . what role should russia play in this concept ?

what does not simplify things is that certain developments in russia , even a return to an authoritarian system , worry us .
we are anxious about certain revisionist statements which are somewhat unsettling . but this changes nothing about the fact that not only as an energy supplier , but also as a security discussion partner in countless elements of policy and international politics , russia is a much-needed partner with whom we should have dialog and lead .

1 from current holder france .
czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg spoke with dw about his country 's intentions for its eu presidency . deutsche welle : in a few weeks , the czech republic will take over the eu presidency .
what are the goals you 've set for the next six months ? karel schwarzenberg : the goals that we originally set are already known : on the one hand , supporting the development of the eastern " neighborhood ; " secondly , driving forward the integration process in the western balkans ; and thirdly , a europe without barriers .
a liberal europe , a europe that does n't close itself off , but meets all challenges . now , it could be as with several other presidencies , that our presidency will be dependent on other things .
the financial crisis is no longer just on the horizon , it 's being felt full-on in europe .
i 'm afraid that this will absorb a great deal of our presidency and that will be something we 'll really have to deal with .
there are also numerous foreign policy problems that threaten us on the horizon . to put it simply , you can set yourself a lot of goals at the start of a presidency , but life can take you in a different direction .
i do n't think the french presidency would have predicted that their main tasks would involve handling the conflict in the caucasus and the beginning of the economic crisis . i 'd like to come back to these topics individually .

the czech republic is one of two countries that has not approved it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzenberg said the financial crisis will remain a major focus god knows that 's true .
that 's been delayed now , firstly because of the proceedings at the constitutional court , and arguments in parliament .
but i 'm assuming it will happen within the next six weeks . the czech president vaclav klaus is a decided opponent to the reform treaty , and he 's also said the eu presidency is a totally unimportant thing. hhow do you live , how do you work with a president that is so disrespectful toward the european union ? well look , i do n't live with him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 16.12.2008 opinion : siemens got off lightly , but there 's more to come großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the biggest bribery scandal in german business history , siemens had to pay fines amounting to nearly a billion euros .
ultimately , though , it got off easy , says dw 's karl zawadzky . considering the extent of the corruption affair , siemens is getting off relatively unscathed .
after all , bribery appears to have been an everyday occurrence for the international group when it came to getting contracts .
and nothing changed when laws were passed in germany - as in other industrial nations - that clearly forbid bribery , and the company 's shares began trading on the new york stock exchange .
in an unrivalled review , a legion of lawyers and accountants examined each and every siemens document .
for the time period between 1999 and 2006 , bribes on the order of 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- were uncovered .
it turns out that siemens workers and representatives around the globe had felt free to use money from secret accounts if it seemed useful for garnering contracts .
given the dimensions of the situation , siemens is getting off more lightly with its fine than most people would have expected .
especially when it comes to the settlement it agreed to with the us ministry of justice and the securities watchdog , the sec .
lesson learned , moving on siemens will pay 620 million euros to the us .
it could have been much worse .
and it would have been , if siemens had been blocked from competing for public contracts in the us for a period of many years .
the intense inspection of its books no doubt made an impression .
moreover , managers throughout the firm have been let go .
siemens learned its lesson .
it can now hope that its us unit will profit from the enormous infrastructure program planned by us president elect barack obama .
in order not to fall back into old , corrupt habits , ex-german finance minister theo waigel - today a lawyer in munich - has been named " compliance monitor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky in the us , such monitoring is a common component of a criminal proceedings settlements .
in germany , the munich prosecutor 's office imposed a fine of 395 million euros , which siemens accepted .
that - along with the payment to the us and setting up the monitoring system that theo waigel will oversee - is the end of the state 's lawsuit against siemens over the bribery of public officials .
siemens can survive the financial hit .
even without corruption , the company 's business is strong - and in its year-end accounts , siemens thought to lay aside a billion euros to pay off fines .
but that 's not the end of the story .
the state prosecutor 's office still has open legal proceedings against specific former company directors , including longtime ceo and supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , on grounds they breached oversight rules .
siemens is suing former executives on top of that , siemens itself is suing former executives for millions in compensatory damages , on the grounds that the board of directors failed to institute internal controls that would prevent a regular culture of bribery - either that , or they intentionally looked the other way .
and there 's another reason the affair is not yet over : clients around the globe are preparing suits for damages because they think the bribery costs increased the prices they paid for goods or services .
moreover , countries want to know which of their officials took bribes from siemens .
even though the big lawsuits in germany and the us ended with settlements and fines , siemens will be processing one of the darkest chapters in its more-than-100-year-old corporate history for years to come .
on top of this , the damage to company 's reputation has been great , and no amount of money can ever fix it the case of siemens turns out to be a perfect example of the adage : corruption does n't pay .

ultimately , though , it got off easy , says dw 's karl zawadzky . considering the extent of the corruption affair , siemens is getting off relatively unscathed .
after all , bribery appears to have been an everyday occurrence for the international group when it came to getting contracts .
and nothing changed when laws were passed in germany - as in other industrial nations - that clearly forbid bribery , and the company 's shares began trading on the new york stock exchange .
in an unrivalled review , a legion of lawyers and accountants examined each and every siemens document .
for the time period between 1999 and 2006 , bribes on the order of 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- were uncovered .
it turns out that siemens workers and representatives around the globe had felt free to use money from secret accounts if it seemed useful for garnering contracts .
given the dimensions of the situation , siemens is getting off more lightly with its fine than most people would have expected .
especially when it comes to the settlement it agreed to with the us ministry of justice and the securities watchdog , the sec .
lesson learned , moving on siemens will pay 620 million euros to the us .
it could have been much worse .
and it would have been , if siemens had been blocked from competing for public contracts in the us for a period of many years .
the intense inspection of its books no doubt made an impression .
moreover , managers throughout the firm have been let go .
siemens learned its lesson .
it can now hope that its us unit will profit from the enormous infrastructure program planned by us president elect barack obama .
in order not to fall back into old , corrupt habits , ex-german finance minister theo waigel - today a lawyer in munich - has been named " compliance monitor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky in the us , such monitoring is a common component of a criminal proceedings settlements .
in germany , the munich prosecutor 's office imposed a fine of 395 million euros , which siemens accepted .
that - along with the payment to the us and setting up the monitoring system that theo waigel will oversee - is the end of the state 's lawsuit against siemens over the bribery of public officials .
siemens can survive the financial hit .
even without corruption , the company 's business is strong - and in its year-end accounts , siemens thought to lay aside a billion euros to pay off fines .
but that 's not the end of the story .
the state prosecutor 's office still has open legal proceedings against specific former company directors , including longtime ceo and supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , on grounds they breached oversight rules .
siemens is suing former executives on top of that , siemens itself is suing former executives for millions in compensatory damages , on the grounds that the board of directors failed to institute internal controls that would prevent a regular culture of bribery - either that , or they intentionally looked the other way .
and there 's another reason the affair is not yet over : clients around the globe are preparing suits for damages because they think the bribery costs increased the prices they paid for goods or services .
moreover , countries want to know which of their officials took bribes from siemens .
even though the big lawsuits in germany and the us ended with settlements and fines , siemens will be processing one of the darkest chapters in its more-than-100-year-old corporate history for years to come .
on top of this , the damage to company 's reputation has been great , and no amount of money can ever fix it the case of siemens turns out to be a perfect example of the adage : corruption does n't pay .

ultimately , though , it got off easy , says dw 's karl zawadzky . considering the extent of the corruption affair , siemens is getting off relatively unscathed .
after all , bribery appears to have been an everyday occurrence for the international group when it came to getting contracts .
and nothing changed when laws were passed in germany - as in other industrial nations - that clearly forbid bribery , and the company 's shares began trading on the new york stock exchange .
in an unrivalled review , a legion of lawyers and accountants examined each and every siemens document .
for the time period between 1999 and 2006 , bribes on the order of 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- were uncovered .
it turns out that siemens workers and representatives around the globe had felt free to use money from secret accounts if it seemed useful for garnering contracts .
given the dimensions of the situation , siemens is getting off more lightly with its fine than most people would have expected .
especially when it comes to the settlement it agreed to with the us ministry of justice and the securities watchdog , the sec .
lesson learned , moving on siemens will pay 620 million euros to the us .
it could have been much worse .
and it would have been , if siemens had been blocked from competing for public contracts in the us for a period of many years .
the intense inspection of its books no doubt made an impression .
moreover , managers throughout the firm have been let go .
siemens learned its lesson .
it can now hope that its us unit will profit from the enormous infrastructure program planned by us president elect barack obama .
in order not to fall back into old , corrupt habits , ex-german finance minister theo waigel - today a lawyer in munich - has been named " compliance monitor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky in the us , such monitoring is a common component of a criminal proceedings settlements .
in germany , the munich prosecutor 's office imposed a fine of 395 million euros , which siemens accepted .
that - along with the payment to the us and setting up the monitoring system that theo waigel will oversee - is the end of the state 's lawsuit against siemens over the bribery of public officials .
siemens can survive the financial hit .
even without corruption , the company 's business is strong - and in its year-end accounts , siemens thought to lay aside a billion euros to pay off fines .
but that 's not the end of the story .
the state prosecutor 's office still has open legal proceedings against specific former company directors , including longtime ceo and supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , on grounds they breached oversight rules .
siemens is suing former executives on top of that , siemens itself is suing former executives for millions in compensatory damages , on the grounds that the board of directors failed to institute internal controls that would prevent a regular culture of bribery - either that , or they intentionally looked the other way .
and there 's another reason the affair is not yet over : clients around the globe are preparing suits for damages because they think the bribery costs increased the prices they paid for goods or services .
moreover , countries want to know which of their officials took bribes from siemens .
even though the big lawsuits in germany and the us ended with settlements and fines , siemens will be processing one of the darkest chapters in its more-than-100-year-old corporate history for years to come .
on top of this , the damage to company 's reputation has been great , and no amount of money can ever fix it the case of siemens turns out to be a perfect example of the adage : corruption does n't pay .

while unsold cars block germany 's biggest car terminal , france 's president promises help for his country 's auto makers . european consumers are continuing to buy fewer cars , according to the european automobile manufacturers ' association acea . " new passenger car registrations in europe fell by 25.8 percent in november compared to the same month of last year , declining for the seventh month in a row , mirroring the financial and economic crises , " the acea said in a statement on tuesday , dec .
16 . november new registrations totaled 932,537 cars , a decrease from over 1.2 million in november 2007 .
acea said there had n't been such a notable decline since 1999 . germany , europe 's largest automobile market , saw registrations down 17.7 percent to 233,722 units .
all markets across the continent decreased except finland , poland and the czech republic . " the new eu member states long showed more resilience , in relative terms , because of the greater number of first-time buyers as opposed to the replacement market of western europe , " acea said . sarkozy pledges help the french government has said it will take action to save the country 's automobile industry .
president nicolas sarkozy on monday , dec .
15 , told leaders from the french car industry that he was prepared to provide additional aid to the struggling sector in the form of government loans and guarantees , his office said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is intent on helping france 's car industry however , he made all government aid to the industry subject to agreement from france 's fellow eu members and the european commission . but sarkozy said carmakers and their suppliers would have to commit to preserving sites in france .
aid was dependent on " the renunciation of any policy of deliberately encouraging the outsourcing " of production , he said . it was " incompatible with the closing of assembly factories in france , " sarkozy said . sarkozy 's office said that senior executives from the two largest french carmakers , renault and peugeot citroen , as well as representatives of the auto-equipment suppliers michelin and valeo took part in the meeting . the worst is yet to come in an interview published monday in the french daily le figaro , renault chief executive carlos ghosn said emergency government loans were necessary for the french car industry to survive the economic crisis . " what we are demanding from the state is some reasonable financing , over two to three years , at interest rates between four and five percent , " ghosn said . two out of every three cars was purchased on credit , he said . " if the finance crisis continues , you will see one producer after the other fail , " ghosn said . both renault and peugeot citroen have shut some of their factories to cut production as demand for cars in europe has plunged . acea figures for november showed the registration of new private cars in france down by more than 14 percent .
but , according to ghosn , the worst of the crisis still lies ahead . " we have n't touched bottom yet , " ghosn said . cars backlogged in germany the dramatic situation in the automobile industry has led to an excess of unsold cars at europe 's biggest car terminal in bremerhaven .
more than 90,000 vehicles are clogging the shipping terminal in the northern german port of bremerhaven , waiting to find new owners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of cars are waiting to be picked up in bremerhaven " we ca n't move the cars , work on them or deliver them until they find buyers , " said detthold aden , head of the blg logistics group , which operates the facility . roll-on roll-off vessels are delivering new cars that nobody wants .
instead of setting a turnover record , the terminal is rapidly becoming one of the world 's largest parking lots . when cars roll off ships like the " danube highway " or " morning champion " they come to a halt after just a few meters because there is no room for them on land .
blg has been forced to find extra space in the area of the port normally reserved for shipping containers .
other cars are temporarily stored on freight trains . ships normally jam-packed with vehicles destined for the united states are now leaving almost empty because of the dramatic downturn on the us car market . the speed of the meltdown caught bremerhaven by surprise .
when automobile manufactures published details of their shrinking sales , many of the cars now languishing in the port were already on their way to germany . " it 's a difficult situation , because many imported cars and those destined for export are still on their way here , " said aden . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

blg has been forced to find extra space in the area of the port normally reserved for shipping containers .
other cars are temporarily stored on freight trains . ships normally jam-packed with vehicles destined for the united states are now leaving almost empty because of the dramatic downturn on the us car market . the speed of the meltdown caught bremerhaven by surprise .

while unsold cars block germany 's biggest car terminal , france 's president promises help for his country 's auto makers . european consumers are continuing to buy fewer cars , according to the european automobile manufacturers ' association acea . " new passenger car registrations in europe fell by 25.8 percent in november compared to the same month of last year , declining for the seventh month in a row , mirroring the financial and economic crises , " the acea said in a statement on tuesday , dec .
16 . november new registrations totaled 932,537 cars , a decrease from over 1.2 million in november 2007 .
acea said there had n't been such a notable decline since 1999 . germany , europe 's largest automobile market , saw registrations down 17.7 percent to 233,722 units .
all markets across the continent decreased except finland , poland and the czech republic . " the new eu member states long showed more resilience , in relative terms , because of the greater number of first-time buyers as opposed to the replacement market of western europe , " acea said . sarkozy pledges help the french government has said it will take action to save the country 's automobile industry .
president nicolas sarkozy on monday , dec .
15 , told leaders from the french car industry that he was prepared to provide additional aid to the struggling sector in the form of government loans and guarantees , his office said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is intent on helping france 's car industry however , he made all government aid to the industry subject to agreement from france 's fellow eu members and the european commission . but sarkozy said carmakers and their suppliers would have to commit to preserving sites in france .
aid was dependent on " the renunciation of any policy of deliberately encouraging the outsourcing " of production , he said . it was " incompatible with the closing of assembly factories in france , " sarkozy said . sarkozy 's office said that senior executives from the two largest french carmakers , renault and peugeot citroen , as well as representatives of the auto-equipment suppliers michelin and valeo took part in the meeting . the worst is yet to come in an interview published monday in the french daily le figaro , renault chief executive carlos ghosn said emergency government loans were necessary for the french car industry to survive the economic crisis . " what we are demanding from the state is some reasonable financing , over two to three years , at interest rates between four and five percent , " ghosn said . two out of every three cars was purchased on credit , he said . " if the finance crisis continues , you will see one producer after the other fail , " ghosn said . both renault and peugeot citroen have shut some of their factories to cut production as demand for cars in europe has plunged . acea figures for november showed the registration of new private cars in france down by more than 14 percent .
but , according to ghosn , the worst of the crisis still lies ahead . " we have n't touched bottom yet , " ghosn said . cars backlogged in germany the dramatic situation in the automobile industry has led to an excess of unsold cars at europe 's biggest car terminal in bremerhaven .
more than 90,000 vehicles are clogging the shipping terminal in the northern german port of bremerhaven , waiting to find new owners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of cars are waiting to be picked up in bremerhaven " we ca n't move the cars , work on them or deliver them until they find buyers , " said detthold aden , head of the blg logistics group , which operates the facility . roll-on roll-off vessels are delivering new cars that nobody wants .
instead of setting a turnover record , the terminal is rapidly becoming one of the world 's largest parking lots . when cars roll off ships like the " danube highway " or " morning champion " they come to a halt after just a few meters because there is no room for them on land .
blg has been forced to find extra space in the area of the port normally reserved for shipping containers .
other cars are temporarily stored on freight trains . ships normally jam-packed with vehicles destined for the united states are now leaving almost empty because of the dramatic downturn on the us car market . the speed of the meltdown caught bremerhaven by surprise .
when automobile manufactures published details of their shrinking sales , many of the cars now languishing in the port were already on their way to germany . " it 's a difficult situation , because many imported cars and those destined for export are still on their way here , " said aden . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , that the government 's stimulus package " might not suffice . " but merkel hinted that she wants to coordinate future efforts with the incoming barack obama administration .
if the financial crisis is such that the us will consider further measures after obama takes office on jan .
20 , " it will also be right to put together a second program in germany at a similar time , " she added .
merkel remains under pressure from other european countries to move quickly with cut taxes or vouchers to encourage spending .
merkel continues to oppose such plans , even though they are being undertaken elsewhere in europe .
paving the road to recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some want merkel to put more money in consumers ' hands instead , merkel favors tackling a backlog of road projects to stimulating the economy , she said in a speech tuesday to the center for european economic research , a think tank in mannheim , germany .
she called on germany 's states to send in their project lists as soon as possible , wanting to get going by the early spring .
most of the states have a backlog of detailed engineering proposals for projects that have been waiting for federal funding .
quoting government sources , press reports have said berlin is preparing to invest 20 billion to 30 billion euros in a fresh economic stimulus plan that will include public investment and consumer incentives , according to afp news agency .
" we will take action again in january - another few billion could come together , " merkel was quoted as saying by the dow jones newswires .
merkel said the fresh investment could go toward infrastructure improvements including roads , broadband communications networks and renovation of schools , as well as subsidies for temporary jobs .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists are predicting that 2009 will be a rough year for germany a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said on tuesday that the government fears the german economy could contract by 3.0 percent or more next year , marking the worst recession in german post-war history .
the bdb commercial banks ' association backed up this assessment , predicting that germany will suffer its deepest recession since world war two next year .
as long as the bad news about germany 's economy continues , it 's unlikely that european allies such as france will let up pressure on merkel to do more and do it quickly .
yet with national elections scheduled for next fall , merkel is taking a cautious approach .
that has lead to criticism from those in her party who want to see the government do more .
economy minister michael glos emphasized that the government still has the scope to increase its economic stimulus package if necessary .
glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has repeatedly argued in favor of cutting taxes .
a poll done for germany 's stern magazine and rtl television showed that support for merkel and her party continues to drop due to concerns over the financial crisis . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , the 52-year-old police chief in the bavarian german city of passau , alois mannichl , was stabbed when he answered his door at home .
the attack was alleged to be a reprisal from the neo-nazi scene ; mannichl had taken a firm stand against far-right supporters in recent years .
police arrested and then released two suspects .
some are now calling for a ban on germany 's far-right political party , the npd .
deutsche welle spoke to konrad freiberg , the head of the union of german police officers -lrb- gdp -rrb- about what the stabbing represents .
deutsche welle : herr freiberg , you said the attempted murder of the passau police chief represents a strategy change on the part of the extreme right .
why ?
konrad freiberg : in the past the violent right-wing activists were respectful to the police .
that has changed radically .
now , in demonstrations that include the npd , the police are frequently targets of physical attacks by the far right .
they verbally abuse the police as well .
that represents a change .
what do you think accounts for this change ?
there is a strategy debate among the far-right wing .
some insist that political means are the way to achieve power , and they want to create change via parliament or local councils .
but others say the way is violence , there is no other way .
so the anger from this group continues to grow .
how long has this strategic change been going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiberg said one must examine the causes of far-right extremism i 'd have to say for about a year .
we feel it very clearly .
there have been a lot of threats against colleagues who took a stand against the extreme right , or whose job description includes responsibility for this area of security .
there have been threats and attacks on those people in the private sphere .
things have really changed .
the extreme right is not only a problem in germany but in other european countries as well .
has anything similar to the passau attack taken place elsewhere in europe ?
yes , there have been attacks on the police by the extreme right in other european countries .
the right wing is making an effort to build itself up internationally .
at many meetings and demonstrations people come from different countries , especially the netherlands , and also italy .
so there is cooperation .
but we know and must recognize that this attack was a single case , without a doubt , and has no relation to an international plan of any sort .
to what degree is germany 's far-right extremist scene tied to those in other european countries , if indeed that is the case ?
there are international meetings .
and at large national meetings they try , as often as possible , to have some international participation .
at these meetings they all cheer together , saying things like " all europe is turning brown . "
that 's just the way it is .
that 's why we have to watch out that the german extreme right does n't increase its own strength by drawing strength from the international extreme right .
what should germany - and europe - do about this ?
if you talk about fighting right-wing extremism , you have to look at the causes .
why do people get into it ?
on top of that you have to look at the living situation and perspectives of those who are involved .
but you also have to look at how the democratic parties , and civil society , deals with these people .
we ca n't only count on the police and justice system to fight them , because they ca n't solve the problem alone . interview : esther broders -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's why we have to watch out that the german extreme right does n't increase its own strength by drawing strength from the international extreme right .
what should germany - and europe - do about this ?
if you talk about fighting right-wing extremism , you have to look at the causes .
why do people get into it ?
on top of that you have to look at the living situation and perspectives of those who are involved .

16 , that the government 's stimulus package " might not suffice . " but merkel hinted that she wants to coordinate future efforts with the incoming barack obama administration .
if the financial crisis is such that the us will consider further measures after obama takes office on jan .
20 , " it will also be right to put together a second program in germany at a similar time , " she added .
merkel remains under pressure from other european countries to move quickly with cut taxes or vouchers to encourage spending .
merkel continues to oppose such plans , even though they are being undertaken elsewhere in europe .
paving the road to recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some want merkel to put more money in consumers ' hands instead , merkel favors tackling a backlog of road projects to stimulating the economy , she said in a speech tuesday to the center for european economic research , a think tank in mannheim , germany .
she called on germany 's states to send in their project lists as soon as possible , wanting to get going by the early spring .
most of the states have a backlog of detailed engineering proposals for projects that have been waiting for federal funding .
quoting government sources , press reports have said berlin is preparing to invest 20 billion to 30 billion euros in a fresh economic stimulus plan that will include public investment and consumer incentives , according to afp news agency .
" we will take action again in january - another few billion could come together , " merkel was quoted as saying by the dow jones newswires .
merkel said the fresh investment could go toward infrastructure improvements including roads , broadband communications networks and renovation of schools , as well as subsidies for temporary jobs .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists are predicting that 2009 will be a rough year for germany a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said on tuesday that the government fears the german economy could contract by 3.0 percent or more next year , marking the worst recession in german post-war history .
the bdb commercial banks ' association backed up this assessment , predicting that germany will suffer its deepest recession since world war two next year .
as long as the bad news about germany 's economy continues , it 's unlikely that european allies such as france will let up pressure on merkel to do more and do it quickly .
yet with national elections scheduled for next fall , merkel is taking a cautious approach .
that has lead to criticism from those in her party who want to see the government do more .
economy minister michael glos emphasized that the government still has the scope to increase its economic stimulus package if necessary .
glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has repeatedly argued in favor of cutting taxes .
a poll done for germany 's stern magazine and rtl television showed that support for merkel and her party continues to drop due to concerns over the financial crisis . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.12.2008 sarkozy bids european parliament farewell großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy , right addresses the european parliament in a speech to the european parliament , france 's president looked back on his country 's six-month term heading the eu .
meps debated with the leader on topics including georgia , the financial crisis and climate change . france 's president nicolas sarkozy said his country had aimed to organize its six-month presidency on the basis of two convictions . " the world needs a strong europe and that europe can not be strong if it is not united , " sarkozy told the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday , dec .
16 .
a strong europe was one that " rejects consensus based on pushing problems to one side , " he said . sarkozy said france 's presidency had been forced to follow " the rhythm of international events , " among them the russia-georgia conflict in august and the worldwide financial crisis in september .
though he had tried to change europe in this time , europe had in fact changed him , he said . " i really think that each head of state or government would benefit at some time from this responsibility , " sarkozy said .
" they would understand that whatever differences we have , there are so many things that bring us together .
when one has the chance over six months to learn about and to solve the problems of 27 nations , one gains tolerance , an opening of the spirit and one understands europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz said the french presidency had been " quite good " overall most meps applauded france on its term .
even the socialist leader in the european parliament , martin schulz , an outspoken critic of sarkozy 's , called the french eu presidency a success . " if the next presidency does the same i would be happy , " said schulz .
he said the french leader had " come out of the closet , as a pro-european . " the czech republic will take over the eu 's rotating presidency on january 1 , 2009 . heated debate on climate change sarkozy defended the eu 's climate change deal , which the bloc agreed on last week .
he told the parliament that there had been " an enormous fight " about climate change and energy as each member state had had " reason for dissatisfaction . "
he said compromises that had been agreed by leaders would avoid imposing unbearable sacrifices on its citizens . " we did n't want to impose constrictions which no country in the world could have survived socially , " sarkozy said . the president of the european commission jose manuel barroso said the climate change initiatives made europe the first to accept legally binding rules by 2020 . " and we will be strengthening these limits as agreement is reached globally , " barroso said .
" we can now turn to our friends in america and say to them : yes , you can ! " the conservative leader joseph daul said the climate change agreement would protect both the environment and jobs .
he said the eu now had to lead the worldwide fight against climate change , press the worst polluters to act and seek tangible commitments from us president barack obama once he took office . but daniel cohn-bendit from the greens called the swift adoption of the climate change package " blackmail . " european lawmakers will be voting on the climate change package on wednesday .
the parliament 's main political groups have already announced that they will be supporting the deal . alleviating the financial crisis most meps applauded france 's rapid reaction to the economic and financial crises .
socialist leader schulz said the presidency " did well " on the financial crisis .
sarkozy had reacted - albeit " somewhat late " - to the time-bomb of social imbalances in europe , schulz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most politicians applauded france 's presidency sarkozy said unity had been crucial in the global financial crisis .
if europe 's countries and institutions had not taken responsibility , this would have led to " the destruction of the european banking system , " he said . " we in europe want entrepreneurial capitalism not speculative capitalism , " sarkozy said .
" we have said this with one voice .
our economies and our political cultures are not the same , but we all agreed in the end . " conservative leader daul said the french presidency 's efforts had helped to win worldwide respect for europe 's coordinated response to the financial crisis . the presidency 's actions had brought about coordinated protection for savers ' deposits and recapitalization for banks , he said .
this had prevented a chain reaction in which thousands of jobs could have been lost , daul said . europe is not the enemy of the nations many parliamentary group leaders welcomed sarkozy 's and the french government 's swift and successful reaction to events in georgia .
sarkozy said his main aim during the georgian crisis had been " to stop the war and not fall into the same trap as in bosnia , " where the united states had taken the lead and europe followed . it had been a " real obsession " of france 's presidency that europe should " take responsibility " over georgia and fortunately europe had remained united over the issue , he said . sarkozy said in his conclusion that europe required an understanding between different nations .
he said that he was not an integrationist , but that he was determined to preserve the nation state . " however european you are , europe is not the enemy of the nations and the nations are not the enemy of europe , " sarkozy said .
" it is easier for europe to have big ambitions than small ones , because only big projects have the power to overcome national egos . " dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , were allegedly plotting to re-organize cosa nostra 's command structure under the orders of one of italy 's most wanted mafia bosses , matteo messina denaro , who remains on the run , a police statement said .
some 1,200 carabinieri paramilitary police , backed by helicopter units and anti-drug dog squads , took part in tuesday 's operation , which was mainly conducted in the area near palermo , sicily , the statement said .
those arrested face charges including extortion , arms dealing , drug-trafficking and " membership of a mafia organization , " it said .
messina denaro is assumed to have taken over cosa nostra 's leadership following the arrest of the previous " godfather , " bernardo provenzano , in april 2006 .
investigators suspect that messina denaro intended , together with several of those arrested , to reconstitute cosa nostra 's governing " cupola " a sort of commission in which representatives of the main crime families take decisions collectively .
the cupola system fell into disuse following the arrest of former mafia kingpin toto riina in 1993 and italian authorities ' subsequent crackdown on the sicilian mafia 's structures . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.12.2008 sarkozy bids european parliament farewell großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy , right addresses the european parliament in a speech to the european parliament , france 's president looked back on his country 's six-month term heading the eu .
meps debated with the leader on topics including georgia , the financial crisis and climate change . france 's president nicolas sarkozy said his country had aimed to organize its six-month presidency on the basis of two convictions . " the world needs a strong europe and that europe can not be strong if it is not united , " sarkozy told the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday , dec .
16 .
a strong europe was one that " rejects consensus based on pushing problems to one side , " he said . sarkozy said france 's presidency had been forced to follow " the rhythm of international events , " among them the russia-georgia conflict in august and the worldwide financial crisis in september .
though he had tried to change europe in this time , europe had in fact changed him , he said . " i really think that each head of state or government would benefit at some time from this responsibility , " sarkozy said .
" they would understand that whatever differences we have , there are so many things that bring us together .
when one has the chance over six months to learn about and to solve the problems of 27 nations , one gains tolerance , an opening of the spirit and one understands europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz said the french presidency had been " quite good " overall most meps applauded france on its term .
even the socialist leader in the european parliament , martin schulz , an outspoken critic of sarkozy 's , called the french eu presidency a success . " if the next presidency does the same i would be happy , " said schulz .
he said the french leader had " come out of the closet , as a pro-european . " the czech republic will take over the eu 's rotating presidency on january 1 , 2009 . heated debate on climate change sarkozy defended the eu 's climate change deal , which the bloc agreed on last week .
he told the parliament that there had been " an enormous fight " about climate change and energy as each member state had had " reason for dissatisfaction . "
he said compromises that had been agreed by leaders would avoid imposing unbearable sacrifices on its citizens . " we did n't want to impose constrictions which no country in the world could have survived socially , " sarkozy said . the president of the european commission jose manuel barroso said the climate change initiatives made europe the first to accept legally binding rules by 2020 . " and we will be strengthening these limits as agreement is reached globally , " barroso said .
" we can now turn to our friends in america and say to them : yes , you can ! " the conservative leader joseph daul said the climate change agreement would protect both the environment and jobs .
he said the eu now had to lead the worldwide fight against climate change , press the worst polluters to act and seek tangible commitments from us president barack obama once he took office . but daniel cohn-bendit from the greens called the swift adoption of the climate change package " blackmail . " european lawmakers will be voting on the climate change package on wednesday .
the parliament 's main political groups have already announced that they will be supporting the deal . alleviating the financial crisis most meps applauded france 's rapid reaction to the economic and financial crises .
socialist leader schulz said the presidency " did well " on the financial crisis .
sarkozy had reacted - albeit " somewhat late " - to the time-bomb of social imbalances in europe , schulz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most politicians applauded france 's presidency sarkozy said unity had been crucial in the global financial crisis .
if europe 's countries and institutions had not taken responsibility , this would have led to " the destruction of the european banking system , " he said . " we in europe want entrepreneurial capitalism not speculative capitalism , " sarkozy said .
" we have said this with one voice .
our economies and our political cultures are not the same , but we all agreed in the end . " conservative leader daul said the french presidency 's efforts had helped to win worldwide respect for europe 's coordinated response to the financial crisis . the presidency 's actions had brought about coordinated protection for savers ' deposits and recapitalization for banks , he said .
this had prevented a chain reaction in which thousands of jobs could have been lost , daul said . europe is not the enemy of the nations many parliamentary group leaders welcomed sarkozy 's and the french government 's swift and successful reaction to events in georgia .
sarkozy said his main aim during the georgian crisis had been " to stop the war and not fall into the same trap as in bosnia , " where the united states had taken the lead and europe followed . it had been a " real obsession " of france 's presidency that europe should " take responsibility " over georgia and fortunately europe had remained united over the issue , he said . sarkozy said in his conclusion that europe required an understanding between different nations .
he said that he was not an integrationist , but that he was determined to preserve the nation state . " however european you are , europe is not the enemy of the nations and the nations are not the enemy of europe , " sarkozy said .
" it is easier for europe to have big ambitions than small ones , because only big projects have the power to overcome national egos . " dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 from current holder france .
czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg spoke with dw about his country 's intentions for its eu presidency . deutsche welle : in a few weeks , the czech republic will take over the eu presidency .
what are the goals you 've set for the next six months ? karel schwarzenberg : the goals that we originally set are already known : on the one hand , supporting the development of the eastern " neighborhood ; " secondly , driving forward the integration process in the western balkans ; and thirdly , a europe without barriers .
a liberal europe , a europe that does n't close itself off , but meets all challenges . now , it could be as with several other presidencies , that our presidency will be dependent on other things .
the financial crisis is no longer just on the horizon , it 's being felt full-on in europe .
i 'm afraid that this will absorb a great deal of our presidency and that will be something we 'll really have to deal with .
there are also numerous foreign policy problems that threaten us on the horizon . to put it simply , you can set yourself a lot of goals at the start of a presidency , but life can take you in a different direction .
i do n't think the french presidency would have predicted that their main tasks would involve handling the conflict in the caucasus and the beginning of the economic crisis . i 'd like to come back to these topics individually .
but i 'm also interested in the future of the lisbon reform treaty .
the czech republic is one of two countries that has not approved it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzenberg said the financial crisis will remain a major focus god knows that 's true .
that 's been delayed now , firstly because of the proceedings at the constitutional court , and arguments in parliament .
but i 'm assuming it will happen within the next six weeks . the czech president vaclav klaus is a decided opponent to the reform treaty , and he 's also said the eu presidency is a totally unimportant thing. hhow do you live , how do you work with a president that is so disrespectful toward the european union ? well look , i do n't live with him .
the president knows that i have different opinions to him , and i know that about him .
we 've had almost two years now to get used to this situation .
foreign policy is dictated by the government , not by the president .
you ca n't choose the kind of relationship you have with a head of state , it 's there and you have to live with it . in france , there 's been public speculation about whether the czech republic is even in a position to lead the european union in this very critical time .
did it hurt you to hear what was coming from the french president 's circle ? no , not in the least .
i 'm not that easily hurt .
i 've been through a lot in my life , i 've seen a lot .
we 'll see if such statements are still being made by the end of our presidency .
i 'm well aware that many smaller countries have had to deal with similar sentiments at the start of their presidencies .
i think it 's just part of the political banter that comes with a presidency and i do n't take it that seriously . you yourself once referred to french president nicolas sarkozy with much admiration as the " spirit of restlessness in politics . "
how satisfied are you with the restlessness that france has brought to the eu in its six-month presidency ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy gets kudos for his handling of the financial crisis i think , all in all , we should be very grateful to the french president .
there were single steps , isolated remarks that i was n't particularly thrilled about .
but i think we have to say that the sarkozy 's energetic handling of the crisis in the caucasus is something europe can be very thankful for , as were his efforts to do something about the economic crisis .
we 'll have to see if the measures he took were the right ones .
that 's beyond my economic expertise , but in any case , it was a presidency that took action . the global economic crisis was n't foreseeable when france took over .
you 're inheriting this problem now .
what are your expectations ?
how bad do you think this crisis will get ? i think it 's something we have to take very , very seriously .
that does n't mean - and i would like to emphasize this - that we should start to panic .
given the situation , that would be the worst thing we could do .
the tried and trusted rules of economics should n't be thrown overboard in a moment of panic . but we should be aware that emergency measures are sometimes needed .
and if i were to break my leg today , i would have to accept that i would have to wear a cast for a while .
but we all know that if you wear a cast for too long , the muscles start to weaken to the point that it could cause lasting damage .
so , like i said , all these emergency measures and regulations should be used very carefully .
they should not be used permanently , and only goal-oriented measures should be used to combat the crisis . an important matter for the eu is always its relations with its eastern neighbors .
should countries such as moldova or ukraine be introduced as members of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty remains a sticking point this will take very , very long , i fear , very long .
but i believe it is in our greatest interests that this prospect stays alive .
it is an engine for reform , real motivation .
whether it concerns the western european states or also these states , this prospect is the strongest motivation to push the necessary reforms . and these reforms are in our greatest interests .
in discussions we forget over and over again that reaching out to these countries is not a charitable activity , exclusively to the advantage of these states , but that we would be pre-empting difficulties we will inevitably have . what role should russia play in this concept ?
is it only a strategic energy supplier or is moscow also a part of this idea of political partnership ? russia is and will remain a world in itself , with which we should search for a healthy , fair relationship .
what does not simplify things is that certain developments in russia , even a return to an authoritarian system , worry us .
we are anxious about certain revisionist statements which are somewhat unsettling . but this changes nothing about the fact that not only as an energy supplier , but also as a security discussion partner in countless elements of policy and international politics , russia is a much-needed partner with whom we should have dialog and lead .
but not under all conditions , this of course is obvious .
we must still protect our own principles .
but dialog with russia is always useful and necessary . interview : christian trippe -lrb- dc / dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the czech republic is one of two countries that has not approved it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzenberg said the financial crisis will remain a major focus god knows that 's true .
that 's been delayed now , firstly because of the proceedings at the constitutional court , and arguments in parliament .
but i 'm assuming it will happen within the next six weeks . the czech president vaclav klaus is a decided opponent to the reform treaty , and he 's also said the eu presidency is a totally unimportant thing. hhow do you live , how do you work with a president that is so disrespectful toward the european union ? well look , i do n't live with him .
the president knows that i have different opinions to him , and i know that about him .
we 've had almost two years now to get used to this situation .
foreign policy is dictated by the government , not by the president .
you ca n't choose the kind of relationship you have with a head of state , it 's there and you have to live with it . in france , there 's been public speculation about whether the czech republic is even in a position to lead the european union in this very critical time .
did it hurt you to hear what was coming from the french president 's circle ? no , not in the least .
i 'm not that easily hurt .
i 've been through a lot in my life , i 've seen a lot .
we 'll see if such statements are still being made by the end of our presidency .
i 'm well aware that many smaller countries have had to deal with similar sentiments at the start of their presidencies .
i think it 's just part of the political banter that comes with a presidency and i do n't take it that seriously . you yourself once referred to french president nicolas sarkozy with much admiration as the " spirit of restlessness in politics . "
how satisfied are you with the restlessness that france has brought to the eu in its six-month presidency ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy gets kudos for his handling of the financial crisis i think , all in all , we should be very grateful to the french president .
there were single steps , isolated remarks that i was n't particularly thrilled about .
but i think we have to say that the sarkozy 's energetic handling of the crisis in the caucasus is something europe can be very thankful for , as were his efforts to do something about the economic crisis .
we 'll have to see if the measures he took were the right ones .
that 's beyond my economic expertise , but in any case , it was a presidency that took action . the global economic crisis was n't foreseeable when france took over .
you 're inheriting this problem now .
what are your expectations ?
how bad do you think this crisis will get ? i think it 's something we have to take very , very seriously .
that does n't mean - and i would like to emphasize this - that we should start to panic .
given the situation , that would be the worst thing we could do .
the tried and trusted rules of economics should n't be thrown overboard in a moment of panic . but we should be aware that emergency measures are sometimes needed .
and if i were to break my leg today , i would have to accept that i would have to wear a cast for a while .
but we all know that if you wear a cast for too long , the muscles start to weaken to the point that it could cause lasting damage .
so , like i said , all these emergency measures and regulations should be used very carefully .
they should not be used permanently , and only goal-oriented measures should be used to combat the crisis . an important matter for the eu is always its relations with its eastern neighbors .
should countries such as moldova or ukraine be introduced as members of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty remains a sticking point this will take very , very long , i fear , very long .
but i believe it is in our greatest interests that this prospect stays alive .
it is an engine for reform , real motivation .
whether it concerns the western european states or also these states , this prospect is the strongest motivation to push the necessary reforms . and these reforms are in our greatest interests .
in discussions we forget over and over again that reaching out to these countries is not a charitable activity , exclusively to the advantage of these states , but that we would be pre-empting difficulties we will inevitably have . what role should russia play in this concept ?
is it only a strategic energy supplier or is moscow also a part of this idea of political partnership ? russia is and will remain a world in itself , with which we should search for a healthy , fair relationship .
what does not simplify things is that certain developments in russia , even a return to an authoritarian system , worry us .
we are anxious about certain revisionist statements which are somewhat unsettling . but this changes nothing about the fact that not only as an energy supplier , but also as a security discussion partner in countless elements of policy and international politics , russia is a much-needed partner with whom we should have dialog and lead .
but not under all conditions , this of course is obvious .

what are the goals you 've set for the next six months ? karel schwarzenberg : the goals that we originally set are already known : on the one hand , supporting the development of the eastern " neighborhood ; " secondly , driving forward the integration process in the western balkans ; and thirdly , a europe without barriers .

it 's estimated that the battle fought there could have involved up to 1,000 roman fighters . according to a theory put forward by guenther moosbauer , an expert at the university of osnabrueck who studies roman-german history , a roman legion could have been seeking revenge after tribesman in 235 a.d. pushed roman troops south of the limes germanicus , a ring of forts that separated the empire from unconquered land to the north and east .

while unsold cars block germany 's biggest car terminal , france 's president promises help for his country 's auto makers . european consumers are continuing to buy fewer cars , according to the european automobile manufacturers ' association acea . " new passenger car registrations in europe fell by 25.8 percent in november compared to the same month of last year , declining for the seventh month in a row , mirroring the financial and economic crises , " the acea said in a statement on tuesday , dec .
16 . november new registrations totaled 932,537 cars , a decrease from over 1.2 million in november 2007 .
acea said there had n't been such a notable decline since 1999 . germany , europe 's largest automobile market , saw registrations down 17.7 percent to 233,722 units .
all markets across the continent decreased except finland , poland and the czech republic . " the new eu member states long showed more resilience , in relative terms , because of the greater number of first-time buyers as opposed to the replacement market of western europe , " acea said . sarkozy pledges help the french government has said it will take action to save the country 's automobile industry .
president nicolas sarkozy on monday , dec .
15 , told leaders from the french car industry that he was prepared to provide additional aid to the struggling sector in the form of government loans and guarantees , his office said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is intent on helping france 's car industry however , he made all government aid to the industry subject to agreement from france 's fellow eu members and the european commission . but sarkozy said carmakers and their suppliers would have to commit to preserving sites in france .
aid was dependent on " the renunciation of any policy of deliberately encouraging the outsourcing " of production , he said . it was " incompatible with the closing of assembly factories in france , " sarkozy said . sarkozy 's office said that senior executives from the two largest french carmakers , renault and peugeot citroen , as well as representatives of the auto-equipment suppliers michelin and valeo took part in the meeting . the worst is yet to come in an interview published monday in the french daily le figaro , renault chief executive carlos ghosn said emergency government loans were necessary for the french car industry to survive the economic crisis . " what we are demanding from the state is some reasonable financing , over two to three years , at interest rates between four and five percent , " ghosn said . two out of every three cars was purchased on credit , he said . " if the finance crisis continues , you will see one producer after the other fail , " ghosn said . both renault and peugeot citroen have shut some of their factories to cut production as demand for cars in europe has plunged . acea figures for november showed the registration of new private cars in france down by more than 14 percent .
but , according to ghosn , the worst of the crisis still lies ahead . " we have n't touched bottom yet , " ghosn said . cars backlogged in germany the dramatic situation in the automobile industry has led to an excess of unsold cars at europe 's biggest car terminal in bremerhaven .
more than 90,000 vehicles are clogging the shipping terminal in the northern german port of bremerhaven , waiting to find new owners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of cars are waiting to be picked up in bremerhaven " we ca n't move the cars , work on them or deliver them until they find buyers , " said detthold aden , head of the blg logistics group , which operates the facility . roll-on roll-off vessels are delivering new cars that nobody wants .
instead of setting a turnover record , the terminal is rapidly becoming one of the world 's largest parking lots . when cars roll off ships like the " danube highway " or " morning champion " they come to a halt after just a few meters because there is no room for them on land .
blg has been forced to find extra space in the area of the port normally reserved for shipping containers .
other cars are temporarily stored on freight trains . ships normally jam-packed with vehicles destined for the united states are now leaving almost empty because of the dramatic downturn on the us car market . the speed of the meltdown caught bremerhaven by surprise .
when automobile manufactures published details of their shrinking sales , many of the cars now languishing in the port were already on their way to germany . " it 's a difficult situation , because many imported cars and those destined for export are still on their way here , " said aden . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , the 52-year-old police chief in the bavarian german city of passau , alois mannichl , was stabbed when he answered his door at home .
the attack was alleged to be a reprisal from the neo-nazi scene ; mannichl had taken a firm stand against far-right supporters in recent years .
police arrested and then released two suspects .
some are now calling for a ban on germany 's far-right political party , the npd .
deutsche welle spoke to konrad freiberg , the head of the union of german police officers -lrb- gdp -rrb- about what the stabbing represents .
deutsche welle : herr freiberg , you said the attempted murder of the passau police chief represents a strategy change on the part of the extreme right .
why ?
konrad freiberg : in the past the violent right-wing activists were respectful to the police .
that has changed radically .
now , in demonstrations that include the npd , the police are frequently targets of physical attacks by the far right .
they verbally abuse the police as well .
that represents a change .
what do you think accounts for this change ?
there is a strategy debate among the far-right wing .
some insist that political means are the way to achieve power , and they want to create change via parliament or local councils .
but others say the way is violence , there is no other way .
so the anger from this group continues to grow .
how long has this strategic change been going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiberg said one must examine the causes of far-right extremism i 'd have to say for about a year .
we feel it very clearly .
there have been a lot of threats against colleagues who took a stand against the extreme right , or whose job description includes responsibility for this area of security .
there have been threats and attacks on those people in the private sphere .
things have really changed .
the extreme right is not only a problem in germany but in other european countries as well .
has anything similar to the passau attack taken place elsewhere in europe ?
yes , there have been attacks on the police by the extreme right in other european countries .
the right wing is making an effort to build itself up internationally .
at many meetings and demonstrations people come from different countries , especially the netherlands , and also italy .
so there is cooperation .
but we know and must recognize that this attack was a single case , without a doubt , and has no relation to an international plan of any sort .
to what degree is germany 's far-right extremist scene tied to those in other european countries , if indeed that is the case ?
there are international meetings .
and at large national meetings they try , as often as possible , to have some international participation .
at these meetings they all cheer together , saying things like " all europe is turning brown . "
that 's just the way it is .
that 's why we have to watch out that the german extreme right does n't increase its own strength by drawing strength from the international extreme right .
what should germany - and europe - do about this ?
if you talk about fighting right-wing extremism , you have to look at the causes .
why do people get into it ?
on top of that you have to look at the living situation and perspectives of those who are involved .
but you also have to look at how the democratic parties , and civil society , deals with these people .
we ca n't only count on the police and justice system to fight them , because they ca n't solve the problem alone . interview : esther broders -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then , it has been busy mounting exhibitions aimed at winning new audiences for the new wave of indian art that has been sweeping the global art market . nature morte , on the other hand , was originally part of new york 's east village art scene in the 1980s before re-establishing itself in new delhi in 1997 . singh 's work sets standards the gallery 's berlin director julie engelmeier first studied politics and economics in paris , london and new york before getting involved in the art world .
she said she 's excited about nature morte 's debut indian art exhibition , featuring singh 's work in three distinct sections .
the exhibition runs through to jan .
3 . one section highlights images shot within the anandamayi ashram in the northern indian city of varanasi -lrb- benares -rrb- .
from portraits of girls sequestered within this environment emerges a study of the tensions found in india today including the role of women . another section zeroes in on activities at a site in the western indian state of gujarat where mentally and physically ill patients go in the hope of a cure .
formerly suffering from epilepsy , singh was originally drawn to the site . bildunterschrift : the nature morte gallery focuses on indian art engelmeier is an enthusiastic fan of singh 's searching brand of photography . " she is a highly profiled , super-serious indian photographer , who is also a very funny and warm person , " engelmeier said .
" i 'm happy to have opened with her work because it sets a great standard for the gallery . " an affinity for india as to her own background , the munich-born engelmeier told german news agency dpa in an interview , " i was working for a consultancy firm for a spell , but then took a year out to re-orientate myself . " " i had this affinity with india and made visits there whenever i could , " engelmeier said .
" my brother also lived in new delhi , so there was this big connection and it was there that i started my work in the art world . " in india , engelmeier met new delhi-based american art entrepreneur peter nagy , at a moment when he was toying with the idea of opening a gallery in europe , preferably in berlin . " that 's how everything fell into place for me , " engelmeier said . engelmeier , 28 , is fascinated by berlin 's thriving art world activity . " the city now has as many art galleries as manhattan , " she said .
" there may not be a lot of industry or many big art buyers here , but there are lots of artists from all parts of the world .
they like its free-wheeling , liberal atmosphere , its many cafes and pubs and its vibrant cultural life . " all the big german art fairs now take place in berlin , whereas previously the art hot spot was cologne , " engelmeier said . a magnet for berlin as for art entrepreneur nagy , he 's confident his latest berlin venture will be welcomed by collectors . nature morte was the first indian gallery to participate at the world 's most prestigious art fairs . " in that sense we have a special edge in terms of brand recognition with the international art world , " nagy told the art newspaper recently .
" we think people will want to travel to berlin to see what we are doing . " in the years following the fall of the berlin wall , numerous galleries emerged along just one street in center of what was the city 's former communist half . now it has spread to other parts of the city , including the area around the old checkpoint charlie crossing point , with a flood of galleries having opened up in recent years near where the berlin wall marked out the city 's post-second world war divide . " gallerists move here because there are large spaces available at much cheaper prices , " engelmeier said . dpa news agency -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 16.12.2008 opinion : siemens got off lightly , but there 's more to come großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the biggest bribery scandal in german business history , siemens had to pay fines amounting to nearly a billion euros .
ultimately , though , it got off easy , says dw 's karl zawadzky . considering the extent of the corruption affair , siemens is getting off relatively unscathed .
after all , bribery appears to have been an everyday occurrence for the international group when it came to getting contracts .
and nothing changed when laws were passed in germany - as in other industrial nations - that clearly forbid bribery , and the company 's shares began trading on the new york stock exchange .
in an unrivalled review , a legion of lawyers and accountants examined each and every siemens document .
for the time period between 1999 and 2006 , bribes on the order of 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- were uncovered .
it turns out that siemens workers and representatives around the globe had felt free to use money from secret accounts if it seemed useful for garnering contracts .
given the dimensions of the situation , siemens is getting off more lightly with its fine than most people would have expected .
especially when it comes to the settlement it agreed to with the us ministry of justice and the securities watchdog , the sec .
lesson learned , moving on siemens will pay 620 million euros to the us .
it could have been much worse .
and it would have been , if siemens had been blocked from competing for public contracts in the us for a period of many years .
the intense inspection of its books no doubt made an impression .
moreover , managers throughout the firm have been let go .
siemens learned its lesson .
it can now hope that its us unit will profit from the enormous infrastructure program planned by us president elect barack obama .
in order not to fall back into old , corrupt habits , ex-german finance minister theo waigel - today a lawyer in munich - has been named " compliance monitor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky in the us , such monitoring is a common component of a criminal proceedings settlements .
in germany , the munich prosecutor 's office imposed a fine of 395 million euros , which siemens accepted .
that - along with the payment to the us and setting up the monitoring system that theo waigel will oversee - is the end of the state 's lawsuit against siemens over the bribery of public officials .
siemens can survive the financial hit .
even without corruption , the company 's business is strong - and in its year-end accounts , siemens thought to lay aside a billion euros to pay off fines .
but that 's not the end of the story .
the state prosecutor 's office still has open legal proceedings against specific former company directors , including longtime ceo and supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , on grounds they breached oversight rules .
siemens is suing former executives on top of that , siemens itself is suing former executives for millions in compensatory damages , on the grounds that the board of directors failed to institute internal controls that would prevent a regular culture of bribery - either that , or they intentionally looked the other way .
and there 's another reason the affair is not yet over : clients around the globe are preparing suits for damages because they think the bribery costs increased the prices they paid for goods or services .
moreover , countries want to know which of their officials took bribes from siemens .
even though the big lawsuits in germany and the us ended with settlements and fines , siemens will be processing one of the darkest chapters in its more-than-100-year-old corporate history for years to come .
on top of this , the damage to company 's reputation has been great , and no amount of money can ever fix it the case of siemens turns out to be a perfect example of the adage : corruption does n't pay .

ultimately , though , it got off easy , says dw 's karl zawadzky . considering the extent of the corruption affair , siemens is getting off relatively unscathed .
after all , bribery appears to have been an everyday occurrence for the international group when it came to getting contracts .
and nothing changed when laws were passed in germany - as in other industrial nations - that clearly forbid bribery , and the company 's shares began trading on the new york stock exchange .
in an unrivalled review , a legion of lawyers and accountants examined each and every siemens document .
for the time period between 1999 and 2006 , bribes on the order of 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- were uncovered .
it turns out that siemens workers and representatives around the globe had felt free to use money from secret accounts if it seemed useful for garnering contracts .
given the dimensions of the situation , siemens is getting off more lightly with its fine than most people would have expected .
especially when it comes to the settlement it agreed to with the us ministry of justice and the securities watchdog , the sec .
lesson learned , moving on siemens will pay 620 million euros to the us .
it could have been much worse .
and it would have been , if siemens had been blocked from competing for public contracts in the us for a period of many years .
the intense inspection of its books no doubt made an impression .
moreover , managers throughout the firm have been let go .
siemens learned its lesson .
it can now hope that its us unit will profit from the enormous infrastructure program planned by us president elect barack obama .
in order not to fall back into old , corrupt habits , ex-german finance minister theo waigel - today a lawyer in munich - has been named " compliance monitor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky in the us , such monitoring is a common component of a criminal proceedings settlements .
in germany , the munich prosecutor 's office imposed a fine of 395 million euros , which siemens accepted .
that - along with the payment to the us and setting up the monitoring system that theo waigel will oversee - is the end of the state 's lawsuit against siemens over the bribery of public officials .
siemens can survive the financial hit .
even without corruption , the company 's business is strong - and in its year-end accounts , siemens thought to lay aside a billion euros to pay off fines .
but that 's not the end of the story .
the state prosecutor 's office still has open legal proceedings against specific former company directors , including longtime ceo and supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , on grounds they breached oversight rules .
siemens is suing former executives on top of that , siemens itself is suing former executives for millions in compensatory damages , on the grounds that the board of directors failed to institute internal controls that would prevent a regular culture of bribery - either that , or they intentionally looked the other way .
and there 's another reason the affair is not yet over : clients around the globe are preparing suits for damages because they think the bribery costs increased the prices they paid for goods or services .
moreover , countries want to know which of their officials took bribes from siemens .
even though the big lawsuits in germany and the us ended with settlements and fines , siemens will be processing one of the darkest chapters in its more-than-100-year-old corporate history for years to come .
on top of this , the damage to company 's reputation has been great , and no amount of money can ever fix it the case of siemens turns out to be a perfect example of the adage : corruption does n't pay .

in order not to fall back into old , corrupt habits , ex-german finance minister theo waigel - today a lawyer in munich - has been named " compliance monitor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky in the us , such monitoring is a common component of a criminal proceedings settlements .
in germany , the munich prosecutor 's office imposed a fine of 395 million euros , which siemens accepted .
that - along with the payment to the us and setting up the monitoring system that theo waigel will oversee - is the end of the state 's lawsuit against siemens over the bribery of public officials .
siemens can survive the financial hit .
even without corruption , the company 's business is strong - and in its year-end accounts , siemens thought to lay aside a billion euros to pay off fines .
but that 's not the end of the story .
the state prosecutor 's office still has open legal proceedings against specific former company directors , including longtime ceo and supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , on grounds they breached oversight rules .
siemens is suing former executives on top of that , siemens itself is suing former executives for millions in compensatory damages , on the grounds that the board of directors failed to institute internal controls that would prevent a regular culture of bribery - either that , or they intentionally looked the other way .
and there 's another reason the affair is not yet over : clients around the globe are preparing suits for damages because they think the bribery costs increased the prices they paid for goods or services .
moreover , countries want to know which of their officials took bribes from siemens .
even though the big lawsuits in germany and the us ended with settlements and fines , siemens will be processing one of the darkest chapters in its more-than-100-year-old corporate history for years to come .
on top of this , the damage to company 's reputation has been great , and no amount of money can ever fix it the case of siemens turns out to be a perfect example of the adage : corruption does n't pay .

ultimately , though , it got off easy , says dw 's karl zawadzky . considering the extent of the corruption affair , siemens is getting off relatively unscathed .
after all , bribery appears to have been an everyday occurrence for the international group when it came to getting contracts .
and nothing changed when laws were passed in germany - as in other industrial nations - that clearly forbid bribery , and the company 's shares began trading on the new york stock exchange .
in an unrivalled review , a legion of lawyers and accountants examined each and every siemens document .
for the time period between 1999 and 2006 , bribes on the order of 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- were uncovered .
it turns out that siemens workers and representatives around the globe had felt free to use money from secret accounts if it seemed useful for garnering contracts .
given the dimensions of the situation , siemens is getting off more lightly with its fine than most people would have expected .
especially when it comes to the settlement it agreed to with the us ministry of justice and the securities watchdog , the sec .
lesson learned , moving on siemens will pay 620 million euros to the us .
it could have been much worse .
and it would have been , if siemens had been blocked from competing for public contracts in the us for a period of many years .
the intense inspection of its books no doubt made an impression .
moreover , managers throughout the firm have been let go .
siemens learned its lesson .
it can now hope that its us unit will profit from the enormous infrastructure program planned by us president elect barack obama .
in order not to fall back into old , corrupt habits , ex-german finance minister theo waigel - today a lawyer in munich - has been named " compliance monitor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky in the us , such monitoring is a common component of a criminal proceedings settlements .
in germany , the munich prosecutor 's office imposed a fine of 395 million euros , which siemens accepted .
that - along with the payment to the us and setting up the monitoring system that theo waigel will oversee - is the end of the state 's lawsuit against siemens over the bribery of public officials .
siemens can survive the financial hit .
even without corruption , the company 's business is strong - and in its year-end accounts , siemens thought to lay aside a billion euros to pay off fines .
but that 's not the end of the story .
the state prosecutor 's office still has open legal proceedings against specific former company directors , including longtime ceo and supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , on grounds they breached oversight rules .
siemens is suing former executives on top of that , siemens itself is suing former executives for millions in compensatory damages , on the grounds that the board of directors failed to institute internal controls that would prevent a regular culture of bribery - either that , or they intentionally looked the other way .
and there 's another reason the affair is not yet over : clients around the globe are preparing suits for damages because they think the bribery costs increased the prices they paid for goods or services .
moreover , countries want to know which of their officials took bribes from siemens .
even though the big lawsuits in germany and the us ended with settlements and fines , siemens will be processing one of the darkest chapters in its more-than-100-year-old corporate history for years to come .
on top of this , the damage to company 's reputation has been great , and no amount of money can ever fix it the case of siemens turns out to be a perfect example of the adage : corruption does n't pay .

1 from current holder france .
czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg spoke with dw about his country 's intentions for its eu presidency . deutsche welle : in a few weeks , the czech republic will take over the eu presidency .
what are the goals you 've set for the next six months ? karel schwarzenberg : the goals that we originally set are already known : on the one hand , supporting the development of the eastern " neighborhood ; " secondly , driving forward the integration process in the western balkans ; and thirdly , a europe without barriers .
a liberal europe , a europe that does n't close itself off , but meets all challenges . now , it could be as with several other presidencies , that our presidency will be dependent on other things .
the financial crisis is no longer just on the horizon , it 's being felt full-on in europe .
i 'm afraid that this will absorb a great deal of our presidency and that will be something we 'll really have to deal with .
there are also numerous foreign policy problems that threaten us on the horizon . to put it simply , you can set yourself a lot of goals at the start of a presidency , but life can take you in a different direction .
i do n't think the french presidency would have predicted that their main tasks would involve handling the conflict in the caucasus and the beginning of the economic crisis . i 'd like to come back to these topics individually .
but i 'm also interested in the future of the lisbon reform treaty .
the czech republic is one of two countries that has not approved it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzenberg said the financial crisis will remain a major focus god knows that 's true .
that 's been delayed now , firstly because of the proceedings at the constitutional court , and arguments in parliament .
but i 'm assuming it will happen within the next six weeks . the czech president vaclav klaus is a decided opponent to the reform treaty , and he 's also said the eu presidency is a totally unimportant thing. hhow do you live , how do you work with a president that is so disrespectful toward the european union ? well look , i do n't live with him .
the president knows that i have different opinions to him , and i know that about him .
we 've had almost two years now to get used to this situation .
foreign policy is dictated by the government , not by the president .
you ca n't choose the kind of relationship you have with a head of state , it 's there and you have to live with it . in france , there 's been public speculation about whether the czech republic is even in a position to lead the european union in this very critical time .
did it hurt you to hear what was coming from the french president 's circle ? no , not in the least .
i 'm not that easily hurt .
i 've been through a lot in my life , i 've seen a lot .
we 'll see if such statements are still being made by the end of our presidency .
i 'm well aware that many smaller countries have had to deal with similar sentiments at the start of their presidencies .
i think it 's just part of the political banter that comes with a presidency and i do n't take it that seriously . you yourself once referred to french president nicolas sarkozy with much admiration as the " spirit of restlessness in politics . "
how satisfied are you with the restlessness that france has brought to the eu in its six-month presidency ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy gets kudos for his handling of the financial crisis i think , all in all , we should be very grateful to the french president .
there were single steps , isolated remarks that i was n't particularly thrilled about .
but i think we have to say that the sarkozy 's energetic handling of the crisis in the caucasus is something europe can be very thankful for , as were his efforts to do something about the economic crisis .
we 'll have to see if the measures he took were the right ones .
that 's beyond my economic expertise , but in any case , it was a presidency that took action . the global economic crisis was n't foreseeable when france took over .
you 're inheriting this problem now .
what are your expectations ?
how bad do you think this crisis will get ? i think it 's something we have to take very , very seriously .
that does n't mean - and i would like to emphasize this - that we should start to panic .
given the situation , that would be the worst thing we could do .
the tried and trusted rules of economics should n't be thrown overboard in a moment of panic . but we should be aware that emergency measures are sometimes needed .
and if i were to break my leg today , i would have to accept that i would have to wear a cast for a while .
but we all know that if you wear a cast for too long , the muscles start to weaken to the point that it could cause lasting damage .
so , like i said , all these emergency measures and regulations should be used very carefully .
they should not be used permanently , and only goal-oriented measures should be used to combat the crisis . an important matter for the eu is always its relations with its eastern neighbors .
should countries such as moldova or ukraine be introduced as members of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty remains a sticking point this will take very , very long , i fear , very long .
but i believe it is in our greatest interests that this prospect stays alive .
it is an engine for reform , real motivation .
whether it concerns the western european states or also these states , this prospect is the strongest motivation to push the necessary reforms . and these reforms are in our greatest interests .
in discussions we forget over and over again that reaching out to these countries is not a charitable activity , exclusively to the advantage of these states , but that we would be pre-empting difficulties we will inevitably have . what role should russia play in this concept ?
is it only a strategic energy supplier or is moscow also a part of this idea of political partnership ? russia is and will remain a world in itself , with which we should search for a healthy , fair relationship .
what does not simplify things is that certain developments in russia , even a return to an authoritarian system , worry us .
we are anxious about certain revisionist statements which are somewhat unsettling . but this changes nothing about the fact that not only as an energy supplier , but also as a security discussion partner in countless elements of policy and international politics , russia is a much-needed partner with whom we should have dialog and lead .
but not under all conditions , this of course is obvious .
we must still protect our own principles .
but dialog with russia is always useful and necessary . interview : christian trippe -lrb- dc / dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 from current holder france .
czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg spoke with dw about his country 's intentions for its eu presidency . deutsche welle : in a few weeks , the czech republic will take over the eu presidency .
what are the goals you 've set for the next six months ? karel schwarzenberg : the goals that we originally set are already known : on the one hand , supporting the development of the eastern " neighborhood ; " secondly , driving forward the integration process in the western balkans ; and thirdly , a europe without barriers .
a liberal europe , a europe that does n't close itself off , but meets all challenges . now , it could be as with several other presidencies , that our presidency will be dependent on other things .
the financial crisis is no longer just on the horizon , it 's being felt full-on in europe .
i 'm afraid that this will absorb a great deal of our presidency and that will be something we 'll really have to deal with .
there are also numerous foreign policy problems that threaten us on the horizon . to put it simply , you can set yourself a lot of goals at the start of a presidency , but life can take you in a different direction .
i do n't think the french presidency would have predicted that their main tasks would involve handling the conflict in the caucasus and the beginning of the economic crisis . i 'd like to come back to these topics individually .
but i 'm also interested in the future of the lisbon reform treaty .
the czech republic is one of two countries that has not approved it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzenberg said the financial crisis will remain a major focus god knows that 's true .
that 's been delayed now , firstly because of the proceedings at the constitutional court , and arguments in parliament .
but i 'm assuming it will happen within the next six weeks . the czech president vaclav klaus is a decided opponent to the reform treaty , and he 's also said the eu presidency is a totally unimportant thing. hhow do you live , how do you work with a president that is so disrespectful toward the european union ? well look , i do n't live with him .
the president knows that i have different opinions to him , and i know that about him .
we 've had almost two years now to get used to this situation .
foreign policy is dictated by the government , not by the president .
you ca n't choose the kind of relationship you have with a head of state , it 's there and you have to live with it . in france , there 's been public speculation about whether the czech republic is even in a position to lead the european union in this very critical time .
did it hurt you to hear what was coming from the french president 's circle ? no , not in the least .
i 'm not that easily hurt .
i 've been through a lot in my life , i 've seen a lot .
we 'll see if such statements are still being made by the end of our presidency .
i 'm well aware that many smaller countries have had to deal with similar sentiments at the start of their presidencies .
i think it 's just part of the political banter that comes with a presidency and i do n't take it that seriously . you yourself once referred to french president nicolas sarkozy with much admiration as the " spirit of restlessness in politics . "
how satisfied are you with the restlessness that france has brought to the eu in its six-month presidency ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy gets kudos for his handling of the financial crisis i think , all in all , we should be very grateful to the french president .
there were single steps , isolated remarks that i was n't particularly thrilled about .
but i think we have to say that the sarkozy 's energetic handling of the crisis in the caucasus is something europe can be very thankful for , as were his efforts to do something about the economic crisis .
we 'll have to see if the measures he took were the right ones .
that 's beyond my economic expertise , but in any case , it was a presidency that took action . the global economic crisis was n't foreseeable when france took over .
you 're inheriting this problem now .
what are your expectations ?
how bad do you think this crisis will get ? i think it 's something we have to take very , very seriously .
that does n't mean - and i would like to emphasize this - that we should start to panic .
given the situation , that would be the worst thing we could do .
the tried and trusted rules of economics should n't be thrown overboard in a moment of panic . but we should be aware that emergency measures are sometimes needed .
and if i were to break my leg today , i would have to accept that i would have to wear a cast for a while .
but we all know that if you wear a cast for too long , the muscles start to weaken to the point that it could cause lasting damage .
so , like i said , all these emergency measures and regulations should be used very carefully .
they should not be used permanently , and only goal-oriented measures should be used to combat the crisis . an important matter for the eu is always its relations with its eastern neighbors .
should countries such as moldova or ukraine be introduced as members of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty remains a sticking point this will take very , very long , i fear , very long .
but i believe it is in our greatest interests that this prospect stays alive .
it is an engine for reform , real motivation .
whether it concerns the western european states or also these states , this prospect is the strongest motivation to push the necessary reforms . and these reforms are in our greatest interests .
in discussions we forget over and over again that reaching out to these countries is not a charitable activity , exclusively to the advantage of these states , but that we would be pre-empting difficulties we will inevitably have . what role should russia play in this concept ?
is it only a strategic energy supplier or is moscow also a part of this idea of political partnership ? russia is and will remain a world in itself , with which we should search for a healthy , fair relationship .
what does not simplify things is that certain developments in russia , even a return to an authoritarian system , worry us .
we are anxious about certain revisionist statements which are somewhat unsettling . but this changes nothing about the fact that not only as an energy supplier , but also as a security discussion partner in countless elements of policy and international politics , russia is a much-needed partner with whom we should have dialog and lead .
but not under all conditions , this of course is obvious .
we must still protect our own principles .
but dialog with russia is always useful and necessary . interview : christian trippe -lrb- dc / dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 16.12.2008 far-right extremists are growing bolder , police official says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far right has a new , confrontational strategy for dealing with police in the wake of a suspected far-right attack on the passau police chief , dw spoke with the head of the german police union about changes in the neo-nazi scene . on saturday , dec .
13 , the 52-year-old police chief in the bavarian german city of passau , alois mannichl , was stabbed when he answered his door at home .
the attack was alleged to be a reprisal from the neo-nazi scene ; mannichl had taken a firm stand against far-right supporters in recent years .
police arrested and then released two suspects .
some are now calling for a ban on germany 's far-right political party , the npd .
deutsche welle spoke to konrad freiberg , the head of the union of german police officers -lrb- gdp -rrb- about what the stabbing represents .
deutsche welle : herr freiberg , you said the attempted murder of the passau police chief represents a strategy change on the part of the extreme right .
why ?
konrad freiberg : in the past the violent right-wing activists were respectful to the police .
that has changed radically .
now , in demonstrations that include the npd , the police are frequently targets of physical attacks by the far right .
they verbally abuse the police as well .
that represents a change .
what do you think accounts for this change ?
there is a strategy debate among the far-right wing .
some insist that political means are the way to achieve power , and they want to create change via parliament or local councils .
but others say the way is violence , there is no other way .
so the anger from this group continues to grow .
how long has this strategic change been going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiberg said one must examine the causes of far-right extremism i 'd have to say for about a year .
we feel it very clearly .
there have been a lot of threats against colleagues who took a stand against the extreme right , or whose job description includes responsibility for this area of security .
there have been threats and attacks on those people in the private sphere .
things have really changed .
the extreme right is not only a problem in germany but in other european countries as well .
has anything similar to the passau attack taken place elsewhere in europe ?
yes , there have been attacks on the police by the extreme right in other european countries .
the right wing is making an effort to build itself up internationally .
at many meetings and demonstrations people come from different countries , especially the netherlands , and also italy .
so there is cooperation .
but we know and must recognize that this attack was a single case , without a doubt , and has no relation to an international plan of any sort .
to what degree is germany 's far-right extremist scene tied to those in other european countries , if indeed that is the case ?
there are international meetings .
and at large national meetings they try , as often as possible , to have some international participation .
at these meetings they all cheer together , saying things like " all europe is turning brown . "
that 's just the way it is .
that 's why we have to watch out that the german extreme right does n't increase its own strength by drawing strength from the international extreme right .
what should germany - and europe - do about this ?
if you talk about fighting right-wing extremism , you have to look at the causes .
why do people get into it ?
on top of that you have to look at the living situation and perspectives of those who are involved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 16.12.2008 far-right extremists are growing bolder , police official says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far right has a new , confrontational strategy for dealing with police in the wake of a suspected far-right attack on the passau police chief , dw spoke with the head of the german police union about changes in the neo-nazi scene . on saturday , dec .
13 , the 52-year-old police chief in the bavarian german city of passau , alois mannichl , was stabbed when he answered his door at home .
the attack was alleged to be a reprisal from the neo-nazi scene ; mannichl had taken a firm stand against far-right supporters in recent years .
police arrested and then released two suspects .
some are now calling for a ban on germany 's far-right political party , the npd .
deutsche welle spoke to konrad freiberg , the head of the union of german police officers -lrb- gdp -rrb- about what the stabbing represents .
deutsche welle : herr freiberg , you said the attempted murder of the passau police chief represents a strategy change on the part of the extreme right .
why ?
konrad freiberg : in the past the violent right-wing activists were respectful to the police .
that has changed radically .
now , in demonstrations that include the npd , the police are frequently targets of physical attacks by the far right .
they verbally abuse the police as well .
that represents a change .
what do you think accounts for this change ?
there is a strategy debate among the far-right wing .
some insist that political means are the way to achieve power , and they want to create change via parliament or local councils .
but others say the way is violence , there is no other way .
so the anger from this group continues to grow .
how long has this strategic change been going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiberg said one must examine the causes of far-right extremism i 'd have to say for about a year .
we feel it very clearly .
there have been a lot of threats against colleagues who took a stand against the extreme right , or whose job description includes responsibility for this area of security .
there have been threats and attacks on those people in the private sphere .
things have really changed .
the extreme right is not only a problem in germany but in other european countries as well .
has anything similar to the passau attack taken place elsewhere in europe ?
yes , there have been attacks on the police by the extreme right in other european countries .
the right wing is making an effort to build itself up internationally .
at many meetings and demonstrations people come from different countries , especially the netherlands , and also italy .
so there is cooperation .
but we know and must recognize that this attack was a single case , without a doubt , and has no relation to an international plan of any sort .
to what degree is germany 's far-right extremist scene tied to those in other european countries , if indeed that is the case ?
there are international meetings .
and at large national meetings they try , as often as possible , to have some international participation .
at these meetings they all cheer together , saying things like " all europe is turning brown . "
that 's just the way it is .
that 's why we have to watch out that the german extreme right does n't increase its own strength by drawing strength from the international extreme right .
what should germany - and europe - do about this ?
if you talk about fighting right-wing extremism , you have to look at the causes .
why do people get into it ?
on top of that you have to look at the living situation and perspectives of those who are involved .
but you also have to look at how the democratic parties , and civil society , deals with these people .

the german capital has become a magnet for the international art scene . as a former gestapo interrogation center in berlin , the sprawling building at number 90-91 zimmerstrasse once played a chilling role in the city 's history .
now , the factory-sized premises near the german capital 's former cold war checkpoint charlie crossing has been renovated and transformed into a home for a cluster of major art galleries in the city . on the building 's top floor , in high-ceilinged , voluminous rooms , is the recently opened nature morte gallery , where fans of contemporary indian art indulge themselves .
new delhi-born artist dayanita singh is currently showing a series of photographic shots depicting marginalized indian communities . nature morte is the second gallery in berlin dedicated to contemporary indian art .
the bodhi gallery , located behind one of the city 's major art museums , the hamburger bahnhof , was the first , opening in may .
since then , it has been busy mounting exhibitions aimed at winning new audiences for the new wave of indian art that has been sweeping the global art market . nature morte , on the other hand , was originally part of new york 's east village art scene in the 1980s before re-establishing itself in new delhi in 1997 . singh 's work sets standards the gallery 's berlin director julie engelmeier first studied politics and economics in paris , london and new york before getting involved in the art world .
she said she 's excited about nature morte 's debut indian art exhibition , featuring singh 's work in three distinct sections .
the exhibition runs through to jan .
3 . one section highlights images shot within the anandamayi ashram in the northern indian city of varanasi -lrb- benares -rrb- .
from portraits of girls sequestered within this environment emerges a study of the tensions found in india today including the role of women . another section zeroes in on activities at a site in the western indian state of gujarat where mentally and physically ill patients go in the hope of a cure .
formerly suffering from epilepsy , singh was originally drawn to the site . bildunterschrift : the nature morte gallery focuses on indian art engelmeier is an enthusiastic fan of singh 's searching brand of photography . " she is a highly profiled , super-serious indian photographer , who is also a very funny and warm person , " engelmeier said .
" i 'm happy to have opened with her work because it sets a great standard for the gallery . " an affinity for india as to her own background , the munich-born engelmeier told german news agency dpa in an interview , " i was working for a consultancy firm for a spell , but then took a year out to re-orientate myself . " " i had this affinity with india and made visits there whenever i could , " engelmeier said .
" my brother also lived in new delhi , so there was this big connection and it was there that i started my work in the art world . " in india , engelmeier met new delhi-based american art entrepreneur peter nagy , at a moment when he was toying with the idea of opening a gallery in europe , preferably in berlin . " that 's how everything fell into place for me , " engelmeier said . engelmeier , 28 , is fascinated by berlin 's thriving art world activity . " the city now has as many art galleries as manhattan , " she said .
" there may not be a lot of industry or many big art buyers here , but there are lots of artists from all parts of the world .
they like its free-wheeling , liberal atmosphere , its many cafes and pubs and its vibrant cultural life . " all the big german art fairs now take place in berlin , whereas previously the art hot spot was cologne , " engelmeier said . a magnet for berlin as for art entrepreneur nagy , he 's confident his latest berlin venture will be welcomed by collectors . nature morte was the first indian gallery to participate at the world 's most prestigious art fairs . " in that sense we have a special edge in terms of brand recognition with the international art world , " nagy told the art newspaper recently .
" we think people will want to travel to berlin to see what we are doing . " in the years following the fall of the berlin wall , numerous galleries emerged along just one street in center of what was the city 's former communist half . now it has spread to other parts of the city , including the area around the old checkpoint charlie crossing point , with a flood of galleries having opened up in recent years near where the berlin wall marked out the city 's post-second world war divide . " gallerists move here because there are large spaces available at much cheaper prices , " engelmeier said . dpa news agency -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ultimately , though , it got off easy , says dw 's karl zawadzky . considering the extent of the corruption affair , siemens is getting off relatively unscathed .
after all , bribery appears to have been an everyday occurrence for the international group when it came to getting contracts .
and nothing changed when laws were passed in germany - as in other industrial nations - that clearly forbid bribery , and the company 's shares began trading on the new york stock exchange .
in an unrivalled review , a legion of lawyers and accountants examined each and every siemens document .
for the time period between 1999 and 2006 , bribes on the order of 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- were uncovered .
it turns out that siemens workers and representatives around the globe had felt free to use money from secret accounts if it seemed useful for garnering contracts .
given the dimensions of the situation , siemens is getting off more lightly with its fine than most people would have expected .
especially when it comes to the settlement it agreed to with the us ministry of justice and the securities watchdog , the sec .
lesson learned , moving on siemens will pay 620 million euros to the us .
it could have been much worse .
and it would have been , if siemens had been blocked from competing for public contracts in the us for a period of many years .
the intense inspection of its books no doubt made an impression .
moreover , managers throughout the firm have been let go .
siemens learned its lesson .
it can now hope that its us unit will profit from the enormous infrastructure program planned by us president elect barack obama .
in order not to fall back into old , corrupt habits , ex-german finance minister theo waigel - today a lawyer in munich - has been named " compliance monitor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky in the us , such monitoring is a common component of a criminal proceedings settlements .
in germany , the munich prosecutor 's office imposed a fine of 395 million euros , which siemens accepted .
that - along with the payment to the us and setting up the monitoring system that theo waigel will oversee - is the end of the state 's lawsuit against siemens over the bribery of public officials .
siemens can survive the financial hit .
even without corruption , the company 's business is strong - and in its year-end accounts , siemens thought to lay aside a billion euros to pay off fines .
but that 's not the end of the story .
the state prosecutor 's office still has open legal proceedings against specific former company directors , including longtime ceo and supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , on grounds they breached oversight rules .
siemens is suing former executives on top of that , siemens itself is suing former executives for millions in compensatory damages , on the grounds that the board of directors failed to institute internal controls that would prevent a regular culture of bribery - either that , or they intentionally looked the other way .
and there 's another reason the affair is not yet over : clients around the globe are preparing suits for damages because they think the bribery costs increased the prices they paid for goods or services .
moreover , countries want to know which of their officials took bribes from siemens .
even though the big lawsuits in germany and the us ended with settlements and fines , siemens will be processing one of the darkest chapters in its more-than-100-year-old corporate history for years to come .
on top of this , the damage to company 's reputation has been great , and no amount of money can ever fix it the case of siemens turns out to be a perfect example of the adage : corruption does n't pay .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 16.12.2008 opinion : siemens got off lightly , but there 's more to come großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the biggest bribery scandal in german business history , siemens had to pay fines amounting to nearly a billion euros .
ultimately , though , it got off easy , says dw 's karl zawadzky . considering the extent of the corruption affair , siemens is getting off relatively unscathed .
after all , bribery appears to have been an everyday occurrence for the international group when it came to getting contracts .
and nothing changed when laws were passed in germany - as in other industrial nations - that clearly forbid bribery , and the company 's shares began trading on the new york stock exchange .
in an unrivalled review , a legion of lawyers and accountants examined each and every siemens document .
for the time period between 1999 and 2006 , bribes on the order of 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- were uncovered .
it turns out that siemens workers and representatives around the globe had felt free to use money from secret accounts if it seemed useful for garnering contracts .
given the dimensions of the situation , siemens is getting off more lightly with its fine than most people would have expected .
especially when it comes to the settlement it agreed to with the us ministry of justice and the securities watchdog , the sec .
lesson learned , moving on siemens will pay 620 million euros to the us .
it could have been much worse .
and it would have been , if siemens had been blocked from competing for public contracts in the us for a period of many years .
the intense inspection of its books no doubt made an impression .
moreover , managers throughout the firm have been let go .
siemens learned its lesson .
it can now hope that its us unit will profit from the enormous infrastructure program planned by us president elect barack obama .
in order not to fall back into old , corrupt habits , ex-german finance minister theo waigel - today a lawyer in munich - has been named " compliance monitor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky in the us , such monitoring is a common component of a criminal proceedings settlements .
in germany , the munich prosecutor 's office imposed a fine of 395 million euros , which siemens accepted .
that - along with the payment to the us and setting up the monitoring system that theo waigel will oversee - is the end of the state 's lawsuit against siemens over the bribery of public officials .
siemens can survive the financial hit .
even without corruption , the company 's business is strong - and in its year-end accounts , siemens thought to lay aside a billion euros to pay off fines .
but that 's not the end of the story .
the state prosecutor 's office still has open legal proceedings against specific former company directors , including longtime ceo and supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , on grounds they breached oversight rules .
siemens is suing former executives on top of that , siemens itself is suing former executives for millions in compensatory damages , on the grounds that the board of directors failed to institute internal controls that would prevent a regular culture of bribery - either that , or they intentionally looked the other way .
and there 's another reason the affair is not yet over : clients around the globe are preparing suits for damages because they think the bribery costs increased the prices they paid for goods or services .
moreover , countries want to know which of their officials took bribes from siemens .
even though the big lawsuits in germany and the us ended with settlements and fines , siemens will be processing one of the darkest chapters in its more-than-100-year-old corporate history for years to come .
on top of this , the damage to company 's reputation has been great , and no amount of money can ever fix it the case of siemens turns out to be a perfect example of the adage : corruption does n't pay .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.12.2008 sarkozy bids european parliament farewell großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy , right addresses the european parliament in a speech to the european parliament , france 's president looked back on his country 's six-month term heading the eu .
meps debated with the leader on topics including georgia , the financial crisis and climate change . france 's president nicolas sarkozy said his country had aimed to organize its six-month presidency on the basis of two convictions . " the world needs a strong europe and that europe can not be strong if it is not united , " sarkozy told the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday , dec .
16 .
a strong europe was one that " rejects consensus based on pushing problems to one side , " he said . sarkozy said france 's presidency had been forced to follow " the rhythm of international events , " among them the russia-georgia conflict in august and the worldwide financial crisis in september .
though he had tried to change europe in this time , europe had in fact changed him , he said . " i really think that each head of state or government would benefit at some time from this responsibility , " sarkozy said .
" they would understand that whatever differences we have , there are so many things that bring us together .
when one has the chance over six months to learn about and to solve the problems of 27 nations , one gains tolerance , an opening of the spirit and one understands europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz said the french presidency had been " quite good " overall most meps applauded france on its term .
even the socialist leader in the european parliament , martin schulz , an outspoken critic of sarkozy 's , called the french eu presidency a success . " if the next presidency does the same i would be happy , " said schulz .
he said the french leader had " come out of the closet , as a pro-european . " the czech republic will take over the eu 's rotating presidency on january 1 , 2009 . heated debate on climate change sarkozy defended the eu 's climate change deal , which the bloc agreed on last week .
he told the parliament that there had been " an enormous fight " about climate change and energy as each member state had had " reason for dissatisfaction . "
he said compromises that had been agreed by leaders would avoid imposing unbearable sacrifices on its citizens . " we did n't want to impose constrictions which no country in the world could have survived socially , " sarkozy said . the president of the european commission jose manuel barroso said the climate change initiatives made europe the first to accept legally binding rules by 2020 . " and we will be strengthening these limits as agreement is reached globally , " barroso said .
" we can now turn to our friends in america and say to them : yes , you can ! " the conservative leader joseph daul said the climate change agreement would protect both the environment and jobs .
he said the eu now had to lead the worldwide fight against climate change , press the worst polluters to act and seek tangible commitments from us president barack obama once he took office . but daniel cohn-bendit from the greens called the swift adoption of the climate change package " blackmail . " european lawmakers will be voting on the climate change package on wednesday .
the parliament 's main political groups have already announced that they will be supporting the deal . alleviating the financial crisis most meps applauded france 's rapid reaction to the economic and financial crises .
socialist leader schulz said the presidency " did well " on the financial crisis .
sarkozy had reacted - albeit " somewhat late " - to the time-bomb of social imbalances in europe , schulz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most politicians applauded france 's presidency sarkozy said unity had been crucial in the global financial crisis .
if europe 's countries and institutions had not taken responsibility , this would have led to " the destruction of the european banking system , " he said . " we in europe want entrepreneurial capitalism not speculative capitalism , " sarkozy said .
" we have said this with one voice .
our economies and our political cultures are not the same , but we all agreed in the end . " conservative leader daul said the french presidency 's efforts had helped to win worldwide respect for europe 's coordinated response to the financial crisis . the presidency 's actions had brought about coordinated protection for savers ' deposits and recapitalization for banks , he said .
this had prevented a chain reaction in which thousands of jobs could have been lost , daul said . europe is not the enemy of the nations many parliamentary group leaders welcomed sarkozy 's and the french government 's swift and successful reaction to events in georgia .
sarkozy said his main aim during the georgian crisis had been " to stop the war and not fall into the same trap as in bosnia , " where the united states had taken the lead and europe followed . it had been a " real obsession " of france 's presidency that europe should " take responsibility " over georgia and fortunately europe had remained united over the issue , he said . sarkozy said in his conclusion that europe required an understanding between different nations .
he said that he was not an integrationist , but that he was determined to preserve the nation state . " however european you are , europe is not the enemy of the nations and the nations are not the enemy of europe , " sarkozy said .
" it is easier for europe to have big ambitions than small ones , because only big projects have the power to overcome national egos . " dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , " it will also be right to put together a second program in germany at a similar time , " she added .
merkel remains under pressure from other european countries to move quickly with cut taxes or vouchers to encourage spending .
merkel continues to oppose such plans , even though they are being undertaken elsewhere in europe .
paving the road to recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some want merkel to put more money in consumers ' hands instead , merkel favors tackling a backlog of road projects to stimulating the economy , she said in a speech tuesday to the center for european economic research , a think tank in mannheim , germany .
she called on germany 's states to send in their project lists as soon as possible , wanting to get going by the early spring .
most of the states have a backlog of detailed engineering proposals for projects that have been waiting for federal funding .
quoting government sources , press reports have said berlin is preparing to invest 20 billion to 30 billion euros in a fresh economic stimulus plan that will include public investment and consumer incentives , according to afp news agency .
" we will take action again in january - another few billion could come together , " merkel was quoted as saying by the dow jones newswires .
merkel said the fresh investment could go toward infrastructure improvements including roads , broadband communications networks and renovation of schools , as well as subsidies for temporary jobs .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists are predicting that 2009 will be a rough year for germany a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said on tuesday that the government fears the german economy could contract by 3.0 percent or more next year , marking the worst recession in german post-war history .
the bdb commercial banks ' association backed up this assessment , predicting that germany will suffer its deepest recession since world war two next year .
as long as the bad news about germany 's economy continues , it 's unlikely that european allies such as france will let up pressure on merkel to do more and do it quickly .
yet with national elections scheduled for next fall , merkel is taking a cautious approach .
that has lead to criticism from those in her party who want to see the government do more .
economy minister michael glos emphasized that the government still has the scope to increase its economic stimulus package if necessary .
glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has repeatedly argued in favor of cutting taxes .
a poll done for germany 's stern magazine and rtl television showed that support for merkel and her party continues to drop due to concerns over the financial crisis . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , the 52-year-old police chief in the bavarian german city of passau , alois mannichl , was stabbed when he answered his door at home .
the attack was alleged to be a reprisal from the neo-nazi scene ; mannichl had taken a firm stand against far-right supporters in recent years .
police arrested and then released two suspects .
some are now calling for a ban on germany 's far-right political party , the npd .
deutsche welle spoke to konrad freiberg , the head of the union of german police officers -lrb- gdp -rrb- about what the stabbing represents .
deutsche welle : herr freiberg , you said the attempted murder of the passau police chief represents a strategy change on the part of the extreme right .
why ?
konrad freiberg : in the past the violent right-wing activists were respectful to the police .
that has changed radically .
now , in demonstrations that include the npd , the police are frequently targets of physical attacks by the far right .
they verbally abuse the police as well .
that represents a change .
what do you think accounts for this change ?
there is a strategy debate among the far-right wing .
some insist that political means are the way to achieve power , and they want to create change via parliament or local councils .
but others say the way is violence , there is no other way .
so the anger from this group continues to grow .
how long has this strategic change been going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiberg said one must examine the causes of far-right extremism i 'd have to say for about a year .
we feel it very clearly .
there have been a lot of threats against colleagues who took a stand against the extreme right , or whose job description includes responsibility for this area of security .
there have been threats and attacks on those people in the private sphere .
things have really changed .
the extreme right is not only a problem in germany but in other european countries as well .
has anything similar to the passau attack taken place elsewhere in europe ?
yes , there have been attacks on the police by the extreme right in other european countries .
the right wing is making an effort to build itself up internationally .
at many meetings and demonstrations people come from different countries , especially the netherlands , and also italy .
so there is cooperation .
but we know and must recognize that this attack was a single case , without a doubt , and has no relation to an international plan of any sort .
to what degree is germany 's far-right extremist scene tied to those in other european countries , if indeed that is the case ?
there are international meetings .
and at large national meetings they try , as often as possible , to have some international participation .
at these meetings they all cheer together , saying things like " all europe is turning brown . "
that 's just the way it is .
that 's why we have to watch out that the german extreme right does n't increase its own strength by drawing strength from the international extreme right .
what should germany - and europe - do about this ?
if you talk about fighting right-wing extremism , you have to look at the causes .
why do people get into it ?
on top of that you have to look at the living situation and perspectives of those who are involved .
but you also have to look at how the democratic parties , and civil society , deals with these people .
we ca n't only count on the police and justice system to fight them , because they ca n't solve the problem alone . interview : esther broders -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , the 52-year-old police chief in the bavarian german city of passau , alois mannichl , was stabbed when he answered his door at home .
the attack was alleged to be a reprisal from the neo-nazi scene ; mannichl had taken a firm stand against far-right supporters in recent years .
police arrested and then released two suspects .
some are now calling for a ban on germany 's far-right political party , the npd .
deutsche welle spoke to konrad freiberg , the head of the union of german police officers -lrb- gdp -rrb- about what the stabbing represents .
deutsche welle : herr freiberg , you said the attempted murder of the passau police chief represents a strategy change on the part of the extreme right .
why ?
konrad freiberg : in the past the violent right-wing activists were respectful to the police .
that has changed radically .
now , in demonstrations that include the npd , the police are frequently targets of physical attacks by the far right .
they verbally abuse the police as well .
that represents a change .
what do you think accounts for this change ?
there is a strategy debate among the far-right wing .
some insist that political means are the way to achieve power , and they want to create change via parliament or local councils .
but others say the way is violence , there is no other way .
so the anger from this group continues to grow .
how long has this strategic change been going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiberg said one must examine the causes of far-right extremism i 'd have to say for about a year .
we feel it very clearly .
there have been a lot of threats against colleagues who took a stand against the extreme right , or whose job description includes responsibility for this area of security .
there have been threats and attacks on those people in the private sphere .
things have really changed .
the extreme right is not only a problem in germany but in other european countries as well .
has anything similar to the passau attack taken place elsewhere in europe ?
yes , there have been attacks on the police by the extreme right in other european countries .
the right wing is making an effort to build itself up internationally .
at many meetings and demonstrations people come from different countries , especially the netherlands , and also italy .
so there is cooperation .
but we know and must recognize that this attack was a single case , without a doubt , and has no relation to an international plan of any sort .
to what degree is germany 's far-right extremist scene tied to those in other european countries , if indeed that is the case ?
there are international meetings .
and at large national meetings they try , as often as possible , to have some international participation .
at these meetings they all cheer together , saying things like " all europe is turning brown . "
that 's just the way it is .
that 's why we have to watch out that the german extreme right does n't increase its own strength by drawing strength from the international extreme right .
what should germany - and europe - do about this ?
if you talk about fighting right-wing extremism , you have to look at the causes .
why do people get into it ?
on top of that you have to look at the living situation and perspectives of those who are involved .
but you also have to look at how the democratic parties , and civil society , deals with these people .
we ca n't only count on the police and justice system to fight them , because they ca n't solve the problem alone . interview : esther broders -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german capital has become a magnet for the international art scene . as a former gestapo interrogation center in berlin , the sprawling building at number 90-91 zimmerstrasse once played a chilling role in the city 's history .
now , the factory-sized premises near the german capital 's former cold war checkpoint charlie crossing has been renovated and transformed into a home for a cluster of major art galleries in the city . on the building 's top floor , in high-ceilinged , voluminous rooms , is the recently opened nature morte gallery , where fans of contemporary indian art indulge themselves .
new delhi-born artist dayanita singh is currently showing a series of photographic shots depicting marginalized indian communities . nature morte is the second gallery in berlin dedicated to contemporary indian art .
the bodhi gallery , located behind one of the city 's major art museums , the hamburger bahnhof , was the first , opening in may .
since then , it has been busy mounting exhibitions aimed at winning new audiences for the new wave of indian art that has been sweeping the global art market . nature morte , on the other hand , was originally part of new york 's east village art scene in the 1980s before re-establishing itself in new delhi in 1997 . singh 's work sets standards the gallery 's berlin director julie engelmeier first studied politics and economics in paris , london and new york before getting involved in the art world .

" she is a highly profiled , super-serious indian photographer , who is also a very funny and warm person , " engelmeier said .

acea said there had n't been such a notable decline since 1999 . germany , europe 's largest automobile market , saw registrations down 17.7 percent to 233,722 units .
all markets across the continent decreased except finland , poland and the czech republic .

" what we are demanding from the state is some reasonable financing , over two to three years , at interest rates between four and five percent , " ghosn said . two out of every three cars was purchased on credit , he said . " if the finance crisis continues , you will see one producer after the other fail , " ghosn said . both renault and peugeot citroen have shut some of their factories to cut production as demand for cars in europe has plunged . acea figures for november showed the registration of new private cars in france down by more than 14 percent .
but , according to ghosn , the worst of the crisis still lies ahead . " we have n't touched bottom yet , " ghosn said . cars backlogged in germany the dramatic situation in the automobile industry has led to an excess of unsold cars at europe 's biggest car terminal in bremerhaven .

while unsold cars block germany 's biggest car terminal , france 's president promises help for his country 's auto makers . european consumers are continuing to buy fewer cars , according to the european automobile manufacturers ' association acea . " new passenger car registrations in europe fell by 25.8 percent in november compared to the same month of last year , declining for the seventh month in a row , mirroring the financial and economic crises , " the acea said in a statement on tuesday , dec .
16 . november new registrations totaled 932,537 cars , a decrease from over 1.2 million in november 2007 .
acea said there had n't been such a notable decline since 1999 . germany , europe 's largest automobile market , saw registrations down 17.7 percent to 233,722 units .
all markets across the continent decreased except finland , poland and the czech republic . " the new eu member states long showed more resilience , in relative terms , because of the greater number of first-time buyers as opposed to the replacement market of western europe , " acea said . sarkozy pledges help the french government has said it will take action to save the country 's automobile industry .
president nicolas sarkozy on monday , dec .
15 , told leaders from the french car industry that he was prepared to provide additional aid to the struggling sector in the form of government loans and guarantees , his office said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is intent on helping france 's car industry however , he made all government aid to the industry subject to agreement from france 's fellow eu members and the european commission . but sarkozy said carmakers and their suppliers would have to commit to preserving sites in france .
aid was dependent on " the renunciation of any policy of deliberately encouraging the outsourcing " of production , he said . it was " incompatible with the closing of assembly factories in france , " sarkozy said . sarkozy 's office said that senior executives from the two largest french carmakers , renault and peugeot citroen , as well as representatives of the auto-equipment suppliers michelin and valeo took part in the meeting . the worst is yet to come in an interview published monday in the french daily le figaro , renault chief executive carlos ghosn said emergency government loans were necessary for the french car industry to survive the economic crisis . " what we are demanding from the state is some reasonable financing , over two to three years , at interest rates between four and five percent , " ghosn said . two out of every three cars was purchased on credit , he said . " if the finance crisis continues , you will see one producer after the other fail , " ghosn said . both renault and peugeot citroen have shut some of their factories to cut production as demand for cars in europe has plunged . acea figures for november showed the registration of new private cars in france down by more than 14 percent .
but , according to ghosn , the worst of the crisis still lies ahead . " we have n't touched bottom yet , " ghosn said . cars backlogged in germany the dramatic situation in the automobile industry has led to an excess of unsold cars at europe 's biggest car terminal in bremerhaven .
more than 90,000 vehicles are clogging the shipping terminal in the northern german port of bremerhaven , waiting to find new owners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of cars are waiting to be picked up in bremerhaven " we ca n't move the cars , work on them or deliver them until they find buyers , " said detthold aden , head of the blg logistics group , which operates the facility . roll-on roll-off vessels are delivering new cars that nobody wants .
instead of setting a turnover record , the terminal is rapidly becoming one of the world 's largest parking lots . when cars roll off ships like the " danube highway " or " morning champion " they come to a halt after just a few meters because there is no room for them on land .
blg has been forced to find extra space in the area of the port normally reserved for shipping containers .
other cars are temporarily stored on freight trains . ships normally jam-packed with vehicles destined for the united states are now leaving almost empty because of the dramatic downturn on the us car market . the speed of the meltdown caught bremerhaven by surprise .

the abductors are holding three germans hostage in a remote area east of the capital , sana 'a .
security forces have closed in on their hideout , police said .
five tribesmen led by abdu-rabu saleh al-tam were holding the hostages in a house in the mountain village of naba 'ah in the khawlan district , about 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- from sana 'a .
prisoner release demanded " security forces cordoned off the house and closed all roads leading to the village , " an interior ministry official told dpa news agency .
" this is intended to prevent the kidnappers from changing their hideout or moving the hostages to another area , " the official said .
he said the kidnappers demanded the release of al-tam 's son and brother who have been jailed at the central prison in sana 'a for abducting five yemeni engineers and holding them hostage for six months last year .
al-tam also demanded authorities pay him 40 million riyals -lrb- $ 200,000 or 147,000 euros -rrb- in compensation for a property in sana 'a , the ownership of which he disputed with an influential businessman , the official said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.12.2008 sarkozy bids european parliament farewell großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy , right addresses the european parliament in a speech to the european parliament , france 's president looked back on his country 's six-month term heading the eu .
meps debated with the leader on topics including georgia , the financial crisis and climate change . france 's president nicolas sarkozy said his country had aimed to organize its six-month presidency on the basis of two convictions . " the world needs a strong europe and that europe can not be strong if it is not united , " sarkozy told the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday , dec .
16 .
a strong europe was one that " rejects consensus based on pushing problems to one side , " he said . sarkozy said france 's presidency had been forced to follow " the rhythm of international events , " among them the russia-georgia conflict in august and the worldwide financial crisis in september .
though he had tried to change europe in this time , europe had in fact changed him , he said . " i really think that each head of state or government would benefit at some time from this responsibility , " sarkozy said .
" they would understand that whatever differences we have , there are so many things that bring us together .
when one has the chance over six months to learn about and to solve the problems of 27 nations , one gains tolerance , an opening of the spirit and one understands europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz said the french presidency had been " quite good " overall most meps applauded france on its term .
even the socialist leader in the european parliament , martin schulz , an outspoken critic of sarkozy 's , called the french eu presidency a success . " if the next presidency does the same i would be happy , " said schulz .
he said the french leader had " come out of the closet , as a pro-european . " the czech republic will take over the eu 's rotating presidency on january 1 , 2009 . heated debate on climate change sarkozy defended the eu 's climate change deal , which the bloc agreed on last week .
he told the parliament that there had been " an enormous fight " about climate change and energy as each member state had had " reason for dissatisfaction . "
he said compromises that had been agreed by leaders would avoid imposing unbearable sacrifices on its citizens . " we did n't want to impose constrictions which no country in the world could have survived socially , " sarkozy said . the president of the european commission jose manuel barroso said the climate change initiatives made europe the first to accept legally binding rules by 2020 . " and we will be strengthening these limits as agreement is reached globally , " barroso said .
" we can now turn to our friends in america and say to them : yes , you can ! " the conservative leader joseph daul said the climate change agreement would protect both the environment and jobs .
he said the eu now had to lead the worldwide fight against climate change , press the worst polluters to act and seek tangible commitments from us president barack obama once he took office . but daniel cohn-bendit from the greens called the swift adoption of the climate change package " blackmail . " european lawmakers will be voting on the climate change package on wednesday .
the parliament 's main political groups have already announced that they will be supporting the deal . alleviating the financial crisis most meps applauded france 's rapid reaction to the economic and financial crises .
socialist leader schulz said the presidency " did well " on the financial crisis .
sarkozy had reacted - albeit " somewhat late " - to the time-bomb of social imbalances in europe , schulz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most politicians applauded france 's presidency sarkozy said unity had been crucial in the global financial crisis .
if europe 's countries and institutions had not taken responsibility , this would have led to " the destruction of the european banking system , " he said . " we in europe want entrepreneurial capitalism not speculative capitalism , " sarkozy said .
" we have said this with one voice .
our economies and our political cultures are not the same , but we all agreed in the end . " conservative leader daul said the french presidency 's efforts had helped to win worldwide respect for europe 's coordinated response to the financial crisis . the presidency 's actions had brought about coordinated protection for savers ' deposits and recapitalization for banks , he said .
this had prevented a chain reaction in which thousands of jobs could have been lost , daul said . europe is not the enemy of the nations many parliamentary group leaders welcomed sarkozy 's and the french government 's swift and successful reaction to events in georgia .
sarkozy said his main aim during the georgian crisis had been " to stop the war and not fall into the same trap as in bosnia , " where the united states had taken the lead and europe followed . it had been a " real obsession " of france 's presidency that europe should " take responsibility " over georgia and fortunately europe had remained united over the issue , he said . sarkozy said in his conclusion that europe required an understanding between different nations .
he said that he was not an integrationist , but that he was determined to preserve the nation state . " however european you are , europe is not the enemy of the nations and the nations are not the enemy of europe , " sarkozy said .
" it is easier for europe to have big ambitions than small ones , because only big projects have the power to overcome national egos . " dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.12.2008 sarkozy bids european parliament farewell großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy , right addresses the european parliament in a speech to the european parliament , france 's president looked back on his country 's six-month term heading the eu .
meps debated with the leader on topics including georgia , the financial crisis and climate change . france 's president nicolas sarkozy said his country had aimed to organize its six-month presidency on the basis of two convictions . " the world needs a strong europe and that europe can not be strong if it is not united , " sarkozy told the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday , dec .
16 .
a strong europe was one that " rejects consensus based on pushing problems to one side , " he said . sarkozy said france 's presidency had been forced to follow " the rhythm of international events , " among them the russia-georgia conflict in august and the worldwide financial crisis in september .
though he had tried to change europe in this time , europe had in fact changed him , he said . " i really think that each head of state or government would benefit at some time from this responsibility , " sarkozy said .
" they would understand that whatever differences we have , there are so many things that bring us together .
when one has the chance over six months to learn about and to solve the problems of 27 nations , one gains tolerance , an opening of the spirit and one understands europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz said the french presidency had been " quite good " overall most meps applauded france on its term .
even the socialist leader in the european parliament , martin schulz , an outspoken critic of sarkozy 's , called the french eu presidency a success . " if the next presidency does the same i would be happy , " said schulz .
he said the french leader had " come out of the closet , as a pro-european . " the czech republic will take over the eu 's rotating presidency on january 1 , 2009 . heated debate on climate change sarkozy defended the eu 's climate change deal , which the bloc agreed on last week .
he told the parliament that there had been " an enormous fight " about climate change and energy as each member state had had " reason for dissatisfaction . "
he said compromises that had been agreed by leaders would avoid imposing unbearable sacrifices on its citizens . " we did n't want to impose constrictions which no country in the world could have survived socially , " sarkozy said . the president of the european commission jose manuel barroso said the climate change initiatives made europe the first to accept legally binding rules by 2020 . " and we will be strengthening these limits as agreement is reached globally , " barroso said .
" we can now turn to our friends in america and say to them : yes , you can ! " the conservative leader joseph daul said the climate change agreement would protect both the environment and jobs .
he said the eu now had to lead the worldwide fight against climate change , press the worst polluters to act and seek tangible commitments from us president barack obama once he took office . but daniel cohn-bendit from the greens called the swift adoption of the climate change package " blackmail . " european lawmakers will be voting on the climate change package on wednesday .
the parliament 's main political groups have already announced that they will be supporting the deal . alleviating the financial crisis most meps applauded france 's rapid reaction to the economic and financial crises .
socialist leader schulz said the presidency " did well " on the financial crisis .
sarkozy had reacted - albeit " somewhat late " - to the time-bomb of social imbalances in europe , schulz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most politicians applauded france 's presidency sarkozy said unity had been crucial in the global financial crisis .
if europe 's countries and institutions had not taken responsibility , this would have led to " the destruction of the european banking system , " he said . " we in europe want entrepreneurial capitalism not speculative capitalism , " sarkozy said .
" we have said this with one voice .
our economies and our political cultures are not the same , but we all agreed in the end . " conservative leader daul said the french presidency 's efforts had helped to win worldwide respect for europe 's coordinated response to the financial crisis . the presidency 's actions had brought about coordinated protection for savers ' deposits and recapitalization for banks , he said .
this had prevented a chain reaction in which thousands of jobs could have been lost , daul said . europe is not the enemy of the nations many parliamentary group leaders welcomed sarkozy 's and the french government 's swift and successful reaction to events in georgia .
sarkozy said his main aim during the georgian crisis had been " to stop the war and not fall into the same trap as in bosnia , " where the united states had taken the lead and europe followed . it had been a " real obsession " of france 's presidency that europe should " take responsibility " over georgia and fortunately europe had remained united over the issue , he said . sarkozy said in his conclusion that europe required an understanding between different nations .
he said that he was not an integrationist , but that he was determined to preserve the nation state . " however european you are , europe is not the enemy of the nations and the nations are not the enemy of europe , " sarkozy said .
" it is easier for europe to have big ambitions than small ones , because only big projects have the power to overcome national egos . " dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ultimately , though , it got off easy , says dw 's karl zawadzky . considering the extent of the corruption affair , siemens is getting off relatively unscathed .

while unsold cars block germany 's biggest car terminal , france 's president promises help for his country 's auto makers . european consumers are continuing to buy fewer cars , according to the european automobile manufacturers ' association acea . " new passenger car registrations in europe fell by 25.8 percent in november compared to the same month of last year , declining for the seventh month in a row , mirroring the financial and economic crises , " the acea said in a statement on tuesday , dec .
16 . november new registrations totaled 932,537 cars , a decrease from over 1.2 million in november 2007 .
acea said there had n't been such a notable decline since 1999 . germany , europe 's largest automobile market , saw registrations down 17.7 percent to 233,722 units .
all markets across the continent decreased except finland , poland and the czech republic . " the new eu member states long showed more resilience , in relative terms , because of the greater number of first-time buyers as opposed to the replacement market of western europe , " acea said . sarkozy pledges help the french government has said it will take action to save the country 's automobile industry .
president nicolas sarkozy on monday , dec .
15 , told leaders from the french car industry that he was prepared to provide additional aid to the struggling sector in the form of government loans and guarantees , his office said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is intent on helping france 's car industry however , he made all government aid to the industry subject to agreement from france 's fellow eu members and the european commission . but sarkozy said carmakers and their suppliers would have to commit to preserving sites in france .
aid was dependent on " the renunciation of any policy of deliberately encouraging the outsourcing " of production , he said . it was " incompatible with the closing of assembly factories in france , " sarkozy said . sarkozy 's office said that senior executives from the two largest french carmakers , renault and peugeot citroen , as well as representatives of the auto-equipment suppliers michelin and valeo took part in the meeting . the worst is yet to come in an interview published monday in the french daily le figaro , renault chief executive carlos ghosn said emergency government loans were necessary for the french car industry to survive the economic crisis . " what we are demanding from the state is some reasonable financing , over two to three years , at interest rates between four and five percent , " ghosn said . two out of every three cars was purchased on credit , he said . " if the finance crisis continues , you will see one producer after the other fail , " ghosn said . both renault and peugeot citroen have shut some of their factories to cut production as demand for cars in europe has plunged . acea figures for november showed the registration of new private cars in france down by more than 14 percent .
but , according to ghosn , the worst of the crisis still lies ahead . " we have n't touched bottom yet , " ghosn said . cars backlogged in germany the dramatic situation in the automobile industry has led to an excess of unsold cars at europe 's biggest car terminal in bremerhaven .
more than 90,000 vehicles are clogging the shipping terminal in the northern german port of bremerhaven , waiting to find new owners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of cars are waiting to be picked up in bremerhaven " we ca n't move the cars , work on them or deliver them until they find buyers , " said detthold aden , head of the blg logistics group , which operates the facility . roll-on roll-off vessels are delivering new cars that nobody wants .
instead of setting a turnover record , the terminal is rapidly becoming one of the world 's largest parking lots . when cars roll off ships like the " danube highway " or " morning champion " they come to a halt after just a few meters because there is no room for them on land .
blg has been forced to find extra space in the area of the port normally reserved for shipping containers .
other cars are temporarily stored on freight trains . ships normally jam-packed with vehicles destined for the united states are now leaving almost empty because of the dramatic downturn on the us car market . the speed of the meltdown caught bremerhaven by surprise .
when automobile manufactures published details of their shrinking sales , many of the cars now languishing in the port were already on their way to germany . " it 's a difficult situation , because many imported cars and those destined for export are still on their way here , " said aden . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ultimately , though , it got off easy , says dw 's karl zawadzky . considering the extent of the corruption affair , siemens is getting off relatively unscathed .
after all , bribery appears to have been an everyday occurrence for the international group when it came to getting contracts .
and nothing changed when laws were passed in germany - as in other industrial nations - that clearly forbid bribery , and the company 's shares began trading on the new york stock exchange .
in an unrivalled review , a legion of lawyers and accountants examined each and every siemens document .
for the time period between 1999 and 2006 , bribes on the order of 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- were uncovered .
it turns out that siemens workers and representatives around the globe had felt free to use money from secret accounts if it seemed useful for garnering contracts .
given the dimensions of the situation , siemens is getting off more lightly with its fine than most people would have expected .
especially when it comes to the settlement it agreed to with the us ministry of justice and the securities watchdog , the sec .
lesson learned , moving on siemens will pay 620 million euros to the us .
it could have been much worse .
and it would have been , if siemens had been blocked from competing for public contracts in the us for a period of many years .
the intense inspection of its books no doubt made an impression .
moreover , managers throughout the firm have been let go .
siemens learned its lesson .
it can now hope that its us unit will profit from the enormous infrastructure program planned by us president elect barack obama .
in order not to fall back into old , corrupt habits , ex-german finance minister theo waigel - today a lawyer in munich - has been named " compliance monitor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky in the us , such monitoring is a common component of a criminal proceedings settlements .
in germany , the munich prosecutor 's office imposed a fine of 395 million euros , which siemens accepted .
that - along with the payment to the us and setting up the monitoring system that theo waigel will oversee - is the end of the state 's lawsuit against siemens over the bribery of public officials .
siemens can survive the financial hit .
even without corruption , the company 's business is strong - and in its year-end accounts , siemens thought to lay aside a billion euros to pay off fines .
but that 's not the end of the story .
the state prosecutor 's office still has open legal proceedings against specific former company directors , including longtime ceo and supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , on grounds they breached oversight rules .
siemens is suing former executives on top of that , siemens itself is suing former executives for millions in compensatory damages , on the grounds that the board of directors failed to institute internal controls that would prevent a regular culture of bribery - either that , or they intentionally looked the other way .
and there 's another reason the affair is not yet over : clients around the globe are preparing suits for damages because they think the bribery costs increased the prices they paid for goods or services .
moreover , countries want to know which of their officials took bribes from siemens .
even though the big lawsuits in germany and the us ended with settlements and fines , siemens will be processing one of the darkest chapters in its more-than-100-year-old corporate history for years to come .
on top of this , the damage to company 's reputation has been great , and no amount of money can ever fix it the case of siemens turns out to be a perfect example of the adage : corruption does n't pay .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 16.12.2008 opinion : siemens got off lightly , but there 's more to come großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the biggest bribery scandal in german business history , siemens had to pay fines amounting to nearly a billion euros .
ultimately , though , it got off easy , says dw 's karl zawadzky . considering the extent of the corruption affair , siemens is getting off relatively unscathed .
after all , bribery appears to have been an everyday occurrence for the international group when it came to getting contracts .
and nothing changed when laws were passed in germany - as in other industrial nations - that clearly forbid bribery , and the company 's shares began trading on the new york stock exchange .
in an unrivalled review , a legion of lawyers and accountants examined each and every siemens document .
for the time period between 1999 and 2006 , bribes on the order of 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- were uncovered .
it turns out that siemens workers and representatives around the globe had felt free to use money from secret accounts if it seemed useful for garnering contracts .
given the dimensions of the situation , siemens is getting off more lightly with its fine than most people would have expected .
especially when it comes to the settlement it agreed to with the us ministry of justice and the securities watchdog , the sec .
lesson learned , moving on siemens will pay 620 million euros to the us .
it could have been much worse .
and it would have been , if siemens had been blocked from competing for public contracts in the us for a period of many years .
the intense inspection of its books no doubt made an impression .
moreover , managers throughout the firm have been let go .
siemens learned its lesson .
it can now hope that its us unit will profit from the enormous infrastructure program planned by us president elect barack obama .
in order not to fall back into old , corrupt habits , ex-german finance minister theo waigel - today a lawyer in munich - has been named " compliance monitor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky in the us , such monitoring is a common component of a criminal proceedings settlements .
in germany , the munich prosecutor 's office imposed a fine of 395 million euros , which siemens accepted .
that - along with the payment to the us and setting up the monitoring system that theo waigel will oversee - is the end of the state 's lawsuit against siemens over the bribery of public officials .
siemens can survive the financial hit .
even without corruption , the company 's business is strong - and in its year-end accounts , siemens thought to lay aside a billion euros to pay off fines .
but that 's not the end of the story .
the state prosecutor 's office still has open legal proceedings against specific former company directors , including longtime ceo and supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , on grounds they breached oversight rules .
siemens is suing former executives on top of that , siemens itself is suing former executives for millions in compensatory damages , on the grounds that the board of directors failed to institute internal controls that would prevent a regular culture of bribery - either that , or they intentionally looked the other way .
and there 's another reason the affair is not yet over : clients around the globe are preparing suits for damages because they think the bribery costs increased the prices they paid for goods or services .
moreover , countries want to know which of their officials took bribes from siemens .
even though the big lawsuits in germany and the us ended with settlements and fines , siemens will be processing one of the darkest chapters in its more-than-100-year-old corporate history for years to come .
on top of this , the damage to company 's reputation has been great , and no amount of money can ever fix it the case of siemens turns out to be a perfect example of the adage : corruption does n't pay .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 16.12.2008 far-right extremists are growing bolder , police official says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far right has a new , confrontational strategy for dealing with police in the wake of a suspected far-right attack on the passau police chief , dw spoke with the head of the german police union about changes in the neo-nazi scene . on saturday , dec .
13 , the 52-year-old police chief in the bavarian german city of passau , alois mannichl , was stabbed when he answered his door at home .
the attack was alleged to be a reprisal from the neo-nazi scene ; mannichl had taken a firm stand against far-right supporters in recent years .
police arrested and then released two suspects .
some are now calling for a ban on germany 's far-right political party , the npd .
deutsche welle spoke to konrad freiberg , the head of the union of german police officers -lrb- gdp -rrb- about what the stabbing represents .
deutsche welle : herr freiberg , you said the attempted murder of the passau police chief represents a strategy change on the part of the extreme right .
why ?
konrad freiberg : in the past the violent right-wing activists were respectful to the police .
that has changed radically .
now , in demonstrations that include the npd , the police are frequently targets of physical attacks by the far right .
they verbally abuse the police as well .
that represents a change .
what do you think accounts for this change ?
there is a strategy debate among the far-right wing .
some insist that political means are the way to achieve power , and they want to create change via parliament or local councils .
but others say the way is violence , there is no other way .
so the anger from this group continues to grow .
how long has this strategic change been going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiberg said one must examine the causes of far-right extremism i 'd have to say for about a year .
we feel it very clearly .
there have been a lot of threats against colleagues who took a stand against the extreme right , or whose job description includes responsibility for this area of security .
there have been threats and attacks on those people in the private sphere .
things have really changed .
the extreme right is not only a problem in germany but in other european countries as well .
has anything similar to the passau attack taken place elsewhere in europe ?
yes , there have been attacks on the police by the extreme right in other european countries .
the right wing is making an effort to build itself up internationally .
at many meetings and demonstrations people come from different countries , especially the netherlands , and also italy .
so there is cooperation .
but we know and must recognize that this attack was a single case , without a doubt , and has no relation to an international plan of any sort .
to what degree is germany 's far-right extremist scene tied to those in other european countries , if indeed that is the case ?
there are international meetings .
and at large national meetings they try , as often as possible , to have some international participation .
at these meetings they all cheer together , saying things like " all europe is turning brown . "
that 's just the way it is .
that 's why we have to watch out that the german extreme right does n't increase its own strength by drawing strength from the international extreme right .
what should germany - and europe - do about this ?
if you talk about fighting right-wing extremism , you have to look at the causes .
why do people get into it ?
on top of that you have to look at the living situation and perspectives of those who are involved .
but you also have to look at how the democratic parties , and civil society , deals with these people .
we ca n't only count on the police and justice system to fight them , because they ca n't solve the problem alone . interview : esther broders -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while unsold cars block germany 's biggest car terminal , france 's president promises help for his country 's auto makers . european consumers are continuing to buy fewer cars , according to the european automobile manufacturers ' association acea . " new passenger car registrations in europe fell by 25.8 percent in november compared to the same month of last year , declining for the seventh month in a row , mirroring the financial and economic crises , " the acea said in a statement on tuesday , dec .
16 . november new registrations totaled 932,537 cars , a decrease from over 1.2 million in november 2007 .
acea said there had n't been such a notable decline since 1999 . germany , europe 's largest automobile market , saw registrations down 17.7 percent to 233,722 units .
all markets across the continent decreased except finland , poland and the czech republic . " the new eu member states long showed more resilience , in relative terms , because of the greater number of first-time buyers as opposed to the replacement market of western europe , " acea said . sarkozy pledges help the french government has said it will take action to save the country 's automobile industry .
president nicolas sarkozy on monday , dec .
15 , told leaders from the french car industry that he was prepared to provide additional aid to the struggling sector in the form of government loans and guarantees , his office said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is intent on helping france 's car industry however , he made all government aid to the industry subject to agreement from france 's fellow eu members and the european commission . but sarkozy said carmakers and their suppliers would have to commit to preserving sites in france .
aid was dependent on " the renunciation of any policy of deliberately encouraging the outsourcing " of production , he said . it was " incompatible with the closing of assembly factories in france , " sarkozy said . sarkozy 's office said that senior executives from the two largest french carmakers , renault and peugeot citroen , as well as representatives of the auto-equipment suppliers michelin and valeo took part in the meeting . the worst is yet to come in an interview published monday in the french daily le figaro , renault chief executive carlos ghosn said emergency government loans were necessary for the french car industry to survive the economic crisis . " what we are demanding from the state is some reasonable financing , over two to three years , at interest rates between four and five percent , " ghosn said . two out of every three cars was purchased on credit , he said . " if the finance crisis continues , you will see one producer after the other fail , " ghosn said . both renault and peugeot citroen have shut some of their factories to cut production as demand for cars in europe has plunged . acea figures for november showed the registration of new private cars in france down by more than 14 percent .
but , according to ghosn , the worst of the crisis still lies ahead . " we have n't touched bottom yet , " ghosn said . cars backlogged in germany the dramatic situation in the automobile industry has led to an excess of unsold cars at europe 's biggest car terminal in bremerhaven .
more than 90,000 vehicles are clogging the shipping terminal in the northern german port of bremerhaven , waiting to find new owners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of cars are waiting to be picked up in bremerhaven " we ca n't move the cars , work on them or deliver them until they find buyers , " said detthold aden , head of the blg logistics group , which operates the facility . roll-on roll-off vessels are delivering new cars that nobody wants .
instead of setting a turnover record , the terminal is rapidly becoming one of the world 's largest parking lots . when cars roll off ships like the " danube highway " or " morning champion " they come to a halt after just a few meters because there is no room for them on land .
blg has been forced to find extra space in the area of the port normally reserved for shipping containers .
other cars are temporarily stored on freight trains . ships normally jam-packed with vehicles destined for the united states are now leaving almost empty because of the dramatic downturn on the us car market . the speed of the meltdown caught bremerhaven by surprise .
when automobile manufactures published details of their shrinking sales , many of the cars now languishing in the port were already on their way to germany . " it 's a difficult situation , because many imported cars and those destined for export are still on their way here , " said aden . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a liberal europe , a europe that does n't close itself off , but meets all challenges . now , it could be as with several other presidencies , that our presidency will be dependent on other things .
the financial crisis is no longer just on the horizon , it 's being felt full-on in europe .
i 'm afraid that this will absorb a great deal of our presidency and that will be something we 'll really have to deal with .
there are also numerous foreign policy problems that threaten us on the horizon . to put it simply , you can set yourself a lot of goals at the start of a presidency , but life can take you in a different direction .
i do n't think the french presidency would have predicted that their main tasks would involve handling the conflict in the caucasus and the beginning of the economic crisis . i 'd like to come back to these topics individually .
but i 'm also interested in the future of the lisbon reform treaty .
the czech republic is one of two countries that has not approved it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzenberg said the financial crisis will remain a major focus god knows that 's true .
that 's been delayed now , firstly because of the proceedings at the constitutional court , and arguments in parliament .
but i 'm assuming it will happen within the next six weeks . the czech president vaclav klaus is a decided opponent to the reform treaty , and he 's also said the eu presidency is a totally unimportant thing. hhow do you live , how do you work with a president that is so disrespectful toward the european union ? well look , i do n't live with him .
the president knows that i have different opinions to him , and i know that about him .
we 've had almost two years now to get used to this situation .
foreign policy is dictated by the government , not by the president .
you ca n't choose the kind of relationship you have with a head of state , it 's there and you have to live with it . in france , there 's been public speculation about whether the czech republic is even in a position to lead the european union in this very critical time .
did it hurt you to hear what was coming from the french president 's circle ? no , not in the least .
i 'm not that easily hurt .
i 've been through a lot in my life , i 've seen a lot .
we 'll see if such statements are still being made by the end of our presidency .
i 'm well aware that many smaller countries have had to deal with similar sentiments at the start of their presidencies .
i think it 's just part of the political banter that comes with a presidency and i do n't take it that seriously . you yourself once referred to french president nicolas sarkozy with much admiration as the " spirit of restlessness in politics . "
how satisfied are you with the restlessness that france has brought to the eu in its six-month presidency ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy gets kudos for his handling of the financial crisis i think , all in all , we should be very grateful to the french president .
there were single steps , isolated remarks that i was n't particularly thrilled about .
but i think we have to say that the sarkozy 's energetic handling of the crisis in the caucasus is something europe can be very thankful for , as were his efforts to do something about the economic crisis .
we 'll have to see if the measures he took were the right ones .
that 's beyond my economic expertise , but in any case , it was a presidency that took action . the global economic crisis was n't foreseeable when france took over .
you 're inheriting this problem now .
what are your expectations ?
how bad do you think this crisis will get ? i think it 's something we have to take very , very seriously .
that does n't mean - and i would like to emphasize this - that we should start to panic .
given the situation , that would be the worst thing we could do .
the tried and trusted rules of economics should n't be thrown overboard in a moment of panic . but we should be aware that emergency measures are sometimes needed .
and if i were to break my leg today , i would have to accept that i would have to wear a cast for a while .
but we all know that if you wear a cast for too long , the muscles start to weaken to the point that it could cause lasting damage .
so , like i said , all these emergency measures and regulations should be used very carefully .
they should not be used permanently , and only goal-oriented measures should be used to combat the crisis . an important matter for the eu is always its relations with its eastern neighbors .
should countries such as moldova or ukraine be introduced as members of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty remains a sticking point this will take very , very long , i fear , very long .
but i believe it is in our greatest interests that this prospect stays alive .
it is an engine for reform , real motivation .
whether it concerns the western european states or also these states , this prospect is the strongest motivation to push the necessary reforms . and these reforms are in our greatest interests .
in discussions we forget over and over again that reaching out to these countries is not a charitable activity , exclusively to the advantage of these states , but that we would be pre-empting difficulties we will inevitably have . what role should russia play in this concept ?
is it only a strategic energy supplier or is moscow also a part of this idea of political partnership ? russia is and will remain a world in itself , with which we should search for a healthy , fair relationship .
what does not simplify things is that certain developments in russia , even a return to an authoritarian system , worry us .
we are anxious about certain revisionist statements which are somewhat unsettling . but this changes nothing about the fact that not only as an energy supplier , but also as a security discussion partner in countless elements of policy and international politics , russia is a much-needed partner with whom we should have dialog and lead .
but not under all conditions , this of course is obvious .
we must still protect our own principles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.12.2008 foreign minister : czech republic ready to lead europe in 2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic will lead the eu starting in 2009 the czech republic takes over the european union presidency on jan .
1 from current holder france .
czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg spoke with dw about his country 's intentions for its eu presidency . deutsche welle : in a few weeks , the czech republic will take over the eu presidency .
what are the goals you 've set for the next six months ? karel schwarzenberg : the goals that we originally set are already known : on the one hand , supporting the development of the eastern " neighborhood ; " secondly , driving forward the integration process in the western balkans ; and thirdly , a europe without barriers .
a liberal europe , a europe that does n't close itself off , but meets all challenges . now , it could be as with several other presidencies , that our presidency will be dependent on other things .
the financial crisis is no longer just on the horizon , it 's being felt full-on in europe .
i 'm afraid that this will absorb a great deal of our presidency and that will be something we 'll really have to deal with .
there are also numerous foreign policy problems that threaten us on the horizon . to put it simply , you can set yourself a lot of goals at the start of a presidency , but life can take you in a different direction .
i do n't think the french presidency would have predicted that their main tasks would involve handling the conflict in the caucasus and the beginning of the economic crisis . i 'd like to come back to these topics individually .
but i 'm also interested in the future of the lisbon reform treaty .
the czech republic is one of two countries that has not approved it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzenberg said the financial crisis will remain a major focus god knows that 's true .
that 's been delayed now , firstly because of the proceedings at the constitutional court , and arguments in parliament .
but i 'm assuming it will happen within the next six weeks . the czech president vaclav klaus is a decided opponent to the reform treaty , and he 's also said the eu presidency is a totally unimportant thing. hhow do you live , how do you work with a president that is so disrespectful toward the european union ? well look , i do n't live with him .
the president knows that i have different opinions to him , and i know that about him .
we 've had almost two years now to get used to this situation .
foreign policy is dictated by the government , not by the president .
you ca n't choose the kind of relationship you have with a head of state , it 's there and you have to live with it . in france , there 's been public speculation about whether the czech republic is even in a position to lead the european union in this very critical time .
did it hurt you to hear what was coming from the french president 's circle ? no , not in the least .
i 'm not that easily hurt .
i 've been through a lot in my life , i 've seen a lot .
we 'll see if such statements are still being made by the end of our presidency .
i 'm well aware that many smaller countries have had to deal with similar sentiments at the start of their presidencies .
i think it 's just part of the political banter that comes with a presidency and i do n't take it that seriously . you yourself once referred to french president nicolas sarkozy with much admiration as the " spirit of restlessness in politics . "
how satisfied are you with the restlessness that france has brought to the eu in its six-month presidency ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy gets kudos for his handling of the financial crisis i think , all in all , we should be very grateful to the french president .
there were single steps , isolated remarks that i was n't particularly thrilled about .
but i think we have to say that the sarkozy 's energetic handling of the crisis in the caucasus is something europe can be very thankful for , as were his efforts to do something about the economic crisis .
we 'll have to see if the measures he took were the right ones .
that 's beyond my economic expertise , but in any case , it was a presidency that took action . the global economic crisis was n't foreseeable when france took over .
you 're inheriting this problem now .
what are your expectations ?
how bad do you think this crisis will get ? i think it 's something we have to take very , very seriously .
that does n't mean - and i would like to emphasize this - that we should start to panic .
given the situation , that would be the worst thing we could do .
the tried and trusted rules of economics should n't be thrown overboard in a moment of panic . but we should be aware that emergency measures are sometimes needed .
and if i were to break my leg today , i would have to accept that i would have to wear a cast for a while .
but we all know that if you wear a cast for too long , the muscles start to weaken to the point that it could cause lasting damage .
so , like i said , all these emergency measures and regulations should be used very carefully .
they should not be used permanently , and only goal-oriented measures should be used to combat the crisis . an important matter for the eu is always its relations with its eastern neighbors .
should countries such as moldova or ukraine be introduced as members of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty remains a sticking point this will take very , very long , i fear , very long .
but i believe it is in our greatest interests that this prospect stays alive .
it is an engine for reform , real motivation .
whether it concerns the western european states or also these states , this prospect is the strongest motivation to push the necessary reforms . and these reforms are in our greatest interests .
in discussions we forget over and over again that reaching out to these countries is not a charitable activity , exclusively to the advantage of these states , but that we would be pre-empting difficulties we will inevitably have . what role should russia play in this concept ?
is it only a strategic energy supplier or is moscow also a part of this idea of political partnership ? russia is and will remain a world in itself , with which we should search for a healthy , fair relationship .
what does not simplify things is that certain developments in russia , even a return to an authoritarian system , worry us .
we are anxious about certain revisionist statements which are somewhat unsettling . but this changes nothing about the fact that not only as an energy supplier , but also as a security discussion partner in countless elements of policy and international politics , russia is a much-needed partner with whom we should have dialog and lead .
but not under all conditions , this of course is obvious .
we must still protect our own principles .
but dialog with russia is always useful and necessary . interview : christian trippe -lrb- dc / dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's estimated that the battle fought there could have involved up to 1,000 roman fighters . according to a theory put forward by guenther moosbauer , an expert at the university of osnabrueck who studies roman-german history , a roman legion could have been seeking revenge after tribesman in 235 a.d. pushed roman troops south of the limes germanicus , a ring of forts that separated the empire from unconquered land to the north and east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.12.2008 foreign minister : czech republic ready to lead europe in 2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic will lead the eu starting in 2009 the czech republic takes over the european union presidency on jan .
1 from current holder france .
czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg spoke with dw about his country 's intentions for its eu presidency . deutsche welle : in a few weeks , the czech republic will take over the eu presidency .
what are the goals you 've set for the next six months ? karel schwarzenberg : the goals that we originally set are already known : on the one hand , supporting the development of the eastern " neighborhood ; " secondly , driving forward the integration process in the western balkans ; and thirdly , a europe without barriers .
a liberal europe , a europe that does n't close itself off , but meets all challenges . now , it could be as with several other presidencies , that our presidency will be dependent on other things .
the financial crisis is no longer just on the horizon , it 's being felt full-on in europe .
i 'm afraid that this will absorb a great deal of our presidency and that will be something we 'll really have to deal with .
there are also numerous foreign policy problems that threaten us on the horizon . to put it simply , you can set yourself a lot of goals at the start of a presidency , but life can take you in a different direction .
i do n't think the french presidency would have predicted that their main tasks would involve handling the conflict in the caucasus and the beginning of the economic crisis . i 'd like to come back to these topics individually .
but i 'm also interested in the future of the lisbon reform treaty .
the czech republic is one of two countries that has not approved it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzenberg said the financial crisis will remain a major focus god knows that 's true .
that 's been delayed now , firstly because of the proceedings at the constitutional court , and arguments in parliament .
but i 'm assuming it will happen within the next six weeks . the czech president vaclav klaus is a decided opponent to the reform treaty , and he 's also said the eu presidency is a totally unimportant thing. hhow do you live , how do you work with a president that is so disrespectful toward the european union ? well look , i do n't live with him .
the president knows that i have different opinions to him , and i know that about him .
we 've had almost two years now to get used to this situation .
foreign policy is dictated by the government , not by the president .
you ca n't choose the kind of relationship you have with a head of state , it 's there and you have to live with it . in france , there 's been public speculation about whether the czech republic is even in a position to lead the european union in this very critical time .
did it hurt you to hear what was coming from the french president 's circle ? no , not in the least .
i 'm not that easily hurt .
i 've been through a lot in my life , i 've seen a lot .
we 'll see if such statements are still being made by the end of our presidency .
i 'm well aware that many smaller countries have had to deal with similar sentiments at the start of their presidencies .
i think it 's just part of the political banter that comes with a presidency and i do n't take it that seriously . you yourself once referred to french president nicolas sarkozy with much admiration as the " spirit of restlessness in politics . "
how satisfied are you with the restlessness that france has brought to the eu in its six-month presidency ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy gets kudos for his handling of the financial crisis i think , all in all , we should be very grateful to the french president .
there were single steps , isolated remarks that i was n't particularly thrilled about .
but i think we have to say that the sarkozy 's energetic handling of the crisis in the caucasus is something europe can be very thankful for , as were his efforts to do something about the economic crisis .
we 'll have to see if the measures he took were the right ones .
that 's beyond my economic expertise , but in any case , it was a presidency that took action . the global economic crisis was n't foreseeable when france took over .
you 're inheriting this problem now .
what are your expectations ?
how bad do you think this crisis will get ? i think it 's something we have to take very , very seriously .
that does n't mean - and i would like to emphasize this - that we should start to panic .
given the situation , that would be the worst thing we could do .
the tried and trusted rules of economics should n't be thrown overboard in a moment of panic . but we should be aware that emergency measures are sometimes needed .
and if i were to break my leg today , i would have to accept that i would have to wear a cast for a while .
but we all know that if you wear a cast for too long , the muscles start to weaken to the point that it could cause lasting damage .
so , like i said , all these emergency measures and regulations should be used very carefully .
they should not be used permanently , and only goal-oriented measures should be used to combat the crisis . an important matter for the eu is always its relations with its eastern neighbors .
should countries such as moldova or ukraine be introduced as members of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty remains a sticking point this will take very , very long , i fear , very long .
but i believe it is in our greatest interests that this prospect stays alive .
it is an engine for reform , real motivation .
whether it concerns the western european states or also these states , this prospect is the strongest motivation to push the necessary reforms . and these reforms are in our greatest interests .
in discussions we forget over and over again that reaching out to these countries is not a charitable activity , exclusively to the advantage of these states , but that we would be pre-empting difficulties we will inevitably have . what role should russia play in this concept ?
is it only a strategic energy supplier or is moscow also a part of this idea of political partnership ? russia is and will remain a world in itself , with which we should search for a healthy , fair relationship .
what does not simplify things is that certain developments in russia , even a return to an authoritarian system , worry us .
we are anxious about certain revisionist statements which are somewhat unsettling . but this changes nothing about the fact that not only as an energy supplier , but also as a security discussion partner in countless elements of policy and international politics , russia is a much-needed partner with whom we should have dialog and lead .
but not under all conditions , this of course is obvious .
we must still protect our own principles .
but dialog with russia is always useful and necessary . interview : christian trippe -lrb- dc / dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

should countries such as moldova or ukraine be introduced as members of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty remains a sticking point this will take very , very long , i fear , very long .
but i believe it is in our greatest interests that this prospect stays alive .
it is an engine for reform , real motivation .
whether it concerns the western european states or also these states , this prospect is the strongest motivation to push the necessary reforms . and these reforms are in our greatest interests .
in discussions we forget over and over again that reaching out to these countries is not a charitable activity , exclusively to the advantage of these states , but that we would be pre-empting difficulties we will inevitably have . what role should russia play in this concept ?
is it only a strategic energy supplier or is moscow also a part of this idea of political partnership ? russia is and will remain a world in itself , with which we should search for a healthy , fair relationship .
what does not simplify things is that certain developments in russia , even a return to an authoritarian system , worry us .
we are anxious about certain revisionist statements which are somewhat unsettling . but this changes nothing about the fact that not only as an energy supplier , but also as a security discussion partner in countless elements of policy and international politics , russia is a much-needed partner with whom we should have dialog and lead .
but not under all conditions , this of course is obvious .
we must still protect our own principles .
but dialog with russia is always useful and necessary . interview : christian trippe -lrb- dc / dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 16.12.2008 far-right extremists are growing bolder , police official says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far right has a new , confrontational strategy for dealing with police in the wake of a suspected far-right attack on the passau police chief , dw spoke with the head of the german police union about changes in the neo-nazi scene . on saturday , dec .
13 , the 52-year-old police chief in the bavarian german city of passau , alois mannichl , was stabbed when he answered his door at home .
the attack was alleged to be a reprisal from the neo-nazi scene ; mannichl had taken a firm stand against far-right supporters in recent years .
police arrested and then released two suspects .
some are now calling for a ban on germany 's far-right political party , the npd .
deutsche welle spoke to konrad freiberg , the head of the union of german police officers -lrb- gdp -rrb- about what the stabbing represents .
deutsche welle : herr freiberg , you said the attempted murder of the passau police chief represents a strategy change on the part of the extreme right .
why ?
konrad freiberg : in the past the violent right-wing activists were respectful to the police .
that has changed radically .
now , in demonstrations that include the npd , the police are frequently targets of physical attacks by the far right .
they verbally abuse the police as well .
that represents a change .
what do you think accounts for this change ?
there is a strategy debate among the far-right wing .
some insist that political means are the way to achieve power , and they want to create change via parliament or local councils .
but others say the way is violence , there is no other way .
so the anger from this group continues to grow .
how long has this strategic change been going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiberg said one must examine the causes of far-right extremism i 'd have to say for about a year .
we feel it very clearly .
there have been a lot of threats against colleagues who took a stand against the extreme right , or whose job description includes responsibility for this area of security .
there have been threats and attacks on those people in the private sphere .
things have really changed .
the extreme right is not only a problem in germany but in other european countries as well .
has anything similar to the passau attack taken place elsewhere in europe ?
yes , there have been attacks on the police by the extreme right in other european countries .
the right wing is making an effort to build itself up internationally .
at many meetings and demonstrations people come from different countries , especially the netherlands , and also italy .
so there is cooperation .
but we know and must recognize that this attack was a single case , without a doubt , and has no relation to an international plan of any sort .
to what degree is germany 's far-right extremist scene tied to those in other european countries , if indeed that is the case ?
there are international meetings .
and at large national meetings they try , as often as possible , to have some international participation .
at these meetings they all cheer together , saying things like " all europe is turning brown . "
that 's just the way it is .
that 's why we have to watch out that the german extreme right does n't increase its own strength by drawing strength from the international extreme right .
what should germany - and europe - do about this ?
if you talk about fighting right-wing extremism , you have to look at the causes .
why do people get into it ?
on top of that you have to look at the living situation and perspectives of those who are involved .
but you also have to look at how the democratic parties , and civil society , deals with these people .
we ca n't only count on the police and justice system to fight them , because they ca n't solve the problem alone . interview : esther broders -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , the 52-year-old police chief in the bavarian german city of passau , alois mannichl , was stabbed when he answered his door at home .
the attack was alleged to be a reprisal from the neo-nazi scene ; mannichl had taken a firm stand against far-right supporters in recent years .
police arrested and then released two suspects .
some are now calling for a ban on germany 's far-right political party , the npd .
deutsche welle spoke to konrad freiberg , the head of the union of german police officers -lrb- gdp -rrb- about what the stabbing represents .
deutsche welle : herr freiberg , you said the attempted murder of the passau police chief represents a strategy change on the part of the extreme right .
why ?
konrad freiberg : in the past the violent right-wing activists were respectful to the police .
that has changed radically .
now , in demonstrations that include the npd , the police are frequently targets of physical attacks by the far right .
they verbally abuse the police as well .
that represents a change .
what do you think accounts for this change ?
there is a strategy debate among the far-right wing .
some insist that political means are the way to achieve power , and they want to create change via parliament or local councils .
but others say the way is violence , there is no other way .
so the anger from this group continues to grow .
how long has this strategic change been going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiberg said one must examine the causes of far-right extremism i 'd have to say for about a year .
we feel it very clearly .
there have been a lot of threats against colleagues who took a stand against the extreme right , or whose job description includes responsibility for this area of security .
there have been threats and attacks on those people in the private sphere .
things have really changed .
the extreme right is not only a problem in germany but in other european countries as well .
has anything similar to the passau attack taken place elsewhere in europe ?
yes , there have been attacks on the police by the extreme right in other european countries .
the right wing is making an effort to build itself up internationally .
at many meetings and demonstrations people come from different countries , especially the netherlands , and also italy .
so there is cooperation .
but we know and must recognize that this attack was a single case , without a doubt , and has no relation to an international plan of any sort .
to what degree is germany 's far-right extremist scene tied to those in other european countries , if indeed that is the case ?
there are international meetings .
and at large national meetings they try , as often as possible , to have some international participation .
at these meetings they all cheer together , saying things like " all europe is turning brown . "
that 's just the way it is .
that 's why we have to watch out that the german extreme right does n't increase its own strength by drawing strength from the international extreme right .
what should germany - and europe - do about this ?
if you talk about fighting right-wing extremism , you have to look at the causes .
why do people get into it ?
on top of that you have to look at the living situation and perspectives of those who are involved .
but you also have to look at how the democratic parties , and civil society , deals with these people .
we ca n't only count on the police and justice system to fight them , because they ca n't solve the problem alone . interview : esther broders -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.12.2008 sarkozy bids european parliament farewell großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy , right addresses the european parliament in a speech to the european parliament , france 's president looked back on his country 's six-month term heading the eu .
meps debated with the leader on topics including georgia , the financial crisis and climate change . france 's president nicolas sarkozy said his country had aimed to organize its six-month presidency on the basis of two convictions . " the world needs a strong europe and that europe can not be strong if it is not united , " sarkozy told the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday , dec .
16 .
a strong europe was one that " rejects consensus based on pushing problems to one side , " he said . sarkozy said france 's presidency had been forced to follow " the rhythm of international events , " among them the russia-georgia conflict in august and the worldwide financial crisis in september .
though he had tried to change europe in this time , europe had in fact changed him , he said . " i really think that each head of state or government would benefit at some time from this responsibility , " sarkozy said .
" they would understand that whatever differences we have , there are so many things that bring us together .
when one has the chance over six months to learn about and to solve the problems of 27 nations , one gains tolerance , an opening of the spirit and one understands europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz said the french presidency had been " quite good " overall most meps applauded france on its term .
even the socialist leader in the european parliament , martin schulz , an outspoken critic of sarkozy 's , called the french eu presidency a success . " if the next presidency does the same i would be happy , " said schulz .
he said the french leader had " come out of the closet , as a pro-european . " the czech republic will take over the eu 's rotating presidency on january 1 , 2009 . heated debate on climate change sarkozy defended the eu 's climate change deal , which the bloc agreed on last week .
he told the parliament that there had been " an enormous fight " about climate change and energy as each member state had had " reason for dissatisfaction . "
he said compromises that had been agreed by leaders would avoid imposing unbearable sacrifices on its citizens . " we did n't want to impose constrictions which no country in the world could have survived socially , " sarkozy said . the president of the european commission jose manuel barroso said the climate change initiatives made europe the first to accept legally binding rules by 2020 . " and we will be strengthening these limits as agreement is reached globally , " barroso said .
" we can now turn to our friends in america and say to them : yes , you can ! " the conservative leader joseph daul said the climate change agreement would protect both the environment and jobs .
he said the eu now had to lead the worldwide fight against climate change , press the worst polluters to act and seek tangible commitments from us president barack obama once he took office . but daniel cohn-bendit from the greens called the swift adoption of the climate change package " blackmail . " european lawmakers will be voting on the climate change package on wednesday .
the parliament 's main political groups have already announced that they will be supporting the deal . alleviating the financial crisis most meps applauded france 's rapid reaction to the economic and financial crises .
socialist leader schulz said the presidency " did well " on the financial crisis .
sarkozy had reacted - albeit " somewhat late " - to the time-bomb of social imbalances in europe , schulz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most politicians applauded france 's presidency sarkozy said unity had been crucial in the global financial crisis .
if europe 's countries and institutions had not taken responsibility , this would have led to " the destruction of the european banking system , " he said . " we in europe want entrepreneurial capitalism not speculative capitalism , " sarkozy said .
" we have said this with one voice .
our economies and our political cultures are not the same , but we all agreed in the end . " conservative leader daul said the french presidency 's efforts had helped to win worldwide respect for europe 's coordinated response to the financial crisis . the presidency 's actions had brought about coordinated protection for savers ' deposits and recapitalization for banks , he said .
this had prevented a chain reaction in which thousands of jobs could have been lost , daul said . europe is not the enemy of the nations many parliamentary group leaders welcomed sarkozy 's and the french government 's swift and successful reaction to events in georgia .
sarkozy said his main aim during the georgian crisis had been " to stop the war and not fall into the same trap as in bosnia , " where the united states had taken the lead and europe followed . it had been a " real obsession " of france 's presidency that europe should " take responsibility " over georgia and fortunately europe had remained united over the issue , he said . sarkozy said in his conclusion that europe required an understanding between different nations .
he said that he was not an integrationist , but that he was determined to preserve the nation state . " however european you are , europe is not the enemy of the nations and the nations are not the enemy of europe , " sarkozy said .
" it is easier for europe to have big ambitions than small ones , because only big projects have the power to overcome national egos . " dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle spoke to konrad freiberg , the head of the union of german police officers -lrb- gdp -rrb- about what the stabbing represents .
deutsche welle : herr freiberg , you said the attempted murder of the passau police chief represents a strategy change on the part of the extreme right .
why ?
konrad freiberg : in the past the violent right-wing activists were respectful to the police .
that has changed radically .
now , in demonstrations that include the npd , the police are frequently targets of physical attacks by the far right .
they verbally abuse the police as well .
that represents a change .
what do you think accounts for this change ?
there is a strategy debate among the far-right wing .
some insist that political means are the way to achieve power , and they want to create change via parliament or local councils .
but others say the way is violence , there is no other way .
so the anger from this group continues to grow .
how long has this strategic change been going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiberg said one must examine the causes of far-right extremism i 'd have to say for about a year .
we feel it very clearly .
there have been a lot of threats against colleagues who took a stand against the extreme right , or whose job description includes responsibility for this area of security .
there have been threats and attacks on those people in the private sphere .
things have really changed .
the extreme right is not only a problem in germany but in other european countries as well .
has anything similar to the passau attack taken place elsewhere in europe ?
yes , there have been attacks on the police by the extreme right in other european countries .
the right wing is making an effort to build itself up internationally .
at many meetings and demonstrations people come from different countries , especially the netherlands , and also italy .
so there is cooperation .
but we know and must recognize that this attack was a single case , without a doubt , and has no relation to an international plan of any sort .
to what degree is germany 's far-right extremist scene tied to those in other european countries , if indeed that is the case ?
there are international meetings .
and at large national meetings they try , as often as possible , to have some international participation .
at these meetings they all cheer together , saying things like " all europe is turning brown . "
that 's just the way it is .
that 's why we have to watch out that the german extreme right does n't increase its own strength by drawing strength from the international extreme right .
what should germany - and europe - do about this ?
if you talk about fighting right-wing extremism , you have to look at the causes .
why do people get into it ?
on top of that you have to look at the living situation and perspectives of those who are involved .
but you also have to look at how the democratic parties , and civil society , deals with these people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.12.2008 sarkozy bids european parliament farewell großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy , right addresses the european parliament in a speech to the european parliament , france 's president looked back on his country 's six-month term heading the eu .
meps debated with the leader on topics including georgia , the financial crisis and climate change . france 's president nicolas sarkozy said his country had aimed to organize its six-month presidency on the basis of two convictions . " the world needs a strong europe and that europe can not be strong if it is not united , " sarkozy told the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday , dec .
16 .
a strong europe was one that " rejects consensus based on pushing problems to one side , " he said . sarkozy said france 's presidency had been forced to follow " the rhythm of international events , " among them the russia-georgia conflict in august and the worldwide financial crisis in september .
though he had tried to change europe in this time , europe had in fact changed him , he said . " i really think that each head of state or government would benefit at some time from this responsibility , " sarkozy said .
" they would understand that whatever differences we have , there are so many things that bring us together .
when one has the chance over six months to learn about and to solve the problems of 27 nations , one gains tolerance , an opening of the spirit and one understands europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz said the french presidency had been " quite good " overall most meps applauded france on its term .
even the socialist leader in the european parliament , martin schulz , an outspoken critic of sarkozy 's , called the french eu presidency a success . " if the next presidency does the same i would be happy , " said schulz .
he said the french leader had " come out of the closet , as a pro-european . " the czech republic will take over the eu 's rotating presidency on january 1 , 2009 . heated debate on climate change sarkozy defended the eu 's climate change deal , which the bloc agreed on last week .
he told the parliament that there had been " an enormous fight " about climate change and energy as each member state had had " reason for dissatisfaction . "
he said compromises that had been agreed by leaders would avoid imposing unbearable sacrifices on its citizens . " we did n't want to impose constrictions which no country in the world could have survived socially , " sarkozy said . the president of the european commission jose manuel barroso said the climate change initiatives made europe the first to accept legally binding rules by 2020 . " and we will be strengthening these limits as agreement is reached globally , " barroso said .
" we can now turn to our friends in america and say to them : yes , you can ! " the conservative leader joseph daul said the climate change agreement would protect both the environment and jobs .
he said the eu now had to lead the worldwide fight against climate change , press the worst polluters to act and seek tangible commitments from us president barack obama once he took office . but daniel cohn-bendit from the greens called the swift adoption of the climate change package " blackmail . " european lawmakers will be voting on the climate change package on wednesday .
the parliament 's main political groups have already announced that they will be supporting the deal . alleviating the financial crisis most meps applauded france 's rapid reaction to the economic and financial crises .
socialist leader schulz said the presidency " did well " on the financial crisis .
sarkozy had reacted - albeit " somewhat late " - to the time-bomb of social imbalances in europe , schulz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most politicians applauded france 's presidency sarkozy said unity had been crucial in the global financial crisis .
if europe 's countries and institutions had not taken responsibility , this would have led to " the destruction of the european banking system , " he said . " we in europe want entrepreneurial capitalism not speculative capitalism , " sarkozy said .
" we have said this with one voice .
our economies and our political cultures are not the same , but we all agreed in the end . " conservative leader daul said the french presidency 's efforts had helped to win worldwide respect for europe 's coordinated response to the financial crisis . the presidency 's actions had brought about coordinated protection for savers ' deposits and recapitalization for banks , he said .
this had prevented a chain reaction in which thousands of jobs could have been lost , daul said . europe is not the enemy of the nations many parliamentary group leaders welcomed sarkozy 's and the french government 's swift and successful reaction to events in georgia .
sarkozy said his main aim during the georgian crisis had been " to stop the war and not fall into the same trap as in bosnia , " where the united states had taken the lead and europe followed . it had been a " real obsession " of france 's presidency that europe should " take responsibility " over georgia and fortunately europe had remained united over the issue , he said . sarkozy said in his conclusion that europe required an understanding between different nations .
he said that he was not an integrationist , but that he was determined to preserve the nation state . " however european you are , europe is not the enemy of the nations and the nations are not the enemy of europe , " sarkozy said .
" it is easier for europe to have big ambitions than small ones , because only big projects have the power to overcome national egos . " dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 16.12.2008 economic crisis hits european carmakers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are plenty of cars for sale , but no one can afford to buy them the ailing economy has less people buying cars - a hard hit for europe 's large car making industry .
while unsold cars block germany 's biggest car terminal , france 's president promises help for his country 's auto makers . european consumers are continuing to buy fewer cars , according to the european automobile manufacturers ' association acea . " new passenger car registrations in europe fell by 25.8 percent in november compared to the same month of last year , declining for the seventh month in a row , mirroring the financial and economic crises , " the acea said in a statement on tuesday , dec .
16 . november new registrations totaled 932,537 cars , a decrease from over 1.2 million in november 2007 .
acea said there had n't been such a notable decline since 1999 . germany , europe 's largest automobile market , saw registrations down 17.7 percent to 233,722 units .
all markets across the continent decreased except finland , poland and the czech republic . " the new eu member states long showed more resilience , in relative terms , because of the greater number of first-time buyers as opposed to the replacement market of western europe , " acea said . sarkozy pledges help the french government has said it will take action to save the country 's automobile industry .
president nicolas sarkozy on monday , dec .
15 , told leaders from the french car industry that he was prepared to provide additional aid to the struggling sector in the form of government loans and guarantees , his office said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is intent on helping france 's car industry however , he made all government aid to the industry subject to agreement from france 's fellow eu members and the european commission . but sarkozy said carmakers and their suppliers would have to commit to preserving sites in france .
aid was dependent on " the renunciation of any policy of deliberately encouraging the outsourcing " of production , he said . it was " incompatible with the closing of assembly factories in france , " sarkozy said . sarkozy 's office said that senior executives from the two largest french carmakers , renault and peugeot citroen , as well as representatives of the auto-equipment suppliers michelin and valeo took part in the meeting . the worst is yet to come in an interview published monday in the french daily le figaro , renault chief executive carlos ghosn said emergency government loans were necessary for the french car industry to survive the economic crisis . " what we are demanding from the state is some reasonable financing , over two to three years , at interest rates between four and five percent , " ghosn said . two out of every three cars was purchased on credit , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.12.2008 sarkozy bids european parliament farewell großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy , right addresses the european parliament in a speech to the european parliament , france 's president looked back on his country 's six-month term heading the eu .
meps debated with the leader on topics including georgia , the financial crisis and climate change . france 's president nicolas sarkozy said his country had aimed to organize its six-month presidency on the basis of two convictions . " the world needs a strong europe and that europe can not be strong if it is not united , " sarkozy told the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday , dec .
16 .
a strong europe was one that " rejects consensus based on pushing problems to one side , " he said . sarkozy said france 's presidency had been forced to follow " the rhythm of international events , " among them the russia-georgia conflict in august and the worldwide financial crisis in september .
though he had tried to change europe in this time , europe had in fact changed him , he said . " i really think that each head of state or government would benefit at some time from this responsibility , " sarkozy said .
" they would understand that whatever differences we have , there are so many things that bring us together .
when one has the chance over six months to learn about and to solve the problems of 27 nations , one gains tolerance , an opening of the spirit and one understands europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz said the french presidency had been " quite good " overall most meps applauded france on its term .
even the socialist leader in the european parliament , martin schulz , an outspoken critic of sarkozy 's , called the french eu presidency a success . " if the next presidency does the same i would be happy , " said schulz .
he said the french leader had " come out of the closet , as a pro-european . " the czech republic will take over the eu 's rotating presidency on january 1 , 2009 . heated debate on climate change sarkozy defended the eu 's climate change deal , which the bloc agreed on last week .
he told the parliament that there had been " an enormous fight " about climate change and energy as each member state had had " reason for dissatisfaction . "
he said compromises that had been agreed by leaders would avoid imposing unbearable sacrifices on its citizens . " we did n't want to impose constrictions which no country in the world could have survived socially , " sarkozy said . the president of the european commission jose manuel barroso said the climate change initiatives made europe the first to accept legally binding rules by 2020 . " and we will be strengthening these limits as agreement is reached globally , " barroso said .
" we can now turn to our friends in america and say to them : yes , you can ! " the conservative leader joseph daul said the climate change agreement would protect both the environment and jobs .
he said the eu now had to lead the worldwide fight against climate change , press the worst polluters to act and seek tangible commitments from us president barack obama once he took office . but daniel cohn-bendit from the greens called the swift adoption of the climate change package " blackmail . " european lawmakers will be voting on the climate change package on wednesday .
the parliament 's main political groups have already announced that they will be supporting the deal . alleviating the financial crisis most meps applauded france 's rapid reaction to the economic and financial crises .
socialist leader schulz said the presidency " did well " on the financial crisis .
sarkozy had reacted - albeit " somewhat late " - to the time-bomb of social imbalances in europe , schulz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most politicians applauded france 's presidency sarkozy said unity had been crucial in the global financial crisis .
if europe 's countries and institutions had not taken responsibility , this would have led to " the destruction of the european banking system , " he said . " we in europe want entrepreneurial capitalism not speculative capitalism , " sarkozy said .
" we have said this with one voice .
our economies and our political cultures are not the same , but we all agreed in the end . " conservative leader daul said the french presidency 's efforts had helped to win worldwide respect for europe 's coordinated response to the financial crisis . the presidency 's actions had brought about coordinated protection for savers ' deposits and recapitalization for banks , he said .
this had prevented a chain reaction in which thousands of jobs could have been lost , daul said . europe is not the enemy of the nations many parliamentary group leaders welcomed sarkozy 's and the french government 's swift and successful reaction to events in georgia .
sarkozy said his main aim during the georgian crisis had been " to stop the war and not fall into the same trap as in bosnia , " where the united states had taken the lead and europe followed . it had been a " real obsession " of france 's presidency that europe should " take responsibility " over georgia and fortunately europe had remained united over the issue , he said . sarkozy said in his conclusion that europe required an understanding between different nations .
he said that he was not an integrationist , but that he was determined to preserve the nation state . " however european you are , europe is not the enemy of the nations and the nations are not the enemy of europe , " sarkozy said .
" it is easier for europe to have big ambitions than small ones , because only big projects have the power to overcome national egos . " dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.12.2008 sarkozy bids european parliament farewell großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy , right addresses the european parliament in a speech to the european parliament , france 's president looked back on his country 's six-month term heading the eu .
meps debated with the leader on topics including georgia , the financial crisis and climate change . france 's president nicolas sarkozy said his country had aimed to organize its six-month presidency on the basis of two convictions . " the world needs a strong europe and that europe can not be strong if it is not united , " sarkozy told the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday , dec .
16 .
a strong europe was one that " rejects consensus based on pushing problems to one side , " he said . sarkozy said france 's presidency had been forced to follow " the rhythm of international events , " among them the russia-georgia conflict in august and the worldwide financial crisis in september .
though he had tried to change europe in this time , europe had in fact changed him , he said . " i really think that each head of state or government would benefit at some time from this responsibility , " sarkozy said .
" they would understand that whatever differences we have , there are so many things that bring us together .
when one has the chance over six months to learn about and to solve the problems of 27 nations , one gains tolerance , an opening of the spirit and one understands europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz said the french presidency had been " quite good " overall most meps applauded france on its term .
even the socialist leader in the european parliament , martin schulz , an outspoken critic of sarkozy 's , called the french eu presidency a success . " if the next presidency does the same i would be happy , " said schulz .
he said the french leader had " come out of the closet , as a pro-european . " the czech republic will take over the eu 's rotating presidency on january 1 , 2009 . heated debate on climate change sarkozy defended the eu 's climate change deal , which the bloc agreed on last week .
he told the parliament that there had been " an enormous fight " about climate change and energy as each member state had had " reason for dissatisfaction . "
he said compromises that had been agreed by leaders would avoid imposing unbearable sacrifices on its citizens . " we did n't want to impose constrictions which no country in the world could have survived socially , " sarkozy said . the president of the european commission jose manuel barroso said the climate change initiatives made europe the first to accept legally binding rules by 2020 . " and we will be strengthening these limits as agreement is reached globally , " barroso said .
" we can now turn to our friends in america and say to them : yes , you can ! " the conservative leader joseph daul said the climate change agreement would protect both the environment and jobs .
he said the eu now had to lead the worldwide fight against climate change , press the worst polluters to act and seek tangible commitments from us president barack obama once he took office . but daniel cohn-bendit from the greens called the swift adoption of the climate change package " blackmail . " european lawmakers will be voting on the climate change package on wednesday .
the parliament 's main political groups have already announced that they will be supporting the deal . alleviating the financial crisis most meps applauded france 's rapid reaction to the economic and financial crises .
socialist leader schulz said the presidency " did well " on the financial crisis .
sarkozy had reacted - albeit " somewhat late " - to the time-bomb of social imbalances in europe , schulz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most politicians applauded france 's presidency sarkozy said unity had been crucial in the global financial crisis .
if europe 's countries and institutions had not taken responsibility , this would have led to " the destruction of the european banking system , " he said . " we in europe want entrepreneurial capitalism not speculative capitalism , " sarkozy said .
" we have said this with one voice .
our economies and our political cultures are not the same , but we all agreed in the end . " conservative leader daul said the french presidency 's efforts had helped to win worldwide respect for europe 's coordinated response to the financial crisis . the presidency 's actions had brought about coordinated protection for savers ' deposits and recapitalization for banks , he said .
this had prevented a chain reaction in which thousands of jobs could have been lost , daul said . europe is not the enemy of the nations many parliamentary group leaders welcomed sarkozy 's and the french government 's swift and successful reaction to events in georgia .
sarkozy said his main aim during the georgian crisis had been " to stop the war and not fall into the same trap as in bosnia , " where the united states had taken the lead and europe followed . it had been a " real obsession " of france 's presidency that europe should " take responsibility " over georgia and fortunately europe had remained united over the issue , he said . sarkozy said in his conclusion that europe required an understanding between different nations .
he said that he was not an integrationist , but that he was determined to preserve the nation state . " however european you are , europe is not the enemy of the nations and the nations are not the enemy of europe , " sarkozy said .
" it is easier for europe to have big ambitions than small ones , because only big projects have the power to overcome national egos . " dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 from current holder france .
czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg spoke with dw about his country 's intentions for its eu presidency . deutsche welle : in a few weeks , the czech republic will take over the eu presidency .
what are the goals you 've set for the next six months ? karel schwarzenberg : the goals that we originally set are already known : on the one hand , supporting the development of the eastern " neighborhood ; " secondly , driving forward the integration process in the western balkans ; and thirdly , a europe without barriers .
a liberal europe , a europe that does n't close itself off , but meets all challenges . now , it could be as with several other presidencies , that our presidency will be dependent on other things .
the financial crisis is no longer just on the horizon , it 's being felt full-on in europe .
i 'm afraid that this will absorb a great deal of our presidency and that will be something we 'll really have to deal with .
there are also numerous foreign policy problems that threaten us on the horizon . to put it simply , you can set yourself a lot of goals at the start of a presidency , but life can take you in a different direction .
i do n't think the french presidency would have predicted that their main tasks would involve handling the conflict in the caucasus and the beginning of the economic crisis . i 'd like to come back to these topics individually .
but i 'm also interested in the future of the lisbon reform treaty .
the czech republic is one of two countries that has not approved it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzenberg said the financial crisis will remain a major focus god knows that 's true .
that 's been delayed now , firstly because of the proceedings at the constitutional court , and arguments in parliament .
but i 'm assuming it will happen within the next six weeks . the czech president vaclav klaus is a decided opponent to the reform treaty , and he 's also said the eu presidency is a totally unimportant thing. hhow do you live , how do you work with a president that is so disrespectful toward the european union ? well look , i do n't live with him .
the president knows that i have different opinions to him , and i know that about him .
we 've had almost two years now to get used to this situation .
foreign policy is dictated by the government , not by the president .
you ca n't choose the kind of relationship you have with a head of state , it 's there and you have to live with it . in france , there 's been public speculation about whether the czech republic is even in a position to lead the european union in this very critical time .
did it hurt you to hear what was coming from the french president 's circle ? no , not in the least .
i 'm not that easily hurt .
i 've been through a lot in my life , i 've seen a lot .
we 'll see if such statements are still being made by the end of our presidency .
i 'm well aware that many smaller countries have had to deal with similar sentiments at the start of their presidencies .
i think it 's just part of the political banter that comes with a presidency and i do n't take it that seriously . you yourself once referred to french president nicolas sarkozy with much admiration as the " spirit of restlessness in politics . "
how satisfied are you with the restlessness that france has brought to the eu in its six-month presidency ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy gets kudos for his handling of the financial crisis i think , all in all , we should be very grateful to the french president .
there were single steps , isolated remarks that i was n't particularly thrilled about .
but i think we have to say that the sarkozy 's energetic handling of the crisis in the caucasus is something europe can be very thankful for , as were his efforts to do something about the economic crisis .
we 'll have to see if the measures he took were the right ones .
that 's beyond my economic expertise , but in any case , it was a presidency that took action . the global economic crisis was n't foreseeable when france took over .
you 're inheriting this problem now .
what are your expectations ?
how bad do you think this crisis will get ? i think it 's something we have to take very , very seriously .
that does n't mean - and i would like to emphasize this - that we should start to panic .
given the situation , that would be the worst thing we could do .
the tried and trusted rules of economics should n't be thrown overboard in a moment of panic . but we should be aware that emergency measures are sometimes needed .
and if i were to break my leg today , i would have to accept that i would have to wear a cast for a while .
but we all know that if you wear a cast for too long , the muscles start to weaken to the point that it could cause lasting damage .
so , like i said , all these emergency measures and regulations should be used very carefully .
they should not be used permanently , and only goal-oriented measures should be used to combat the crisis . an important matter for the eu is always its relations with its eastern neighbors .
should countries such as moldova or ukraine be introduced as members of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty remains a sticking point this will take very , very long , i fear , very long .
but i believe it is in our greatest interests that this prospect stays alive .
it is an engine for reform , real motivation .
whether it concerns the western european states or also these states , this prospect is the strongest motivation to push the necessary reforms . and these reforms are in our greatest interests .
in discussions we forget over and over again that reaching out to these countries is not a charitable activity , exclusively to the advantage of these states , but that we would be pre-empting difficulties we will inevitably have . what role should russia play in this concept ?
is it only a strategic energy supplier or is moscow also a part of this idea of political partnership ? russia is and will remain a world in itself , with which we should search for a healthy , fair relationship .
what does not simplify things is that certain developments in russia , even a return to an authoritarian system , worry us .
we are anxious about certain revisionist statements which are somewhat unsettling . but this changes nothing about the fact that not only as an energy supplier , but also as a security discussion partner in countless elements of policy and international politics , russia is a much-needed partner with whom we should have dialog and lead .
but not under all conditions , this of course is obvious .
we must still protect our own principles .

what are your expectations ?
how bad do you think this crisis will get ? i think it 's something we have to take very , very seriously .
that does n't mean - and i would like to emphasize this - that we should start to panic .
given the situation , that would be the worst thing we could do .
the tried and trusted rules of economics should n't be thrown overboard in a moment of panic . but we should be aware that emergency measures are sometimes needed .
and if i were to break my leg today , i would have to accept that i would have to wear a cast for a while .
but we all know that if you wear a cast for too long , the muscles start to weaken to the point that it could cause lasting damage .
so , like i said , all these emergency measures and regulations should be used very carefully .
they should not be used permanently , and only goal-oriented measures should be used to combat the crisis . an important matter for the eu is always its relations with its eastern neighbors .

but i believe it is in our greatest interests that this prospect stays alive .
it is an engine for reform , real motivation .
whether it concerns the western european states or also these states , this prospect is the strongest motivation to push the necessary reforms . and these reforms are in our greatest interests .
in discussions we forget over and over again that reaching out to these countries is not a charitable activity , exclusively to the advantage of these states , but that we would be pre-empting difficulties we will inevitably have . what role should russia play in this concept ?

what does not simplify things is that certain developments in russia , even a return to an authoritarian system , worry us .
we are anxious about certain revisionist statements which are somewhat unsettling . but this changes nothing about the fact that not only as an energy supplier , but also as a security discussion partner in countless elements of policy and international politics , russia is a much-needed partner with whom we should have dialog and lead .

1 from current holder france .
czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg spoke with dw about his country 's intentions for its eu presidency . deutsche welle : in a few weeks , the czech republic will take over the eu presidency .
what are the goals you 've set for the next six months ? karel schwarzenberg : the goals that we originally set are already known : on the one hand , supporting the development of the eastern " neighborhood ; " secondly , driving forward the integration process in the western balkans ; and thirdly , a europe without barriers .
a liberal europe , a europe that does n't close itself off , but meets all challenges . now , it could be as with several other presidencies , that our presidency will be dependent on other things .
the financial crisis is no longer just on the horizon , it 's being felt full-on in europe .
i 'm afraid that this will absorb a great deal of our presidency and that will be something we 'll really have to deal with .
there are also numerous foreign policy problems that threaten us on the horizon . to put it simply , you can set yourself a lot of goals at the start of a presidency , but life can take you in a different direction .
i do n't think the french presidency would have predicted that their main tasks would involve handling the conflict in the caucasus and the beginning of the economic crisis . i 'd like to come back to these topics individually .
but i 'm also interested in the future of the lisbon reform treaty .
the czech republic is one of two countries that has not approved it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzenberg said the financial crisis will remain a major focus god knows that 's true .
that 's been delayed now , firstly because of the proceedings at the constitutional court , and arguments in parliament .
but i 'm assuming it will happen within the next six weeks . the czech president vaclav klaus is a decided opponent to the reform treaty , and he 's also said the eu presidency is a totally unimportant thing. hhow do you live , how do you work with a president that is so disrespectful toward the european union ? well look , i do n't live with him .
the president knows that i have different opinions to him , and i know that about him .
we 've had almost two years now to get used to this situation .
foreign policy is dictated by the government , not by the president .
you ca n't choose the kind of relationship you have with a head of state , it 's there and you have to live with it . in france , there 's been public speculation about whether the czech republic is even in a position to lead the european union in this very critical time .
did it hurt you to hear what was coming from the french president 's circle ? no , not in the least .
i 'm not that easily hurt .
i 've been through a lot in my life , i 've seen a lot .
we 'll see if such statements are still being made by the end of our presidency .
i 'm well aware that many smaller countries have had to deal with similar sentiments at the start of their presidencies .
i think it 's just part of the political banter that comes with a presidency and i do n't take it that seriously . you yourself once referred to french president nicolas sarkozy with much admiration as the " spirit of restlessness in politics . "
how satisfied are you with the restlessness that france has brought to the eu in its six-month presidency ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy gets kudos for his handling of the financial crisis i think , all in all , we should be very grateful to the french president .
there were single steps , isolated remarks that i was n't particularly thrilled about .
but i think we have to say that the sarkozy 's energetic handling of the crisis in the caucasus is something europe can be very thankful for , as were his efforts to do something about the economic crisis .
we 'll have to see if the measures he took were the right ones .
that 's beyond my economic expertise , but in any case , it was a presidency that took action . the global economic crisis was n't foreseeable when france took over .

after all , bribery appears to have been an everyday occurrence for the international group when it came to getting contracts .
and nothing changed when laws were passed in germany - as in other industrial nations - that clearly forbid bribery , and the company 's shares began trading on the new york stock exchange .
in an unrivalled review , a legion of lawyers and accountants examined each and every siemens document .
for the time period between 1999 and 2006 , bribes on the order of 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- were uncovered .
it turns out that siemens workers and representatives around the globe had felt free to use money from secret accounts if it seemed useful for garnering contracts .

16 , that the government 's stimulus package " might not suffice . " but merkel hinted that she wants to coordinate future efforts with the incoming barack obama administration .
if the financial crisis is such that the us will consider further measures after obama takes office on jan .
20 , " it will also be right to put together a second program in germany at a similar time , " she added .
merkel remains under pressure from other european countries to move quickly with cut taxes or vouchers to encourage spending .
merkel continues to oppose such plans , even though they are being undertaken elsewhere in europe .
paving the road to recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some want merkel to put more money in consumers ' hands instead , merkel favors tackling a backlog of road projects to stimulating the economy , she said in a speech tuesday to the center for european economic research , a think tank in mannheim , germany .
she called on germany 's states to send in their project lists as soon as possible , wanting to get going by the early spring .
most of the states have a backlog of detailed engineering proposals for projects that have been waiting for federal funding .
quoting government sources , press reports have said berlin is preparing to invest 20 billion to 30 billion euros in a fresh economic stimulus plan that will include public investment and consumer incentives , according to afp news agency .
" we will take action again in january - another few billion could come together , " merkel was quoted as saying by the dow jones newswires .
merkel said the fresh investment could go toward infrastructure improvements including roads , broadband communications networks and renovation of schools , as well as subsidies for temporary jobs .
no time to lose ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists are predicting that 2009 will be a rough year for germany a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said on tuesday that the government fears the german economy could contract by 3.0 percent or more next year , marking the worst recession in german post-war history .
the bdb commercial banks ' association backed up this assessment , predicting that germany will suffer its deepest recession since world war two next year .
as long as the bad news about germany 's economy continues , it 's unlikely that european allies such as france will let up pressure on merkel to do more and do it quickly .
yet with national elections scheduled for next fall , merkel is taking a cautious approach .
that has lead to criticism from those in her party who want to see the government do more .
economy minister michael glos emphasized that the government still has the scope to increase its economic stimulus package if necessary .
glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has repeatedly argued in favor of cutting taxes .
a poll done for germany 's stern magazine and rtl television showed that support for merkel and her party continues to drop due to concerns over the financial crisis . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 16.12.2008 opinion : siemens got off lightly , but there 's more to come großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the biggest bribery scandal in german business history , siemens had to pay fines amounting to nearly a billion euros .
ultimately , though , it got off easy , says dw 's karl zawadzky . considering the extent of the corruption affair , siemens is getting off relatively unscathed .
after all , bribery appears to have been an everyday occurrence for the international group when it came to getting contracts .
and nothing changed when laws were passed in germany - as in other industrial nations - that clearly forbid bribery , and the company 's shares began trading on the new york stock exchange .
in an unrivalled review , a legion of lawyers and accountants examined each and every siemens document .
for the time period between 1999 and 2006 , bribes on the order of 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- were uncovered .
it turns out that siemens workers and representatives around the globe had felt free to use money from secret accounts if it seemed useful for garnering contracts .
given the dimensions of the situation , siemens is getting off more lightly with its fine than most people would have expected .
especially when it comes to the settlement it agreed to with the us ministry of justice and the securities watchdog , the sec .
lesson learned , moving on siemens will pay 620 million euros to the us .
it could have been much worse .
and it would have been , if siemens had been blocked from competing for public contracts in the us for a period of many years .
the intense inspection of its books no doubt made an impression .
moreover , managers throughout the firm have been let go .
siemens learned its lesson .
it can now hope that its us unit will profit from the enormous infrastructure program planned by us president elect barack obama .
in order not to fall back into old , corrupt habits , ex-german finance minister theo waigel - today a lawyer in munich - has been named " compliance monitor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky in the us , such monitoring is a common component of a criminal proceedings settlements .
in germany , the munich prosecutor 's office imposed a fine of 395 million euros , which siemens accepted .
that - along with the payment to the us and setting up the monitoring system that theo waigel will oversee - is the end of the state 's lawsuit against siemens over the bribery of public officials .
siemens can survive the financial hit .
even without corruption , the company 's business is strong - and in its year-end accounts , siemens thought to lay aside a billion euros to pay off fines .
but that 's not the end of the story .
the state prosecutor 's office still has open legal proceedings against specific former company directors , including longtime ceo and supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , on grounds they breached oversight rules .
siemens is suing former executives on top of that , siemens itself is suing former executives for millions in compensatory damages , on the grounds that the board of directors failed to institute internal controls that would prevent a regular culture of bribery - either that , or they intentionally looked the other way .
and there 's another reason the affair is not yet over : clients around the globe are preparing suits for damages because they think the bribery costs increased the prices they paid for goods or services .
moreover , countries want to know which of their officials took bribes from siemens .
even though the big lawsuits in germany and the us ended with settlements and fines , siemens will be processing one of the darkest chapters in its more-than-100-year-old corporate history for years to come .
on top of this , the damage to company 's reputation has been great , and no amount of money can ever fix it the case of siemens turns out to be a perfect example of the adage : corruption does n't pay .

meps debated with the leader on topics including georgia , the financial crisis and climate change . france 's president nicolas sarkozy said his country had aimed to organize its six-month presidency on the basis of two convictions . " the world needs a strong europe and that europe can not be strong if it is not united , " sarkozy told the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday , dec .
16 .
a strong europe was one that " rejects consensus based on pushing problems to one side , " he said . sarkozy said france 's presidency had been forced to follow " the rhythm of international events , " among them the russia-georgia conflict in august and the worldwide financial crisis in september .
though he had tried to change europe in this time , europe had in fact changed him , he said . " i really think that each head of state or government would benefit at some time from this responsibility , " sarkozy said .

five tribesmen led by abdu-rabu saleh al-tam were holding the hostages in a house in the mountain village of naba 'ah in the khawlan district , about 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- from sana 'a .
prisoner release demanded " security forces cordoned off the house and closed all roads leading to the village , " an interior ministry official told dpa news agency .
" this is intended to prevent the kidnappers from changing their hideout or moving the hostages to another area , " the official said .
he said the kidnappers demanded the release of al-tam 's son and brother who have been jailed at the central prison in sana 'a for abducting five yemeni engineers and holding them hostage for six months last year .
al-tam also demanded authorities pay him 40 million riyals -lrb- $ 200,000 or 147,000 euros -rrb- in compensation for a property in sana 'a , the ownership of which he disputed with an influential businessman , the official said .

16 , were allegedly plotting to re-organize cosa nostra 's command structure under the orders of one of italy 's most wanted mafia bosses , matteo messina denaro , who remains on the run , a police statement said .
some 1,200 carabinieri paramilitary police , backed by helicopter units and anti-drug dog squads , took part in tuesday 's operation , which was mainly conducted in the area near palermo , sicily , the statement said .
those arrested face charges including extortion , arms dealing , drug-trafficking and " membership of a mafia organization , " it said .
messina denaro is assumed to have taken over cosa nostra 's leadership following the arrest of the previous " godfather , " bernardo provenzano , in april 2006 .
investigators suspect that messina denaro intended , together with several of those arrested , to reconstitute cosa nostra 's governing " cupola " a sort of commission in which representatives of the main crime families take decisions collectively .
the cupola system fell into disuse following the arrest of former mafia kingpin toto riina in 1993 and italian authorities ' subsequent crackdown on the sicilian mafia 's structures . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 16.12.2008 opinion : siemens got off lightly , but there 's more to come großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the biggest bribery scandal in german business history , siemens had to pay fines amounting to nearly a billion euros .
ultimately , though , it got off easy , says dw 's karl zawadzky . considering the extent of the corruption affair , siemens is getting off relatively unscathed .
after all , bribery appears to have been an everyday occurrence for the international group when it came to getting contracts .
and nothing changed when laws were passed in germany - as in other industrial nations - that clearly forbid bribery , and the company 's shares began trading on the new york stock exchange .
in an unrivalled review , a legion of lawyers and accountants examined each and every siemens document .
for the time period between 1999 and 2006 , bribes on the order of 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- were uncovered .
it turns out that siemens workers and representatives around the globe had felt free to use money from secret accounts if it seemed useful for garnering contracts .
given the dimensions of the situation , siemens is getting off more lightly with its fine than most people would have expected .
especially when it comes to the settlement it agreed to with the us ministry of justice and the securities watchdog , the sec .
lesson learned , moving on siemens will pay 620 million euros to the us .
it could have been much worse .
and it would have been , if siemens had been blocked from competing for public contracts in the us for a period of many years .
the intense inspection of its books no doubt made an impression .
moreover , managers throughout the firm have been let go .
siemens learned its lesson .
it can now hope that its us unit will profit from the enormous infrastructure program planned by us president elect barack obama .
in order not to fall back into old , corrupt habits , ex-german finance minister theo waigel - today a lawyer in munich - has been named " compliance monitor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky in the us , such monitoring is a common component of a criminal proceedings settlements .
in germany , the munich prosecutor 's office imposed a fine of 395 million euros , which siemens accepted .
that - along with the payment to the us and setting up the monitoring system that theo waigel will oversee - is the end of the state 's lawsuit against siemens over the bribery of public officials .
siemens can survive the financial hit .
even without corruption , the company 's business is strong - and in its year-end accounts , siemens thought to lay aside a billion euros to pay off fines .
but that 's not the end of the story .
the state prosecutor 's office still has open legal proceedings against specific former company directors , including longtime ceo and supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , on grounds they breached oversight rules .
siemens is suing former executives on top of that , siemens itself is suing former executives for millions in compensatory damages , on the grounds that the board of directors failed to institute internal controls that would prevent a regular culture of bribery - either that , or they intentionally looked the other way .
and there 's another reason the affair is not yet over : clients around the globe are preparing suits for damages because they think the bribery costs increased the prices they paid for goods or services .
moreover , countries want to know which of their officials took bribes from siemens .
even though the big lawsuits in germany and the us ended with settlements and fines , siemens will be processing one of the darkest chapters in its more-than-100-year-old corporate history for years to come .
on top of this , the damage to company 's reputation has been great , and no amount of money can ever fix it the case of siemens turns out to be a perfect example of the adage : corruption does n't pay .

ultimately , though , it got off easy , says dw 's karl zawadzky . considering the extent of the corruption affair , siemens is getting off relatively unscathed .
after all , bribery appears to have been an everyday occurrence for the international group when it came to getting contracts .
and nothing changed when laws were passed in germany - as in other industrial nations - that clearly forbid bribery , and the company 's shares began trading on the new york stock exchange .
in an unrivalled review , a legion of lawyers and accountants examined each and every siemens document .
for the time period between 1999 and 2006 , bribes on the order of 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- were uncovered .
it turns out that siemens workers and representatives around the globe had felt free to use money from secret accounts if it seemed useful for garnering contracts .
given the dimensions of the situation , siemens is getting off more lightly with its fine than most people would have expected .
especially when it comes to the settlement it agreed to with the us ministry of justice and the securities watchdog , the sec .
lesson learned , moving on siemens will pay 620 million euros to the us .
it could have been much worse .
and it would have been , if siemens had been blocked from competing for public contracts in the us for a period of many years .
the intense inspection of its books no doubt made an impression .
moreover , managers throughout the firm have been let go .
siemens learned its lesson .
it can now hope that its us unit will profit from the enormous infrastructure program planned by us president elect barack obama .
in order not to fall back into old , corrupt habits , ex-german finance minister theo waigel - today a lawyer in munich - has been named " compliance monitor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky in the us , such monitoring is a common component of a criminal proceedings settlements .
in germany , the munich prosecutor 's office imposed a fine of 395 million euros , which siemens accepted .
that - along with the payment to the us and setting up the monitoring system that theo waigel will oversee - is the end of the state 's lawsuit against siemens over the bribery of public officials .
siemens can survive the financial hit .
even without corruption , the company 's business is strong - and in its year-end accounts , siemens thought to lay aside a billion euros to pay off fines .
but that 's not the end of the story .
the state prosecutor 's office still has open legal proceedings against specific former company directors , including longtime ceo and supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , on grounds they breached oversight rules .
siemens is suing former executives on top of that , siemens itself is suing former executives for millions in compensatory damages , on the grounds that the board of directors failed to institute internal controls that would prevent a regular culture of bribery - either that , or they intentionally looked the other way .
and there 's another reason the affair is not yet over : clients around the globe are preparing suits for damages because they think the bribery costs increased the prices they paid for goods or services .
moreover , countries want to know which of their officials took bribes from siemens .
even though the big lawsuits in germany and the us ended with settlements and fines , siemens will be processing one of the darkest chapters in its more-than-100-year-old corporate history for years to come .
on top of this , the damage to company 's reputation has been great , and no amount of money can ever fix it the case of siemens turns out to be a perfect example of the adage : corruption does n't pay .

investigators suspect that messina denaro intended , together with several of those arrested , to reconstitute cosa nostra 's governing " cupola " a sort of commission in which representatives of the main crime families take decisions collectively .
the cupola system fell into disuse following the arrest of former mafia kingpin toto riina in 1993 and italian authorities ' subsequent crackdown on the sicilian mafia 's structures . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , the 52-year-old police chief in the bavarian german city of passau , alois mannichl , was stabbed when he answered his door at home .
the attack was alleged to be a reprisal from the neo-nazi scene ; mannichl had taken a firm stand against far-right supporters in recent years .
police arrested and then released two suspects .
some are now calling for a ban on germany 's far-right political party , the npd .
deutsche welle spoke to konrad freiberg , the head of the union of german police officers -lrb- gdp -rrb- about what the stabbing represents .
deutsche welle : herr freiberg , you said the attempted murder of the passau police chief represents a strategy change on the part of the extreme right .
why ?
konrad freiberg : in the past the violent right-wing activists were respectful to the police .
that has changed radically .
now , in demonstrations that include the npd , the police are frequently targets of physical attacks by the far right .
they verbally abuse the police as well .
that represents a change .
what do you think accounts for this change ?
there is a strategy debate among the far-right wing .
some insist that political means are the way to achieve power , and they want to create change via parliament or local councils .
but others say the way is violence , there is no other way .
so the anger from this group continues to grow .
how long has this strategic change been going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiberg said one must examine the causes of far-right extremism i 'd have to say for about a year .
we feel it very clearly .
there have been a lot of threats against colleagues who took a stand against the extreme right , or whose job description includes responsibility for this area of security .
there have been threats and attacks on those people in the private sphere .
things have really changed .
the extreme right is not only a problem in germany but in other european countries as well .
has anything similar to the passau attack taken place elsewhere in europe ?
yes , there have been attacks on the police by the extreme right in other european countries .
the right wing is making an effort to build itself up internationally .
at many meetings and demonstrations people come from different countries , especially the netherlands , and also italy .
so there is cooperation .
but we know and must recognize that this attack was a single case , without a doubt , and has no relation to an international plan of any sort .
to what degree is germany 's far-right extremist scene tied to those in other european countries , if indeed that is the case ?
there are international meetings .
and at large national meetings they try , as often as possible , to have some international participation .
at these meetings they all cheer together , saying things like " all europe is turning brown . "
that 's just the way it is .
that 's why we have to watch out that the german extreme right does n't increase its own strength by drawing strength from the international extreme right .
what should germany - and europe - do about this ?
if you talk about fighting right-wing extremism , you have to look at the causes .
why do people get into it ?
on top of that you have to look at the living situation and perspectives of those who are involved .
but you also have to look at how the democratic parties , and civil society , deals with these people .
we ca n't only count on the police and justice system to fight them , because they ca n't solve the problem alone . interview : esther broders -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.12.2008 sarkozy bids european parliament farewell großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy , right addresses the european parliament in a speech to the european parliament , france 's president looked back on his country 's six-month term heading the eu .
meps debated with the leader on topics including georgia , the financial crisis and climate change . france 's president nicolas sarkozy said his country had aimed to organize its six-month presidency on the basis of two convictions . " the world needs a strong europe and that europe can not be strong if it is not united , " sarkozy told the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday , dec .
16 .
a strong europe was one that " rejects consensus based on pushing problems to one side , " he said . sarkozy said france 's presidency had been forced to follow " the rhythm of international events , " among them the russia-georgia conflict in august and the worldwide financial crisis in september .
though he had tried to change europe in this time , europe had in fact changed him , he said . " i really think that each head of state or government would benefit at some time from this responsibility , " sarkozy said .
" they would understand that whatever differences we have , there are so many things that bring us together .
when one has the chance over six months to learn about and to solve the problems of 27 nations , one gains tolerance , an opening of the spirit and one understands europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz said the french presidency had been " quite good " overall most meps applauded france on its term .
even the socialist leader in the european parliament , martin schulz , an outspoken critic of sarkozy 's , called the french eu presidency a success . " if the next presidency does the same i would be happy , " said schulz .
he said the french leader had " come out of the closet , as a pro-european . " the czech republic will take over the eu 's rotating presidency on january 1 , 2009 . heated debate on climate change sarkozy defended the eu 's climate change deal , which the bloc agreed on last week .
he told the parliament that there had been " an enormous fight " about climate change and energy as each member state had had " reason for dissatisfaction . "
he said compromises that had been agreed by leaders would avoid imposing unbearable sacrifices on its citizens . " we did n't want to impose constrictions which no country in the world could have survived socially , " sarkozy said . the president of the european commission jose manuel barroso said the climate change initiatives made europe the first to accept legally binding rules by 2020 . " and we will be strengthening these limits as agreement is reached globally , " barroso said .
" we can now turn to our friends in america and say to them : yes , you can ! " the conservative leader joseph daul said the climate change agreement would protect both the environment and jobs .
he said the eu now had to lead the worldwide fight against climate change , press the worst polluters to act and seek tangible commitments from us president barack obama once he took office . but daniel cohn-bendit from the greens called the swift adoption of the climate change package " blackmail . " european lawmakers will be voting on the climate change package on wednesday .
the parliament 's main political groups have already announced that they will be supporting the deal . alleviating the financial crisis most meps applauded france 's rapid reaction to the economic and financial crises .
socialist leader schulz said the presidency " did well " on the financial crisis .
sarkozy had reacted - albeit " somewhat late " - to the time-bomb of social imbalances in europe , schulz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most politicians applauded france 's presidency sarkozy said unity had been crucial in the global financial crisis .
if europe 's countries and institutions had not taken responsibility , this would have led to " the destruction of the european banking system , " he said . " we in europe want entrepreneurial capitalism not speculative capitalism , " sarkozy said .
" we have said this with one voice .
our economies and our political cultures are not the same , but we all agreed in the end . " conservative leader daul said the french presidency 's efforts had helped to win worldwide respect for europe 's coordinated response to the financial crisis . the presidency 's actions had brought about coordinated protection for savers ' deposits and recapitalization for banks , he said .
this had prevented a chain reaction in which thousands of jobs could have been lost , daul said . europe is not the enemy of the nations many parliamentary group leaders welcomed sarkozy 's and the french government 's swift and successful reaction to events in georgia .
sarkozy said his main aim during the georgian crisis had been " to stop the war and not fall into the same trap as in bosnia , " where the united states had taken the lead and europe followed . it had been a " real obsession " of france 's presidency that europe should " take responsibility " over georgia and fortunately europe had remained united over the issue , he said . sarkozy said in his conclusion that europe required an understanding between different nations .
he said that he was not an integrationist , but that he was determined to preserve the nation state . " however european you are , europe is not the enemy of the nations and the nations are not the enemy of europe , " sarkozy said .
" it is easier for europe to have big ambitions than small ones , because only big projects have the power to overcome national egos . " dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , that the government 's stimulus package " might not suffice . " but merkel hinted that she wants to coordinate future efforts with the incoming barack obama administration .
if the financial crisis is such that the us will consider further measures after obama takes office on jan .
20 , " it will also be right to put together a second program in germany at a similar time , " she added .
merkel remains under pressure from other european countries to move quickly with cut taxes or vouchers to encourage spending .
merkel continues to oppose such plans , even though they are being undertaken elsewhere in europe .
paving the road to recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some want merkel to put more money in consumers ' hands instead , merkel favors tackling a backlog of road projects to stimulating the economy , she said in a speech tuesday to the center for european economic research , a think tank in mannheim , germany .
she called on germany 's states to send in their project lists as soon as possible , wanting to get going by the early spring .
most of the states have a backlog of detailed engineering proposals for projects that have been waiting for federal funding .
quoting government sources , press reports have said berlin is preparing to invest 20 billion to 30 billion euros in a fresh economic stimulus plan that will include public investment and consumer incentives , according to afp news agency .
" we will take action again in january - another few billion could come together , " merkel was quoted as saying by the dow jones newswires .
merkel said the fresh investment could go toward infrastructure improvements including roads , broadband communications networks and renovation of schools , as well as subsidies for temporary jobs .

the bdb commercial banks ' association backed up this assessment , predicting that germany will suffer its deepest recession since world war two next year .
as long as the bad news about germany 's economy continues , it 's unlikely that european allies such as france will let up pressure on merkel to do more and do it quickly .
yet with national elections scheduled for next fall , merkel is taking a cautious approach .
that has lead to criticism from those in her party who want to see the government do more .
economy minister michael glos emphasized that the government still has the scope to increase its economic stimulus package if necessary .
glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has repeatedly argued in favor of cutting taxes .
a poll done for germany 's stern magazine and rtl television showed that support for merkel and her party continues to drop due to concerns over the financial crisis . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , the 52-year-old police chief in the bavarian german city of passau , alois mannichl , was stabbed when he answered his door at home .
the attack was alleged to be a reprisal from the neo-nazi scene ; mannichl had taken a firm stand against far-right supporters in recent years .
police arrested and then released two suspects .
some are now calling for a ban on germany 's far-right political party , the npd .
deutsche welle spoke to konrad freiberg , the head of the union of german police officers -lrb- gdp -rrb- about what the stabbing represents .
deutsche welle : herr freiberg , you said the attempted murder of the passau police chief represents a strategy change on the part of the extreme right .
why ?
konrad freiberg : in the past the violent right-wing activists were respectful to the police .
that has changed radically .
now , in demonstrations that include the npd , the police are frequently targets of physical attacks by the far right .
they verbally abuse the police as well .
that represents a change .
what do you think accounts for this change ?
there is a strategy debate among the far-right wing .
some insist that political means are the way to achieve power , and they want to create change via parliament or local councils .
but others say the way is violence , there is no other way .
so the anger from this group continues to grow .
how long has this strategic change been going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiberg said one must examine the causes of far-right extremism i 'd have to say for about a year .
we feel it very clearly .
there have been a lot of threats against colleagues who took a stand against the extreme right , or whose job description includes responsibility for this area of security .
there have been threats and attacks on those people in the private sphere .
things have really changed .
the extreme right is not only a problem in germany but in other european countries as well .
has anything similar to the passau attack taken place elsewhere in europe ?
yes , there have been attacks on the police by the extreme right in other european countries .
the right wing is making an effort to build itself up internationally .
at many meetings and demonstrations people come from different countries , especially the netherlands , and also italy .
so there is cooperation .
but we know and must recognize that this attack was a single case , without a doubt , and has no relation to an international plan of any sort .
to what degree is germany 's far-right extremist scene tied to those in other european countries , if indeed that is the case ?
there are international meetings .
and at large national meetings they try , as often as possible , to have some international participation .
at these meetings they all cheer together , saying things like " all europe is turning brown . "
that 's just the way it is .
that 's why we have to watch out that the german extreme right does n't increase its own strength by drawing strength from the international extreme right .
what should germany - and europe - do about this ?
if you talk about fighting right-wing extremism , you have to look at the causes .
why do people get into it ?
on top of that you have to look at the living situation and perspectives of those who are involved .
but you also have to look at how the democratic parties , and civil society , deals with these people .
we ca n't only count on the police and justice system to fight them , because they ca n't solve the problem alone . interview : esther broders -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 from current holder france .
czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg spoke with dw about his country 's intentions for its eu presidency . deutsche welle : in a few weeks , the czech republic will take over the eu presidency .
what are the goals you 've set for the next six months ? karel schwarzenberg : the goals that we originally set are already known : on the one hand , supporting the development of the eastern " neighborhood ; " secondly , driving forward the integration process in the western balkans ; and thirdly , a europe without barriers .
a liberal europe , a europe that does n't close itself off , but meets all challenges . now , it could be as with several other presidencies , that our presidency will be dependent on other things .
the financial crisis is no longer just on the horizon , it 's being felt full-on in europe .
i 'm afraid that this will absorb a great deal of our presidency and that will be something we 'll really have to deal with .
there are also numerous foreign policy problems that threaten us on the horizon . to put it simply , you can set yourself a lot of goals at the start of a presidency , but life can take you in a different direction .
i do n't think the french presidency would have predicted that their main tasks would involve handling the conflict in the caucasus and the beginning of the economic crisis . i 'd like to come back to these topics individually .
but i 'm also interested in the future of the lisbon reform treaty .
the czech republic is one of two countries that has not approved it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzenberg said the financial crisis will remain a major focus god knows that 's true .
that 's been delayed now , firstly because of the proceedings at the constitutional court , and arguments in parliament .
but i 'm assuming it will happen within the next six weeks . the czech president vaclav klaus is a decided opponent to the reform treaty , and he 's also said the eu presidency is a totally unimportant thing. hhow do you live , how do you work with a president that is so disrespectful toward the european union ? well look , i do n't live with him .
the president knows that i have different opinions to him , and i know that about him .
we 've had almost two years now to get used to this situation .
foreign policy is dictated by the government , not by the president .
you ca n't choose the kind of relationship you have with a head of state , it 's there and you have to live with it . in france , there 's been public speculation about whether the czech republic is even in a position to lead the european union in this very critical time .
did it hurt you to hear what was coming from the french president 's circle ? no , not in the least .
i 'm not that easily hurt .
i 've been through a lot in my life , i 've seen a lot .
we 'll see if such statements are still being made by the end of our presidency .
i 'm well aware that many smaller countries have had to deal with similar sentiments at the start of their presidencies .
i think it 's just part of the political banter that comes with a presidency and i do n't take it that seriously . you yourself once referred to french president nicolas sarkozy with much admiration as the " spirit of restlessness in politics . "
how satisfied are you with the restlessness that france has brought to the eu in its six-month presidency ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy gets kudos for his handling of the financial crisis i think , all in all , we should be very grateful to the french president .
there were single steps , isolated remarks that i was n't particularly thrilled about .
but i think we have to say that the sarkozy 's energetic handling of the crisis in the caucasus is something europe can be very thankful for , as were his efforts to do something about the economic crisis .
we 'll have to see if the measures he took were the right ones .
that 's beyond my economic expertise , but in any case , it was a presidency that took action . the global economic crisis was n't foreseeable when france took over .
you 're inheriting this problem now .
what are your expectations ?
how bad do you think this crisis will get ? i think it 's something we have to take very , very seriously .
that does n't mean - and i would like to emphasize this - that we should start to panic .
given the situation , that would be the worst thing we could do .
the tried and trusted rules of economics should n't be thrown overboard in a moment of panic . but we should be aware that emergency measures are sometimes needed .
and if i were to break my leg today , i would have to accept that i would have to wear a cast for a while .
but we all know that if you wear a cast for too long , the muscles start to weaken to the point that it could cause lasting damage .
so , like i said , all these emergency measures and regulations should be used very carefully .
they should not be used permanently , and only goal-oriented measures should be used to combat the crisis . an important matter for the eu is always its relations with its eastern neighbors .
should countries such as moldova or ukraine be introduced as members of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty remains a sticking point this will take very , very long , i fear , very long .
but i believe it is in our greatest interests that this prospect stays alive .
it is an engine for reform , real motivation .
whether it concerns the western european states or also these states , this prospect is the strongest motivation to push the necessary reforms . and these reforms are in our greatest interests .
in discussions we forget over and over again that reaching out to these countries is not a charitable activity , exclusively to the advantage of these states , but that we would be pre-empting difficulties we will inevitably have . what role should russia play in this concept ?
is it only a strategic energy supplier or is moscow also a part of this idea of political partnership ? russia is and will remain a world in itself , with which we should search for a healthy , fair relationship .
what does not simplify things is that certain developments in russia , even a return to an authoritarian system , worry us .
we are anxious about certain revisionist statements which are somewhat unsettling . but this changes nothing about the fact that not only as an energy supplier , but also as a security discussion partner in countless elements of policy and international politics , russia is a much-needed partner with whom we should have dialog and lead .
but not under all conditions , this of course is obvious .
we must still protect our own principles .
but dialog with russia is always useful and necessary . interview : christian trippe -lrb- dc / dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 from current holder france .
czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg spoke with dw about his country 's intentions for its eu presidency . deutsche welle : in a few weeks , the czech republic will take over the eu presidency .
what are the goals you 've set for the next six months ? karel schwarzenberg : the goals that we originally set are already known : on the one hand , supporting the development of the eastern " neighborhood ; " secondly , driving forward the integration process in the western balkans ; and thirdly , a europe without barriers .
a liberal europe , a europe that does n't close itself off , but meets all challenges . now , it could be as with several other presidencies , that our presidency will be dependent on other things .
the financial crisis is no longer just on the horizon , it 's being felt full-on in europe .
i 'm afraid that this will absorb a great deal of our presidency and that will be something we 'll really have to deal with .
there are also numerous foreign policy problems that threaten us on the horizon . to put it simply , you can set yourself a lot of goals at the start of a presidency , but life can take you in a different direction .
i do n't think the french presidency would have predicted that their main tasks would involve handling the conflict in the caucasus and the beginning of the economic crisis . i 'd like to come back to these topics individually .
but i 'm also interested in the future of the lisbon reform treaty .
the czech republic is one of two countries that has not approved it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzenberg said the financial crisis will remain a major focus god knows that 's true .
that 's been delayed now , firstly because of the proceedings at the constitutional court , and arguments in parliament .
but i 'm assuming it will happen within the next six weeks . the czech president vaclav klaus is a decided opponent to the reform treaty , and he 's also said the eu presidency is a totally unimportant thing. hhow do you live , how do you work with a president that is so disrespectful toward the european union ? well look , i do n't live with him .
the president knows that i have different opinions to him , and i know that about him .
we 've had almost two years now to get used to this situation .
foreign policy is dictated by the government , not by the president .
you ca n't choose the kind of relationship you have with a head of state , it 's there and you have to live with it . in france , there 's been public speculation about whether the czech republic is even in a position to lead the european union in this very critical time .
did it hurt you to hear what was coming from the french president 's circle ? no , not in the least .
i 'm not that easily hurt .
i 've been through a lot in my life , i 've seen a lot .
we 'll see if such statements are still being made by the end of our presidency .
i 'm well aware that many smaller countries have had to deal with similar sentiments at the start of their presidencies .
i think it 's just part of the political banter that comes with a presidency and i do n't take it that seriously . you yourself once referred to french president nicolas sarkozy with much admiration as the " spirit of restlessness in politics . "
how satisfied are you with the restlessness that france has brought to the eu in its six-month presidency ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy gets kudos for his handling of the financial crisis i think , all in all , we should be very grateful to the french president .
there were single steps , isolated remarks that i was n't particularly thrilled about .
but i think we have to say that the sarkozy 's energetic handling of the crisis in the caucasus is something europe can be very thankful for , as were his efforts to do something about the economic crisis .
we 'll have to see if the measures he took were the right ones .
that 's beyond my economic expertise , but in any case , it was a presidency that took action . the global economic crisis was n't foreseeable when france took over .
you 're inheriting this problem now .
what are your expectations ?
how bad do you think this crisis will get ? i think it 's something we have to take very , very seriously .
that does n't mean - and i would like to emphasize this - that we should start to panic .
given the situation , that would be the worst thing we could do .
the tried and trusted rules of economics should n't be thrown overboard in a moment of panic . but we should be aware that emergency measures are sometimes needed .
and if i were to break my leg today , i would have to accept that i would have to wear a cast for a while .
but we all know that if you wear a cast for too long , the muscles start to weaken to the point that it could cause lasting damage .
so , like i said , all these emergency measures and regulations should be used very carefully .
they should not be used permanently , and only goal-oriented measures should be used to combat the crisis . an important matter for the eu is always its relations with its eastern neighbors .
should countries such as moldova or ukraine be introduced as members of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty remains a sticking point this will take very , very long , i fear , very long .
but i believe it is in our greatest interests that this prospect stays alive .
it is an engine for reform , real motivation .
whether it concerns the western european states or also these states , this prospect is the strongest motivation to push the necessary reforms . and these reforms are in our greatest interests .
in discussions we forget over and over again that reaching out to these countries is not a charitable activity , exclusively to the advantage of these states , but that we would be pre-empting difficulties we will inevitably have . what role should russia play in this concept ?
is it only a strategic energy supplier or is moscow also a part of this idea of political partnership ? russia is and will remain a world in itself , with which we should search for a healthy , fair relationship .
what does not simplify things is that certain developments in russia , even a return to an authoritarian system , worry us .
we are anxious about certain revisionist statements which are somewhat unsettling . but this changes nothing about the fact that not only as an energy supplier , but also as a security discussion partner in countless elements of policy and international politics , russia is a much-needed partner with whom we should have dialog and lead .
but not under all conditions , this of course is obvious .
we must still protect our own principles .
but dialog with russia is always useful and necessary . interview : christian trippe -lrb- dc / dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 .
the abductors are holding three germans hostage in a remote area east of the capital , sana 'a .
security forces have closed in on their hideout , police said .
five tribesmen led by abdu-rabu saleh al-tam were holding the hostages in a house in the mountain village of naba 'ah in the khawlan district , about 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- from sana 'a .
prisoner release demanded " security forces cordoned off the house and closed all roads leading to the village , " an interior ministry official told dpa news agency .
" this is intended to prevent the kidnappers from changing their hideout or moving the hostages to another area , " the official said .
he said the kidnappers demanded the release of al-tam 's son and brother who have been jailed at the central prison in sana 'a for abducting five yemeni engineers and holding them hostage for six months last year .
al-tam also demanded authorities pay him 40 million riyals -lrb- $ 200,000 or 147,000 euros -rrb- in compensation for a property in sana 'a , the ownership of which he disputed with an influential businessman , the official said .

tribal sources said five men armed with ak-47 rifles snatched the three germans from their car as they left rada 'a on the way to sana 'a .
a source at the german embassy in sana 'a said the embassy had received assurances from authorities that no force would be used to free the hostages .
a german foreign ministry spokesman said german officials were in contact with yemeni authorities .
he declined to give further details .
kidnapping for living condititions the embassy official said the hostages , an employee of the german technical cooperation agency gtz and her parents , were in good health and had not been harmed . the london-based newspaper asharq al-awsat also said it had contacted one of the hostages who said she and the others had not been injured .
police arrested dozens of tribesmen from the bani dhabian tribe late monday to put pressure on the kidnappers to free the hostages , tribal sources told dpa .
a security official said monday that tribal elders had begun contacts with the kidnappers to secure the hostages ' release .
the bani dhabian tribe is known for kidnapping foreigners to press the government for better living conditions .
disgruntled tribesmen from impoverished areas of the arab country often take hostages to use as bargaining chips to press the government for aid , jobs or the release of detained fellow clansmen .

while unsold cars block germany 's biggest car terminal , france 's president promises help for his country 's auto makers . european consumers are continuing to buy fewer cars , according to the european automobile manufacturers ' association acea . " new passenger car registrations in europe fell by 25.8 percent in november compared to the same month of last year , declining for the seventh month in a row , mirroring the financial and economic crises , " the acea said in a statement on tuesday , dec .

acea said there had n't been such a notable decline since 1999 . germany , europe 's largest automobile market , saw registrations down 17.7 percent to 233,722 units .
all markets across the continent decreased except finland , poland and the czech republic . " the new eu member states long showed more resilience , in relative terms , because of the greater number of first-time buyers as opposed to the replacement market of western europe , " acea said . sarkozy pledges help the french government has said it will take action to save the country 's automobile industry .

aid was dependent on " the renunciation of any policy of deliberately encouraging the outsourcing " of production , he said . it was " incompatible with the closing of assembly factories in france , " sarkozy said . sarkozy 's office said that senior executives from the two largest french carmakers , renault and peugeot citroen , as well as representatives of the auto-equipment suppliers michelin and valeo took part in the meeting . the worst is yet to come in an interview published monday in the french daily le figaro , renault chief executive carlos ghosn said emergency government loans were necessary for the french car industry to survive the economic crisis . " what we are demanding from the state is some reasonable financing , over two to three years , at interest rates between four and five percent , " ghosn said . two out of every three cars was purchased on credit , he said . " if the finance crisis continues , you will see one producer after the other fail , " ghosn said . both renault and peugeot citroen have shut some of their factories to cut production as demand for cars in europe has plunged . acea figures for november showed the registration of new private cars in france down by more than 14 percent .
but , according to ghosn , the worst of the crisis still lies ahead . " we have n't touched bottom yet , " ghosn said . cars backlogged in germany the dramatic situation in the automobile industry has led to an excess of unsold cars at europe 's biggest car terminal in bremerhaven .

blg has been forced to find extra space in the area of the port normally reserved for shipping containers .
other cars are temporarily stored on freight trains . ships normally jam-packed with vehicles destined for the united states are now leaving almost empty because of the dramatic downturn on the us car market . the speed of the meltdown caught bremerhaven by surprise .

prisoner release demanded " security forces cordoned off the house and closed all roads leading to the village , " an interior ministry official told dpa news agency .
" this is intended to prevent the kidnappers from changing their hideout or moving the hostages to another area , " the official said .
he said the kidnappers demanded the release of al-tam 's son and brother who have been jailed at the central prison in sana 'a for abducting five yemeni engineers and holding them hostage for six months last year .
al-tam also demanded authorities pay him 40 million riyals -lrb- $ 200,000 or 147,000 euros -rrb- in compensation for a property in sana 'a , the ownership of which he disputed with an influential businessman , the official said .

1 from current holder france .
czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg spoke with dw about his country 's intentions for its eu presidency . deutsche welle : in a few weeks , the czech republic will take over the eu presidency .
what are the goals you 've set for the next six months ? karel schwarzenberg : the goals that we originally set are already known : on the one hand , supporting the development of the eastern " neighborhood ; " secondly , driving forward the integration process in the western balkans ; and thirdly , a europe without barriers .
a liberal europe , a europe that does n't close itself off , but meets all challenges . now , it could be as with several other presidencies , that our presidency will be dependent on other things .
the financial crisis is no longer just on the horizon , it 's being felt full-on in europe .
i 'm afraid that this will absorb a great deal of our presidency and that will be something we 'll really have to deal with .
there are also numerous foreign policy problems that threaten us on the horizon . to put it simply , you can set yourself a lot of goals at the start of a presidency , but life can take you in a different direction .
i do n't think the french presidency would have predicted that their main tasks would involve handling the conflict in the caucasus and the beginning of the economic crisis . i 'd like to come back to these topics individually .
but i 'm also interested in the future of the lisbon reform treaty .
the czech republic is one of two countries that has not approved it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzenberg said the financial crisis will remain a major focus god knows that 's true .
that 's been delayed now , firstly because of the proceedings at the constitutional court , and arguments in parliament .
but i 'm assuming it will happen within the next six weeks . the czech president vaclav klaus is a decided opponent to the reform treaty , and he 's also said the eu presidency is a totally unimportant thing. hhow do you live , how do you work with a president that is so disrespectful toward the european union ? well look , i do n't live with him .
the president knows that i have different opinions to him , and i know that about him .
we 've had almost two years now to get used to this situation .
foreign policy is dictated by the government , not by the president .
you ca n't choose the kind of relationship you have with a head of state , it 's there and you have to live with it . in france , there 's been public speculation about whether the czech republic is even in a position to lead the european union in this very critical time .
did it hurt you to hear what was coming from the french president 's circle ? no , not in the least .
i 'm not that easily hurt .
i 've been through a lot in my life , i 've seen a lot .
we 'll see if such statements are still being made by the end of our presidency .
i 'm well aware that many smaller countries have had to deal with similar sentiments at the start of their presidencies .
i think it 's just part of the political banter that comes with a presidency and i do n't take it that seriously . you yourself once referred to french president nicolas sarkozy with much admiration as the " spirit of restlessness in politics . "
how satisfied are you with the restlessness that france has brought to the eu in its six-month presidency ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy gets kudos for his handling of the financial crisis i think , all in all , we should be very grateful to the french president .
there were single steps , isolated remarks that i was n't particularly thrilled about .
but i think we have to say that the sarkozy 's energetic handling of the crisis in the caucasus is something europe can be very thankful for , as were his efforts to do something about the economic crisis .
we 'll have to see if the measures he took were the right ones .
that 's beyond my economic expertise , but in any case , it was a presidency that took action . the global economic crisis was n't foreseeable when france took over .
you 're inheriting this problem now .
what are your expectations ?
how bad do you think this crisis will get ? i think it 's something we have to take very , very seriously .
that does n't mean - and i would like to emphasize this - that we should start to panic .
given the situation , that would be the worst thing we could do .
the tried and trusted rules of economics should n't be thrown overboard in a moment of panic . but we should be aware that emergency measures are sometimes needed .
and if i were to break my leg today , i would have to accept that i would have to wear a cast for a while .
but we all know that if you wear a cast for too long , the muscles start to weaken to the point that it could cause lasting damage .
so , like i said , all these emergency measures and regulations should be used very carefully .
they should not be used permanently , and only goal-oriented measures should be used to combat the crisis . an important matter for the eu is always its relations with its eastern neighbors .
should countries such as moldova or ukraine be introduced as members of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty remains a sticking point this will take very , very long , i fear , very long .
but i believe it is in our greatest interests that this prospect stays alive .
it is an engine for reform , real motivation .
whether it concerns the western european states or also these states , this prospect is the strongest motivation to push the necessary reforms . and these reforms are in our greatest interests .
in discussions we forget over and over again that reaching out to these countries is not a charitable activity , exclusively to the advantage of these states , but that we would be pre-empting difficulties we will inevitably have . what role should russia play in this concept ?
is it only a strategic energy supplier or is moscow also a part of this idea of political partnership ? russia is and will remain a world in itself , with which we should search for a healthy , fair relationship .
what does not simplify things is that certain developments in russia , even a return to an authoritarian system , worry us .
we are anxious about certain revisionist statements which are somewhat unsettling . but this changes nothing about the fact that not only as an energy supplier , but also as a security discussion partner in countless elements of policy and international politics , russia is a much-needed partner with whom we should have dialog and lead .
but not under all conditions , this of course is obvious .
we must still protect our own principles .
but dialog with russia is always useful and necessary . interview : christian trippe -lrb- dc / dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 from current holder france .
czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg spoke with dw about his country 's intentions for its eu presidency . deutsche welle : in a few weeks , the czech republic will take over the eu presidency .
what are the goals you 've set for the next six months ? karel schwarzenberg : the goals that we originally set are already known : on the one hand , supporting the development of the eastern " neighborhood ; " secondly , driving forward the integration process in the western balkans ; and thirdly , a europe without barriers .
a liberal europe , a europe that does n't close itself off , but meets all challenges . now , it could be as with several other presidencies , that our presidency will be dependent on other things .
the financial crisis is no longer just on the horizon , it 's being felt full-on in europe .
i 'm afraid that this will absorb a great deal of our presidency and that will be something we 'll really have to deal with .
there are also numerous foreign policy problems that threaten us on the horizon . to put it simply , you can set yourself a lot of goals at the start of a presidency , but life can take you in a different direction .
i do n't think the french presidency would have predicted that their main tasks would involve handling the conflict in the caucasus and the beginning of the economic crisis . i 'd like to come back to these topics individually .
but i 'm also interested in the future of the lisbon reform treaty .
the czech republic is one of two countries that has not approved it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzenberg said the financial crisis will remain a major focus god knows that 's true .
that 's been delayed now , firstly because of the proceedings at the constitutional court , and arguments in parliament .
but i 'm assuming it will happen within the next six weeks . the czech president vaclav klaus is a decided opponent to the reform treaty , and he 's also said the eu presidency is a totally unimportant thing. hhow do you live , how do you work with a president that is so disrespectful toward the european union ? well look , i do n't live with him .
the president knows that i have different opinions to him , and i know that about him .
we 've had almost two years now to get used to this situation .
foreign policy is dictated by the government , not by the president .
you ca n't choose the kind of relationship you have with a head of state , it 's there and you have to live with it . in france , there 's been public speculation about whether the czech republic is even in a position to lead the european union in this very critical time .
did it hurt you to hear what was coming from the french president 's circle ? no , not in the least .
i 'm not that easily hurt .
i 've been through a lot in my life , i 've seen a lot .
we 'll see if such statements are still being made by the end of our presidency .
i 'm well aware that many smaller countries have had to deal with similar sentiments at the start of their presidencies .
i think it 's just part of the political banter that comes with a presidency and i do n't take it that seriously . you yourself once referred to french president nicolas sarkozy with much admiration as the " spirit of restlessness in politics . "
how satisfied are you with the restlessness that france has brought to the eu in its six-month presidency ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy gets kudos for his handling of the financial crisis i think , all in all , we should be very grateful to the french president .
there were single steps , isolated remarks that i was n't particularly thrilled about .
but i think we have to say that the sarkozy 's energetic handling of the crisis in the caucasus is something europe can be very thankful for , as were his efforts to do something about the economic crisis .
we 'll have to see if the measures he took were the right ones .
that 's beyond my economic expertise , but in any case , it was a presidency that took action . the global economic crisis was n't foreseeable when france took over .
you 're inheriting this problem now .
what are your expectations ?
how bad do you think this crisis will get ? i think it 's something we have to take very , very seriously .
that does n't mean - and i would like to emphasize this - that we should start to panic .
given the situation , that would be the worst thing we could do .
the tried and trusted rules of economics should n't be thrown overboard in a moment of panic . but we should be aware that emergency measures are sometimes needed .
and if i were to break my leg today , i would have to accept that i would have to wear a cast for a while .
but we all know that if you wear a cast for too long , the muscles start to weaken to the point that it could cause lasting damage .
so , like i said , all these emergency measures and regulations should be used very carefully .
they should not be used permanently , and only goal-oriented measures should be used to combat the crisis . an important matter for the eu is always its relations with its eastern neighbors .
should countries such as moldova or ukraine be introduced as members of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty remains a sticking point this will take very , very long , i fear , very long .
but i believe it is in our greatest interests that this prospect stays alive .
it is an engine for reform , real motivation .
whether it concerns the western european states or also these states , this prospect is the strongest motivation to push the necessary reforms . and these reforms are in our greatest interests .
in discussions we forget over and over again that reaching out to these countries is not a charitable activity , exclusively to the advantage of these states , but that we would be pre-empting difficulties we will inevitably have . what role should russia play in this concept ?
is it only a strategic energy supplier or is moscow also a part of this idea of political partnership ? russia is and will remain a world in itself , with which we should search for a healthy , fair relationship .
what does not simplify things is that certain developments in russia , even a return to an authoritarian system , worry us .
we are anxious about certain revisionist statements which are somewhat unsettling . but this changes nothing about the fact that not only as an energy supplier , but also as a security discussion partner in countless elements of policy and international politics , russia is a much-needed partner with whom we should have dialog and lead .
but not under all conditions , this of course is obvious .
we must still protect our own principles .
but dialog with russia is always useful and necessary . interview : christian trippe -lrb- dc / dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prisoner release demanded " security forces cordoned off the house and closed all roads leading to the village , " an interior ministry official told dpa news agency .
" this is intended to prevent the kidnappers from changing their hideout or moving the hostages to another area , " the official said .
he said the kidnappers demanded the release of al-tam 's son and brother who have been jailed at the central prison in sana 'a for abducting five yemeni engineers and holding them hostage for six months last year .
al-tam also demanded authorities pay him 40 million riyals -lrb- $ 200,000 or 147,000 euros -rrb- in compensation for a property in sana 'a , the ownership of which he disputed with an influential businessman , the official said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 16.12.2008 opinion : siemens got off lightly , but there 's more to come großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the biggest bribery scandal in german business history , siemens had to pay fines amounting to nearly a billion euros .
ultimately , though , it got off easy , says dw 's karl zawadzky . considering the extent of the corruption affair , siemens is getting off relatively unscathed .
after all , bribery appears to have been an everyday occurrence for the international group when it came to getting contracts .
and nothing changed when laws were passed in germany - as in other industrial nations - that clearly forbid bribery , and the company 's shares began trading on the new york stock exchange .
in an unrivalled review , a legion of lawyers and accountants examined each and every siemens document .
for the time period between 1999 and 2006 , bribes on the order of 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- were uncovered .
it turns out that siemens workers and representatives around the globe had felt free to use money from secret accounts if it seemed useful for garnering contracts .
given the dimensions of the situation , siemens is getting off more lightly with its fine than most people would have expected .
especially when it comes to the settlement it agreed to with the us ministry of justice and the securities watchdog , the sec .
lesson learned , moving on siemens will pay 620 million euros to the us .
it could have been much worse .
and it would have been , if siemens had been blocked from competing for public contracts in the us for a period of many years .
the intense inspection of its books no doubt made an impression .
moreover , managers throughout the firm have been let go .
siemens learned its lesson .
it can now hope that its us unit will profit from the enormous infrastructure program planned by us president elect barack obama .
in order not to fall back into old , corrupt habits , ex-german finance minister theo waigel - today a lawyer in munich - has been named " compliance monitor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky in the us , such monitoring is a common component of a criminal proceedings settlements .
in germany , the munich prosecutor 's office imposed a fine of 395 million euros , which siemens accepted .
that - along with the payment to the us and setting up the monitoring system that theo waigel will oversee - is the end of the state 's lawsuit against siemens over the bribery of public officials .
siemens can survive the financial hit .
even without corruption , the company 's business is strong - and in its year-end accounts , siemens thought to lay aside a billion euros to pay off fines .
but that 's not the end of the story .
the state prosecutor 's office still has open legal proceedings against specific former company directors , including longtime ceo and supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , on grounds they breached oversight rules .
siemens is suing former executives on top of that , siemens itself is suing former executives for millions in compensatory damages , on the grounds that the board of directors failed to institute internal controls that would prevent a regular culture of bribery - either that , or they intentionally looked the other way .
and there 's another reason the affair is not yet over : clients around the globe are preparing suits for damages because they think the bribery costs increased the prices they paid for goods or services .
moreover , countries want to know which of their officials took bribes from siemens .
even though the big lawsuits in germany and the us ended with settlements and fines , siemens will be processing one of the darkest chapters in its more-than-100-year-old corporate history for years to come .
on top of this , the damage to company 's reputation has been great , and no amount of money can ever fix it the case of siemens turns out to be a perfect example of the adage : corruption does n't pay .

16 , that the government 's stimulus package " might not suffice . " but merkel hinted that she wants to coordinate future efforts with the incoming barack obama administration .
if the financial crisis is such that the us will consider further measures after obama takes office on jan .
20 , " it will also be right to put together a second program in germany at a similar time , " she added .
merkel remains under pressure from other european countries to move quickly with cut taxes or vouchers to encourage spending .
merkel continues to oppose such plans , even though they are being undertaken elsewhere in europe .
paving the road to recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some want merkel to put more money in consumers ' hands instead , merkel favors tackling a backlog of road projects to stimulating the economy , she said in a speech tuesday to the center for european economic research , a think tank in mannheim , germany .
she called on germany 's states to send in their project lists as soon as possible , wanting to get going by the early spring .
most of the states have a backlog of detailed engineering proposals for projects that have been waiting for federal funding .
quoting government sources , press reports have said berlin is preparing to invest 20 billion to 30 billion euros in a fresh economic stimulus plan that will include public investment and consumer incentives , according to afp news agency .
" we will take action again in january - another few billion could come together , " merkel was quoted as saying by the dow jones newswires .
merkel said the fresh investment could go toward infrastructure improvements including roads , broadband communications networks and renovation of schools , as well as subsidies for temporary jobs .
no time to lose ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists are predicting that 2009 will be a rough year for germany a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said on tuesday that the government fears the german economy could contract by 3.0 percent or more next year , marking the worst recession in german post-war history .
the bdb commercial banks ' association backed up this assessment , predicting that germany will suffer its deepest recession since world war two next year .
as long as the bad news about germany 's economy continues , it 's unlikely that european allies such as france will let up pressure on merkel to do more and do it quickly .
yet with national elections scheduled for next fall , merkel is taking a cautious approach .
that has lead to criticism from those in her party who want to see the government do more .
economy minister michael glos emphasized that the government still has the scope to increase its economic stimulus package if necessary .
glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has repeatedly argued in favor of cutting taxes .
a poll done for germany 's stern magazine and rtl television showed that support for merkel and her party continues to drop due to concerns over the financial crisis . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 16.12.2008 far-right extremists are growing bolder , police official says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far right has a new , confrontational strategy for dealing with police in the wake of a suspected far-right attack on the passau police chief , dw spoke with the head of the german police union about changes in the neo-nazi scene . on saturday , dec .
13 , the 52-year-old police chief in the bavarian german city of passau , alois mannichl , was stabbed when he answered his door at home .
the attack was alleged to be a reprisal from the neo-nazi scene ; mannichl had taken a firm stand against far-right supporters in recent years .
police arrested and then released two suspects .
some are now calling for a ban on germany 's far-right political party , the npd .
deutsche welle spoke to konrad freiberg , the head of the union of german police officers -lrb- gdp -rrb- about what the stabbing represents .
deutsche welle : herr freiberg , you said the attempted murder of the passau police chief represents a strategy change on the part of the extreme right .
why ?
konrad freiberg : in the past the violent right-wing activists were respectful to the police .
that has changed radically .
now , in demonstrations that include the npd , the police are frequently targets of physical attacks by the far right .
they verbally abuse the police as well .
that represents a change .
what do you think accounts for this change ?
there is a strategy debate among the far-right wing .
some insist that political means are the way to achieve power , and they want to create change via parliament or local councils .
but others say the way is violence , there is no other way .
so the anger from this group continues to grow .
how long has this strategic change been going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiberg said one must examine the causes of far-right extremism i 'd have to say for about a year .
we feel it very clearly .
there have been a lot of threats against colleagues who took a stand against the extreme right , or whose job description includes responsibility for this area of security .
there have been threats and attacks on those people in the private sphere .
things have really changed .
the extreme right is not only a problem in germany but in other european countries as well .
has anything similar to the passau attack taken place elsewhere in europe ?
yes , there have been attacks on the police by the extreme right in other european countries .
the right wing is making an effort to build itself up internationally .
at many meetings and demonstrations people come from different countries , especially the netherlands , and also italy .
so there is cooperation .
but we know and must recognize that this attack was a single case , without a doubt , and has no relation to an international plan of any sort .
to what degree is germany 's far-right extremist scene tied to those in other european countries , if indeed that is the case ?
there are international meetings .
and at large national meetings they try , as often as possible , to have some international participation .
at these meetings they all cheer together , saying things like " all europe is turning brown . "
that 's just the way it is .
that 's why we have to watch out that the german extreme right does n't increase its own strength by drawing strength from the international extreme right .
what should germany - and europe - do about this ?
if you talk about fighting right-wing extremism , you have to look at the causes .
why do people get into it ?
on top of that you have to look at the living situation and perspectives of those who are involved .
but you also have to look at how the democratic parties , and civil society , deals with these people .
we ca n't only count on the police and justice system to fight them , because they ca n't solve the problem alone . interview : esther broders -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 16.12.2008 opinion : siemens got off lightly , but there 's more to come großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the biggest bribery scandal in german business history , siemens had to pay fines amounting to nearly a billion euros .
ultimately , though , it got off easy , says dw 's karl zawadzky . considering the extent of the corruption affair , siemens is getting off relatively unscathed .
after all , bribery appears to have been an everyday occurrence for the international group when it came to getting contracts .
and nothing changed when laws were passed in germany - as in other industrial nations - that clearly forbid bribery , and the company 's shares began trading on the new york stock exchange .
in an unrivalled review , a legion of lawyers and accountants examined each and every siemens document .
for the time period between 1999 and 2006 , bribes on the order of 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- were uncovered .
it turns out that siemens workers and representatives around the globe had felt free to use money from secret accounts if it seemed useful for garnering contracts .
given the dimensions of the situation , siemens is getting off more lightly with its fine than most people would have expected .
especially when it comes to the settlement it agreed to with the us ministry of justice and the securities watchdog , the sec .
lesson learned , moving on siemens will pay 620 million euros to the us .
it could have been much worse .
and it would have been , if siemens had been blocked from competing for public contracts in the us for a period of many years .
the intense inspection of its books no doubt made an impression .
moreover , managers throughout the firm have been let go .
siemens learned its lesson .
it can now hope that its us unit will profit from the enormous infrastructure program planned by us president elect barack obama .
in order not to fall back into old , corrupt habits , ex-german finance minister theo waigel - today a lawyer in munich - has been named " compliance monitor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky in the us , such monitoring is a common component of a criminal proceedings settlements .
in germany , the munich prosecutor 's office imposed a fine of 395 million euros , which siemens accepted .
that - along with the payment to the us and setting up the monitoring system that theo waigel will oversee - is the end of the state 's lawsuit against siemens over the bribery of public officials .
siemens can survive the financial hit .
even without corruption , the company 's business is strong - and in its year-end accounts , siemens thought to lay aside a billion euros to pay off fines .
but that 's not the end of the story .
the state prosecutor 's office still has open legal proceedings against specific former company directors , including longtime ceo and supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , on grounds they breached oversight rules .
siemens is suing former executives on top of that , siemens itself is suing former executives for millions in compensatory damages , on the grounds that the board of directors failed to institute internal controls that would prevent a regular culture of bribery - either that , or they intentionally looked the other way .
and there 's another reason the affair is not yet over : clients around the globe are preparing suits for damages because they think the bribery costs increased the prices they paid for goods or services .
moreover , countries want to know which of their officials took bribes from siemens .
even though the big lawsuits in germany and the us ended with settlements and fines , siemens will be processing one of the darkest chapters in its more-than-100-year-old corporate history for years to come .
on top of this , the damage to company 's reputation has been great , and no amount of money can ever fix it the case of siemens turns out to be a perfect example of the adage : corruption does n't pay .

it 's estimated that the battle fought there could have involved up to 1,000 roman fighters . according to a theory put forward by guenther moosbauer , an expert at the university of osnabrueck who studies roman-german history , a roman legion could have been seeking revenge after tribesman in 235 a.d. pushed roman troops south of the limes germanicus , a ring of forts that separated the empire from unconquered land to the north and east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 16.12.2008 opinion : siemens got off lightly , but there 's more to come großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the biggest bribery scandal in german business history , siemens had to pay fines amounting to nearly a billion euros .
ultimately , though , it got off easy , says dw 's karl zawadzky . considering the extent of the corruption affair , siemens is getting off relatively unscathed .
after all , bribery appears to have been an everyday occurrence for the international group when it came to getting contracts .
and nothing changed when laws were passed in germany - as in other industrial nations - that clearly forbid bribery , and the company 's shares began trading on the new york stock exchange .
in an unrivalled review , a legion of lawyers and accountants examined each and every siemens document .
for the time period between 1999 and 2006 , bribes on the order of 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- were uncovered .
it turns out that siemens workers and representatives around the globe had felt free to use money from secret accounts if it seemed useful for garnering contracts .
given the dimensions of the situation , siemens is getting off more lightly with its fine than most people would have expected .
especially when it comes to the settlement it agreed to with the us ministry of justice and the securities watchdog , the sec .
lesson learned , moving on siemens will pay 620 million euros to the us .
it could have been much worse .
and it would have been , if siemens had been blocked from competing for public contracts in the us for a period of many years .
the intense inspection of its books no doubt made an impression .
moreover , managers throughout the firm have been let go .
siemens learned its lesson .
it can now hope that its us unit will profit from the enormous infrastructure program planned by us president elect barack obama .
in order not to fall back into old , corrupt habits , ex-german finance minister theo waigel - today a lawyer in munich - has been named " compliance monitor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky in the us , such monitoring is a common component of a criminal proceedings settlements .
in germany , the munich prosecutor 's office imposed a fine of 395 million euros , which siemens accepted .
that - along with the payment to the us and setting up the monitoring system that theo waigel will oversee - is the end of the state 's lawsuit against siemens over the bribery of public officials .
siemens can survive the financial hit .
even without corruption , the company 's business is strong - and in its year-end accounts , siemens thought to lay aside a billion euros to pay off fines .
but that 's not the end of the story .
the state prosecutor 's office still has open legal proceedings against specific former company directors , including longtime ceo and supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , on grounds they breached oversight rules .
siemens is suing former executives on top of that , siemens itself is suing former executives for millions in compensatory damages , on the grounds that the board of directors failed to institute internal controls that would prevent a regular culture of bribery - either that , or they intentionally looked the other way .
and there 's another reason the affair is not yet over : clients around the globe are preparing suits for damages because they think the bribery costs increased the prices they paid for goods or services .
moreover , countries want to know which of their officials took bribes from siemens .
even though the big lawsuits in germany and the us ended with settlements and fines , siemens will be processing one of the darkest chapters in its more-than-100-year-old corporate history for years to come .
on top of this , the damage to company 's reputation has been great , and no amount of money can ever fix it the case of siemens turns out to be a perfect example of the adage : corruption does n't pay .

pictures of the icy satellite enceladus suggest its surface splits and spreads apart - just like the ocean floor on our planet splits to create new crust .
the information was released at a meeting of the american geophysical union in san francisco .
the data from the cassini spacecraft is said to strengthen the idea that enceladus harbours a sub-surface sea .
" bit by bit , we 're accumulating the evidence that there is liquid water on enceladus , " said carolyn porco , team leader of the cassini imaging group and one of the senior scientists on the mission .
the observation on earth that the sea floor is splitting at mid-ocean ridges and moving apart was one of the great scientific discoveries of the 20th century ; and became a key feature in the theory of plate tectonics - the idea that massive slabs of the earth 's surface move around and are recycled .
cassini sees something very similar on enceladus .
the surface of this snow-white moon is riven with cracks - dubbed tiger stripes - at its south pole .
dr paul helfenstein from cornell university used digital maps of this region to reconstruct a history of the stripes , pushing the fractures around on a computer screen until they fitted together like pieces in a puzzle .
he found that sections of the cracks had clearly moved from their original locations .
dr helfenstein told bbc news that the resemblance to the earth process was remarkable .
" what 's different about them is that spreading ridges on the earth typically spread symmetrically about a rift , " he said .
" on enceladus , what we see is a type of spreading but it is strongly asymmetric - it 's like a conveyor belt , in which , if it 's true it 's coming up from a convection well , it seems to be only pushing in one direction .
it does happen on earth , but only in very peculiar situations . "
on earth , sea-floor spreading is fuelled by molten rock upwelling from deep inside the earth .
on enceladus , the scientists speculate the liquid may be water .
if that is the case , it makes this moon one of the most exciting targets for future exploration .
enceladus is already known to have some of the fundamental chemistry required to make and sustain life .
liquid water currently is the major missing ingredient .
dr porco commented : " we first discovered this region in early 2005 and now it 's nearly four years later , so it 's still kind of brand new ; but already there are some of us who really want to go back with a spacecraft that focuses on the south pole of enceladus and investigates whether or not it is a site of either pre-biotic or biotic processes .

pictures of the icy satellite enceladus suggest its surface splits and spreads apart - just like the ocean floor on our planet splits to create new crust .
the information was released at a meeting of the american geophysical union in san francisco .
the data from the cassini spacecraft is said to strengthen the idea that enceladus harbours a sub-surface sea .
" bit by bit , we 're accumulating the evidence that there is liquid water on enceladus , " said carolyn porco , team leader of the cassini imaging group and one of the senior scientists on the mission .
the observation on earth that the sea floor is splitting at mid-ocean ridges and moving apart was one of the great scientific discoveries of the 20th century ; and became a key feature in the theory of plate tectonics - the idea that massive slabs of the earth 's surface move around and are recycled .
cassini sees something very similar on enceladus .
the surface of this snow-white moon is riven with cracks - dubbed tiger stripes - at its south pole .
dr paul helfenstein from cornell university used digital maps of this region to reconstruct a history of the stripes , pushing the fractures around on a computer screen until they fitted together like pieces in a puzzle .

he found that sections of the cracks had clearly moved from their original locations .
dr helfenstein told bbc news that the resemblance to the earth process was remarkable .
" what 's different about them is that spreading ridges on the earth typically spread symmetrically about a rift , " he said .
" on enceladus , what we see is a type of spreading but it is strongly asymmetric - it 's like a conveyor belt , in which , if it 's true it 's coming up from a convection well , it seems to be only pushing in one direction .
it does happen on earth , but only in very peculiar situations . "
on earth , sea-floor spreading is fuelled by molten rock upwelling from deep inside the earth .
evidence is mounting that liquid water lies beneath the surface on enceladus , the scientists speculate the liquid may be water .
if that is the case , it makes this moon one of the most exciting targets for future exploration .
enceladus is already known to have some of the fundamental chemistry required to make and sustain life .
liquid water currently is the major missing ingredient .
dr porco commented : " we first discovered this region in early 2005 and now it 's nearly four years later , so it 's still kind of brand new ; but already there are some of us who really want to go back with a spacecraft that focuses on the south pole of enceladus and investigates whether or not it is a site of either pre-biotic or biotic processes .

coed cadw - the woodland trust in wales - says clear-felling , cutting down all the trees in an area , is harmful to habitats and wildlife .
the forestry commission said it was increasing broadleaf tree planting and clear-felling could help as a catalyst .
the assembly government is expected to make a woodland announcement in 2009 .
the labour-plaid coalition agreement promised to support indigenous woods and create a welsh national forest .
rory francis , from coed cadw , said that clear-felling was harming wentwood forest near newport , one of wales ' largest ancient woodlands .
' ugly ' " the problem is that the old policies are still being followed and there are parts of wentwood where you can see clear-felling has happened , you can see damaging ground preparation .
" we understand whole new crops of conifers will be planted and that 's caused more problems already - it looks ugly , it 's unpopular , but that new crop of conifers will destroy even more of those ancient woodland relics that make the place special . "
around 900 acres of wentwood forest is owned and managed by coed cadw .
it also harvests trees commercially , but it believes clear-felling for possible replacement with more conifers goes against the assembly government 's aims . "
we are able to act as a catalyst and ensure we put some broadleaf woodland back in a shorter timescale " neil stoddart , forestry commission wales the one wales coalition document agrees to provide support for indigenous woodlands and help to create a " welsh national forest of native trees to act as a carbon sink . "
neil stoddart , a forest district manager for the forestry commission at llandovery in carmarthenshire , said although conifer production was an important part of rural economic development , it could be balanced with environmental gains .
" there are clear fell operations still going on across the estate - they are fewer on ancient woodland sites , however we have to ensure that we meet our stakeholders ' objectives and some of the greater , wider biodiversity gains are achieved through clear-felling .
" clear-felling on ancient woodland sites allows the forest manager to ensure that whilst we do n't damage any remnants , we are able to act as a catalyst and ensure we put some broadleaf woodland back in a shorter timescale .
" in the private sector we are able to offer enhanced grant aid for broadleaf planting and in the public sector we certainly have the drivers there to ensure we increase the broadleaf plantings across the whole estate . "
rural affairs minister elin jones is expected to make an announcement of woodland in the new year .

the paper says investors around the world are counting the spiralling costs of the alleged $ 50bn fraud .
the daily express asks : " how could one man lose £ 30bn of other people 's money without anyone noticing ? "
the daily star expresses disbelief that uk banks were easily fooled .
after all , says the daily mail , he was working at the centre of the financial universe .
post jobs the main story in the daily telegraph is about the future of royal mail .
the paper says it understands that two foreign companies , tnt and dhl , are seeking to buy a large stake in the state-owned company .
the times quotes unions who predict that a partial privatisation of royal mail could lead to the loss of up to 50,000 jobs .
it thinks the government is likely to back the changes - which would inflame both unions and labour backbenchers .
sporting relief the daily mirror says india 's win over england was a defiant message that cricket and sport will continue after last month 's terror attacks in mumbai .
the daily express describes how india 's sporting icon , sachin tendulkar , put a smile back on his nation 's face .
tendulkar scored the winning runs in one of the most remarkable run chases in the history of test cricket .
the independent says the indian team gave more than a billion people the perfect antidote to the attacks .
festive trend the daily telegraph reports that the number of christmas cards being sent over the internet is on the rise .
organisations such as the royal opera house are even joining the trend , the paper says .
but a man featured in the daily express seems unlikely to change his ways - he has been sending the same christmas card to his wife for 41 years .
sandra sargison tells the paper that her husband john is a typical yorkshireman - careful with his cash .

tests on poultry from two villages around englishbazar town in the maldah district have returned positive results , a health official said .
he " few thousand " birds in the area will be slaughtered , he said .
the h5n1 strain of bird flu is regarded as highly pathogenic and can also cause disease and death in humans .
bird flu has returned to west bengal after an outbreak in 14 districts of the state in january this year .
separately , authorities in the north-eastern state of assam say they have finished culling of more than 300,000 chickens and ducks to control the spread of bird flu in the state .
poultry in seven districts in the state have turned up cases of bird flu .
flu fears assam health minister himanta biswa sarma told the bbc that nearly 100 people had reported fever and respiratory tract infections in the districts affected by bird flu .
" medical experts are closely examining these people .
we have to be doubly sure they have not been infected by bird flu , " he said .
federal medical teams have brought in supplies of equipment as a preventive measure in case the virus spreads to humans .
bird flu was first detected in assam in a poultry farm outside the state 's capital guwahati late in november .
since then it has spread to seven districts - from goalpara in the western border with bangladesh to dibrugarh in the far north of the state .
assam , west bengal , tripura and manipur states have suffered outbreaks of bird flu during the past year .
millions of chickens and ducks have been slaughtered after the outbreaks .
while no case of humans being infected by bird flu has been reported from anywhere in india , experts fear the h5n1 virus might mutate or combine with the highly contagious seasonal influenza virus and spark a pandemic that could kill millions of people .
since the virus resurfaced in asia in 2003 , says the world health organisation , it has killed more than 200 people in a dozen of countries .

tests on poultry from two villages around englishbazar town in the maldah district have returned positive results , a health official said .
he " few thousand " birds in the area will be slaughtered , he said .
the h5n1 strain of bird flu is regarded as highly pathogenic and can also cause disease and death in humans .
bird flu has returned to west bengal after an outbreak in 14 districts of the state in january this year .
separately , authorities in the north-eastern state of assam say they have finished culling of more than 300,000 chickens and ducks to control the spread of bird flu in the state .
poultry in seven districts in the state have turned up cases of bird flu .
flu fears assam health minister himanta biswa sarma told the bbc that nearly 100 people had reported fever and respiratory tract infections in the districts affected by bird flu .
" medical experts are closely examining these people .
we have to be doubly sure they have not been infected by bird flu , " he said .
federal medical teams have brought in supplies of equipment as a preventive measure in case the virus spreads to humans .
bird flu was first detected in assam in a poultry farm outside the state 's capital guwahati late in november .
since then it has spread to seven districts - from goalpara in the western border with bangladesh to dibrugarh in the far north of the state .
assam , west bengal , tripura and manipur states have suffered outbreaks of bird flu during the past year .
millions of chickens and ducks have been slaughtered after the outbreaks .
while no case of humans being infected by bird flu has been reported from anywhere in india , experts fear the h5n1 virus might mutate or combine with the highly contagious seasonal influenza virus and spark a pandemic that could kill millions of people .
since the virus resurfaced in asia in 2003 , says the world health organisation , it has killed more than 200 people in a dozen of countries .

tests on poultry from two villages around englishbazar town in the maldah district have returned positive results , a health official said .
he " few thousand " birds in the area will be slaughtered , he said .
the h5n1 strain of bird flu is regarded as highly pathogenic and can also cause disease and death in humans .
bird flu has returned to west bengal after an outbreak in 14 districts of the state in january this year .
separately , authorities in the north-eastern state of assam say they have finished culling of more than 300,000 chickens and ducks to control the spread of bird flu in the state .
poultry in seven districts in the state have turned up cases of bird flu .
flu fears assam health minister himanta biswa sarma told the bbc that nearly 100 people had reported fever and respiratory tract infections in the districts affected by bird flu .
" medical experts are closely examining these people .
we have to be doubly sure they have not been infected by bird flu , " he said .
federal medical teams have brought in supplies of equipment as a preventive measure in case the virus spreads to humans .
bird flu was first detected in assam in a poultry farm outside the state 's capital guwahati late in november .
since then it has spread to seven districts - from goalpara in the western border with bangladesh to dibrugarh in the far north of the state .
assam , west bengal , tripura and manipur states have suffered outbreaks of bird flu during the past year .
millions of chickens and ducks have been slaughtered after the outbreaks .
while no case of humans being infected by bird flu has been reported from anywhere in india , experts fear the h5n1 virus might mutate or combine with the highly contagious seasonal influenza virus and spark a pandemic that could kill millions of people .
since the virus resurfaced in asia in 2003 , says the world health organisation , it has killed more than 200 people in a dozen of countries .

solihull council 's planning committee unanimously backed the £ 130m project to extend the runway by 400m -lrb- 1,329ft -rrb- .
but the final decision has been deferred until january so that councillors can review environmental measures to protect people in the area .
the project would allow larger aircraft and carriers of non-stop flights to the west coast of the us and the far east .
the manufacturers ' group , the engineering employers ' federation -lrb- eef -rrb- , welcomed the councillors ' decision but the green party called it a " disastrous decision " .
' no brainer ' under the project , the runway will be extended 405m towards bickenhill and hampton-in-arden .
plans for a second runway for the airport were scrapped in september 2007 .
peter o 'grady , west midlands spokesman for the eef , said the expansion was " a much needed boost for the region 's economy " . "
the nine councillors have bowed to commercial pressure " felicity norman , green party " despite genuine concerns from local residents it was a no brainer for solihull council , " he said .
mr o 'grady said people would no longer have to travel to london to visit places such as china and japan .
" this will also mean easier access for business to the asia-pacific region and they will now have the chance to compete in those markets on an equal footing with companies in the south east and north west , " he added .
felicity norman , green party euro-mp candidate , said : " the nine councillors have bowed to commercial pressure , not looking after the interests of the people they are supposed to represent .
" extending the runway is going to have a catastrophic and inexcusable impact on climate change , which in itself will have a negative impact on the world economy in the long term . "

solihull council 's planning committee unanimously backed the £ 130m project to extend the runway by 400m -lrb- 1,329ft -rrb- .
but the final decision has been deferred until january so that councillors can review environmental measures to protect people in the area .
the project would allow larger aircraft and carriers of non-stop flights to the west coast of the us and the far east .
the manufacturers ' group , the engineering employers ' federation -lrb- eef -rrb- , welcomed the councillors ' decision but the green party called it a " disastrous decision " .
' no brainer ' under the project , the runway will be extended 405m towards bickenhill and hampton-in-arden .
plans for a second runway for the airport were scrapped in september 2007 .
peter o 'grady , west midlands spokesman for the eef , said the expansion was " a much needed boost for the region 's economy " .
the nine councillors have bowed to commercial pressure felicity norman , green party " despite genuine concerns from local residents it was a no brainer for solihull council , " he said .
mr o 'grady said people would no longer have to travel to london to visit places such as china and japan .
" this will also mean easier access for business to the asia-pacific region and they will now have the chance to compete in those markets on an equal footing with companies in the south east and north west , " he added .
felicity norman , green party euro-mp candidate , said : " the nine councillors have bowed to commercial pressure , not looking after the interests of the people they are supposed to represent .
" extending the runway is going to have a catastrophic and inexcusable impact on climate change , which in itself will have a negative impact on the world economy in the long term . "
