" that does hurt a lot , " andre schwarz , spokesman of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- told the dpa news agency . in light of the euro 's growing strength against the dollar , the group predicts a slump in german exports to the us this year , too . us slowdown affecting german economy while germany can count on its export-driven economy to perform well this year , fears are mounting that a slowing us economy and the recent credit crisis will have a negative impact on germany 's domestic economy although government officials insist " there is no reason to panic . " " little by little , the turbulence in the financial markets and the strong euro are taking their toll , " gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute , said this week . he predicted that growth would reach 1.3 percent , down from a previous forecast of 1.5 percent .
germany 's economy booked 2.5 percent growth last year . threats to germany 's economy can not be attributed to a single cause , according to juergen thumann , head of the federation of german industries . " it is the influence of the weak dollar , rising oil prices , falling us economy and the financial crisis that are making the situation difficult for companies , " he told daily berliner zeitung . exports to poland surge still , germany saw overall exports jump in 2007 to 969 billion euros , a surge of 8.5 percent .
the bga expects the rise to continue and increase by another five percent this year to surpass the one trillion euro mark for the first time . despite the us slump , german exports to other countries saw robust growth .
among germany 's 15 most important export partners , exports to poland last year registered the highest increase , soaring by 24.3 percent to 36.1 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy is heavily reliant on exports growth was also strong in russia with germany exporting goods worth 28.2 billion euros - an increase of 20.6 percent from the previous year .
the bga forecasts that german exports to russia will climb by another 20 percent this year due to russia 's focus on infrastructure investment . russia expected to overtake china france remained germany 's most important export partner .
last year , german exports to its neighbor jumped by 10.4 percent to reach 93.9 billion euros . france was followed by the us , britain , italy and the netherlands as germany 's most significant export partners . china remains an important player on the german economic landscape with exports last year soaring by 8.9 percent to reach 29.9 billion euros .
however , russia is expected to overtake china in the export field because of the latter 's dependence on the us economy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the movement has lost some momentum . back in 1983 , the good old days to many peace activists , some 700,000 people would turn up for peace marches across germany .
these days , those numbers are much reduced , although several thousand have turned out in german cities and towns despite miserable weather to raise their voices against the iraq war , germany 's mission in afghanistan or the chinese crackdown in tibet and to protest war and violence all together . " this is a signal from a truly anti-war movement , " said willi van ooyen , who has organized the peace marches in germany for the last several years .
he said the turnout was better this year than last and that some 70 events were taking place between good friday and easter monday . there were around 1,500 who turned out in the bavarian capital munich , where the slogan on many banners was " halt the foreign deployment of german troops , " referring to the 3,500 german troops engaged in the nato-led mission in afghanistan . about 250 people participated at the start of a three-day march in the ruhr valley region from duisburg to dortmund , with calls going out to get out of afghanistan , keep germany nuclear free and defend the country 's constitution . there were also protests in hanover , wiesbaden , augsburg and erlangen , where a couple of hundred demonstrators showed up at each event .
on sunday , activists pulled on their heavy coats and grabbed their umbrellas in cologne , gotha , berlin and other locations to call for an end to conflict resolution through violence .

but the movement has lost some momentum . back in 1983 , the good old days to many peace activists , some 700,000 people would turn up for peace marches across germany .
these days , those numbers are much reduced , although several thousand have turned out in german cities and towns despite miserable weather to raise their voices against the iraq war , germany 's mission in afghanistan or the chinese crackdown in tibet and to protest war and violence all together . " this is a signal from a truly anti-war movement , " said willi van ooyen , who has organized the peace marches in germany for the last several years .
he said the turnout was better this year than last and that some 70 events were taking place between good friday and easter monday . there were around 1,500 who turned out in the bavarian capital munich , where the slogan on many banners was " halt the foreign deployment of german troops , " referring to the 3,500 german troops engaged in the nato-led mission in afghanistan . about 250 people participated at the start of a three-day march in the ruhr valley region from duisburg to dortmund , with calls going out to get out of afghanistan , keep germany nuclear free and defend the country 's constitution . there were also protests in hanover , wiesbaden , augsburg and erlangen , where a couple of hundred demonstrators showed up at each event .
on sunday , activists pulled on their heavy coats and grabbed their umbrellas in cologne , gotha , berlin and other locations to call for an end to conflict resolution through violence . " war and peace are still an urgent issue , " said matthias dembinski from the foundation for peace and conflict resolution in frankfurt in an interview on german public radio . dwindling numbers but he admitted that the numbers of protestors were down from previous decades , since there was no key issue that motivated a wider audience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " no to war " although this year is the fifth anniversary of the us-led iraq war , berlin 's refusal to become directly involved in the conflict has robbed the issue of some of the urgency it might have had here . many germans are against the bundeswehr 's participation in the afghanistan peacekeeping operation , but a lack of casualties from combat operations has weakened any widespread , passionate opposition that might have brought large numbers out to the streets . " there is simply no burning issue at the moment , " peter strutynski , an activist who worked to mobilize marchers this year , told the dpa news agency . uk roots germany 's own peace marches began in 1960 , although the movement sees its roots stretching back to the 1958 march in the uk that went from central london to the nuclear armaments facility in aldermaston . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace demonstration in stuttgart by 1968 , german marches were drawing 300,000 , due to large-scale opposition to the vietnam war .
in 1983 , the height of the movement , 700,000 marched to protest the stationing of medium-range nuclear missiles in western europe . today , however , germany is no longer on the fault line between east and west . " there must be a feeling of direct threat and the sense that something is going wrong in your own country that you need to demonstrate against , " said dembinski . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that deadline will be respected , " leterme told parliament saturday , a day after he and his 15-member cabinet were sworn into office by belgium 's king albert ii after protracted negotiations with other political groupings . uniter , not a divider ? leterme has his work cut out to persuade belgium 's francophones - concentrated in brussels and the southern wallonia region - of his ability to unite the country in the wake of general elections back in june 2007 . flanders , home to belgium 's dutch-speaking majority , craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity .
it also resents the dollops of euros it now pays to subsidise the poorer , french-speaking wallonia region to its south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of belgium with flanders and wallonia " i fear grave institutional chaos " if the government falls in july , said the new employment minister , joelle milquet , leader of the francophone centrists , adding that the danger of belgium splitting into two nations was now " real . " for the international community , such a possibility would be serious , given that both the european union and nato are headquartered in the capital brussels . the new prime minister has promised to raise pensions and offer tax cuts for low earners although government revenues have been lower than expected .
his plans have come under increasing scrutiny by the opposition and the media . leterme - who once confused belgium 's anthem with that of france and failed in two previous attempts to form a government - fueled inter-communal anger in 2006 by suggesting that french-speakers were incapable of learning dutch . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " little by little , the turbulence in the financial markets and the strong euro are taking their toll , " gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute , said this week . he predicted that growth would reach 1.3 percent , down from a previous forecast of 1.5 percent .
germany 's economy booked 2.5 percent growth last year . threats to germany 's economy can not be attributed to a single cause , according to juergen thumann , head of the federation of german industries .

the bga expects the rise to continue and increase by another five percent this year to surpass the one trillion euro mark for the first time . despite the us slump , german exports to other countries saw robust growth .

last year , german exports to its neighbor jumped by 10.4 percent to reach 93.9 billion euros . france was followed by the us , britain , italy and the netherlands as germany 's most significant export partners . china remains an important player on the german economic landscape with exports last year soaring by 8.9 percent to reach 29.9 billion euros .
however , russia is expected to overtake china in the export field because of the latter 's dependence on the us economy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that deadline will be respected , " leterme told parliament saturday , a day after he and his 15-member cabinet were sworn into office by belgium 's king albert ii after protracted negotiations with other political groupings . uniter , not a divider ? leterme has his work cut out to persuade belgium 's francophones - concentrated in brussels and the southern wallonia region - of his ability to unite the country in the wake of general elections back in june 2007 . flanders , home to belgium 's dutch-speaking majority , craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity .

" for the international community , such a possibility would be serious , given that both the european union and nato are headquartered in the capital brussels . the new prime minister has promised to raise pensions and offer tax cuts for low earners although government revenues have been lower than expected .
his plans have come under increasing scrutiny by the opposition and the media . leterme - who once confused belgium 's anthem with that of france and failed in two previous attempts to form a government - fueled inter-communal anger in 2006 by suggesting that french-speakers were incapable of learning dutch . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " little by little , the turbulence in the financial markets and the strong euro are taking their toll , " gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute , said this week . he predicted that growth would reach 1.3 percent , down from a previous forecast of 1.5 percent .
germany 's economy booked 2.5 percent growth last year . threats to germany 's economy can not be attributed to a single cause , according to juergen thumann , head of the federation of german industries . " it is the influence of the weak dollar , rising oil prices , falling us economy and the financial crisis that are making the situation difficult for companies , " he told daily berliner zeitung . exports to poland surge still , germany saw overall exports jump in 2007 to 969 billion euros , a surge of 8.5 percent .
the bga expects the rise to continue and increase by another five percent this year to surpass the one trillion euro mark for the first time . despite the us slump , german exports to other countries saw robust growth .
among germany 's 15 most important export partners , exports to poland last year registered the highest increase , soaring by 24.3 percent to 36.1 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy is heavily reliant on exports growth was also strong in russia with germany exporting goods worth 28.2 billion euros - an increase of 20.6 percent from the previous year .
the bga forecasts that german exports to russia will climb by another 20 percent this year due to russia 's focus on infrastructure investment . russia expected to overtake china france remained germany 's most important export partner .
last year , german exports to its neighbor jumped by 10.4 percent to reach 93.9 billion euros . france was followed by the us , britain , italy and the netherlands as germany 's most significant export partners . china remains an important player on the german economic landscape with exports last year soaring by 8.9 percent to reach 29.9 billion euros .
however , russia is expected to overtake china in the export field because of the latter 's dependence on the us economy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the movement has lost some momentum . back in 1983 , the good old days to many peace activists , some 700,000 people would turn up for peace marches across germany .
these days , those numbers are much reduced , although several thousand have turned out in german cities and towns despite miserable weather to raise their voices against the iraq war , germany 's mission in afghanistan or the chinese crackdown in tibet and to protest war and violence all together . " this is a signal from a truly anti-war movement , " said willi van ooyen , who has organized the peace marches in germany for the last several years .
he said the turnout was better this year than last and that some 70 events were taking place between good friday and easter monday . there were around 1,500 who turned out in the bavarian capital munich , where the slogan on many banners was " halt the foreign deployment of german troops , " referring to the 3,500 german troops engaged in the nato-led mission in afghanistan . about 250 people participated at the start of a three-day march in the ruhr valley region from duisburg to dortmund , with calls going out to get out of afghanistan , keep germany nuclear free and defend the country 's constitution . there were also protests in hanover , wiesbaden , augsburg and erlangen , where a couple of hundred demonstrators showed up at each event .
on sunday , activists pulled on their heavy coats and grabbed their umbrellas in cologne , gotha , berlin and other locations to call for an end to conflict resolution through violence . " war and peace are still an urgent issue , " said matthias dembinski from the foundation for peace and conflict resolution in frankfurt in an interview on german public radio . dwindling numbers but he admitted that the numbers of protestors were down from previous decades , since there was no key issue that motivated a wider audience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " no to war " although this year is the fifth anniversary of the us-led iraq war , berlin 's refusal to become directly involved in the conflict has robbed the issue of some of the urgency it might have had here . many germans are against the bundeswehr 's participation in the afghanistan peacekeeping operation , but a lack of casualties from combat operations has weakened any widespread , passionate opposition that might have brought large numbers out to the streets . " there is simply no burning issue at the moment , " peter strutynski , an activist who worked to mobilize marchers this year , told the dpa news agency . uk roots germany 's own peace marches began in 1960 , although the movement sees its roots stretching back to the 1958 march in the uk that went from central london to the nuclear armaments facility in aldermaston . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace demonstration in stuttgart by 1968 , german marches were drawing 300,000 , due to large-scale opposition to the vietnam war .
in 1983 , the height of the movement , 700,000 marched to protest the stationing of medium-range nuclear missiles in western europe . today , however , germany is no longer on the fault line between east and west . " there must be a feeling of direct threat and the sense that something is going wrong in your own country that you need to demonstrate against , " said dembinski . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that deadline will be respected , " leterme told parliament saturday , a day after he and his 15-member cabinet were sworn into office by belgium 's king albert ii after protracted negotiations with other political groupings . uniter , not a divider ? leterme has his work cut out to persuade belgium 's francophones - concentrated in brussels and the southern wallonia region - of his ability to unite the country in the wake of general elections back in june 2007 . flanders , home to belgium 's dutch-speaking majority , craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity .
it also resents the dollops of euros it now pays to subsidise the poorer , french-speaking wallonia region to its south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of belgium with flanders and wallonia " i fear grave institutional chaos " if the government falls in july , said the new employment minister , joelle milquet , leader of the francophone centrists , adding that the danger of belgium splitting into two nations was now " real . " for the international community , such a possibility would be serious , given that both the european union and nato are headquartered in the capital brussels . the new prime minister has promised to raise pensions and offer tax cuts for low earners although government revenues have been lower than expected .
his plans have come under increasing scrutiny by the opposition and the media . leterme - who once confused belgium 's anthem with that of france and failed in two previous attempts to form a government - fueled inter-communal anger in 2006 by suggesting that french-speakers were incapable of learning dutch . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the movement has lost some momentum . back in 1983 , the good old days to many peace activists , some 700,000 people would turn up for peace marches across germany .
these days , those numbers are much reduced , although several thousand have turned out in german cities and towns despite miserable weather to raise their voices against the iraq war , germany 's mission in afghanistan or the chinese crackdown in tibet and to protest war and violence all together . " this is a signal from a truly anti-war movement , " said willi van ooyen , who has organized the peace marches in germany for the last several years .
he said the turnout was better this year than last and that some 70 events were taking place between good friday and easter monday . there were around 1,500 who turned out in the bavarian capital munich , where the slogan on many banners was " halt the foreign deployment of german troops , " referring to the 3,500 german troops engaged in the nato-led mission in afghanistan . about 250 people participated at the start of a three-day march in the ruhr valley region from duisburg to dortmund , with calls going out to get out of afghanistan , keep germany nuclear free and defend the country 's constitution . there were also protests in hanover , wiesbaden , augsburg and erlangen , where a couple of hundred demonstrators showed up at each event .
on sunday , activists pulled on their heavy coats and grabbed their umbrellas in cologne , gotha , berlin and other locations to call for an end to conflict resolution through violence . " war and peace are still an urgent issue , " said matthias dembinski from the foundation for peace and conflict resolution in frankfurt in an interview on german public radio . dwindling numbers but he admitted that the numbers of protestors were down from previous decades , since there was no key issue that motivated a wider audience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " no to war " although this year is the fifth anniversary of the us-led iraq war , berlin 's refusal to become directly involved in the conflict has robbed the issue of some of the urgency it might have had here . many germans are against the bundeswehr 's participation in the afghanistan peacekeeping operation , but a lack of casualties from combat operations has weakened any widespread , passionate opposition that might have brought large numbers out to the streets . " there is simply no burning issue at the moment , " peter strutynski , an activist who worked to mobilize marchers this year , told the dpa news agency . uk roots germany 's own peace marches began in 1960 , although the movement sees its roots stretching back to the 1958 march in the uk that went from central london to the nuclear armaments facility in aldermaston . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace demonstration in stuttgart by 1968 , german marches were drawing 300,000 , due to large-scale opposition to the vietnam war .
in 1983 , the height of the movement , 700,000 marched to protest the stationing of medium-range nuclear missiles in western europe . today , however , germany is no longer on the fault line between east and west .

but the movement has lost some momentum . back in 1983 , the good old days to many peace activists , some 700,000 people would turn up for peace marches across germany .
these days , those numbers are much reduced , although several thousand have turned out in german cities and towns despite miserable weather to raise their voices against the iraq war , germany 's mission in afghanistan or the chinese crackdown in tibet and to protest war and violence all together . " this is a signal from a truly anti-war movement , " said willi van ooyen , who has organized the peace marches in germany for the last several years .
he said the turnout was better this year than last and that some 70 events were taking place between good friday and easter monday . there were around 1,500 who turned out in the bavarian capital munich , where the slogan on many banners was " halt the foreign deployment of german troops , " referring to the 3,500 german troops engaged in the nato-led mission in afghanistan . about 250 people participated at the start of a three-day march in the ruhr valley region from duisburg to dortmund , with calls going out to get out of afghanistan , keep germany nuclear free and defend the country 's constitution . there were also protests in hanover , wiesbaden , augsburg and erlangen , where a couple of hundred demonstrators showed up at each event .
on sunday , activists pulled on their heavy coats and grabbed their umbrellas in cologne , gotha , berlin and other locations to call for an end to conflict resolution through violence . " war and peace are still an urgent issue , " said matthias dembinski from the foundation for peace and conflict resolution in frankfurt in an interview on german public radio . dwindling numbers but he admitted that the numbers of protestors were down from previous decades , since there was no key issue that motivated a wider audience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " no to war " although this year is the fifth anniversary of the us-led iraq war , berlin 's refusal to become directly involved in the conflict has robbed the issue of some of the urgency it might have had here . many germans are against the bundeswehr 's participation in the afghanistan peacekeeping operation , but a lack of casualties from combat operations has weakened any widespread , passionate opposition that might have brought large numbers out to the streets . " there is simply no burning issue at the moment , " peter strutynski , an activist who worked to mobilize marchers this year , told the dpa news agency . uk roots germany 's own peace marches began in 1960 , although the movement sees its roots stretching back to the 1958 march in the uk that went from central london to the nuclear armaments facility in aldermaston . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace demonstration in stuttgart by 1968 , german marches were drawing 300,000 , due to large-scale opposition to the vietnam war .
in 1983 , the height of the movement , 700,000 marched to protest the stationing of medium-range nuclear missiles in western europe . today , however , germany is no longer on the fault line between east and west . " there must be a feeling of direct threat and the sense that something is going wrong in your own country that you need to demonstrate against , " said dembinski . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that deadline will be respected , " leterme told parliament saturday , a day after he and his 15-member cabinet were sworn into office by belgium 's king albert ii after protracted negotiations with other political groupings . uniter , not a divider ? leterme has his work cut out to persuade belgium 's francophones - concentrated in brussels and the southern wallonia region - of his ability to unite the country in the wake of general elections back in june 2007 . flanders , home to belgium 's dutch-speaking majority , craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity .
it also resents the dollops of euros it now pays to subsidise the poorer , french-speaking wallonia region to its south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of belgium with flanders and wallonia " i fear grave institutional chaos " if the government falls in july , said the new employment minister , joelle milquet , leader of the francophone centrists , adding that the danger of belgium splitting into two nations was now " real . " for the international community , such a possibility would be serious , given that both the european union and nato are headquartered in the capital brussels . the new prime minister has promised to raise pensions and offer tax cuts for low earners although government revenues have been lower than expected .
his plans have come under increasing scrutiny by the opposition and the media . leterme - who once confused belgium 's anthem with that of france and failed in two previous attempts to form a government - fueled inter-communal anger in 2006 by suggesting that french-speakers were incapable of learning dutch . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that deadline will be respected , " leterme told parliament saturday , a day after he and his 15-member cabinet were sworn into office by belgium 's king albert ii after protracted negotiations with other political groupings . uniter , not a divider ? leterme has his work cut out to persuade belgium 's francophones - concentrated in brussels and the southern wallonia region - of his ability to unite the country in the wake of general elections back in june 2007 . flanders , home to belgium 's dutch-speaking majority , craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity .
it also resents the dollops of euros it now pays to subsidise the poorer , french-speaking wallonia region to its south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of belgium with flanders and wallonia " i fear grave institutional chaos " if the government falls in july , said the new employment minister , joelle milquet , leader of the francophone centrists , adding that the danger of belgium splitting into two nations was now " real . " for the international community , such a possibility would be serious , given that both the european union and nato are headquartered in the capital brussels . the new prime minister has promised to raise pensions and offer tax cuts for low earners although government revenues have been lower than expected .
his plans have come under increasing scrutiny by the opposition and the media . leterme - who once confused belgium 's anthem with that of france and failed in two previous attempts to form a government - fueled inter-communal anger in 2006 by suggesting that french-speakers were incapable of learning dutch . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that deadline will be respected , " leterme told parliament saturday , a day after he and his 15-member cabinet were sworn into office by belgium 's king albert ii after protracted negotiations with other political groupings . uniter , not a divider ? leterme has his work cut out to persuade belgium 's francophones - concentrated in brussels and the southern wallonia region - of his ability to unite the country in the wake of general elections back in june 2007 . flanders , home to belgium 's dutch-speaking majority , craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity .
it also resents the dollops of euros it now pays to subsidise the poorer , french-speaking wallonia region to its south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of belgium with flanders and wallonia " i fear grave institutional chaos " if the government falls in july , said the new employment minister , joelle milquet , leader of the francophone centrists , adding that the danger of belgium splitting into two nations was now " real . " for the international community , such a possibility would be serious , given that both the european union and nato are headquartered in the capital brussels . the new prime minister has promised to raise pensions and offer tax cuts for low earners although government revenues have been lower than expected .
his plans have come under increasing scrutiny by the opposition and the media . leterme - who once confused belgium 's anthem with that of france and failed in two previous attempts to form a government - fueled inter-communal anger in 2006 by suggesting that french-speakers were incapable of learning dutch . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the movement has lost some momentum . back in 1983 , the good old days to many peace activists , some 700,000 people would turn up for peace marches across germany .
these days , those numbers are much reduced , although several thousand have turned out in german cities and towns despite miserable weather to raise their voices against the iraq war , germany 's mission in afghanistan or the chinese crackdown in tibet and to protest war and violence all together . " this is a signal from a truly anti-war movement , " said willi van ooyen , who has organized the peace marches in germany for the last several years .
he said the turnout was better this year than last and that some 70 events were taking place between good friday and easter monday . there were around 1,500 who turned out in the bavarian capital munich , where the slogan on many banners was " halt the foreign deployment of german troops , " referring to the 3,500 german troops engaged in the nato-led mission in afghanistan . about 250 people participated at the start of a three-day march in the ruhr valley region from duisburg to dortmund , with calls going out to get out of afghanistan , keep germany nuclear free and defend the country 's constitution . there were also protests in hanover , wiesbaden , augsburg and erlangen , where a couple of hundred demonstrators showed up at each event .
on sunday , activists pulled on their heavy coats and grabbed their umbrellas in cologne , gotha , berlin and other locations to call for an end to conflict resolution through violence . " war and peace are still an urgent issue , " said matthias dembinski from the foundation for peace and conflict resolution in frankfurt in an interview on german public radio . dwindling numbers but he admitted that the numbers of protestors were down from previous decades , since there was no key issue that motivated a wider audience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " no to war " although this year is the fifth anniversary of the us-led iraq war , berlin 's refusal to become directly involved in the conflict has robbed the issue of some of the urgency it might have had here . many germans are against the bundeswehr 's participation in the afghanistan peacekeeping operation , but a lack of casualties from combat operations has weakened any widespread , passionate opposition that might have brought large numbers out to the streets . " there is simply no burning issue at the moment , " peter strutynski , an activist who worked to mobilize marchers this year , told the dpa news agency . uk roots germany 's own peace marches began in 1960 , although the movement sees its roots stretching back to the 1958 march in the uk that went from central london to the nuclear armaments facility in aldermaston . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace demonstration in stuttgart by 1968 , german marches were drawing 300,000 , due to large-scale opposition to the vietnam war .
in 1983 , the height of the movement , 700,000 marched to protest the stationing of medium-range nuclear missiles in western europe . today , however , germany is no longer on the fault line between east and west . " there must be a feeling of direct threat and the sense that something is going wrong in your own country that you need to demonstrate against , " said dembinski . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the movement has lost some momentum . back in 1983 , the good old days to many peace activists , some 700,000 people would turn up for peace marches across germany .
these days , those numbers are much reduced , although several thousand have turned out in german cities and towns despite miserable weather to raise their voices against the iraq war , germany 's mission in afghanistan or the chinese crackdown in tibet and to protest war and violence all together . " this is a signal from a truly anti-war movement , " said willi van ooyen , who has organized the peace marches in germany for the last several years .
he said the turnout was better this year than last and that some 70 events were taking place between good friday and easter monday . there were around 1,500 who turned out in the bavarian capital munich , where the slogan on many banners was " halt the foreign deployment of german troops , " referring to the 3,500 german troops engaged in the nato-led mission in afghanistan . about 250 people participated at the start of a three-day march in the ruhr valley region from duisburg to dortmund , with calls going out to get out of afghanistan , keep germany nuclear free and defend the country 's constitution . there were also protests in hanover , wiesbaden , augsburg and erlangen , where a couple of hundred demonstrators showed up at each event .
on sunday , activists pulled on their heavy coats and grabbed their umbrellas in cologne , gotha , berlin and other locations to call for an end to conflict resolution through violence . " war and peace are still an urgent issue , " said matthias dembinski from the foundation for peace and conflict resolution in frankfurt in an interview on german public radio . dwindling numbers but he admitted that the numbers of protestors were down from previous decades , since there was no key issue that motivated a wider audience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " no to war " although this year is the fifth anniversary of the us-led iraq war , berlin 's refusal to become directly involved in the conflict has robbed the issue of some of the urgency it might have had here . many germans are against the bundeswehr 's participation in the afghanistan peacekeeping operation , but a lack of casualties from combat operations has weakened any widespread , passionate opposition that might have brought large numbers out to the streets . " there is simply no burning issue at the moment , " peter strutynski , an activist who worked to mobilize marchers this year , told the dpa news agency . uk roots germany 's own peace marches began in 1960 , although the movement sees its roots stretching back to the 1958 march in the uk that went from central london to the nuclear armaments facility in aldermaston . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace demonstration in stuttgart by 1968 , german marches were drawing 300,000 , due to large-scale opposition to the vietnam war .
in 1983 , the height of the movement , 700,000 marched to protest the stationing of medium-range nuclear missiles in western europe . today , however , germany is no longer on the fault line between east and west .

" that deadline will be respected , " leterme told parliament saturday , a day after he and his 15-member cabinet were sworn into office by belgium 's king albert ii after protracted negotiations with other political groupings . uniter , not a divider ? leterme has his work cut out to persuade belgium 's francophones - concentrated in brussels and the southern wallonia region - of his ability to unite the country in the wake of general elections back in june 2007 . flanders , home to belgium 's dutch-speaking majority , craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity .

" for the international community , such a possibility would be serious , given that both the european union and nato are headquartered in the capital brussels . the new prime minister has promised to raise pensions and offer tax cuts for low earners although government revenues have been lower than expected .
his plans have come under increasing scrutiny by the opposition and the media . leterme - who once confused belgium 's anthem with that of france and failed in two previous attempts to form a government - fueled inter-communal anger in 2006 by suggesting that french-speakers were incapable of learning dutch . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the movement has lost some momentum . back in 1983 , the good old days to many peace activists , some 700,000 people would turn up for peace marches across germany .
these days , those numbers are much reduced , although several thousand have turned out in german cities and towns despite miserable weather to raise their voices against the iraq war , germany 's mission in afghanistan or the chinese crackdown in tibet and to protest war and violence all together . " this is a signal from a truly anti-war movement , " said willi van ooyen , who has organized the peace marches in germany for the last several years .
he said the turnout was better this year than last and that some 70 events were taking place between good friday and easter monday . there were around 1,500 who turned out in the bavarian capital munich , where the slogan on many banners was " halt the foreign deployment of german troops , " referring to the 3,500 german troops engaged in the nato-led mission in afghanistan . about 250 people participated at the start of a three-day march in the ruhr valley region from duisburg to dortmund , with calls going out to get out of afghanistan , keep germany nuclear free and defend the country 's constitution . there were also protests in hanover , wiesbaden , augsburg and erlangen , where a couple of hundred demonstrators showed up at each event .
on sunday , activists pulled on their heavy coats and grabbed their umbrellas in cologne , gotha , berlin and other locations to call for an end to conflict resolution through violence . " war and peace are still an urgent issue , " said matthias dembinski from the foundation for peace and conflict resolution in frankfurt in an interview on german public radio . dwindling numbers but he admitted that the numbers of protestors were down from previous decades , since there was no key issue that motivated a wider audience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " no to war " although this year is the fifth anniversary of the us-led iraq war , berlin 's refusal to become directly involved in the conflict has robbed the issue of some of the urgency it might have had here . many germans are against the bundeswehr 's participation in the afghanistan peacekeeping operation , but a lack of casualties from combat operations has weakened any widespread , passionate opposition that might have brought large numbers out to the streets . " there is simply no burning issue at the moment , " peter strutynski , an activist who worked to mobilize marchers this year , told the dpa news agency . uk roots germany 's own peace marches began in 1960 , although the movement sees its roots stretching back to the 1958 march in the uk that went from central london to the nuclear armaments facility in aldermaston . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace demonstration in stuttgart by 1968 , german marches were drawing 300,000 , due to large-scale opposition to the vietnam war .
in 1983 , the height of the movement , 700,000 marched to protest the stationing of medium-range nuclear missiles in western europe . today , however , germany is no longer on the fault line between east and west .

but the movement has lost some momentum . back in 1983 , the good old days to many peace activists , some 700,000 people would turn up for peace marches across germany .
these days , those numbers are much reduced , although several thousand have turned out in german cities and towns despite miserable weather to raise their voices against the iraq war , germany 's mission in afghanistan or the chinese crackdown in tibet and to protest war and violence all together . " this is a signal from a truly anti-war movement , " said willi van ooyen , who has organized the peace marches in germany for the last several years .
he said the turnout was better this year than last and that some 70 events were taking place between good friday and easter monday . there were around 1,500 who turned out in the bavarian capital munich , where the slogan on many banners was " halt the foreign deployment of german troops , " referring to the 3,500 german troops engaged in the nato-led mission in afghanistan . about 250 people participated at the start of a three-day march in the ruhr valley region from duisburg to dortmund , with calls going out to get out of afghanistan , keep germany nuclear free and defend the country 's constitution . there were also protests in hanover , wiesbaden , augsburg and erlangen , where a couple of hundred demonstrators showed up at each event .

" that deadline will be respected , " leterme told parliament saturday , a day after he and his 15-member cabinet were sworn into office by belgium 's king albert ii after protracted negotiations with other political groupings . uniter , not a divider ? leterme has his work cut out to persuade belgium 's francophones - concentrated in brussels and the southern wallonia region - of his ability to unite the country in the wake of general elections back in june 2007 . flanders , home to belgium 's dutch-speaking majority , craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity .
it also resents the dollops of euros it now pays to subsidise the poorer , french-speaking wallonia region to its south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of belgium with flanders and wallonia " i fear grave institutional chaos " if the government falls in july , said the new employment minister , joelle milquet , leader of the francophone centrists , adding that the danger of belgium splitting into two nations was now " real . " for the international community , such a possibility would be serious , given that both the european union and nato are headquartered in the capital brussels . the new prime minister has promised to raise pensions and offer tax cuts for low earners although government revenues have been lower than expected .
his plans have come under increasing scrutiny by the opposition and the media . leterme - who once confused belgium 's anthem with that of france and failed in two previous attempts to form a government - fueled inter-communal anger in 2006 by suggesting that french-speakers were incapable of learning dutch . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the movement has lost some momentum . back in 1983 , the good old days to many peace activists , some 700,000 people would turn up for peace marches across germany .
these days , those numbers are much reduced , although several thousand have turned out in german cities and towns despite miserable weather to raise their voices against the iraq war , germany 's mission in afghanistan or the chinese crackdown in tibet and to protest war and violence all together . " this is a signal from a truly anti-war movement , " said willi van ooyen , who has organized the peace marches in germany for the last several years .
he said the turnout was better this year than last and that some 70 events were taking place between good friday and easter monday . there were around 1,500 who turned out in the bavarian capital munich , where the slogan on many banners was " halt the foreign deployment of german troops , " referring to the 3,500 german troops engaged in the nato-led mission in afghanistan . about 250 people participated at the start of a three-day march in the ruhr valley region from duisburg to dortmund , with calls going out to get out of afghanistan , keep germany nuclear free and defend the country 's constitution . there were also protests in hanover , wiesbaden , augsburg and erlangen , where a couple of hundred demonstrators showed up at each event .
on sunday , activists pulled on their heavy coats and grabbed their umbrellas in cologne , gotha , berlin and other locations to call for an end to conflict resolution through violence . " war and peace are still an urgent issue , " said matthias dembinski from the foundation for peace and conflict resolution in frankfurt in an interview on german public radio . dwindling numbers but he admitted that the numbers of protestors were down from previous decades , since there was no key issue that motivated a wider audience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " no to war " although this year is the fifth anniversary of the us-led iraq war , berlin 's refusal to become directly involved in the conflict has robbed the issue of some of the urgency it might have had here . many germans are against the bundeswehr 's participation in the afghanistan peacekeeping operation , but a lack of casualties from combat operations has weakened any widespread , passionate opposition that might have brought large numbers out to the streets . " there is simply no burning issue at the moment , " peter strutynski , an activist who worked to mobilize marchers this year , told the dpa news agency . uk roots germany 's own peace marches began in 1960 , although the movement sees its roots stretching back to the 1958 march in the uk that went from central london to the nuclear armaments facility in aldermaston . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace demonstration in stuttgart by 1968 , german marches were drawing 300,000 , due to large-scale opposition to the vietnam war .
in 1983 , the height of the movement , 700,000 marched to protest the stationing of medium-range nuclear missiles in western europe . today , however , germany is no longer on the fault line between east and west . " there must be a feeling of direct threat and the sense that something is going wrong in your own country that you need to demonstrate against , " said dembinski . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the movement has lost some momentum . back in 1983 , the good old days to many peace activists , some 700,000 people would turn up for peace marches across germany .
these days , those numbers are much reduced , although several thousand have turned out in german cities and towns despite miserable weather to raise their voices against the iraq war , germany 's mission in afghanistan or the chinese crackdown in tibet and to protest war and violence all together . " this is a signal from a truly anti-war movement , " said willi van ooyen , who has organized the peace marches in germany for the last several years .
he said the turnout was better this year than last and that some 70 events were taking place between good friday and easter monday . there were around 1,500 who turned out in the bavarian capital munich , where the slogan on many banners was " halt the foreign deployment of german troops , " referring to the 3,500 german troops engaged in the nato-led mission in afghanistan . about 250 people participated at the start of a three-day march in the ruhr valley region from duisburg to dortmund , with calls going out to get out of afghanistan , keep germany nuclear free and defend the country 's constitution . there were also protests in hanover , wiesbaden , augsburg and erlangen , where a couple of hundred demonstrators showed up at each event .
on sunday , activists pulled on their heavy coats and grabbed their umbrellas in cologne , gotha , berlin and other locations to call for an end to conflict resolution through violence . " war and peace are still an urgent issue , " said matthias dembinski from the foundation for peace and conflict resolution in frankfurt in an interview on german public radio . dwindling numbers but he admitted that the numbers of protestors were down from previous decades , since there was no key issue that motivated a wider audience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " no to war " although this year is the fifth anniversary of the us-led iraq war , berlin 's refusal to become directly involved in the conflict has robbed the issue of some of the urgency it might have had here . many germans are against the bundeswehr 's participation in the afghanistan peacekeeping operation , but a lack of casualties from combat operations has weakened any widespread , passionate opposition that might have brought large numbers out to the streets . " there is simply no burning issue at the moment , " peter strutynski , an activist who worked to mobilize marchers this year , told the dpa news agency . uk roots germany 's own peace marches began in 1960 , although the movement sees its roots stretching back to the 1958 march in the uk that went from central london to the nuclear armaments facility in aldermaston . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace demonstration in stuttgart by 1968 , german marches were drawing 300,000 , due to large-scale opposition to the vietnam war .
in 1983 , the height of the movement , 700,000 marched to protest the stationing of medium-range nuclear missiles in western europe . today , however , germany is no longer on the fault line between east and west . " there must be a feeling of direct threat and the sense that something is going wrong in your own country that you need to demonstrate against , " said dembinski . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the movement has lost some momentum . back in 1983 , the good old days to many peace activists , some 700,000 people would turn up for peace marches across germany .
these days , those numbers are much reduced , although several thousand have turned out in german cities and towns despite miserable weather to raise their voices against the iraq war , germany 's mission in afghanistan or the chinese crackdown in tibet and to protest war and violence all together . " this is a signal from a truly anti-war movement , " said willi van ooyen , who has organized the peace marches in germany for the last several years .
he said the turnout was better this year than last and that some 70 events were taking place between good friday and easter monday . there were around 1,500 who turned out in the bavarian capital munich , where the slogan on many banners was " halt the foreign deployment of german troops , " referring to the 3,500 german troops engaged in the nato-led mission in afghanistan . about 250 people participated at the start of a three-day march in the ruhr valley region from duisburg to dortmund , with calls going out to get out of afghanistan , keep germany nuclear free and defend the country 's constitution . there were also protests in hanover , wiesbaden , augsburg and erlangen , where a couple of hundred demonstrators showed up at each event .
on sunday , activists pulled on their heavy coats and grabbed their umbrellas in cologne , gotha , berlin and other locations to call for an end to conflict resolution through violence . " war and peace are still an urgent issue , " said matthias dembinski from the foundation for peace and conflict resolution in frankfurt in an interview on german public radio . dwindling numbers but he admitted that the numbers of protestors were down from previous decades , since there was no key issue that motivated a wider audience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " no to war " although this year is the fifth anniversary of the us-led iraq war , berlin 's refusal to become directly involved in the conflict has robbed the issue of some of the urgency it might have had here . many germans are against the bundeswehr 's participation in the afghanistan peacekeeping operation , but a lack of casualties from combat operations has weakened any widespread , passionate opposition that might have brought large numbers out to the streets . " there is simply no burning issue at the moment , " peter strutynski , an activist who worked to mobilize marchers this year , told the dpa news agency . uk roots germany 's own peace marches began in 1960 , although the movement sees its roots stretching back to the 1958 march in the uk that went from central london to the nuclear armaments facility in aldermaston . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace demonstration in stuttgart by 1968 , german marches were drawing 300,000 , due to large-scale opposition to the vietnam war .
in 1983 , the height of the movement , 700,000 marched to protest the stationing of medium-range nuclear missiles in western europe . today , however , germany is no longer on the fault line between east and west .

" that deadline will be respected , " leterme told parliament saturday , a day after he and his 15-member cabinet were sworn into office by belgium 's king albert ii after protracted negotiations with other political groupings . uniter , not a divider ? leterme has his work cut out to persuade belgium 's francophones - concentrated in brussels and the southern wallonia region - of his ability to unite the country in the wake of general elections back in june 2007 . flanders , home to belgium 's dutch-speaking majority , craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity .
it also resents the dollops of euros it now pays to subsidise the poorer , french-speaking wallonia region to its south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map of belgium with flanders and wallonia " i fear grave institutional chaos " if the government falls in july , said the new employment minister , joelle milquet , leader of the francophone centrists , adding that the danger of belgium splitting into two nations was now " real . " for the international community , such a possibility would be serious , given that both the european union and nato are headquartered in the capital brussels . the new prime minister has promised to raise pensions and offer tax cuts for low earners although government revenues have been lower than expected .
his plans have come under increasing scrutiny by the opposition and the media . leterme - who once confused belgium 's anthem with that of france and failed in two previous attempts to form a government - fueled inter-communal anger in 2006 by suggesting that french-speakers were incapable of learning dutch . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the movement has lost some momentum . back in 1983 , the good old days to many peace activists , some 700,000 people would turn up for peace marches across germany .
these days , those numbers are much reduced , although several thousand have turned out in german cities and towns despite miserable weather to raise their voices against the iraq war , germany 's mission in afghanistan or the chinese crackdown in tibet and to protest war and violence all together . " this is a signal from a truly anti-war movement , " said willi van ooyen , who has organized the peace marches in germany for the last several years .
he said the turnout was better this year than last and that some 70 events were taking place between good friday and easter monday . there were around 1,500 who turned out in the bavarian capital munich , where the slogan on many banners was " halt the foreign deployment of german troops , " referring to the 3,500 german troops engaged in the nato-led mission in afghanistan . about 250 people participated at the start of a three-day march in the ruhr valley region from duisburg to dortmund , with calls going out to get out of afghanistan , keep germany nuclear free and defend the country 's constitution . there were also protests in hanover , wiesbaden , augsburg and erlangen , where a couple of hundred demonstrators showed up at each event .
on sunday , activists pulled on their heavy coats and grabbed their umbrellas in cologne , gotha , berlin and other locations to call for an end to conflict resolution through violence . " war and peace are still an urgent issue , " said matthias dembinski from the foundation for peace and conflict resolution in frankfurt in an interview on german public radio . dwindling numbers but he admitted that the numbers of protestors were down from previous decades , since there was no key issue that motivated a wider audience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " no to war " although this year is the fifth anniversary of the us-led iraq war , berlin 's refusal to become directly involved in the conflict has robbed the issue of some of the urgency it might have had here . many germans are against the bundeswehr 's participation in the afghanistan peacekeeping operation , but a lack of casualties from combat operations has weakened any widespread , passionate opposition that might have brought large numbers out to the streets . " there is simply no burning issue at the moment , " peter strutynski , an activist who worked to mobilize marchers this year , told the dpa news agency . uk roots germany 's own peace marches began in 1960 , although the movement sees its roots stretching back to the 1958 march in the uk that went from central london to the nuclear armaments facility in aldermaston . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace demonstration in stuttgart by 1968 , german marches were drawing 300,000 , due to large-scale opposition to the vietnam war .
in 1983 , the height of the movement , 700,000 marched to protest the stationing of medium-range nuclear missiles in western europe . today , however , germany is no longer on the fault line between east and west . " there must be a feeling of direct threat and the sense that something is going wrong in your own country that you need to demonstrate against , " said dembinski . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that does hurt a lot , " andre schwarz , spokesman of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- told the dpa news agency . in light of the euro 's growing strength against the dollar , the group predicts a slump in german exports to the us this year , too . us slowdown affecting german economy while germany can count on its export-driven economy to perform well this year , fears are mounting that a slowing us economy and the recent credit crisis will have a negative impact on germany 's domestic economy although government officials insist " there is no reason to panic . " " little by little , the turbulence in the financial markets and the strong euro are taking their toll , " gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute , said this week . he predicted that growth would reach 1.3 percent , down from a previous forecast of 1.5 percent .
germany 's economy booked 2.5 percent growth last year . threats to germany 's economy can not be attributed to a single cause , according to juergen thumann , head of the federation of german industries . " it is the influence of the weak dollar , rising oil prices , falling us economy and the financial crisis that are making the situation difficult for companies , " he told daily berliner zeitung . exports to poland surge still , germany saw overall exports jump in 2007 to 969 billion euros , a surge of 8.5 percent .
the bga expects the rise to continue and increase by another five percent this year to surpass the one trillion euro mark for the first time . despite the us slump , german exports to other countries saw robust growth .
among germany 's 15 most important export partners , exports to poland last year registered the highest increase , soaring by 24.3 percent to 36.1 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy is heavily reliant on exports growth was also strong in russia with germany exporting goods worth 28.2 billion euros - an increase of 20.6 percent from the previous year .
the bga forecasts that german exports to russia will climb by another 20 percent this year due to russia 's focus on infrastructure investment . russia expected to overtake china france remained germany 's most important export partner .
last year , german exports to its neighbor jumped by 10.4 percent to reach 93.9 billion euros . france was followed by the us , britain , italy and the netherlands as germany 's most significant export partners . china remains an important player on the german economic landscape with exports last year soaring by 8.9 percent to reach 29.9 billion euros .
however , russia is expected to overtake china in the export field because of the latter 's dependence on the us economy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the movement has lost some momentum . back in 1983 , the good old days to many peace activists , some 700,000 people would turn up for peace marches across germany .
these days , those numbers are much reduced , although several thousand have turned out in german cities and towns despite miserable weather to raise their voices against the iraq war , germany 's mission in afghanistan or the chinese crackdown in tibet and to protest war and violence all together . " this is a signal from a truly anti-war movement , " said willi van ooyen , who has organized the peace marches in germany for the last several years .
he said the turnout was better this year than last and that some 70 events were taking place between good friday and easter monday . there were around 1,500 who turned out in the bavarian capital munich , where the slogan on many banners was " halt the foreign deployment of german troops , " referring to the 3,500 german troops engaged in the nato-led mission in afghanistan . about 250 people participated at the start of a three-day march in the ruhr valley region from duisburg to dortmund , with calls going out to get out of afghanistan , keep germany nuclear free and defend the country 's constitution . there were also protests in hanover , wiesbaden , augsburg and erlangen , where a couple of hundred demonstrators showed up at each event .

" how can we fail to remember certain african regions , such as darfur and somalia , the tormented middle east , especially the holy land , iraq , lebanon , and finally tibet , all of whom i encourage to seek solutions that will safeguard peace and the common good , " the pope said in his " urbi et orbi " -lrb- to the city and the world -rrb- message . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people under umbrellas attend mass led by pope benedict xvi in st. peter 's square speaking as pilgrims in saint peter 's square braved a steady rain , the 80-year-old head of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics wished that " the light that streams forth from this solemn day -lrb- may -rrb- shine forth in every part of the world .

" for the international community , such a possibility would be serious , given that both the european union and nato are headquartered in the capital brussels . the new prime minister has promised to raise pensions and offer tax cuts for low earners although government revenues have been lower than expected .
his plans have come under increasing scrutiny by the opposition and the media . leterme - who once confused belgium 's anthem with that of france and failed in two previous attempts to form a government - fueled inter-communal anger in 2006 by suggesting that french-speakers were incapable of learning dutch . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.03.2008 german peace activists mark half century of easter marches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in munich , peace activists took to the streets tracing their origins to a " ban the bomb " march in britain 50 years ago , traditional peace marches are being held across germany over the easter holidays despite cold and sleet .
but the movement has lost some momentum . back in 1983 , the good old days to many peace activists , some 700,000 people would turn up for peace marches across germany .
these days , those numbers are much reduced , although several thousand have turned out in german cities and towns despite miserable weather to raise their voices against the iraq war , germany 's mission in afghanistan or the chinese crackdown in tibet and to protest war and violence all together . " this is a signal from a truly anti-war movement , " said willi van ooyen , who has organized the peace marches in germany for the last several years .
he said the turnout was better this year than last and that some 70 events were taking place between good friday and easter monday . there were around 1,500 who turned out in the bavarian capital munich , where the slogan on many banners was " halt the foreign deployment of german troops , " referring to the 3,500 german troops engaged in the nato-led mission in afghanistan . about 250 people participated at the start of a three-day march in the ruhr valley region from duisburg to dortmund , with calls going out to get out of afghanistan , keep germany nuclear free and defend the country 's constitution . there were also protests in hanover , wiesbaden , augsburg and erlangen , where a couple of hundred demonstrators showed up at each event .
on sunday , activists pulled on their heavy coats and grabbed their umbrellas in cologne , gotha , berlin and other locations to call for an end to conflict resolution through violence . " war and peace are still an urgent issue , " said matthias dembinski from the foundation for peace and conflict resolution in frankfurt in an interview on german public radio . dwindling numbers but he admitted that the numbers of protestors were down from previous decades , since there was no key issue that motivated a wider audience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " no to war " although this year is the fifth anniversary of the us-led iraq war , berlin 's refusal to become directly involved in the conflict has robbed the issue of some of the urgency it might have had here . many germans are against the bundeswehr 's participation in the afghanistan peacekeeping operation , but a lack of casualties from combat operations has weakened any widespread , passionate opposition that might have brought large numbers out to the streets . " there is simply no burning issue at the moment , " peter strutynski , an activist who worked to mobilize marchers this year , told the dpa news agency . uk roots germany 's own peace marches began in 1960 , although the movement sees its roots stretching back to the 1958 march in the uk that went from central london to the nuclear armaments facility in aldermaston . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace demonstration in stuttgart by 1968 , german marches were drawing 300,000 , due to large-scale opposition to the vietnam war .
in 1983 , the height of the movement , 700,000 marched to protest the stationing of medium-range nuclear missiles in western europe . today , however , germany is no longer on the fault line between east and west . " there must be a feeling of direct threat and the sense that something is going wrong in your own country that you need to demonstrate against , " said dembinski . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 34-year-old briton said the move was a " very positive sign " for him .
however , he has still not been officially cleared and remains a formal suspect in the case , or " arguido " .
mr murat lives near the apartment from where madeleine , of rothley , leics , disappeared aged three in praia da luz , portugal , on 3 may last year .
' very happy ' mr murat said : " it is a very positive sign , there 's no doubt about that whatsoever .
" why would they return something if it was in the middle of being investigated in any way , shape or form ?
arguido status officially a suspect bestowed by police or requested by individual right to remain silent right to a lawyer must report to police every five days " we are very happy to have the computers back , and i hope i will have my arguido status dropped very shortly . "
mr murat said he was considering taking legal action over allegedly libellous stories printed about him in the newspapers .
it comes after madeleine 's parents , kate and gerry , won a libel settlement and apology from express newspapers for suggesting they were involved in their daughter 's disappearance .
mr murat , who was questioned by police 11 days after madeleine went missing before he was made a suspect , strenuously denies any involvement .

ma ying-jeou said he would like to work towards a peace treaty with beijing , but would only do so if china removed missiles pointed at taiwan .
he said he had no immediate plans to visit the mainland , but wanted to work on " substantive issues " .
mr ma won a comfortable victory over frank hsieh of the ruling democratic progressive party on saturday .
official results gave mr ma 58.45 % of the vote - an advantage of nearly 17 percentage points over mr hsieh .
mr ma , of the kuomintang party , had stood on a platform of economic reform and improving relations with china .
i will make it crystal clear that taiwan will be a stakeholder and will not rock the boat in the region .
ma ying-jeou profile : ma ying-jeou rocky relationship he ruled out an immediate visit to mainland china , but said he would focus on improving relations by " substantive " means including stepping up direct flights .
no incumbent president has visited the chinese mainland since the kuomintang was forced to retreat to taiwan in 1949 , as civil war broke out on the mainland .
on saturday , mr ma said economic normalisation would take priority over concluding a peace treaty , which he said would be conditional on the removal of what taiwan says are some 1,000 missiles aimed at the island .
in sunday 's further comments , he acknowledged that the issue of sovereignty was the most difficult problem affecting bilateral relations , adding that mutual recognition was " out of the question " .
instead , he proposed a middle road of " mutual non-denial " - " we will not deny their existence but we can not recognise their sovereignty " over taiwan , he said .
china says that taiwan is part of its territory , although the two have been separately governed since 1949 , and china has never ruled out using force against the island should it move towards formal independence .
us reaction mr ma indicated that he would move away from the stance of arch-nationalist chen shui-bian , who steps down in may .
some of mr hsieh 's supporters were tearful after the poll " i will make it crystal clear that taiwan will be a stakeholder and will not rock the boat in the region .
by stakeholder , i mean peacemaker . "
in washington , president george w bush greeted mr ma 's victory .
" i believe the election provides a fresh opportunity for both sides to reach out and engage one another in peacefully resolving their differences , " he said .
though mr hsieh had also pledged to build closer commercial ties with china , his approach was more cautious than his rival 's .
mr ma now has a commanding mandate , as the kuomintang controls two-thirds of the seats in parliament having won a sweeping victory in polls in january .
but analysts were split over how rapidly change might come , noting that mr ma would want to reassure voters that he was not selling out to china .
mr ma , 57 and educated at harvard , put the promise of an economic revival at the centre of his election campaign .
air links many taiwanese waiting to cast their votes identified the faltering economy as their top priority .
have your say our gdp has been at a standstill for eight years .
we need a clean government .
liu , taipei send us your comments " our economic policy has three points , " mr ma said .
" one is to love taiwan , another is infrastructure and industry and a third is to reach out to the whole world . "
he has set ambitious growth targets - which some analysts say will not be met , unless his pledge to establish much closer economic ties with china is also fulfilled .

he said he had no immediate plans to visit the mainland , but wanted to work on " substantive issues " .
mr ma won a comfortable victory over frank hsieh of the ruling democratic progressive party on saturday .
official results gave mr ma 58.45 % of the vote - an advantage of nearly 17 percentage points over mr hsieh .
mr ma , of the kuomintang party , had stood on a platform of economic reform and improving relations with china .
i will make it crystal clear that taiwan will be a stakeholder and will not rock the boat in the region .
ma ying-jeou profile : ma ying-jeou rocky relationship he ruled out an immediate visit to mainland china , but said he would focus on improving relations by " substantive " means including stepping up direct flights .
no incumbent president has visited the chinese mainland since the kuomintang was forced to retreat to taiwan in 1949 , as civil war broke out on the mainland .
on saturday , mr ma said economic normalisation would take priority over concluding a peace treaty , which he said would be conditional on the removal of what taiwan says are some 1,000 missiles aimed at the island .
in sunday 's further comments , he acknowledged that the issue of sovereignty was the most difficult problem affecting bilateral relations , adding that mutual recognition was " out of the question " .
instead , he proposed a middle road of " mutual non-denial " - " we will not deny their existence but we can not recognise their sovereignty " over taiwan , he said .
china says that taiwan is part of its territory , although the two have been separately governed since 1949 , and china has never ruled out using force against the island should it move towards formal independence .
us reaction mr ma indicated that he would move away from the stance of arch-nationalist chen shui-bian , who steps down in may .
some of mr hsieh 's supporters were tearful after the poll " i will make it crystal clear that taiwan will be a stakeholder and will not rock the boat in the region .
by stakeholder , i mean peacemaker . "
in washington , president george w bush greeted mr ma 's victory .
" i believe the election provides a fresh opportunity for both sides to reach out and engage one another in peacefully resolving their differences , " he said .
though mr hsieh had also pledged to build closer commercial ties with china , his approach was more cautious than his rival 's .
mr ma now has a commanding mandate , as the kuomintang controls two-thirds of the seats in parliament having won a sweeping victory in polls in january .
but analysts were split over how rapidly change might come , noting that mr ma would want to reassure voters that he was not selling out to china .
mr ma , 57 and educated at harvard , put the promise of an economic revival at the centre of his election campaign .
air links many taiwanese waiting to cast their votes identified the faltering economy as their top priority .
have your say our gdp has been at a standstill for eight years .
we need a clean government .
liu , taipei send us your comments " our economic policy has three points , " mr ma said .
" one is to love taiwan , another is infrastructure and industry and a third is to reach out to the whole world . "
he has set ambitious growth targets - which some analysts say will not be met , unless his pledge to establish much closer economic ties with china is also fulfilled .
