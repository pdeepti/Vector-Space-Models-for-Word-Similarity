they 're out of shape .
they drink and smoke too much .
their general fitness level is unacceptable . reinhold robbe 's 2008 report , which he presented to his employer , the german parliament , on tuesday , march 4 , said that more than 40 percent of the country 's soldiers were overweight and over 70 percent were regular smokers .
sports often played a minor role in the army , and the soldiers ' physical abilities were alarming , the ombudsman said .
the german army was suffering from the effects of a passive lifestyle . robbe would n't go so far as to say that the troops were too unfit to fight .
he did , however , point out that : " every athletic soldier who can react quickly has an advantage on the field . " as the bundeswehr 's agony aunt , robbe should know .
his job is to provide civilian oversight of the armed forces and ensure that the country 's soldiers are being treated appropriately .
the ombudsman receives up to 6,000 complaints from soldiers each year , which make up part of the report he submits annually to parliament .
he also regularly visits the troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports could play a greater role in a soldier 's career robbe said on tuesday that soldiers ' poor state of health was not all their fault .
instead , he said , the bundeswehr needed to take a different approach to fitness and health .
the introduction of rations designated as " optimized provisions " had led to less bread and fruit being available to soldiers .
it had n't been an improvement but a cost-cutting measure . he also lamented the amount of bureaucracy soldiers have to deal with on a daily basis and the bundeswehr 's continuing lack of funds .
keeping them honest based on a swedish model , the ombudsman 's office was created at the same time as the bundeswehr itself , in 1955 .
in the wake of the german army 's entanglement in the crimes of the nazis , the idea was to prevent abuse of power by having a politician , rather than a soldier , act as a liaison between parliament and the armed forces . parliament chooses the ombudsman , usually from its own ranks , for the five-year post .
the office holder is required to lay down his or her parliamentary mandate and work exclusively as the ombudsman . the current officeholder , reinhold robbe , was a conscientious objector as a young man in the 1970s .
the social democrat is a defense policy specialist and a fervent believer in the need for mandatory military conscription . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're out of shape .
they drink and smoke too much .
their general fitness level is unacceptable . reinhold robbe 's 2008 report , which he presented to his employer , the german parliament , on tuesday , march 4 , said that more than 40 percent of the country 's soldiers were overweight and over 70 percent were regular smokers .
sports often played a minor role in the army , and the soldiers ' physical abilities were alarming , the ombudsman said .
the german army was suffering from the effects of a passive lifestyle . robbe would n't go so far as to say that the troops were too unfit to fight .
he did , however , point out that : " every athletic soldier who can react quickly has an advantage on the field . " as the bundeswehr 's agony aunt , robbe should know .
his job is to provide civilian oversight of the armed forces and ensure that the country 's soldiers are being treated appropriately .
the ombudsman receives up to 6,000 complaints from soldiers each year , which make up part of the report he submits annually to parliament .
he also regularly visits the troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports could play a greater role in a soldier 's career robbe said on tuesday that soldiers ' poor state of health was not all their fault .
instead , he said , the bundeswehr needed to take a different approach to fitness and health .
the introduction of rations designated as " optimized provisions " had led to less bread and fruit being available to soldiers .
it had n't been an improvement but a cost-cutting measure . he also lamented the amount of bureaucracy soldiers have to deal with on a daily basis and the bundeswehr 's continuing lack of funds .
keeping them honest based on a swedish model , the ombudsman 's office was created at the same time as the bundeswehr itself , in 1955 .
in the wake of the german army 's entanglement in the crimes of the nazis , the idea was to prevent abuse of power by having a politician , rather than a soldier , act as a liaison between parliament and the armed forces . parliament chooses the ombudsman , usually from its own ranks , for the five-year post .
the office holder is required to lay down his or her parliamentary mandate and work exclusively as the ombudsman . the current officeholder , reinhold robbe , was a conscientious objector as a young man in the 1970s .

german worked an estimated three billion overtime hours last years , according to a new study , but were only compensated for half of them .
it 's no wonder they 're also the world champs in vacationing . " can you stay longer today ? "
what do you say when your boss asks you that question . according to a new study by the institute for labor market and career research -lrb- iab -rrb- in nuremberg , many germans are either too chicken to say no , do n't have anything better to do instead , or truly are die-hard workaholics . sure , germans may be known for their diligence , but c 'mon : three billion hours is a really long time .
it 's the equivalent of 125,000,000 days , 17,857,142 weeks , or 342,466 years . things start looking even worse when you think that 1.5 billion of those hours were practically done on a volunteer basis . it sounds like a recipe for a strike -lrb- see this week 's news -rrb- .
but - surprisingly - it 's not the public services or transportation sectors that are affected , rather the employees in retail shops , restaurants , banks and insurance companies and no one 's striking there . still , who 'd have thought that 1.5 billion hours of unpaid exploitation takes place in one of the world 's most expensive labor markets - and nobody 's complaining ! maybe it has something to do with those 30-some vacation days that most germans get every year . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're out of shape .
they drink and smoke too much .
their general fitness level is unacceptable . reinhold robbe 's 2008 report , which he presented to his employer , the german parliament , on tuesday , march 4 , said that more than 40 percent of the country 's soldiers were overweight and over 70 percent were regular smokers .
sports often played a minor role in the army , and the soldiers ' physical abilities were alarming , the ombudsman said .
the german army was suffering from the effects of a passive lifestyle . robbe would n't go so far as to say that the troops were too unfit to fight .
he did , however , point out that : " every athletic soldier who can react quickly has an advantage on the field . " as the bundeswehr 's agony aunt , robbe should know .
his job is to provide civilian oversight of the armed forces and ensure that the country 's soldiers are being treated appropriately .
the ombudsman receives up to 6,000 complaints from soldiers each year , which make up part of the report he submits annually to parliament .
he also regularly visits the troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports could play a greater role in a soldier 's career robbe said on tuesday that soldiers ' poor state of health was not all their fault .
instead , he said , the bundeswehr needed to take a different approach to fitness and health .
the introduction of rations designated as " optimized provisions " had led to less bread and fruit being available to soldiers .
it had n't been an improvement but a cost-cutting measure . he also lamented the amount of bureaucracy soldiers have to deal with on a daily basis and the bundeswehr 's continuing lack of funds .
keeping them honest based on a swedish model , the ombudsman 's office was created at the same time as the bundeswehr itself , in 1955 .
in the wake of the german army 's entanglement in the crimes of the nazis , the idea was to prevent abuse of power by having a politician , rather than a soldier , act as a liaison between parliament and the armed forces . parliament chooses the ombudsman , usually from its own ranks , for the five-year post .
the office holder is required to lay down his or her parliamentary mandate and work exclusively as the ombudsman . the current officeholder , reinhold robbe , was a conscientious objector as a young man in the 1970s .
the social democrat is a defense policy specialist and a fervent believer in the need for mandatory military conscription . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're out of shape .
they drink and smoke too much .
their general fitness level is unacceptable . reinhold robbe 's 2008 report , which he presented to his employer , the german parliament , on tuesday , march 4 , said that more than 40 percent of the country 's soldiers were overweight and over 70 percent were regular smokers .
sports often played a minor role in the army , and the soldiers ' physical abilities were alarming , the ombudsman said .
the german army was suffering from the effects of a passive lifestyle . robbe would n't go so far as to say that the troops were too unfit to fight .
he did , however , point out that : " every athletic soldier who can react quickly has an advantage on the field . " as the bundeswehr 's agony aunt , robbe should know .
his job is to provide civilian oversight of the armed forces and ensure that the country 's soldiers are being treated appropriately .
the ombudsman receives up to 6,000 complaints from soldiers each year , which make up part of the report he submits annually to parliament .
he also regularly visits the troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports could play a greater role in a soldier 's career robbe said on tuesday that soldiers ' poor state of health was not all their fault .
instead , he said , the bundeswehr needed to take a different approach to fitness and health .
the introduction of rations designated as " optimized provisions " had led to less bread and fruit being available to soldiers .
it had n't been an improvement but a cost-cutting measure . he also lamented the amount of bureaucracy soldiers have to deal with on a daily basis and the bundeswehr 's continuing lack of funds .
keeping them honest based on a swedish model , the ombudsman 's office was created at the same time as the bundeswehr itself , in 1955 .
in the wake of the german army 's entanglement in the crimes of the nazis , the idea was to prevent abuse of power by having a politician , rather than a soldier , act as a liaison between parliament and the armed forces . parliament chooses the ombudsman , usually from its own ranks , for the five-year post .
the office holder is required to lay down his or her parliamentary mandate and work exclusively as the ombudsman . the current officeholder , reinhold robbe , was a conscientious objector as a young man in the 1970s .

western europe buys most of its gas from russia and it has to pass through ukrainian pipelines to get there . ukraine may cut gas deliveries to western europe if russia 's gas giant gazprom continues to tighten the tap on supplies to ukraine , state gas company naftogaz said tuesday , march 4 , in a statement . gazprom on monday reduced ukraine 's gas supply by 25 percent , bringing the total supply to half its normal level .
it said it would cut deliveries by another 25 percent at 5:00 pm gmt tuesday . gazprom says europe wo n't feel the crunch " naftogaz can only guarantee uninterrupted transit -lsb- of gas -rsb- to european consumers as long as it does not threaten ukraine 's energy security , " said the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is planning a baltic sea pipeline to circumvent transit countries like ukraine european commission spokesman michele cercone said tuesday that gazprom had promised that gas supplies to the european union would not be affected . " the commission is concerned about the apparent reductions and urges both parties to go ahead in negotiations and quickly find a definitive solution to this commercial issue , " added cercone . some 80 percent of the eu 's gas orders from russia - a quarter of its total gas supply - flows through ukraine . resolution elusive in gas impasse the recent cuts are part of an ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine over gas prices and supply that began in early 2006 .
at that time , russia tightened the tap when ukraine refused to pay jacked up prices , which had a ripple effect on gas deliveries to europe and sparked concern over russia 's reliability as a supplier . gazprom has said kiev has some $ 600 million -lrb- 395 million euros -rrb- in outstanding debts and has accused it of taking more than it pays for by siphoning off extra gas to sell to western europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom was partially re-nationalized under putin ukraine , on the other hand , has said that gazprom has n't paid transit fees on gas passing through to the european market . energy clash splits ukraine ukrainian president viktor yushchenko on monday said that the conflict could escalate into a new " gas war " with moscow .
he had negotiated a new gas agreement with russian president vladimir putin last month , but the deal had not yet been signed . the conflict has split ukraine 's governing coalition , with yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko taking different positions .
according to reports , yushchenko 's deal with putin may have collapsed after tymoshenko 's recent visit to moscow . gazprom 's chairman of the board , dmitry medvedev was on sunday elected to succeed putin as president , but it is unclear whether he played a role in the most recent gas cuts . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

western europe buys most of its gas from russia and it has to pass through ukrainian pipelines to get there . ukraine may cut gas deliveries to western europe if russia 's gas giant gazprom continues to tighten the tap on supplies to ukraine , state gas company naftogaz said tuesday , march 4 , in a statement . gazprom on monday reduced ukraine 's gas supply by 25 percent , bringing the total supply to half its normal level .
it said it would cut deliveries by another 25 percent at 5:00 pm gmt tuesday . gazprom says europe wo n't feel the crunch " naftogaz can only guarantee uninterrupted transit -lsb- of gas -rsb- to european consumers as long as it does not threaten ukraine 's energy security , " said the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is planning a baltic sea pipeline to circumvent transit countries like ukraine european commission spokesman michele cercone said tuesday that gazprom had promised that gas supplies to the european union would not be affected . " the commission is concerned about the apparent reductions and urges both parties to go ahead in negotiations and quickly find a definitive solution to this commercial issue , " added cercone . some 80 percent of the eu 's gas orders from russia - a quarter of its total gas supply - flows through ukraine . resolution elusive in gas impasse the recent cuts are part of an ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine over gas prices and supply that began in early 2006 .
at that time , russia tightened the tap when ukraine refused to pay jacked up prices , which had a ripple effect on gas deliveries to europe and sparked concern over russia 's reliability as a supplier . gazprom has said kiev has some $ 600 million -lrb- 395 million euros -rrb- in outstanding debts and has accused it of taking more than it pays for by siphoning off extra gas to sell to western europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom was partially re-nationalized under putin ukraine , on the other hand , has said that gazprom has n't paid transit fees on gas passing through to the european market . energy clash splits ukraine ukrainian president viktor yushchenko on monday said that the conflict could escalate into a new " gas war " with moscow .
he had negotiated a new gas agreement with russian president vladimir putin last month , but the deal had not yet been signed . the conflict has split ukraine 's governing coalition , with yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko taking different positions .
according to reports , yushchenko 's deal with putin may have collapsed after tymoshenko 's recent visit to moscow . gazprom 's chairman of the board , dmitry medvedev was on sunday elected to succeed putin as president , but it is unclear whether he played a role in the most recent gas cuts . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

computer giant microsoft said computers could be activated to save electricity . german chancellor angela merkel attended the public opening of the six-day trade fair - billed as the world 's biggest show of computer software and digital gear . a total of 5,845 exhibitors from 77 countries are taking part in the 2008 trade show and paying special attention to the needs of large corporate and government buyers . merkel was joined by french president nicolas sarkozy , european commission president jose manuel barroso and microsoft head steve ballmer at the trade fair 's formal opening on monday . ballmer told reporters that computers could contribute to combating climate change by being activated to save electricity . computers going green ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat screens are nothing new , but they 're getting bigger and clearer at cebit ibm germany chief executive martin jetter , who is on the board of the german computing trade federation bitkom , said software and services could help most other business sectors cut their power use and their carbon footprint . environmentally friendly technology is one of the themes of the cebit , which runs from march 4-9 , heeding calls for future computers to waste less electricity . " if you exclude transportation and travel , pcs and information technology are probably the area with the fastest-growing consumption , " ballmer said . the world 's computer and telecommunications systems are estimated to cause about 2 percent of carbon dioxide emissions , industry leaders said at a briefing .
those emissions are about equal to the carbon emitted by the world 's aircraft engines . " there 's work that the software companies need to do to drive down power consumption , " he added .
" we believe we have both a responsibility and the innovations at our disposal which can help us concentrate on reducing consumption . " ballmer said computers were necessary as a tool for some of the scientific research that could fundamentally change the way that energy is generated and used . responding to criticism of the huge electricity demands from internet server " farms , " ballmer said microsoft would publish policies it had developed for power reduction in its data centers .
he added that , when idling , the new windows vista operating system uses 3 percent of the energy of the older xp system . raising awareness through computers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just a computer fair , cell phone technology is also present in hanover microsoft and the german energy provider yello strom have also entered a partnership to raise awareness among consumers .
the joint project is to enable customers to use software to monitor and control their energy consumption . the system is based on a new german law that allows electricity producers to install their own meters .
it was the beginning of an entirely new way of monitoring , said martin vesper , managing director of yello strom . " we said right away that other solutions must be found since the current meter systems are 40 to 50 years old , " he said .
" these old methods no longer correlate with the possibilities that now exist , which could help raise awareness among consumers and provide them with more transparency about energy efficiency . " the new technology vesper referred to consists of power meters that send consumption information to the electricity provider , who make the data available electronically to customers . " the system will enable consumers to be informed about the power they use in ' real-time , ' which will make it possible for them to immediately see how they can cut down , " vesper said . consumers will be able to see how much energy - and money - they save on a daily , monthly and annual basis when they turn off electrical appliances . one thing consumers wo n't be able to track , though : how much energy they 'll save when they switch off their computers . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

western europe buys most of its gas from russia and it has to pass through ukrainian pipelines to get there . ukraine may cut gas deliveries to western europe if russia 's gas giant gazprom continues to tighten the tap on supplies to ukraine , state gas company naftogaz said tuesday , march 4 , in a statement . gazprom on monday reduced ukraine 's gas supply by 25 percent , bringing the total supply to half its normal level .
it said it would cut deliveries by another 25 percent at 5:00 pm gmt tuesday . gazprom says europe wo n't feel the crunch " naftogaz can only guarantee uninterrupted transit -lsb- of gas -rsb- to european consumers as long as it does not threaten ukraine 's energy security , " said the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is planning a baltic sea pipeline to circumvent transit countries like ukraine european commission spokesman michele cercone said tuesday that gazprom had promised that gas supplies to the european union would not be affected . " the commission is concerned about the apparent reductions and urges both parties to go ahead in negotiations and quickly find a definitive solution to this commercial issue , " added cercone . some 80 percent of the eu 's gas orders from russia - a quarter of its total gas supply - flows through ukraine . resolution elusive in gas impasse the recent cuts are part of an ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine over gas prices and supply that began in early 2006 .
at that time , russia tightened the tap when ukraine refused to pay jacked up prices , which had a ripple effect on gas deliveries to europe and sparked concern over russia 's reliability as a supplier . gazprom has said kiev has some $ 600 million -lrb- 395 million euros -rrb- in outstanding debts and has accused it of taking more than it pays for by siphoning off extra gas to sell to western europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom was partially re-nationalized under putin ukraine , on the other hand , has said that gazprom has n't paid transit fees on gas passing through to the european market . energy clash splits ukraine ukrainian president viktor yushchenko on monday said that the conflict could escalate into a new " gas war " with moscow .
he had negotiated a new gas agreement with russian president vladimir putin last month , but the deal had not yet been signed . the conflict has split ukraine 's governing coalition , with yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko taking different positions .
according to reports , yushchenko 's deal with putin may have collapsed after tymoshenko 's recent visit to moscow . gazprom 's chairman of the board , dmitry medvedev was on sunday elected to succeed putin as president , but it is unclear whether he played a role in the most recent gas cuts . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but experts say policing efforts in germany will likely remain disjointed . as travel within the european union becomes increasingly borderless , german politicians decided it was time to rethink the role of the federal police to focus on internal issues such as terrorism and illegal immigration . the reforms included shutting numerous field offices across the country and centralizing management of the 40,000-strong force under the leadership of matthias seeger , who formerly headed one of the federal police regional offices .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble travelled to the new potsdam headquarters of the federal police on monday , march 3 , to welcome seeger to his new job . schaeuble promised that the streamlined force would free up personnel to focus on terrorism .
the law allowing the restructuring officially went into force on saturday . " we 're reducing bureaucracy this way , " said schaeuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . resisting reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal police are going beyond border patrol the federal police have been responsible for guarding germany 's border crossings and overseeing security in airports and train stations .
germany 's state governments can also call in the federal police if they need backup during riots or demonstrations , and the force has played a role in training police officers in places such as afghanistan . but germany still gives most of its responsibility for policing and internal security issues to its 16 federal states .
the regional governments traditionally resist police reform because they worry about losing their influence over domestic security issues , said michael bauer , a security expert at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . state police have a good overview of the local situation that someone sitting in berlin would n't necessarily have , bauer said .
yet there is general acknowledgement in the security field that certain issues , such as terrorism , need to be dealt with at a national level as terrorism suspects typically work in a network that crosses state and national boundaries . the federal police can " get the big picture " in a way that local jurisdictions often ca n't , bauer said . falling through the cracks immigration is n't a new area for the federal police either .
responsible for security at germany 's airports , the last german official many illegal immigrants see before being deported is a federal police officer . bernd mesovic , a spokesman for pro asyl , a campaign group for refugees which monitors deportations , said he was n't alarmed to hear that the federal police could become more involved in the issue . yet the biggest problem with the current system is that illegal immigrants often get passed from one police agency to the next in the process of being deported from germany .
that can lead to often important information about the immigrant 's health , for example , getting lost in the shuffle , he said . wary of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal police will keep responsibility for train station and airport security mesovic said a recent examination of deportations at frankfurt airport showed federal police have not engaged in human rights violations , however , a concern among the general public about giving too much power to a centralized police force remains . because of the horrors committed by the gestapo , the secret police during the nazi regime , the german public is highly sensitive about a powerful , centralized police force .
there has also been unease about increasing surveillance and secret online searches . germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- remains responsible for collecting and analyzing information on terrorism and other national security threats . the bnd is heavily involved in wiretapping and electronic surveillance .
the federal police -lrb- bundespolizei -rrb- are also different from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bundeskriminalamt -rrb- , which is the federal government 's investigative arm that functions similarly to the fbi in the united states . one thing most germans do n't understand is that it 's possible to keep the intelligence services ' work , such as that done by the bnd , separate from police work , said bauer of the center for applied policy research . " sometimes i think that in the public discussion this gets a bit mixed up , " bauer said . walking the walk only time will tell whether the personnel changes bring about a noticeable difference in how the federal police go about their jobs .
bauer said he doubts the restructuring will have a big impact as it 's not backed up by " sufficient resources to get the job done .

german worked an estimated three billion overtime hours last years , according to a new study , but were only compensated for half of them .
it 's no wonder they 're also the world champs in vacationing . " can you stay longer today ? "
what do you say when your boss asks you that question . according to a new study by the institute for labor market and career research -lrb- iab -rrb- in nuremberg , many germans are either too chicken to say no , do n't have anything better to do instead , or truly are die-hard workaholics . sure , germans may be known for their diligence , but c 'mon : three billion hours is a really long time .
it 's the equivalent of 125,000,000 days , 17,857,142 weeks , or 342,466 years . things start looking even worse when you think that 1.5 billion of those hours were practically done on a volunteer basis . it sounds like a recipe for a strike -lrb- see this week 's news -rrb- .
but - surprisingly - it 's not the public services or transportation sectors that are affected , rather the employees in retail shops , restaurants , banks and insurance companies and no one 's striking there . still , who 'd have thought that 1.5 billion hours of unpaid exploitation takes place in one of the world 's most expensive labor markets - and nobody 's complaining ! maybe it has something to do with those 30-some vacation days that most germans get every year . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but its member states disagree on how . berlin is spearheading efforts to cut off tax havens as investigations continue into large-scale tax evasion on the part of hundreds of wealthy germans .
but it found its quest blocked by vienna at a meeting of eu finance minister in brussels on tuesday , march 4 . germany wants to expand eu legislation to force all member states to share information about foreigners who have accrued income in interest on bank accounts . " bank secrecy is not on the table , " austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer stressed after the meeting . austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer said his country would veto the attempt to water down bank secrecy regulations unless " other european countries , " followed suit .

but experts say policing efforts in germany will likely remain disjointed . as travel within the european union becomes increasingly borderless , german politicians decided it was time to rethink the role of the federal police to focus on internal issues such as terrorism and illegal immigration . the reforms included shutting numerous field offices across the country and centralizing management of the 40,000-strong force under the leadership of matthias seeger , who formerly headed one of the federal police regional offices .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble travelled to the new potsdam headquarters of the federal police on monday , march 3 , to welcome seeger to his new job . schaeuble promised that the streamlined force would free up personnel to focus on terrorism .
the law allowing the restructuring officially went into force on saturday . " we 're reducing bureaucracy this way , " said schaeuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . resisting reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal police are going beyond border patrol the federal police have been responsible for guarding germany 's border crossings and overseeing security in airports and train stations .
germany 's state governments can also call in the federal police if they need backup during riots or demonstrations , and the force has played a role in training police officers in places such as afghanistan . but germany still gives most of its responsibility for policing and internal security issues to its 16 federal states .
the regional governments traditionally resist police reform because they worry about losing their influence over domestic security issues , said michael bauer , a security expert at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . state police have a good overview of the local situation that someone sitting in berlin would n't necessarily have , bauer said .
yet there is general acknowledgement in the security field that certain issues , such as terrorism , need to be dealt with at a national level as terrorism suspects typically work in a network that crosses state and national boundaries . the federal police can " get the big picture " in a way that local jurisdictions often ca n't , bauer said . falling through the cracks immigration is n't a new area for the federal police either .
responsible for security at germany 's airports , the last german official many illegal immigrants see before being deported is a federal police officer . bernd mesovic , a spokesman for pro asyl , a campaign group for refugees which monitors deportations , said he was n't alarmed to hear that the federal police could become more involved in the issue . yet the biggest problem with the current system is that illegal immigrants often get passed from one police agency to the next in the process of being deported from germany .
that can lead to often important information about the immigrant 's health , for example , getting lost in the shuffle , he said . wary of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal police will keep responsibility for train station and airport security mesovic said a recent examination of deportations at frankfurt airport showed federal police have not engaged in human rights violations , however , a concern among the general public about giving too much power to a centralized police force remains . because of the horrors committed by the gestapo , the secret police during the nazi regime , the german public is highly sensitive about a powerful , centralized police force .
there has also been unease about increasing surveillance and secret online searches . germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- remains responsible for collecting and analyzing information on terrorism and other national security threats . the bnd is heavily involved in wiretapping and electronic surveillance .
the federal police -lrb- bundespolizei -rrb- are also different from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bundeskriminalamt -rrb- , which is the federal government 's investigative arm that functions similarly to the fbi in the united states . one thing most germans do n't understand is that it 's possible to keep the intelligence services ' work , such as that done by the bnd , separate from police work , said bauer of the center for applied policy research . " sometimes i think that in the public discussion this gets a bit mixed up , " bauer said . walking the walk only time will tell whether the personnel changes bring about a noticeable difference in how the federal police go about their jobs .
bauer said he doubts the restructuring will have a big impact as it 's not backed up by " sufficient resources to get the job done . " mesovic also said he doubts there will be a major shift of power to the federal police and away from the states .

western europe buys most of its gas from russia and it has to pass through ukrainian pipelines to get there . ukraine may cut gas deliveries to western europe if russia 's gas giant gazprom continues to tighten the tap on supplies to ukraine , state gas company naftogaz said tuesday , march 4 , in a statement . gazprom on monday reduced ukraine 's gas supply by 25 percent , bringing the total supply to half its normal level .
it said it would cut deliveries by another 25 percent at 5:00 pm gmt tuesday . gazprom says europe wo n't feel the crunch " naftogaz can only guarantee uninterrupted transit -lsb- of gas -rsb- to european consumers as long as it does not threaten ukraine 's energy security , " said the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is planning a baltic sea pipeline to circumvent transit countries like ukraine european commission spokesman michele cercone said tuesday that gazprom had promised that gas supplies to the european union would not be affected . " the commission is concerned about the apparent reductions and urges both parties to go ahead in negotiations and quickly find a definitive solution to this commercial issue , " added cercone . some 80 percent of the eu 's gas orders from russia - a quarter of its total gas supply - flows through ukraine . resolution elusive in gas impasse the recent cuts are part of an ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine over gas prices and supply that began in early 2006 .
at that time , russia tightened the tap when ukraine refused to pay jacked up prices , which had a ripple effect on gas deliveries to europe and sparked concern over russia 's reliability as a supplier . gazprom has said kiev has some $ 600 million -lrb- 395 million euros -rrb- in outstanding debts and has accused it of taking more than it pays for by siphoning off extra gas to sell to western europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom was partially re-nationalized under putin ukraine , on the other hand , has said that gazprom has n't paid transit fees on gas passing through to the european market . energy clash splits ukraine ukrainian president viktor yushchenko on monday said that the conflict could escalate into a new " gas war " with moscow .
he had negotiated a new gas agreement with russian president vladimir putin last month , but the deal had not yet been signed . the conflict has split ukraine 's governing coalition , with yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko taking different positions .
according to reports , yushchenko 's deal with putin may have collapsed after tymoshenko 's recent visit to moscow . gazprom 's chairman of the board , dmitry medvedev was on sunday elected to succeed putin as president , but it is unclear whether he played a role in the most recent gas cuts . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's no wonder they 're also the world champs in vacationing . " can you stay longer today ? "
what do you say when your boss asks you that question . according to a new study by the institute for labor market and career research -lrb- iab -rrb- in nuremberg , many germans are either too chicken to say no , do n't have anything better to do instead , or truly are die-hard workaholics . sure , germans may be known for their diligence , but c 'mon : three billion hours is a really long time .

computer giant microsoft said computers could be activated to save electricity . german chancellor angela merkel attended the public opening of the six-day trade fair - billed as the world 's biggest show of computer software and digital gear . a total of 5,845 exhibitors from 77 countries are taking part in the 2008 trade show and paying special attention to the needs of large corporate and government buyers . merkel was joined by french president nicolas sarkozy , european commission president jose manuel barroso and microsoft head steve ballmer at the trade fair 's formal opening on monday . ballmer told reporters that computers could contribute to combating climate change by being activated to save electricity . computers going green ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat screens are nothing new , but they 're getting bigger and clearer at cebit ibm germany chief executive martin jetter , who is on the board of the german computing trade federation bitkom , said software and services could help most other business sectors cut their power use and their carbon footprint . environmentally friendly technology is one of the themes of the cebit , which runs from march 4-9 , heeding calls for future computers to waste less electricity . " if you exclude transportation and travel , pcs and information technology are probably the area with the fastest-growing consumption , " ballmer said . the world 's computer and telecommunications systems are estimated to cause about 2 percent of carbon dioxide emissions , industry leaders said at a briefing .
those emissions are about equal to the carbon emitted by the world 's aircraft engines . " there 's work that the software companies need to do to drive down power consumption , " he added .
" we believe we have both a responsibility and the innovations at our disposal which can help us concentrate on reducing consumption . " ballmer said computers were necessary as a tool for some of the scientific research that could fundamentally change the way that energy is generated and used . responding to criticism of the huge electricity demands from internet server " farms , " ballmer said microsoft would publish policies it had developed for power reduction in its data centers .
he added that , when idling , the new windows vista operating system uses 3 percent of the energy of the older xp system . raising awareness through computers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just a computer fair , cell phone technology is also present in hanover microsoft and the german energy provider yello strom have also entered a partnership to raise awareness among consumers .
the joint project is to enable customers to use software to monitor and control their energy consumption . the system is based on a new german law that allows electricity producers to install their own meters .
it was the beginning of an entirely new way of monitoring , said martin vesper , managing director of yello strom . " we said right away that other solutions must be found since the current meter systems are 40 to 50 years old , " he said .
" these old methods no longer correlate with the possibilities that now exist , which could help raise awareness among consumers and provide them with more transparency about energy efficiency . " the new technology vesper referred to consists of power meters that send consumption information to the electricity provider , who make the data available electronically to customers . " the system will enable consumers to be informed about the power they use in ' real-time , ' which will make it possible for them to immediately see how they can cut down , " vesper said . consumers will be able to see how much energy - and money - they save on a daily , monthly and annual basis when they turn off electrical appliances . one thing consumers wo n't be able to track , though : how much energy they 'll save when they switch off their computers . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german worked an estimated three billion overtime hours last years , according to a new study , but were only compensated for half of them .
it 's no wonder they 're also the world champs in vacationing . " can you stay longer today ? "
what do you say when your boss asks you that question . according to a new study by the institute for labor market and career research -lrb- iab -rrb- in nuremberg , many germans are either too chicken to say no , do n't have anything better to do instead , or truly are die-hard workaholics . sure , germans may be known for their diligence , but c 'mon : three billion hours is a really long time .
it 's the equivalent of 125,000,000 days , 17,857,142 weeks , or 342,466 years . things start looking even worse when you think that 1.5 billion of those hours were practically done on a volunteer basis . it sounds like a recipe for a strike -lrb- see this week 's news -rrb- .
but - surprisingly - it 's not the public services or transportation sectors that are affected , rather the employees in retail shops , restaurants , banks and insurance companies and no one 's striking there . still , who 'd have thought that 1.5 billion hours of unpaid exploitation takes place in one of the world 's most expensive labor markets - and nobody 's complaining ! maybe it has something to do with those 30-some vacation days that most germans get every year . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

computer giant microsoft said computers could be activated to save electricity . german chancellor angela merkel attended the public opening of the six-day trade fair - billed as the world 's biggest show of computer software and digital gear . a total of 5,845 exhibitors from 77 countries are taking part in the 2008 trade show and paying special attention to the needs of large corporate and government buyers . merkel was joined by french president nicolas sarkozy , european commission president jose manuel barroso and microsoft head steve ballmer at the trade fair 's formal opening on monday . ballmer told reporters that computers could contribute to combating climate change by being activated to save electricity . computers going green ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat screens are nothing new , but they 're getting bigger and clearer at cebit ibm germany chief executive martin jetter , who is on the board of the german computing trade federation bitkom , said software and services could help most other business sectors cut their power use and their carbon footprint . environmentally friendly technology is one of the themes of the cebit , which runs from march 4-9 , heeding calls for future computers to waste less electricity . " if you exclude transportation and travel , pcs and information technology are probably the area with the fastest-growing consumption , " ballmer said . the world 's computer and telecommunications systems are estimated to cause about 2 percent of carbon dioxide emissions , industry leaders said at a briefing .
those emissions are about equal to the carbon emitted by the world 's aircraft engines . " there 's work that the software companies need to do to drive down power consumption , " he added .
" we believe we have both a responsibility and the innovations at our disposal which can help us concentrate on reducing consumption . " ballmer said computers were necessary as a tool for some of the scientific research that could fundamentally change the way that energy is generated and used . responding to criticism of the huge electricity demands from internet server " farms , " ballmer said microsoft would publish policies it had developed for power reduction in its data centers .
he added that , when idling , the new windows vista operating system uses 3 percent of the energy of the older xp system . raising awareness through computers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just a computer fair , cell phone technology is also present in hanover microsoft and the german energy provider yello strom have also entered a partnership to raise awareness among consumers .
the joint project is to enable customers to use software to monitor and control their energy consumption . the system is based on a new german law that allows electricity producers to install their own meters .
it was the beginning of an entirely new way of monitoring , said martin vesper , managing director of yello strom . " we said right away that other solutions must be found since the current meter systems are 40 to 50 years old , " he said .
" these old methods no longer correlate with the possibilities that now exist , which could help raise awareness among consumers and provide them with more transparency about energy efficiency . " the new technology vesper referred to consists of power meters that send consumption information to the electricity provider , who make the data available electronically to customers . " the system will enable consumers to be informed about the power they use in ' real-time , ' which will make it possible for them to immediately see how they can cut down , " vesper said . consumers will be able to see how much energy - and money - they save on a daily , monthly and annual basis when they turn off electrical appliances . one thing consumers wo n't be able to track , though : how much energy they 'll save when they switch off their computers . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're out of shape .
they drink and smoke too much .
their general fitness level is unacceptable . reinhold robbe 's 2008 report , which he presented to his employer , the german parliament , on tuesday , march 4 , said that more than 40 percent of the country 's soldiers were overweight and over 70 percent were regular smokers .
sports often played a minor role in the army , and the soldiers ' physical abilities were alarming , the ombudsman said .
the german army was suffering from the effects of a passive lifestyle . robbe would n't go so far as to say that the troops were too unfit to fight .
he did , however , point out that : " every athletic soldier who can react quickly has an advantage on the field . " as the bundeswehr 's agony aunt , robbe should know .
his job is to provide civilian oversight of the armed forces and ensure that the country 's soldiers are being treated appropriately .
the ombudsman receives up to 6,000 complaints from soldiers each year , which make up part of the report he submits annually to parliament .
he also regularly visits the troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports could play a greater role in a soldier 's career robbe said on tuesday that soldiers ' poor state of health was not all their fault .
instead , he said , the bundeswehr needed to take a different approach to fitness and health .
the introduction of rations designated as " optimized provisions " had led to less bread and fruit being available to soldiers .
it had n't been an improvement but a cost-cutting measure . he also lamented the amount of bureaucracy soldiers have to deal with on a daily basis and the bundeswehr 's continuing lack of funds .
keeping them honest based on a swedish model , the ombudsman 's office was created at the same time as the bundeswehr itself , in 1955 .
in the wake of the german army 's entanglement in the crimes of the nazis , the idea was to prevent abuse of power by having a politician , rather than a soldier , act as a liaison between parliament and the armed forces . parliament chooses the ombudsman , usually from its own ranks , for the five-year post .
the office holder is required to lay down his or her parliamentary mandate and work exclusively as the ombudsman . the current officeholder , reinhold robbe , was a conscientious objector as a young man in the 1970s .

but its member states disagree on how . berlin is spearheading efforts to cut off tax havens as investigations continue into large-scale tax evasion on the part of hundreds of wealthy germans .

" bank secrecy is not on the table , " austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer stressed after the meeting . austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer said his country would veto the attempt to water down bank secrecy regulations unless " other european countries , " followed suit .
he was referring to switzerland , liechtenstein , andorra , san marino and monaco , all of which profit from strict bank secrecy laws . eu members austria , belgium and luxembourg had opted out of the 2005 legislation which allows foreign bank account holders to remain anonymous .

they 're out of shape .
they drink and smoke too much .
their general fitness level is unacceptable . reinhold robbe 's 2008 report , which he presented to his employer , the german parliament , on tuesday , march 4 , said that more than 40 percent of the country 's soldiers were overweight and over 70 percent were regular smokers .
sports often played a minor role in the army , and the soldiers ' physical abilities were alarming , the ombudsman said .
the german army was suffering from the effects of a passive lifestyle . robbe would n't go so far as to say that the troops were too unfit to fight .
he did , however , point out that : " every athletic soldier who can react quickly has an advantage on the field . " as the bundeswehr 's agony aunt , robbe should know .
his job is to provide civilian oversight of the armed forces and ensure that the country 's soldiers are being treated appropriately .
the ombudsman receives up to 6,000 complaints from soldiers each year , which make up part of the report he submits annually to parliament .
he also regularly visits the troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports could play a greater role in a soldier 's career robbe said on tuesday that soldiers ' poor state of health was not all their fault .
instead , he said , the bundeswehr needed to take a different approach to fitness and health .
the introduction of rations designated as " optimized provisions " had led to less bread and fruit being available to soldiers .
it had n't been an improvement but a cost-cutting measure . he also lamented the amount of bureaucracy soldiers have to deal with on a daily basis and the bundeswehr 's continuing lack of funds .
keeping them honest based on a swedish model , the ombudsman 's office was created at the same time as the bundeswehr itself , in 1955 .
in the wake of the german army 's entanglement in the crimes of the nazis , the idea was to prevent abuse of power by having a politician , rather than a soldier , act as a liaison between parliament and the armed forces . parliament chooses the ombudsman , usually from its own ranks , for the five-year post .
the office holder is required to lay down his or her parliamentary mandate and work exclusively as the ombudsman . the current officeholder , reinhold robbe , was a conscientious objector as a young man in the 1970s .

they 're out of shape .
they drink and smoke too much .
their general fitness level is unacceptable . reinhold robbe 's 2008 report , which he presented to his employer , the german parliament , on tuesday , march 4 , said that more than 40 percent of the country 's soldiers were overweight and over 70 percent were regular smokers .
sports often played a minor role in the army , and the soldiers ' physical abilities were alarming , the ombudsman said .
the german army was suffering from the effects of a passive lifestyle . robbe would n't go so far as to say that the troops were too unfit to fight .
he did , however , point out that : " every athletic soldier who can react quickly has an advantage on the field . " as the bundeswehr 's agony aunt , robbe should know .
his job is to provide civilian oversight of the armed forces and ensure that the country 's soldiers are being treated appropriately .
the ombudsman receives up to 6,000 complaints from soldiers each year , which make up part of the report he submits annually to parliament .
he also regularly visits the troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports could play a greater role in a soldier 's career robbe said on tuesday that soldiers ' poor state of health was not all their fault .
instead , he said , the bundeswehr needed to take a different approach to fitness and health .
the introduction of rations designated as " optimized provisions " had led to less bread and fruit being available to soldiers .
it had n't been an improvement but a cost-cutting measure . he also lamented the amount of bureaucracy soldiers have to deal with on a daily basis and the bundeswehr 's continuing lack of funds .
keeping them honest based on a swedish model , the ombudsman 's office was created at the same time as the bundeswehr itself , in 1955 .
in the wake of the german army 's entanglement in the crimes of the nazis , the idea was to prevent abuse of power by having a politician , rather than a soldier , act as a liaison between parliament and the armed forces . parliament chooses the ombudsman , usually from its own ranks , for the five-year post .
the office holder is required to lay down his or her parliamentary mandate and work exclusively as the ombudsman . the current officeholder , reinhold robbe , was a conscientious objector as a young man in the 1970s .

" vulnerable people in many of the world 's poorest countries are increasingly exposed to natural disasters , conflict and economic pressures that can rapidly lead to situations whereby people go hungry , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said on tuesday , march 4 . " the european union has an essential role in providing them with food aid , and in restoring food production , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : droughts can devastate harvests the united nations ' world food program is to manage the aid , which is to target 18.7 million of the world 's most vulnerable people living in countries or areas such as : sudan , chad , somalia , kenya , ethiopia , uganda , democratic republic of the congo , tanzania , burundi , the sahel countries of northern africa , liberia , zimbabwe , afghanistan , nepal , sri lanka , colombia and the palestinian territories . it is the largest funding decision of its kind by the commission 's aid department , michel said . more than just food in addition to food aid for populations in need following natural disasters , epidemics , or armed conflicts , the aid package is to also include more long-term support including seeds , tools and fertilizers . commission officials said the executive may allocate more funds later in the year , with the possibility of digging deeper into emergency reserves if necessary . " our concern is to avoid financial drought .
this may not be a tsunami or an earthquake but price inflation still generates humanitarian needs , " european commission aid spokesman john clancy told a news briefing . prices soared in 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , it 's either food aid or death the aid comes after a warning by the world food program that it will have to cut food donations to some poor nations if donors do not contribute more soon to help counteract soaring commodities prices . the commission noted that world wheat prices had shot up by 81 percent during the course of 2007 . such price rises are the result of a variety of factors , including bad harvests , higher oil prices and an increase in the production of crops used for the production of biofuels , which are viewed as a more environmentally-friendly alternative to gasoline . josette sheeran , executive director of the rome-based world food programme , appealed last week to members of the us congress and the bush administration to help meet a 329 euro -lrb- $ 500 million -rrb- shortfall for the fiscal year 2008 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but experts say policing efforts in germany will likely remain disjointed . as travel within the european union becomes increasingly borderless , german politicians decided it was time to rethink the role of the federal police to focus on internal issues such as terrorism and illegal immigration . the reforms included shutting numerous field offices across the country and centralizing management of the 40,000-strong force under the leadership of matthias seeger , who formerly headed one of the federal police regional offices .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble travelled to the new potsdam headquarters of the federal police on monday , march 3 , to welcome seeger to his new job . schaeuble promised that the streamlined force would free up personnel to focus on terrorism .
the law allowing the restructuring officially went into force on saturday . " we 're reducing bureaucracy this way , " said schaeuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . resisting reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal police are going beyond border patrol the federal police have been responsible for guarding germany 's border crossings and overseeing security in airports and train stations .
germany 's state governments can also call in the federal police if they need backup during riots or demonstrations , and the force has played a role in training police officers in places such as afghanistan . but germany still gives most of its responsibility for policing and internal security issues to its 16 federal states .
the regional governments traditionally resist police reform because they worry about losing their influence over domestic security issues , said michael bauer , a security expert at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . state police have a good overview of the local situation that someone sitting in berlin would n't necessarily have , bauer said .
yet there is general acknowledgement in the security field that certain issues , such as terrorism , need to be dealt with at a national level as terrorism suspects typically work in a network that crosses state and national boundaries . the federal police can " get the big picture " in a way that local jurisdictions often ca n't , bauer said . falling through the cracks immigration is n't a new area for the federal police either .
responsible for security at germany 's airports , the last german official many illegal immigrants see before being deported is a federal police officer . bernd mesovic , a spokesman for pro asyl , a campaign group for refugees which monitors deportations , said he was n't alarmed to hear that the federal police could become more involved in the issue . yet the biggest problem with the current system is that illegal immigrants often get passed from one police agency to the next in the process of being deported from germany .
that can lead to often important information about the immigrant 's health , for example , getting lost in the shuffle , he said . wary of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal police will keep responsibility for train station and airport security mesovic said a recent examination of deportations at frankfurt airport showed federal police have not engaged in human rights violations , however , a concern among the general public about giving too much power to a centralized police force remains . because of the horrors committed by the gestapo , the secret police during the nazi regime , the german public is highly sensitive about a powerful , centralized police force .
there has also been unease about increasing surveillance and secret online searches . germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- remains responsible for collecting and analyzing information on terrorism and other national security threats . the bnd is heavily involved in wiretapping and electronic surveillance .
the federal police -lrb- bundespolizei -rrb- are also different from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bundeskriminalamt -rrb- , which is the federal government 's investigative arm that functions similarly to the fbi in the united states . one thing most germans do n't understand is that it 's possible to keep the intelligence services ' work , such as that done by the bnd , separate from police work , said bauer of the center for applied policy research . " sometimes i think that in the public discussion this gets a bit mixed up , " bauer said . walking the walk only time will tell whether the personnel changes bring about a noticeable difference in how the federal police go about their jobs .
bauer said he doubts the restructuring will have a big impact as it 's not backed up by " sufficient resources to get the job done . " mesovic also said he doubts there will be a major shift of power to the federal police and away from the states .

but experts say policing efforts in germany will likely remain disjointed . as travel within the european union becomes increasingly borderless , german politicians decided it was time to rethink the role of the federal police to focus on internal issues such as terrorism and illegal immigration . the reforms included shutting numerous field offices across the country and centralizing management of the 40,000-strong force under the leadership of matthias seeger , who formerly headed one of the federal police regional offices .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble travelled to the new potsdam headquarters of the federal police on monday , march 3 , to welcome seeger to his new job . schaeuble promised that the streamlined force would free up personnel to focus on terrorism .

" vulnerable people in many of the world 's poorest countries are increasingly exposed to natural disasters , conflict and economic pressures that can rapidly lead to situations whereby people go hungry , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said on tuesday , march 4 . " the european union has an essential role in providing them with food aid , and in restoring food production , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : droughts can devastate harvests the united nations ' world food program is to manage the aid , which is to target 18.7 million of the world 's most vulnerable people living in countries or areas such as : sudan , chad , somalia , kenya , ethiopia , uganda , democratic republic of the congo , tanzania , burundi , the sahel countries of northern africa , liberia , zimbabwe , afghanistan , nepal , sri lanka , colombia and the palestinian territories . it is the largest funding decision of its kind by the commission 's aid department , michel said . more than just food in addition to food aid for populations in need following natural disasters , epidemics , or armed conflicts , the aid package is to also include more long-term support including seeds , tools and fertilizers . commission officials said the executive may allocate more funds later in the year , with the possibility of digging deeper into emergency reserves if necessary .

they 're out of shape .
they drink and smoke too much .
their general fitness level is unacceptable . reinhold robbe 's 2008 report , which he presented to his employer , the german parliament , on tuesday , march 4 , said that more than 40 percent of the country 's soldiers were overweight and over 70 percent were regular smokers .
sports often played a minor role in the army , and the soldiers ' physical abilities were alarming , the ombudsman said .
the german army was suffering from the effects of a passive lifestyle . robbe would n't go so far as to say that the troops were too unfit to fight .
he did , however , point out that : " every athletic soldier who can react quickly has an advantage on the field . " as the bundeswehr 's agony aunt , robbe should know .
his job is to provide civilian oversight of the armed forces and ensure that the country 's soldiers are being treated appropriately .
the ombudsman receives up to 6,000 complaints from soldiers each year , which make up part of the report he submits annually to parliament .
he also regularly visits the troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports could play a greater role in a soldier 's career robbe said on tuesday that soldiers ' poor state of health was not all their fault .
instead , he said , the bundeswehr needed to take a different approach to fitness and health .
the introduction of rations designated as " optimized provisions " had led to less bread and fruit being available to soldiers .
it had n't been an improvement but a cost-cutting measure . he also lamented the amount of bureaucracy soldiers have to deal with on a daily basis and the bundeswehr 's continuing lack of funds .
keeping them honest based on a swedish model , the ombudsman 's office was created at the same time as the bundeswehr itself , in 1955 .
in the wake of the german army 's entanglement in the crimes of the nazis , the idea was to prevent abuse of power by having a politician , rather than a soldier , act as a liaison between parliament and the armed forces . parliament chooses the ombudsman , usually from its own ranks , for the five-year post .
the office holder is required to lay down his or her parliamentary mandate and work exclusively as the ombudsman . the current officeholder , reinhold robbe , was a conscientious objector as a young man in the 1970s .

they 're out of shape .
they drink and smoke too much .
their general fitness level is unacceptable . reinhold robbe 's 2008 report , which he presented to his employer , the german parliament , on tuesday , march 4 , said that more than 40 percent of the country 's soldiers were overweight and over 70 percent were regular smokers .
sports often played a minor role in the army , and the soldiers ' physical abilities were alarming , the ombudsman said .
the german army was suffering from the effects of a passive lifestyle . robbe would n't go so far as to say that the troops were too unfit to fight .
he did , however , point out that : " every athletic soldier who can react quickly has an advantage on the field . " as the bundeswehr 's agony aunt , robbe should know .
his job is to provide civilian oversight of the armed forces and ensure that the country 's soldiers are being treated appropriately .
the ombudsman receives up to 6,000 complaints from soldiers each year , which make up part of the report he submits annually to parliament .
he also regularly visits the troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports could play a greater role in a soldier 's career robbe said on tuesday that soldiers ' poor state of health was not all their fault .
instead , he said , the bundeswehr needed to take a different approach to fitness and health .
the introduction of rations designated as " optimized provisions " had led to less bread and fruit being available to soldiers .
it had n't been an improvement but a cost-cutting measure . he also lamented the amount of bureaucracy soldiers have to deal with on a daily basis and the bundeswehr 's continuing lack of funds .
keeping them honest based on a swedish model , the ombudsman 's office was created at the same time as the bundeswehr itself , in 1955 .
in the wake of the german army 's entanglement in the crimes of the nazis , the idea was to prevent abuse of power by having a politician , rather than a soldier , act as a liaison between parliament and the armed forces . parliament chooses the ombudsman , usually from its own ranks , for the five-year post .
the office holder is required to lay down his or her parliamentary mandate and work exclusively as the ombudsman . the current officeholder , reinhold robbe , was a conscientious objector as a young man in the 1970s .
the social democrat is a defense policy specialist and a fervent believer in the need for mandatory military conscription . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

western europe buys most of its gas from russia and it has to pass through ukrainian pipelines to get there . ukraine may cut gas deliveries to western europe if russia 's gas giant gazprom continues to tighten the tap on supplies to ukraine , state gas company naftogaz said tuesday , march 4 , in a statement . gazprom on monday reduced ukraine 's gas supply by 25 percent , bringing the total supply to half its normal level .
it said it would cut deliveries by another 25 percent at 5:00 pm gmt tuesday . gazprom says europe wo n't feel the crunch " naftogaz can only guarantee uninterrupted transit -lsb- of gas -rsb- to european consumers as long as it does not threaten ukraine 's energy security , " said the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is planning a baltic sea pipeline to circumvent transit countries like ukraine european commission spokesman michele cercone said tuesday that gazprom had promised that gas supplies to the european union would not be affected . " the commission is concerned about the apparent reductions and urges both parties to go ahead in negotiations and quickly find a definitive solution to this commercial issue , " added cercone . some 80 percent of the eu 's gas orders from russia - a quarter of its total gas supply - flows through ukraine . resolution elusive in gas impasse the recent cuts are part of an ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine over gas prices and supply that began in early 2006 .
at that time , russia tightened the tap when ukraine refused to pay jacked up prices , which had a ripple effect on gas deliveries to europe and sparked concern over russia 's reliability as a supplier . gazprom has said kiev has some $ 600 million -lrb- 395 million euros -rrb- in outstanding debts and has accused it of taking more than it pays for by siphoning off extra gas to sell to western europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom was partially re-nationalized under putin ukraine , on the other hand , has said that gazprom has n't paid transit fees on gas passing through to the european market . energy clash splits ukraine ukrainian president viktor yushchenko on monday said that the conflict could escalate into a new " gas war " with moscow .
he had negotiated a new gas agreement with russian president vladimir putin last month , but the deal had not yet been signed . the conflict has split ukraine 's governing coalition , with yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko taking different positions .
according to reports , yushchenko 's deal with putin may have collapsed after tymoshenko 's recent visit to moscow . gazprom 's chairman of the board , dmitry medvedev was on sunday elected to succeed putin as president , but it is unclear whether he played a role in the most recent gas cuts . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

computer giant microsoft said computers could be activated to save electricity . german chancellor angela merkel attended the public opening of the six-day trade fair - billed as the world 's biggest show of computer software and digital gear . a total of 5,845 exhibitors from 77 countries are taking part in the 2008 trade show and paying special attention to the needs of large corporate and government buyers . merkel was joined by french president nicolas sarkozy , european commission president jose manuel barroso and microsoft head steve ballmer at the trade fair 's formal opening on monday . ballmer told reporters that computers could contribute to combating climate change by being activated to save electricity . computers going green ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat screens are nothing new , but they 're getting bigger and clearer at cebit ibm germany chief executive martin jetter , who is on the board of the german computing trade federation bitkom , said software and services could help most other business sectors cut their power use and their carbon footprint . environmentally friendly technology is one of the themes of the cebit , which runs from march 4-9 , heeding calls for future computers to waste less electricity . " if you exclude transportation and travel , pcs and information technology are probably the area with the fastest-growing consumption , " ballmer said . the world 's computer and telecommunications systems are estimated to cause about 2 percent of carbon dioxide emissions , industry leaders said at a briefing .
those emissions are about equal to the carbon emitted by the world 's aircraft engines . " there 's work that the software companies need to do to drive down power consumption , " he added .
" we believe we have both a responsibility and the innovations at our disposal which can help us concentrate on reducing consumption . " ballmer said computers were necessary as a tool for some of the scientific research that could fundamentally change the way that energy is generated and used . responding to criticism of the huge electricity demands from internet server " farms , " ballmer said microsoft would publish policies it had developed for power reduction in its data centers .
he added that , when idling , the new windows vista operating system uses 3 percent of the energy of the older xp system . raising awareness through computers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just a computer fair , cell phone technology is also present in hanover microsoft and the german energy provider yello strom have also entered a partnership to raise awareness among consumers .
the joint project is to enable customers to use software to monitor and control their energy consumption . the system is based on a new german law that allows electricity producers to install their own meters .
it was the beginning of an entirely new way of monitoring , said martin vesper , managing director of yello strom . " we said right away that other solutions must be found since the current meter systems are 40 to 50 years old , " he said .
" these old methods no longer correlate with the possibilities that now exist , which could help raise awareness among consumers and provide them with more transparency about energy efficiency . " the new technology vesper referred to consists of power meters that send consumption information to the electricity provider , who make the data available electronically to customers . " the system will enable consumers to be informed about the power they use in ' real-time , ' which will make it possible for them to immediately see how they can cut down , " vesper said . consumers will be able to see how much energy - and money - they save on a daily , monthly and annual basis when they turn off electrical appliances . one thing consumers wo n't be able to track , though : how much energy they 'll save when they switch off their computers . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sports often played a minor role in the army , and the soldiers ' physical abilities were alarming , the ombudsman said .
the german army was suffering from the effects of a passive lifestyle . robbe would n't go so far as to say that the troops were too unfit to fight .
he did , however , point out that : " every athletic soldier who can react quickly has an advantage on the field . " as the bundeswehr 's agony aunt , robbe should know .
his job is to provide civilian oversight of the armed forces and ensure that the country 's soldiers are being treated appropriately .
the ombudsman receives up to 6,000 complaints from soldiers each year , which make up part of the report he submits annually to parliament .
he also regularly visits the troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports could play a greater role in a soldier 's career robbe said on tuesday that soldiers ' poor state of health was not all their fault .
instead , he said , the bundeswehr needed to take a different approach to fitness and health .
the introduction of rations designated as " optimized provisions " had led to less bread and fruit being available to soldiers .
it had n't been an improvement but a cost-cutting measure . he also lamented the amount of bureaucracy soldiers have to deal with on a daily basis and the bundeswehr 's continuing lack of funds .

they 're out of shape .
they drink and smoke too much .
their general fitness level is unacceptable . reinhold robbe 's 2008 report , which he presented to his employer , the german parliament , on tuesday , march 4 , said that more than 40 percent of the country 's soldiers were overweight and over 70 percent were regular smokers .
sports often played a minor role in the army , and the soldiers ' physical abilities were alarming , the ombudsman said .
the german army was suffering from the effects of a passive lifestyle . robbe would n't go so far as to say that the troops were too unfit to fight .
he did , however , point out that : " every athletic soldier who can react quickly has an advantage on the field . " as the bundeswehr 's agony aunt , robbe should know .
his job is to provide civilian oversight of the armed forces and ensure that the country 's soldiers are being treated appropriately .
the ombudsman receives up to 6,000 complaints from soldiers each year , which make up part of the report he submits annually to parliament .
he also regularly visits the troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports could play a greater role in a soldier 's career robbe said on tuesday that soldiers ' poor state of health was not all their fault .
instead , he said , the bundeswehr needed to take a different approach to fitness and health .
the introduction of rations designated as " optimized provisions " had led to less bread and fruit being available to soldiers .
it had n't been an improvement but a cost-cutting measure . he also lamented the amount of bureaucracy soldiers have to deal with on a daily basis and the bundeswehr 's continuing lack of funds .
keeping them honest based on a swedish model , the ombudsman 's office was created at the same time as the bundeswehr itself , in 1955 .
in the wake of the german army 's entanglement in the crimes of the nazis , the idea was to prevent abuse of power by having a politician , rather than a soldier , act as a liaison between parliament and the armed forces . parliament chooses the ombudsman , usually from its own ranks , for the five-year post .

but experts say policing efforts in germany will likely remain disjointed . as travel within the european union becomes increasingly borderless , german politicians decided it was time to rethink the role of the federal police to focus on internal issues such as terrorism and illegal immigration . the reforms included shutting numerous field offices across the country and centralizing management of the 40,000-strong force under the leadership of matthias seeger , who formerly headed one of the federal police regional offices .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble travelled to the new potsdam headquarters of the federal police on monday , march 3 , to welcome seeger to his new job . schaeuble promised that the streamlined force would free up personnel to focus on terrorism .

germany 's state governments can also call in the federal police if they need backup during riots or demonstrations , and the force has played a role in training police officers in places such as afghanistan . but germany still gives most of its responsibility for policing and internal security issues to its 16 federal states .
the regional governments traditionally resist police reform because they worry about losing their influence over domestic security issues , said michael bauer , a security expert at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . state police have a good overview of the local situation that someone sitting in berlin would n't necessarily have , bauer said .
yet there is general acknowledgement in the security field that certain issues , such as terrorism , need to be dealt with at a national level as terrorism suspects typically work in a network that crosses state and national boundaries . the federal police can " get the big picture " in a way that local jurisdictions often ca n't , bauer said . falling through the cracks immigration is n't a new area for the federal police either .
responsible for security at germany 's airports , the last german official many illegal immigrants see before being deported is a federal police officer . bernd mesovic , a spokesman for pro asyl , a campaign group for refugees which monitors deportations , said he was n't alarmed to hear that the federal police could become more involved in the issue . yet the biggest problem with the current system is that illegal immigrants often get passed from one police agency to the next in the process of being deported from germany .

there has also been unease about increasing surveillance and secret online searches . germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- remains responsible for collecting and analyzing information on terrorism and other national security threats . the bnd is heavily involved in wiretapping and electronic surveillance .
the federal police -lrb- bundespolizei -rrb- are also different from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bundeskriminalamt -rrb- , which is the federal government 's investigative arm that functions similarly to the fbi in the united states . one thing most germans do n't understand is that it 's possible to keep the intelligence services ' work , such as that done by the bnd , separate from police work , said bauer of the center for applied policy research . " sometimes i think that in the public discussion this gets a bit mixed up , " bauer said . walking the walk only time will tell whether the personnel changes bring about a noticeable difference in how the federal police go about their jobs .

german worked an estimated three billion overtime hours last years , according to a new study , but were only compensated for half of them .
it 's no wonder they 're also the world champs in vacationing . " can you stay longer today ? "
what do you say when your boss asks you that question . according to a new study by the institute for labor market and career research -lrb- iab -rrb- in nuremberg , many germans are either too chicken to say no , do n't have anything better to do instead , or truly are die-hard workaholics . sure , germans may be known for their diligence , but c 'mon : three billion hours is a really long time .
it 's the equivalent of 125,000,000 days , 17,857,142 weeks , or 342,466 years . things start looking even worse when you think that 1.5 billion of those hours were practically done on a volunteer basis . it sounds like a recipe for a strike -lrb- see this week 's news -rrb- .
but - surprisingly - it 's not the public services or transportation sectors that are affected , rather the employees in retail shops , restaurants , banks and insurance companies and no one 's striking there . still , who 'd have thought that 1.5 billion hours of unpaid exploitation takes place in one of the world 's most expensive labor markets - and nobody 's complaining ! maybe it has something to do with those 30-some vacation days that most germans get every year . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

computer giant microsoft said computers could be activated to save electricity . german chancellor angela merkel attended the public opening of the six-day trade fair - billed as the world 's biggest show of computer software and digital gear . a total of 5,845 exhibitors from 77 countries are taking part in the 2008 trade show and paying special attention to the needs of large corporate and government buyers . merkel was joined by french president nicolas sarkozy , european commission president jose manuel barroso and microsoft head steve ballmer at the trade fair 's formal opening on monday . ballmer told reporters that computers could contribute to combating climate change by being activated to save electricity . computers going green ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat screens are nothing new , but they 're getting bigger and clearer at cebit ibm germany chief executive martin jetter , who is on the board of the german computing trade federation bitkom , said software and services could help most other business sectors cut their power use and their carbon footprint . environmentally friendly technology is one of the themes of the cebit , which runs from march 4-9 , heeding calls for future computers to waste less electricity . " if you exclude transportation and travel , pcs and information technology are probably the area with the fastest-growing consumption , " ballmer said . the world 's computer and telecommunications systems are estimated to cause about 2 percent of carbon dioxide emissions , industry leaders said at a briefing .
those emissions are about equal to the carbon emitted by the world 's aircraft engines . " there 's work that the software companies need to do to drive down power consumption , " he added .
" we believe we have both a responsibility and the innovations at our disposal which can help us concentrate on reducing consumption . " ballmer said computers were necessary as a tool for some of the scientific research that could fundamentally change the way that energy is generated and used . responding to criticism of the huge electricity demands from internet server " farms , " ballmer said microsoft would publish policies it had developed for power reduction in its data centers .
he added that , when idling , the new windows vista operating system uses 3 percent of the energy of the older xp system . raising awareness through computers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just a computer fair , cell phone technology is also present in hanover microsoft and the german energy provider yello strom have also entered a partnership to raise awareness among consumers .
the joint project is to enable customers to use software to monitor and control their energy consumption . the system is based on a new german law that allows electricity producers to install their own meters .
it was the beginning of an entirely new way of monitoring , said martin vesper , managing director of yello strom . " we said right away that other solutions must be found since the current meter systems are 40 to 50 years old , " he said .
" these old methods no longer correlate with the possibilities that now exist , which could help raise awareness among consumers and provide them with more transparency about energy efficiency . " the new technology vesper referred to consists of power meters that send consumption information to the electricity provider , who make the data available electronically to customers . " the system will enable consumers to be informed about the power they use in ' real-time , ' which will make it possible for them to immediately see how they can cut down , " vesper said . consumers will be able to see how much energy - and money - they save on a daily , monthly and annual basis when they turn off electrical appliances . one thing consumers wo n't be able to track , though : how much energy they 'll save when they switch off their computers . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" vulnerable people in many of the world 's poorest countries are increasingly exposed to natural disasters , conflict and economic pressures that can rapidly lead to situations whereby people go hungry , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said on tuesday , march 4 .

what do you say when your boss asks you that question . according to a new study by the institute for labor market and career research -lrb- iab -rrb- in nuremberg , many germans are either too chicken to say no , do n't have anything better to do instead , or truly are die-hard workaholics . sure , germans may be known for their diligence , but c 'mon : three billion hours is a really long time .
it 's the equivalent of 125,000,000 days , 17,857,142 weeks , or 342,466 years . things start looking even worse when you think that 1.5 billion of those hours were practically done on a volunteer basis . it sounds like a recipe for a strike -lrb- see this week 's news -rrb- .

it said it would cut deliveries by another 25 percent at 5:00 pm gmt tuesday . gazprom says europe wo n't feel the crunch " naftogaz can only guarantee uninterrupted transit -lsb- of gas -rsb- to european consumers as long as it does not threaten ukraine 's energy security , " said the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is planning a baltic sea pipeline to circumvent transit countries like ukraine european commission spokesman michele cercone said tuesday that gazprom had promised that gas supplies to the european union would not be affected . " the commission is concerned about the apparent reductions and urges both parties to go ahead in negotiations and quickly find a definitive solution to this commercial issue , " added cercone . some 80 percent of the eu 's gas orders from russia - a quarter of its total gas supply - flows through ukraine . resolution elusive in gas impasse the recent cuts are part of an ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine over gas prices and supply that began in early 2006 .
at that time , russia tightened the tap when ukraine refused to pay jacked up prices , which had a ripple effect on gas deliveries to europe and sparked concern over russia 's reliability as a supplier . gazprom has said kiev has some $ 600 million -lrb- 395 million euros -rrb- in outstanding debts and has accused it of taking more than it pays for by siphoning off extra gas to sell to western europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom was partially re-nationalized under putin ukraine , on the other hand , has said that gazprom has n't paid transit fees on gas passing through to the european market . energy clash splits ukraine ukrainian president viktor yushchenko on monday said that the conflict could escalate into a new " gas war " with moscow .
he had negotiated a new gas agreement with russian president vladimir putin last month , but the deal had not yet been signed . the conflict has split ukraine 's governing coalition , with yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko taking different positions .
according to reports , yushchenko 's deal with putin may have collapsed after tymoshenko 's recent visit to moscow . gazprom 's chairman of the board , dmitry medvedev was on sunday elected to succeed putin as president , but it is unclear whether he played a role in the most recent gas cuts . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's foreign minister welcomed the resolution as a " sign of the international community 's resolve . " in response to iran 's refusal to halt nuclear fuel work , the five permanent members of the un security council and eight of its nine non-permanent members voted monday ; march 3 , to tighten existing economic and trade sanctions .
indonesia abstained from the vote . " we want to work with iran as a member of the international community and support iran 's right to a peaceful nuclear program , " german ambassador to the united nations thomas matussek told reporters after the vote .

iran must suspend uranium enrichment . " the un 's atomic watchdog met to discuss the iranian nuclear dossier on tuesday . " iran would do well to listen to what the international community is asking it , " one western diplomat told the afp news agency ahead of the meeting on the condition of anonymity .

" we are once again witnessing the bitter reality that the security council 's position is belittled to an extent to serve as an instrument at the service of the foreign policy of a few countries , " said iran 's ambassador to the united nations mohammad khazaie . iran tops iaea agenda the resolution came a week after iaea chief mohammed elbaradei for the first time referenced evidence of nuclear weapons plans allegedly found by us secret service agents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 04.03.2008 germany 's revamped federal police take on terror fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police duties often overlap germany 's federal police have undergone a major restructuring in an attempt to make the organization better equipped in fighting terrorism .
but experts say policing efforts in germany will likely remain disjointed . as travel within the european union becomes increasingly borderless , german politicians decided it was time to rethink the role of the federal police to focus on internal issues such as terrorism and illegal immigration . the reforms included shutting numerous field offices across the country and centralizing management of the 40,000-strong force under the leadership of matthias seeger , who formerly headed one of the federal police regional offices .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble travelled to the new potsdam headquarters of the federal police on monday , march 3 , to welcome seeger to his new job . schaeuble promised that the streamlined force would free up personnel to focus on terrorism .
the law allowing the restructuring officially went into force on saturday . " we 're reducing bureaucracy this way , " said schaeuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . resisting reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal police are going beyond border patrol the federal police have been responsible for guarding germany 's border crossings and overseeing security in airports and train stations .
germany 's state governments can also call in the federal police if they need backup during riots or demonstrations , and the force has played a role in training police officers in places such as afghanistan . but germany still gives most of its responsibility for policing and internal security issues to its 16 federal states .
the regional governments traditionally resist police reform because they worry about losing their influence over domestic security issues , said michael bauer , a security expert at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . state police have a good overview of the local situation that someone sitting in berlin would n't necessarily have , bauer said .
yet there is general acknowledgement in the security field that certain issues , such as terrorism , need to be dealt with at a national level as terrorism suspects typically work in a network that crosses state and national boundaries . the federal police can " get the big picture " in a way that local jurisdictions often ca n't , bauer said . falling through the cracks immigration is n't a new area for the federal police either .

but experts say policing efforts in germany will likely remain disjointed . as travel within the european union becomes increasingly borderless , german politicians decided it was time to rethink the role of the federal police to focus on internal issues such as terrorism and illegal immigration . the reforms included shutting numerous field offices across the country and centralizing management of the 40,000-strong force under the leadership of matthias seeger , who formerly headed one of the federal police regional offices .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble travelled to the new potsdam headquarters of the federal police on monday , march 3 , to welcome seeger to his new job . schaeuble promised that the streamlined force would free up personnel to focus on terrorism .

germany 's state governments can also call in the federal police if they need backup during riots or demonstrations , and the force has played a role in training police officers in places such as afghanistan . but germany still gives most of its responsibility for policing and internal security issues to its 16 federal states .
the regional governments traditionally resist police reform because they worry about losing their influence over domestic security issues , said michael bauer , a security expert at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . state police have a good overview of the local situation that someone sitting in berlin would n't necessarily have , bauer said .
yet there is general acknowledgement in the security field that certain issues , such as terrorism , need to be dealt with at a national level as terrorism suspects typically work in a network that crosses state and national boundaries . the federal police can " get the big picture " in a way that local jurisdictions often ca n't , bauer said . falling through the cracks immigration is n't a new area for the federal police either .

but experts say policing efforts in germany will likely remain disjointed . as travel within the european union becomes increasingly borderless , german politicians decided it was time to rethink the role of the federal police to focus on internal issues such as terrorism and illegal immigration . the reforms included shutting numerous field offices across the country and centralizing management of the 40,000-strong force under the leadership of matthias seeger , who formerly headed one of the federal police regional offices .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble travelled to the new potsdam headquarters of the federal police on monday , march 3 , to welcome seeger to his new job . schaeuble promised that the streamlined force would free up personnel to focus on terrorism .
the law allowing the restructuring officially went into force on saturday . " we 're reducing bureaucracy this way , " said schaeuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . resisting reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal police are going beyond border patrol the federal police have been responsible for guarding germany 's border crossings and overseeing security in airports and train stations .
germany 's state governments can also call in the federal police if they need backup during riots or demonstrations , and the force has played a role in training police officers in places such as afghanistan . but germany still gives most of its responsibility for policing and internal security issues to its 16 federal states .
the regional governments traditionally resist police reform because they worry about losing their influence over domestic security issues , said michael bauer , a security expert at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . state police have a good overview of the local situation that someone sitting in berlin would n't necessarily have , bauer said .
yet there is general acknowledgement in the security field that certain issues , such as terrorism , need to be dealt with at a national level as terrorism suspects typically work in a network that crosses state and national boundaries . the federal police can " get the big picture " in a way that local jurisdictions often ca n't , bauer said . falling through the cracks immigration is n't a new area for the federal police either .
responsible for security at germany 's airports , the last german official many illegal immigrants see before being deported is a federal police officer . bernd mesovic , a spokesman for pro asyl , a campaign group for refugees which monitors deportations , said he was n't alarmed to hear that the federal police could become more involved in the issue . yet the biggest problem with the current system is that illegal immigrants often get passed from one police agency to the next in the process of being deported from germany .
that can lead to often important information about the immigrant 's health , for example , getting lost in the shuffle , he said . wary of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal police will keep responsibility for train station and airport security mesovic said a recent examination of deportations at frankfurt airport showed federal police have not engaged in human rights violations , however , a concern among the general public about giving too much power to a centralized police force remains . because of the horrors committed by the gestapo , the secret police during the nazi regime , the german public is highly sensitive about a powerful , centralized police force .
there has also been unease about increasing surveillance and secret online searches . germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- remains responsible for collecting and analyzing information on terrorism and other national security threats . the bnd is heavily involved in wiretapping and electronic surveillance .
the federal police -lrb- bundespolizei -rrb- are also different from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bundeskriminalamt -rrb- , which is the federal government 's investigative arm that functions similarly to the fbi in the united states . one thing most germans do n't understand is that it 's possible to keep the intelligence services ' work , such as that done by the bnd , separate from police work , said bauer of the center for applied policy research . " sometimes i think that in the public discussion this gets a bit mixed up , " bauer said . walking the walk only time will tell whether the personnel changes bring about a noticeable difference in how the federal police go about their jobs .
bauer said he doubts the restructuring will have a big impact as it 's not backed up by " sufficient resources to get the job done . " mesovic also said he doubts there will be a major shift of power to the federal police and away from the states . " it seems to me it 's a matter of reorganization , " mesovic said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're out of shape .
they drink and smoke too much .
their general fitness level is unacceptable . reinhold robbe 's 2008 report , which he presented to his employer , the german parliament , on tuesday , march 4 , said that more than 40 percent of the country 's soldiers were overweight and over 70 percent were regular smokers .
sports often played a minor role in the army , and the soldiers ' physical abilities were alarming , the ombudsman said .
the german army was suffering from the effects of a passive lifestyle . robbe would n't go so far as to say that the troops were too unfit to fight .
he did , however , point out that : " every athletic soldier who can react quickly has an advantage on the field . " as the bundeswehr 's agony aunt , robbe should know .
his job is to provide civilian oversight of the armed forces and ensure that the country 's soldiers are being treated appropriately .
the ombudsman receives up to 6,000 complaints from soldiers each year , which make up part of the report he submits annually to parliament .
he also regularly visits the troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports could play a greater role in a soldier 's career robbe said on tuesday that soldiers ' poor state of health was not all their fault .
instead , he said , the bundeswehr needed to take a different approach to fitness and health .
the introduction of rations designated as " optimized provisions " had led to less bread and fruit being available to soldiers .
it had n't been an improvement but a cost-cutting measure . he also lamented the amount of bureaucracy soldiers have to deal with on a daily basis and the bundeswehr 's continuing lack of funds .
keeping them honest based on a swedish model , the ombudsman 's office was created at the same time as the bundeswehr itself , in 1955 .
in the wake of the german army 's entanglement in the crimes of the nazis , the idea was to prevent abuse of power by having a politician , rather than a soldier , act as a liaison between parliament and the armed forces . parliament chooses the ombudsman , usually from its own ranks , for the five-year post .

they 're out of shape .
they drink and smoke too much .
their general fitness level is unacceptable . reinhold robbe 's 2008 report , which he presented to his employer , the german parliament , on tuesday , march 4 , said that more than 40 percent of the country 's soldiers were overweight and over 70 percent were regular smokers .
sports often played a minor role in the army , and the soldiers ' physical abilities were alarming , the ombudsman said .
the german army was suffering from the effects of a passive lifestyle . robbe would n't go so far as to say that the troops were too unfit to fight .
he did , however , point out that : " every athletic soldier who can react quickly has an advantage on the field . " as the bundeswehr 's agony aunt , robbe should know .
his job is to provide civilian oversight of the armed forces and ensure that the country 's soldiers are being treated appropriately .
the ombudsman receives up to 6,000 complaints from soldiers each year , which make up part of the report he submits annually to parliament .
he also regularly visits the troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports could play a greater role in a soldier 's career robbe said on tuesday that soldiers ' poor state of health was not all their fault .
instead , he said , the bundeswehr needed to take a different approach to fitness and health .
the introduction of rations designated as " optimized provisions " had led to less bread and fruit being available to soldiers .
it had n't been an improvement but a cost-cutting measure . he also lamented the amount of bureaucracy soldiers have to deal with on a daily basis and the bundeswehr 's continuing lack of funds .
keeping them honest based on a swedish model , the ombudsman 's office was created at the same time as the bundeswehr itself , in 1955 .
in the wake of the german army 's entanglement in the crimes of the nazis , the idea was to prevent abuse of power by having a politician , rather than a soldier , act as a liaison between parliament and the armed forces . parliament chooses the ombudsman , usually from its own ranks , for the five-year post .
the office holder is required to lay down his or her parliamentary mandate and work exclusively as the ombudsman . the current officeholder , reinhold robbe , was a conscientious objector as a young man in the 1970s .

" vulnerable people in many of the world 's poorest countries are increasingly exposed to natural disasters , conflict and economic pressures that can rapidly lead to situations whereby people go hungry , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said on tuesday , march 4 .

computer giant microsoft said computers could be activated to save electricity . german chancellor angela merkel attended the public opening of the six-day trade fair - billed as the world 's biggest show of computer software and digital gear . a total of 5,845 exhibitors from 77 countries are taking part in the 2008 trade show and paying special attention to the needs of large corporate and government buyers . merkel was joined by french president nicolas sarkozy , european commission president jose manuel barroso and microsoft head steve ballmer at the trade fair 's formal opening on monday . ballmer told reporters that computers could contribute to combating climate change by being activated to save electricity . computers going green ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat screens are nothing new , but they 're getting bigger and clearer at cebit ibm germany chief executive martin jetter , who is on the board of the german computing trade federation bitkom , said software and services could help most other business sectors cut their power use and their carbon footprint . environmentally friendly technology is one of the themes of the cebit , which runs from march 4-9 , heeding calls for future computers to waste less electricity . " if you exclude transportation and travel , pcs and information technology are probably the area with the fastest-growing consumption , " ballmer said . the world 's computer and telecommunications systems are estimated to cause about 2 percent of carbon dioxide emissions , industry leaders said at a briefing .
those emissions are about equal to the carbon emitted by the world 's aircraft engines . " there 's work that the software companies need to do to drive down power consumption , " he added .
" we believe we have both a responsibility and the innovations at our disposal which can help us concentrate on reducing consumption . " ballmer said computers were necessary as a tool for some of the scientific research that could fundamentally change the way that energy is generated and used . responding to criticism of the huge electricity demands from internet server " farms , " ballmer said microsoft would publish policies it had developed for power reduction in its data centers .
he added that , when idling , the new windows vista operating system uses 3 percent of the energy of the older xp system . raising awareness through computers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just a computer fair , cell phone technology is also present in hanover microsoft and the german energy provider yello strom have also entered a partnership to raise awareness among consumers .
the joint project is to enable customers to use software to monitor and control their energy consumption . the system is based on a new german law that allows electricity producers to install their own meters .
it was the beginning of an entirely new way of monitoring , said martin vesper , managing director of yello strom . " we said right away that other solutions must be found since the current meter systems are 40 to 50 years old , " he said .
" these old methods no longer correlate with the possibilities that now exist , which could help raise awareness among consumers and provide them with more transparency about energy efficiency . " the new technology vesper referred to consists of power meters that send consumption information to the electricity provider , who make the data available electronically to customers . " the system will enable consumers to be informed about the power they use in ' real-time , ' which will make it possible for them to immediately see how they can cut down , " vesper said . consumers will be able to see how much energy - and money - they save on a daily , monthly and annual basis when they turn off electrical appliances . one thing consumers wo n't be able to track , though : how much energy they 'll save when they switch off their computers . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 04.03.2008 germany 's revamped federal police take on terror fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police duties often overlap germany 's federal police have undergone a major restructuring in an attempt to make the organization better equipped in fighting terrorism .
but experts say policing efforts in germany will likely remain disjointed . as travel within the european union becomes increasingly borderless , german politicians decided it was time to rethink the role of the federal police to focus on internal issues such as terrorism and illegal immigration . the reforms included shutting numerous field offices across the country and centralizing management of the 40,000-strong force under the leadership of matthias seeger , who formerly headed one of the federal police regional offices .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble travelled to the new potsdam headquarters of the federal police on monday , march 3 , to welcome seeger to his new job . schaeuble promised that the streamlined force would free up personnel to focus on terrorism .
the law allowing the restructuring officially went into force on saturday . " we 're reducing bureaucracy this way , " said schaeuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . resisting reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal police are going beyond border patrol the federal police have been responsible for guarding germany 's border crossings and overseeing security in airports and train stations .
germany 's state governments can also call in the federal police if they need backup during riots or demonstrations , and the force has played a role in training police officers in places such as afghanistan . but germany still gives most of its responsibility for policing and internal security issues to its 16 federal states .
the regional governments traditionally resist police reform because they worry about losing their influence over domestic security issues , said michael bauer , a security expert at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . state police have a good overview of the local situation that someone sitting in berlin would n't necessarily have , bauer said .
yet there is general acknowledgement in the security field that certain issues , such as terrorism , need to be dealt with at a national level as terrorism suspects typically work in a network that crosses state and national boundaries . the federal police can " get the big picture " in a way that local jurisdictions often ca n't , bauer said . falling through the cracks immigration is n't a new area for the federal police either .

but experts say policing efforts in germany will likely remain disjointed . as travel within the european union becomes increasingly borderless , german politicians decided it was time to rethink the role of the federal police to focus on internal issues such as terrorism and illegal immigration . the reforms included shutting numerous field offices across the country and centralizing management of the 40,000-strong force under the leadership of matthias seeger , who formerly headed one of the federal police regional offices .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble travelled to the new potsdam headquarters of the federal police on monday , march 3 , to welcome seeger to his new job . schaeuble promised that the streamlined force would free up personnel to focus on terrorism .
the law allowing the restructuring officially went into force on saturday . " we 're reducing bureaucracy this way , " said schaeuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . resisting reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal police are going beyond border patrol the federal police have been responsible for guarding germany 's border crossings and overseeing security in airports and train stations .
germany 's state governments can also call in the federal police if they need backup during riots or demonstrations , and the force has played a role in training police officers in places such as afghanistan . but germany still gives most of its responsibility for policing and internal security issues to its 16 federal states .
the regional governments traditionally resist police reform because they worry about losing their influence over domestic security issues , said michael bauer , a security expert at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . state police have a good overview of the local situation that someone sitting in berlin would n't necessarily have , bauer said .
yet there is general acknowledgement in the security field that certain issues , such as terrorism , need to be dealt with at a national level as terrorism suspects typically work in a network that crosses state and national boundaries . the federal police can " get the big picture " in a way that local jurisdictions often ca n't , bauer said . falling through the cracks immigration is n't a new area for the federal police either .
responsible for security at germany 's airports , the last german official many illegal immigrants see before being deported is a federal police officer . bernd mesovic , a spokesman for pro asyl , a campaign group for refugees which monitors deportations , said he was n't alarmed to hear that the federal police could become more involved in the issue . yet the biggest problem with the current system is that illegal immigrants often get passed from one police agency to the next in the process of being deported from germany .

but experts say policing efforts in germany will likely remain disjointed . as travel within the european union becomes increasingly borderless , german politicians decided it was time to rethink the role of the federal police to focus on internal issues such as terrorism and illegal immigration . the reforms included shutting numerous field offices across the country and centralizing management of the 40,000-strong force under the leadership of matthias seeger , who formerly headed one of the federal police regional offices .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble travelled to the new potsdam headquarters of the federal police on monday , march 3 , to welcome seeger to his new job . schaeuble promised that the streamlined force would free up personnel to focus on terrorism .
the law allowing the restructuring officially went into force on saturday . " we 're reducing bureaucracy this way , " said schaeuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . resisting reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal police are going beyond border patrol the federal police have been responsible for guarding germany 's border crossings and overseeing security in airports and train stations .
germany 's state governments can also call in the federal police if they need backup during riots or demonstrations , and the force has played a role in training police officers in places such as afghanistan . but germany still gives most of its responsibility for policing and internal security issues to its 16 federal states .
the regional governments traditionally resist police reform because they worry about losing their influence over domestic security issues , said michael bauer , a security expert at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . state police have a good overview of the local situation that someone sitting in berlin would n't necessarily have , bauer said .
yet there is general acknowledgement in the security field that certain issues , such as terrorism , need to be dealt with at a national level as terrorism suspects typically work in a network that crosses state and national boundaries . the federal police can " get the big picture " in a way that local jurisdictions often ca n't , bauer said . falling through the cracks immigration is n't a new area for the federal police either .
responsible for security at germany 's airports , the last german official many illegal immigrants see before being deported is a federal police officer . bernd mesovic , a spokesman for pro asyl , a campaign group for refugees which monitors deportations , said he was n't alarmed to hear that the federal police could become more involved in the issue . yet the biggest problem with the current system is that illegal immigrants often get passed from one police agency to the next in the process of being deported from germany .
that can lead to often important information about the immigrant 's health , for example , getting lost in the shuffle , he said . wary of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal police will keep responsibility for train station and airport security mesovic said a recent examination of deportations at frankfurt airport showed federal police have not engaged in human rights violations , however , a concern among the general public about giving too much power to a centralized police force remains . because of the horrors committed by the gestapo , the secret police during the nazi regime , the german public is highly sensitive about a powerful , centralized police force .
there has also been unease about increasing surveillance and secret online searches . germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- remains responsible for collecting and analyzing information on terrorism and other national security threats . the bnd is heavily involved in wiretapping and electronic surveillance .
the federal police -lrb- bundespolizei -rrb- are also different from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bundeskriminalamt -rrb- , which is the federal government 's investigative arm that functions similarly to the fbi in the united states . one thing most germans do n't understand is that it 's possible to keep the intelligence services ' work , such as that done by the bnd , separate from police work , said bauer of the center for applied policy research . " sometimes i think that in the public discussion this gets a bit mixed up , " bauer said . walking the walk only time will tell whether the personnel changes bring about a noticeable difference in how the federal police go about their jobs .
bauer said he doubts the restructuring will have a big impact as it 's not backed up by " sufficient resources to get the job done . " mesovic also said he doubts there will be a major shift of power to the federal police and away from the states .

" vulnerable people in many of the world 's poorest countries are increasingly exposed to natural disasters , conflict and economic pressures that can rapidly lead to situations whereby people go hungry , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said on tuesday , march 4 . " the european union has an essential role in providing them with food aid , and in restoring food production , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : droughts can devastate harvests the united nations ' world food program is to manage the aid , which is to target 18.7 million of the world 's most vulnerable people living in countries or areas such as : sudan , chad , somalia , kenya , ethiopia , uganda , democratic republic of the congo , tanzania , burundi , the sahel countries of northern africa , liberia , zimbabwe , afghanistan , nepal , sri lanka , colombia and the palestinian territories . it is the largest funding decision of its kind by the commission 's aid department , michel said . more than just food in addition to food aid for populations in need following natural disasters , epidemics , or armed conflicts , the aid package is to also include more long-term support including seeds , tools and fertilizers . commission officials said the executive may allocate more funds later in the year , with the possibility of digging deeper into emergency reserves if necessary . " our concern is to avoid financial drought .
this may not be a tsunami or an earthquake but price inflation still generates humanitarian needs , " european commission aid spokesman john clancy told a news briefing . prices soared in 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , it 's either food aid or death the aid comes after a warning by the world food program that it will have to cut food donations to some poor nations if donors do not contribute more soon to help counteract soaring commodities prices . the commission noted that world wheat prices had shot up by 81 percent during the course of 2007 . such price rises are the result of a variety of factors , including bad harvests , higher oil prices and an increase in the production of crops used for the production of biofuels , which are viewed as a more environmentally-friendly alternative to gasoline . josette sheeran , executive director of the rome-based world food programme , appealed last week to members of the us congress and the bush administration to help meet a 329 euro -lrb- $ 500 million -rrb- shortfall for the fiscal year 2008 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" vulnerable people in many of the world 's poorest countries are increasingly exposed to natural disasters , conflict and economic pressures that can rapidly lead to situations whereby people go hungry , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said on tuesday , march 4 . " the european union has an essential role in providing them with food aid , and in restoring food production , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : droughts can devastate harvests the united nations ' world food program is to manage the aid , which is to target 18.7 million of the world 's most vulnerable people living in countries or areas such as : sudan , chad , somalia , kenya , ethiopia , uganda , democratic republic of the congo , tanzania , burundi , the sahel countries of northern africa , liberia , zimbabwe , afghanistan , nepal , sri lanka , colombia and the palestinian territories . it is the largest funding decision of its kind by the commission 's aid department , michel said . more than just food in addition to food aid for populations in need following natural disasters , epidemics , or armed conflicts , the aid package is to also include more long-term support including seeds , tools and fertilizers . commission officials said the executive may allocate more funds later in the year , with the possibility of digging deeper into emergency reserves if necessary . " our concern is to avoid financial drought .
this may not be a tsunami or an earthquake but price inflation still generates humanitarian needs , " european commission aid spokesman john clancy told a news briefing . prices soared in 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , it 's either food aid or death the aid comes after a warning by the world food program that it will have to cut food donations to some poor nations if donors do not contribute more soon to help counteract soaring commodities prices . the commission noted that world wheat prices had shot up by 81 percent during the course of 2007 . such price rises are the result of a variety of factors , including bad harvests , higher oil prices and an increase in the production of crops used for the production of biofuels , which are viewed as a more environmentally-friendly alternative to gasoline . josette sheeran , executive director of the rome-based world food programme , appealed last week to members of the us congress and the bush administration to help meet a 329 euro -lrb- $ 500 million -rrb- shortfall for the fiscal year 2008 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german worked an estimated three billion overtime hours last years , according to a new study , but were only compensated for half of them .
it 's no wonder they 're also the world champs in vacationing . " can you stay longer today ? "
what do you say when your boss asks you that question . according to a new study by the institute for labor market and career research -lrb- iab -rrb- in nuremberg , many germans are either too chicken to say no , do n't have anything better to do instead , or truly are die-hard workaholics . sure , germans may be known for their diligence , but c 'mon : three billion hours is a really long time .
it 's the equivalent of 125,000,000 days , 17,857,142 weeks , or 342,466 years . things start looking even worse when you think that 1.5 billion of those hours were practically done on a volunteer basis . it sounds like a recipe for a strike -lrb- see this week 's news -rrb- .
but - surprisingly - it 's not the public services or transportation sectors that are affected , rather the employees in retail shops , restaurants , banks and insurance companies and no one 's striking there . still , who 'd have thought that 1.5 billion hours of unpaid exploitation takes place in one of the world 's most expensive labor markets - and nobody 's complaining ! maybe it has something to do with those 30-some vacation days that most germans get every year . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're out of shape .
they drink and smoke too much .
their general fitness level is unacceptable . reinhold robbe 's 2008 report , which he presented to his employer , the german parliament , on tuesday , march 4 , said that more than 40 percent of the country 's soldiers were overweight and over 70 percent were regular smokers .
sports often played a minor role in the army , and the soldiers ' physical abilities were alarming , the ombudsman said .
the german army was suffering from the effects of a passive lifestyle . robbe would n't go so far as to say that the troops were too unfit to fight .
he did , however , point out that : " every athletic soldier who can react quickly has an advantage on the field . " as the bundeswehr 's agony aunt , robbe should know .
his job is to provide civilian oversight of the armed forces and ensure that the country 's soldiers are being treated appropriately .
the ombudsman receives up to 6,000 complaints from soldiers each year , which make up part of the report he submits annually to parliament .
he also regularly visits the troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports could play a greater role in a soldier 's career robbe said on tuesday that soldiers ' poor state of health was not all their fault .
instead , he said , the bundeswehr needed to take a different approach to fitness and health .
the introduction of rations designated as " optimized provisions " had led to less bread and fruit being available to soldiers .
it had n't been an improvement but a cost-cutting measure . he also lamented the amount of bureaucracy soldiers have to deal with on a daily basis and the bundeswehr 's continuing lack of funds .
keeping them honest based on a swedish model , the ombudsman 's office was created at the same time as the bundeswehr itself , in 1955 .
in the wake of the german army 's entanglement in the crimes of the nazis , the idea was to prevent abuse of power by having a politician , rather than a soldier , act as a liaison between parliament and the armed forces . parliament chooses the ombudsman , usually from its own ranks , for the five-year post .

they 're out of shape .
they drink and smoke too much .
their general fitness level is unacceptable . reinhold robbe 's 2008 report , which he presented to his employer , the german parliament , on tuesday , march 4 , said that more than 40 percent of the country 's soldiers were overweight and over 70 percent were regular smokers .
sports often played a minor role in the army , and the soldiers ' physical abilities were alarming , the ombudsman said .
the german army was suffering from the effects of a passive lifestyle . robbe would n't go so far as to say that the troops were too unfit to fight .
he did , however , point out that : " every athletic soldier who can react quickly has an advantage on the field . " as the bundeswehr 's agony aunt , robbe should know .
his job is to provide civilian oversight of the armed forces and ensure that the country 's soldiers are being treated appropriately .
the ombudsman receives up to 6,000 complaints from soldiers each year , which make up part of the report he submits annually to parliament .
he also regularly visits the troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports could play a greater role in a soldier 's career robbe said on tuesday that soldiers ' poor state of health was not all their fault .
instead , he said , the bundeswehr needed to take a different approach to fitness and health .
the introduction of rations designated as " optimized provisions " had led to less bread and fruit being available to soldiers .
it had n't been an improvement but a cost-cutting measure . he also lamented the amount of bureaucracy soldiers have to deal with on a daily basis and the bundeswehr 's continuing lack of funds .
keeping them honest based on a swedish model , the ombudsman 's office was created at the same time as the bundeswehr itself , in 1955 .
in the wake of the german army 's entanglement in the crimes of the nazis , the idea was to prevent abuse of power by having a politician , rather than a soldier , act as a liaison between parliament and the armed forces . parliament chooses the ombudsman , usually from its own ranks , for the five-year post .
the office holder is required to lay down his or her parliamentary mandate and work exclusively as the ombudsman . the current officeholder , reinhold robbe , was a conscientious objector as a young man in the 1970s .

" vulnerable people in many of the world 's poorest countries are increasingly exposed to natural disasters , conflict and economic pressures that can rapidly lead to situations whereby people go hungry , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said on tuesday , march 4 . " the european union has an essential role in providing them with food aid , and in restoring food production , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : droughts can devastate harvests the united nations ' world food program is to manage the aid , which is to target 18.7 million of the world 's most vulnerable people living in countries or areas such as : sudan , chad , somalia , kenya , ethiopia , uganda , democratic republic of the congo , tanzania , burundi , the sahel countries of northern africa , liberia , zimbabwe , afghanistan , nepal , sri lanka , colombia and the palestinian territories . it is the largest funding decision of its kind by the commission 's aid department , michel said . more than just food in addition to food aid for populations in need following natural disasters , epidemics , or armed conflicts , the aid package is to also include more long-term support including seeds , tools and fertilizers . commission officials said the executive may allocate more funds later in the year , with the possibility of digging deeper into emergency reserves if necessary . " our concern is to avoid financial drought .
this may not be a tsunami or an earthquake but price inflation still generates humanitarian needs , " european commission aid spokesman john clancy told a news briefing . prices soared in 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , it 's either food aid or death the aid comes after a warning by the world food program that it will have to cut food donations to some poor nations if donors do not contribute more soon to help counteract soaring commodities prices . the commission noted that world wheat prices had shot up by 81 percent during the course of 2007 . such price rises are the result of a variety of factors , including bad harvests , higher oil prices and an increase in the production of crops used for the production of biofuels , which are viewed as a more environmentally-friendly alternative to gasoline . josette sheeran , executive director of the rome-based world food programme , appealed last week to members of the us congress and the bush administration to help meet a 329 euro -lrb- $ 500 million -rrb- shortfall for the fiscal year 2008 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but experts say policing efforts in germany will likely remain disjointed . as travel within the european union becomes increasingly borderless , german politicians decided it was time to rethink the role of the federal police to focus on internal issues such as terrorism and illegal immigration . the reforms included shutting numerous field offices across the country and centralizing management of the 40,000-strong force under the leadership of matthias seeger , who formerly headed one of the federal police regional offices .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble travelled to the new potsdam headquarters of the federal police on monday , march 3 , to welcome seeger to his new job . schaeuble promised that the streamlined force would free up personnel to focus on terrorism .
the law allowing the restructuring officially went into force on saturday . " we 're reducing bureaucracy this way , " said schaeuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . resisting reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal police are going beyond border patrol the federal police have been responsible for guarding germany 's border crossings and overseeing security in airports and train stations .
germany 's state governments can also call in the federal police if they need backup during riots or demonstrations , and the force has played a role in training police officers in places such as afghanistan . but germany still gives most of its responsibility for policing and internal security issues to its 16 federal states .
the regional governments traditionally resist police reform because they worry about losing their influence over domestic security issues , said michael bauer , a security expert at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . state police have a good overview of the local situation that someone sitting in berlin would n't necessarily have , bauer said .
yet there is general acknowledgement in the security field that certain issues , such as terrorism , need to be dealt with at a national level as terrorism suspects typically work in a network that crosses state and national boundaries . the federal police can " get the big picture " in a way that local jurisdictions often ca n't , bauer said . falling through the cracks immigration is n't a new area for the federal police either .
responsible for security at germany 's airports , the last german official many illegal immigrants see before being deported is a federal police officer . bernd mesovic , a spokesman for pro asyl , a campaign group for refugees which monitors deportations , said he was n't alarmed to hear that the federal police could become more involved in the issue . yet the biggest problem with the current system is that illegal immigrants often get passed from one police agency to the next in the process of being deported from germany .
that can lead to often important information about the immigrant 's health , for example , getting lost in the shuffle , he said . wary of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal police will keep responsibility for train station and airport security mesovic said a recent examination of deportations at frankfurt airport showed federal police have not engaged in human rights violations , however , a concern among the general public about giving too much power to a centralized police force remains . because of the horrors committed by the gestapo , the secret police during the nazi regime , the german public is highly sensitive about a powerful , centralized police force .
there has also been unease about increasing surveillance and secret online searches . germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- remains responsible for collecting and analyzing information on terrorism and other national security threats . the bnd is heavily involved in wiretapping and electronic surveillance .
the federal police -lrb- bundespolizei -rrb- are also different from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bundeskriminalamt -rrb- , which is the federal government 's investigative arm that functions similarly to the fbi in the united states . one thing most germans do n't understand is that it 's possible to keep the intelligence services ' work , such as that done by the bnd , separate from police work , said bauer of the center for applied policy research . " sometimes i think that in the public discussion this gets a bit mixed up , " bauer said . walking the walk only time will tell whether the personnel changes bring about a noticeable difference in how the federal police go about their jobs .
bauer said he doubts the restructuring will have a big impact as it 's not backed up by " sufficient resources to get the job done .

western europe buys most of its gas from russia and it has to pass through ukrainian pipelines to get there . ukraine may cut gas deliveries to western europe if russia 's gas giant gazprom continues to tighten the tap on supplies to ukraine , state gas company naftogaz said tuesday , march 4 , in a statement . gazprom on monday reduced ukraine 's gas supply by 25 percent , bringing the total supply to half its normal level .
it said it would cut deliveries by another 25 percent at 5:00 pm gmt tuesday . gazprom says europe wo n't feel the crunch " naftogaz can only guarantee uninterrupted transit -lsb- of gas -rsb- to european consumers as long as it does not threaten ukraine 's energy security , " said the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is planning a baltic sea pipeline to circumvent transit countries like ukraine european commission spokesman michele cercone said tuesday that gazprom had promised that gas supplies to the european union would not be affected . " the commission is concerned about the apparent reductions and urges both parties to go ahead in negotiations and quickly find a definitive solution to this commercial issue , " added cercone . some 80 percent of the eu 's gas orders from russia - a quarter of its total gas supply - flows through ukraine . resolution elusive in gas impasse the recent cuts are part of an ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine over gas prices and supply that began in early 2006 .
at that time , russia tightened the tap when ukraine refused to pay jacked up prices , which had a ripple effect on gas deliveries to europe and sparked concern over russia 's reliability as a supplier . gazprom has said kiev has some $ 600 million -lrb- 395 million euros -rrb- in outstanding debts and has accused it of taking more than it pays for by siphoning off extra gas to sell to western europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom was partially re-nationalized under putin ukraine , on the other hand , has said that gazprom has n't paid transit fees on gas passing through to the european market . energy clash splits ukraine ukrainian president viktor yushchenko on monday said that the conflict could escalate into a new " gas war " with moscow .
he had negotiated a new gas agreement with russian president vladimir putin last month , but the deal had not yet been signed . the conflict has split ukraine 's governing coalition , with yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko taking different positions .
according to reports , yushchenko 's deal with putin may have collapsed after tymoshenko 's recent visit to moscow . gazprom 's chairman of the board , dmitry medvedev was on sunday elected to succeed putin as president , but it is unclear whether he played a role in the most recent gas cuts . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

western europe buys most of its gas from russia and it has to pass through ukrainian pipelines to get there . ukraine may cut gas deliveries to western europe if russia 's gas giant gazprom continues to tighten the tap on supplies to ukraine , state gas company naftogaz said tuesday , march 4 , in a statement . gazprom on monday reduced ukraine 's gas supply by 25 percent , bringing the total supply to half its normal level .
it said it would cut deliveries by another 25 percent at 5:00 pm gmt tuesday . gazprom says europe wo n't feel the crunch " naftogaz can only guarantee uninterrupted transit -lsb- of gas -rsb- to european consumers as long as it does not threaten ukraine 's energy security , " said the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is planning a baltic sea pipeline to circumvent transit countries like ukraine european commission spokesman michele cercone said tuesday that gazprom had promised that gas supplies to the european union would not be affected . " the commission is concerned about the apparent reductions and urges both parties to go ahead in negotiations and quickly find a definitive solution to this commercial issue , " added cercone . some 80 percent of the eu 's gas orders from russia - a quarter of its total gas supply - flows through ukraine . resolution elusive in gas impasse the recent cuts are part of an ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine over gas prices and supply that began in early 2006 .
at that time , russia tightened the tap when ukraine refused to pay jacked up prices , which had a ripple effect on gas deliveries to europe and sparked concern over russia 's reliability as a supplier . gazprom has said kiev has some $ 600 million -lrb- 395 million euros -rrb- in outstanding debts and has accused it of taking more than it pays for by siphoning off extra gas to sell to western europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom was partially re-nationalized under putin ukraine , on the other hand , has said that gazprom has n't paid transit fees on gas passing through to the european market . energy clash splits ukraine ukrainian president viktor yushchenko on monday said that the conflict could escalate into a new " gas war " with moscow .
he had negotiated a new gas agreement with russian president vladimir putin last month , but the deal had not yet been signed . the conflict has split ukraine 's governing coalition , with yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko taking different positions .
according to reports , yushchenko 's deal with putin may have collapsed after tymoshenko 's recent visit to moscow . gazprom 's chairman of the board , dmitry medvedev was on sunday elected to succeed putin as president , but it is unclear whether he played a role in the most recent gas cuts . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're out of shape .
they drink and smoke too much .
their general fitness level is unacceptable . reinhold robbe 's 2008 report , which he presented to his employer , the german parliament , on tuesday , march 4 , said that more than 40 percent of the country 's soldiers were overweight and over 70 percent were regular smokers .
sports often played a minor role in the army , and the soldiers ' physical abilities were alarming , the ombudsman said .
the german army was suffering from the effects of a passive lifestyle . robbe would n't go so far as to say that the troops were too unfit to fight .
he did , however , point out that : " every athletic soldier who can react quickly has an advantage on the field . " as the bundeswehr 's agony aunt , robbe should know .
his job is to provide civilian oversight of the armed forces and ensure that the country 's soldiers are being treated appropriately .
the ombudsman receives up to 6,000 complaints from soldiers each year , which make up part of the report he submits annually to parliament .
he also regularly visits the troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports could play a greater role in a soldier 's career robbe said on tuesday that soldiers ' poor state of health was not all their fault .
instead , he said , the bundeswehr needed to take a different approach to fitness and health .
the introduction of rations designated as " optimized provisions " had led to less bread and fruit being available to soldiers .
it had n't been an improvement but a cost-cutting measure . he also lamented the amount of bureaucracy soldiers have to deal with on a daily basis and the bundeswehr 's continuing lack of funds .
keeping them honest based on a swedish model , the ombudsman 's office was created at the same time as the bundeswehr itself , in 1955 .
in the wake of the german army 's entanglement in the crimes of the nazis , the idea was to prevent abuse of power by having a politician , rather than a soldier , act as a liaison between parliament and the armed forces . parliament chooses the ombudsman , usually from its own ranks , for the five-year post .
the office holder is required to lay down his or her parliamentary mandate and work exclusively as the ombudsman . the current officeholder , reinhold robbe , was a conscientious objector as a young man in the 1970s .
the social democrat is a defense policy specialist and a fervent believer in the need for mandatory military conscription . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but its member states disagree on how . berlin is spearheading efforts to cut off tax havens as investigations continue into large-scale tax evasion on the part of hundreds of wealthy germans .

" bank secrecy is not on the table , " austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer stressed after the meeting . austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer said his country would veto the attempt to water down bank secrecy regulations unless " other european countries , " followed suit .
he was referring to switzerland , liechtenstein , andorra , san marino and monaco , all of which profit from strict bank secrecy laws . eu members austria , belgium and luxembourg had opted out of the 2005 legislation which allows foreign bank account holders to remain anonymous .

but experts say policing efforts in germany will likely remain disjointed . as travel within the european union becomes increasingly borderless , german politicians decided it was time to rethink the role of the federal police to focus on internal issues such as terrorism and illegal immigration . the reforms included shutting numerous field offices across the country and centralizing management of the 40,000-strong force under the leadership of matthias seeger , who formerly headed one of the federal police regional offices .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble travelled to the new potsdam headquarters of the federal police on monday , march 3 , to welcome seeger to his new job . schaeuble promised that the streamlined force would free up personnel to focus on terrorism .
the law allowing the restructuring officially went into force on saturday . " we 're reducing bureaucracy this way , " said schaeuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . resisting reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal police are going beyond border patrol the federal police have been responsible for guarding germany 's border crossings and overseeing security in airports and train stations .
germany 's state governments can also call in the federal police if they need backup during riots or demonstrations , and the force has played a role in training police officers in places such as afghanistan . but germany still gives most of its responsibility for policing and internal security issues to its 16 federal states .
the regional governments traditionally resist police reform because they worry about losing their influence over domestic security issues , said michael bauer , a security expert at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . state police have a good overview of the local situation that someone sitting in berlin would n't necessarily have , bauer said .
yet there is general acknowledgement in the security field that certain issues , such as terrorism , need to be dealt with at a national level as terrorism suspects typically work in a network that crosses state and national boundaries . the federal police can " get the big picture " in a way that local jurisdictions often ca n't , bauer said . falling through the cracks immigration is n't a new area for the federal police either .
responsible for security at germany 's airports , the last german official many illegal immigrants see before being deported is a federal police officer . bernd mesovic , a spokesman for pro asyl , a campaign group for refugees which monitors deportations , said he was n't alarmed to hear that the federal police could become more involved in the issue . yet the biggest problem with the current system is that illegal immigrants often get passed from one police agency to the next in the process of being deported from germany .
that can lead to often important information about the immigrant 's health , for example , getting lost in the shuffle , he said . wary of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal police will keep responsibility for train station and airport security mesovic said a recent examination of deportations at frankfurt airport showed federal police have not engaged in human rights violations , however , a concern among the general public about giving too much power to a centralized police force remains . because of the horrors committed by the gestapo , the secret police during the nazi regime , the german public is highly sensitive about a powerful , centralized police force .
there has also been unease about increasing surveillance and secret online searches . germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- remains responsible for collecting and analyzing information on terrorism and other national security threats . the bnd is heavily involved in wiretapping and electronic surveillance .
the federal police -lrb- bundespolizei -rrb- are also different from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bundeskriminalamt -rrb- , which is the federal government 's investigative arm that functions similarly to the fbi in the united states . one thing most germans do n't understand is that it 's possible to keep the intelligence services ' work , such as that done by the bnd , separate from police work , said bauer of the center for applied policy research . " sometimes i think that in the public discussion this gets a bit mixed up , " bauer said . walking the walk only time will tell whether the personnel changes bring about a noticeable difference in how the federal police go about their jobs .
bauer said he doubts the restructuring will have a big impact as it 's not backed up by " sufficient resources to get the job done . " mesovic also said he doubts there will be a major shift of power to the federal police and away from the states . " it seems to me it 's a matter of reorganization , " mesovic said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

computer giant microsoft said computers could be activated to save electricity . german chancellor angela merkel attended the public opening of the six-day trade fair - billed as the world 's biggest show of computer software and digital gear . a total of 5,845 exhibitors from 77 countries are taking part in the 2008 trade show and paying special attention to the needs of large corporate and government buyers . merkel was joined by french president nicolas sarkozy , european commission president jose manuel barroso and microsoft head steve ballmer at the trade fair 's formal opening on monday . ballmer told reporters that computers could contribute to combating climate change by being activated to save electricity . computers going green ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat screens are nothing new , but they 're getting bigger and clearer at cebit ibm germany chief executive martin jetter , who is on the board of the german computing trade federation bitkom , said software and services could help most other business sectors cut their power use and their carbon footprint . environmentally friendly technology is one of the themes of the cebit , which runs from march 4-9 , heeding calls for future computers to waste less electricity . " if you exclude transportation and travel , pcs and information technology are probably the area with the fastest-growing consumption , " ballmer said . the world 's computer and telecommunications systems are estimated to cause about 2 percent of carbon dioxide emissions , industry leaders said at a briefing .
those emissions are about equal to the carbon emitted by the world 's aircraft engines . " there 's work that the software companies need to do to drive down power consumption , " he added .
" we believe we have both a responsibility and the innovations at our disposal which can help us concentrate on reducing consumption . " ballmer said computers were necessary as a tool for some of the scientific research that could fundamentally change the way that energy is generated and used . responding to criticism of the huge electricity demands from internet server " farms , " ballmer said microsoft would publish policies it had developed for power reduction in its data centers .
he added that , when idling , the new windows vista operating system uses 3 percent of the energy of the older xp system . raising awareness through computers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just a computer fair , cell phone technology is also present in hanover microsoft and the german energy provider yello strom have also entered a partnership to raise awareness among consumers .
the joint project is to enable customers to use software to monitor and control their energy consumption . the system is based on a new german law that allows electricity producers to install their own meters .
it was the beginning of an entirely new way of monitoring , said martin vesper , managing director of yello strom . " we said right away that other solutions must be found since the current meter systems are 40 to 50 years old , " he said .
" these old methods no longer correlate with the possibilities that now exist , which could help raise awareness among consumers and provide them with more transparency about energy efficiency . " the new technology vesper referred to consists of power meters that send consumption information to the electricity provider , who make the data available electronically to customers . " the system will enable consumers to be informed about the power they use in ' real-time , ' which will make it possible for them to immediately see how they can cut down , " vesper said . consumers will be able to see how much energy - and money - they save on a daily , monthly and annual basis when they turn off electrical appliances . one thing consumers wo n't be able to track , though : how much energy they 'll save when they switch off their computers . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but experts say policing efforts in germany will likely remain disjointed . as travel within the european union becomes increasingly borderless , german politicians decided it was time to rethink the role of the federal police to focus on internal issues such as terrorism and illegal immigration . the reforms included shutting numerous field offices across the country and centralizing management of the 40,000-strong force under the leadership of matthias seeger , who formerly headed one of the federal police regional offices .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble travelled to the new potsdam headquarters of the federal police on monday , march 3 , to welcome seeger to his new job . schaeuble promised that the streamlined force would free up personnel to focus on terrorism .
the law allowing the restructuring officially went into force on saturday . " we 're reducing bureaucracy this way , " said schaeuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . resisting reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal police are going beyond border patrol the federal police have been responsible for guarding germany 's border crossings and overseeing security in airports and train stations .
germany 's state governments can also call in the federal police if they need backup during riots or demonstrations , and the force has played a role in training police officers in places such as afghanistan . but germany still gives most of its responsibility for policing and internal security issues to its 16 federal states .
the regional governments traditionally resist police reform because they worry about losing their influence over domestic security issues , said michael bauer , a security expert at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . state police have a good overview of the local situation that someone sitting in berlin would n't necessarily have , bauer said .

but its member states disagree on how . berlin is spearheading efforts to cut off tax havens as investigations continue into large-scale tax evasion on the part of hundreds of wealthy germans .
but it found its quest blocked by vienna at a meeting of eu finance minister in brussels on tuesday , march 4 . germany wants to expand eu legislation to force all member states to share information about foreigners who have accrued income in interest on bank accounts . " bank secrecy is not on the table , " austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer stressed after the meeting . austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer said his country would veto the attempt to water down bank secrecy regulations unless " other european countries , " followed suit .

computer giant microsoft said computers could be activated to save electricity . german chancellor angela merkel attended the public opening of the six-day trade fair - billed as the world 's biggest show of computer software and digital gear . a total of 5,845 exhibitors from 77 countries are taking part in the 2008 trade show and paying special attention to the needs of large corporate and government buyers . merkel was joined by french president nicolas sarkozy , european commission president jose manuel barroso and microsoft head steve ballmer at the trade fair 's formal opening on monday . ballmer told reporters that computers could contribute to combating climate change by being activated to save electricity . computers going green ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat screens are nothing new , but they 're getting bigger and clearer at cebit ibm germany chief executive martin jetter , who is on the board of the german computing trade federation bitkom , said software and services could help most other business sectors cut their power use and their carbon footprint . environmentally friendly technology is one of the themes of the cebit , which runs from march 4-9 , heeding calls for future computers to waste less electricity . " if you exclude transportation and travel , pcs and information technology are probably the area with the fastest-growing consumption , " ballmer said . the world 's computer and telecommunications systems are estimated to cause about 2 percent of carbon dioxide emissions , industry leaders said at a briefing .
those emissions are about equal to the carbon emitted by the world 's aircraft engines . " there 's work that the software companies need to do to drive down power consumption , " he added .
" we believe we have both a responsibility and the innovations at our disposal which can help us concentrate on reducing consumption . " ballmer said computers were necessary as a tool for some of the scientific research that could fundamentally change the way that energy is generated and used . responding to criticism of the huge electricity demands from internet server " farms , " ballmer said microsoft would publish policies it had developed for power reduction in its data centers .
he added that , when idling , the new windows vista operating system uses 3 percent of the energy of the older xp system . raising awareness through computers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just a computer fair , cell phone technology is also present in hanover microsoft and the german energy provider yello strom have also entered a partnership to raise awareness among consumers .
the joint project is to enable customers to use software to monitor and control their energy consumption . the system is based on a new german law that allows electricity producers to install their own meters .
it was the beginning of an entirely new way of monitoring , said martin vesper , managing director of yello strom . " we said right away that other solutions must be found since the current meter systems are 40 to 50 years old , " he said .
" these old methods no longer correlate with the possibilities that now exist , which could help raise awareness among consumers and provide them with more transparency about energy efficiency . " the new technology vesper referred to consists of power meters that send consumption information to the electricity provider , who make the data available electronically to customers . " the system will enable consumers to be informed about the power they use in ' real-time , ' which will make it possible for them to immediately see how they can cut down , " vesper said . consumers will be able to see how much energy - and money - they save on a daily , monthly and annual basis when they turn off electrical appliances . one thing consumers wo n't be able to track , though : how much energy they 'll save when they switch off their computers . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

western europe buys most of its gas from russia and it has to pass through ukrainian pipelines to get there . ukraine may cut gas deliveries to western europe if russia 's gas giant gazprom continues to tighten the tap on supplies to ukraine , state gas company naftogaz said tuesday , march 4 , in a statement . gazprom on monday reduced ukraine 's gas supply by 25 percent , bringing the total supply to half its normal level .
it said it would cut deliveries by another 25 percent at 5:00 pm gmt tuesday . gazprom says europe wo n't feel the crunch " naftogaz can only guarantee uninterrupted transit -lsb- of gas -rsb- to european consumers as long as it does not threaten ukraine 's energy security , " said the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is planning a baltic sea pipeline to circumvent transit countries like ukraine european commission spokesman michele cercone said tuesday that gazprom had promised that gas supplies to the european union would not be affected . " the commission is concerned about the apparent reductions and urges both parties to go ahead in negotiations and quickly find a definitive solution to this commercial issue , " added cercone . some 80 percent of the eu 's gas orders from russia - a quarter of its total gas supply - flows through ukraine . resolution elusive in gas impasse the recent cuts are part of an ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine over gas prices and supply that began in early 2006 .
at that time , russia tightened the tap when ukraine refused to pay jacked up prices , which had a ripple effect on gas deliveries to europe and sparked concern over russia 's reliability as a supplier . gazprom has said kiev has some $ 600 million -lrb- 395 million euros -rrb- in outstanding debts and has accused it of taking more than it pays for by siphoning off extra gas to sell to western europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom was partially re-nationalized under putin ukraine , on the other hand , has said that gazprom has n't paid transit fees on gas passing through to the european market . energy clash splits ukraine ukrainian president viktor yushchenko on monday said that the conflict could escalate into a new " gas war " with moscow .
he had negotiated a new gas agreement with russian president vladimir putin last month , but the deal had not yet been signed . the conflict has split ukraine 's governing coalition , with yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko taking different positions .
according to reports , yushchenko 's deal with putin may have collapsed after tymoshenko 's recent visit to moscow . gazprom 's chairman of the board , dmitry medvedev was on sunday elected to succeed putin as president , but it is unclear whether he played a role in the most recent gas cuts . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 04.03.2008 germany 's revamped federal police take on terror fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police duties often overlap germany 's federal police have undergone a major restructuring in an attempt to make the organization better equipped in fighting terrorism .
but experts say policing efforts in germany will likely remain disjointed . as travel within the european union becomes increasingly borderless , german politicians decided it was time to rethink the role of the federal police to focus on internal issues such as terrorism and illegal immigration . the reforms included shutting numerous field offices across the country and centralizing management of the 40,000-strong force under the leadership of matthias seeger , who formerly headed one of the federal police regional offices .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble travelled to the new potsdam headquarters of the federal police on monday , march 3 , to welcome seeger to his new job . schaeuble promised that the streamlined force would free up personnel to focus on terrorism .
the law allowing the restructuring officially went into force on saturday . " we 're reducing bureaucracy this way , " said schaeuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . resisting reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal police are going beyond border patrol the federal police have been responsible for guarding germany 's border crossings and overseeing security in airports and train stations .
germany 's state governments can also call in the federal police if they need backup during riots or demonstrations , and the force has played a role in training police officers in places such as afghanistan . but germany still gives most of its responsibility for policing and internal security issues to its 16 federal states .
the regional governments traditionally resist police reform because they worry about losing their influence over domestic security issues , said michael bauer , a security expert at the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . state police have a good overview of the local situation that someone sitting in berlin would n't necessarily have , bauer said .
yet there is general acknowledgement in the security field that certain issues , such as terrorism , need to be dealt with at a national level as terrorism suspects typically work in a network that crosses state and national boundaries . the federal police can " get the big picture " in a way that local jurisdictions often ca n't , bauer said . falling through the cracks immigration is n't a new area for the federal police either .
responsible for security at germany 's airports , the last german official many illegal immigrants see before being deported is a federal police officer . bernd mesovic , a spokesman for pro asyl , a campaign group for refugees which monitors deportations , said he was n't alarmed to hear that the federal police could become more involved in the issue . yet the biggest problem with the current system is that illegal immigrants often get passed from one police agency to the next in the process of being deported from germany .
that can lead to often important information about the immigrant 's health , for example , getting lost in the shuffle , he said . wary of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal police will keep responsibility for train station and airport security mesovic said a recent examination of deportations at frankfurt airport showed federal police have not engaged in human rights violations , however , a concern among the general public about giving too much power to a centralized police force remains . because of the horrors committed by the gestapo , the secret police during the nazi regime , the german public is highly sensitive about a powerful , centralized police force .
there has also been unease about increasing surveillance and secret online searches . germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- remains responsible for collecting and analyzing information on terrorism and other national security threats . the bnd is heavily involved in wiretapping and electronic surveillance .
the federal police -lrb- bundespolizei -rrb- are also different from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bundeskriminalamt -rrb- , which is the federal government 's investigative arm that functions similarly to the fbi in the united states . one thing most germans do n't understand is that it 's possible to keep the intelligence services ' work , such as that done by the bnd , separate from police work , said bauer of the center for applied policy research . " sometimes i think that in the public discussion this gets a bit mixed up , " bauer said . walking the walk only time will tell whether the personnel changes bring about a noticeable difference in how the federal police go about their jobs .
bauer said he doubts the restructuring will have a big impact as it 's not backed up by " sufficient resources to get the job done . " mesovic also said he doubts there will be a major shift of power to the federal police and away from the states . " it seems to me it 's a matter of reorganization , " mesovic said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's foreign minister welcomed the resolution as a " sign of the international community 's resolve . " in response to iran 's refusal to halt nuclear fuel work , the five permanent members of the un security council and eight of its nine non-permanent members voted monday ; march 3 , to tighten existing economic and trade sanctions .
indonesia abstained from the vote . " we want to work with iran as a member of the international community and support iran 's right to a peaceful nuclear program , " german ambassador to the united nations thomas matussek told reporters after the vote .
" but we must show that we have serious intentions and while we are negotiating , it 's impossible if one of the partners moves the goal posts .
iran must suspend uranium enrichment . " the un 's atomic watchdog met to discuss the iranian nuclear dossier on tuesday . " iran would do well to listen to what the international community is asking it , " one western diplomat told the afp news agency ahead of the meeting on the condition of anonymity .

" we are once again witnessing the bitter reality that the security council 's position is belittled to an extent to serve as an instrument at the service of the foreign policy of a few countries , " said iran 's ambassador to the united nations mohammad khazaie . iran tops iaea agenda the resolution came a week after iaea chief mohammed elbaradei for the first time referenced evidence of nuclear weapons plans allegedly found by us secret service agents .
the iaea board of governors is expected to approve an additional resolution against iran later this week . previous sanctions have failed to keep iran from developing its uranium enrichment program , which the west suspects is being used to create nuclear weapons .

" if you exclude transportation and travel , pcs and information technology are probably the area with the fastest-growing consumption , " ballmer said . the world 's computer and telecommunications systems are estimated to cause about 2 percent of carbon dioxide emissions , industry leaders said at a briefing .
those emissions are about equal to the carbon emitted by the world 's aircraft engines . " there 's work that the software companies need to do to drive down power consumption , " he added .
" we believe we have both a responsibility and the innovations at our disposal which can help us concentrate on reducing consumption . " ballmer said computers were necessary as a tool for some of the scientific research that could fundamentally change the way that energy is generated and used . responding to criticism of the huge electricity demands from internet server " farms , " ballmer said microsoft would publish policies it had developed for power reduction in its data centers .
he added that , when idling , the new windows vista operating system uses 3 percent of the energy of the older xp system . raising awareness through computers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just a computer fair , cell phone technology is also present in hanover microsoft and the german energy provider yello strom have also entered a partnership to raise awareness among consumers .
the joint project is to enable customers to use software to monitor and control their energy consumption . the system is based on a new german law that allows electricity producers to install their own meters .
it was the beginning of an entirely new way of monitoring , said martin vesper , managing director of yello strom . " we said right away that other solutions must be found since the current meter systems are 40 to 50 years old , " he said .
" these old methods no longer correlate with the possibilities that now exist , which could help raise awareness among consumers and provide them with more transparency about energy efficiency . " the new technology vesper referred to consists of power meters that send consumption information to the electricity provider , who make the data available electronically to customers . " the system will enable consumers to be informed about the power they use in ' real-time , ' which will make it possible for them to immediately see how they can cut down , " vesper said . consumers will be able to see how much energy - and money - they save on a daily , monthly and annual basis when they turn off electrical appliances . one thing consumers wo n't be able to track , though : how much energy they 'll save when they switch off their computers . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what do you say when your boss asks you that question . according to a new study by the institute for labor market and career research -lrb- iab -rrb- in nuremberg , many germans are either too chicken to say no , do n't have anything better to do instead , or truly are die-hard workaholics . sure , germans may be known for their diligence , but c 'mon : three billion hours is a really long time .

computer giant microsoft said computers could be activated to save electricity . german chancellor angela merkel attended the public opening of the six-day trade fair - billed as the world 's biggest show of computer software and digital gear . a total of 5,845 exhibitors from 77 countries are taking part in the 2008 trade show and paying special attention to the needs of large corporate and government buyers . merkel was joined by french president nicolas sarkozy , european commission president jose manuel barroso and microsoft head steve ballmer at the trade fair 's formal opening on monday . ballmer told reporters that computers could contribute to combating climate change by being activated to save electricity . computers going green ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat screens are nothing new , but they 're getting bigger and clearer at cebit ibm germany chief executive martin jetter , who is on the board of the german computing trade federation bitkom , said software and services could help most other business sectors cut their power use and their carbon footprint . environmentally friendly technology is one of the themes of the cebit , which runs from march 4-9 , heeding calls for future computers to waste less electricity . " if you exclude transportation and travel , pcs and information technology are probably the area with the fastest-growing consumption , " ballmer said . the world 's computer and telecommunications systems are estimated to cause about 2 percent of carbon dioxide emissions , industry leaders said at a briefing .
those emissions are about equal to the carbon emitted by the world 's aircraft engines . " there 's work that the software companies need to do to drive down power consumption , " he added .
" we believe we have both a responsibility and the innovations at our disposal which can help us concentrate on reducing consumption . " ballmer said computers were necessary as a tool for some of the scientific research that could fundamentally change the way that energy is generated and used . responding to criticism of the huge electricity demands from internet server " farms , " ballmer said microsoft would publish policies it had developed for power reduction in its data centers .
he added that , when idling , the new windows vista operating system uses 3 percent of the energy of the older xp system . raising awareness through computers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just a computer fair , cell phone technology is also present in hanover microsoft and the german energy provider yello strom have also entered a partnership to raise awareness among consumers .
the joint project is to enable customers to use software to monitor and control their energy consumption . the system is based on a new german law that allows electricity producers to install their own meters .
it was the beginning of an entirely new way of monitoring , said martin vesper , managing director of yello strom . " we said right away that other solutions must be found since the current meter systems are 40 to 50 years old , " he said .
" these old methods no longer correlate with the possibilities that now exist , which could help raise awareness among consumers and provide them with more transparency about energy efficiency . " the new technology vesper referred to consists of power meters that send consumption information to the electricity provider , who make the data available electronically to customers . " the system will enable consumers to be informed about the power they use in ' real-time , ' which will make it possible for them to immediately see how they can cut down , " vesper said . consumers will be able to see how much energy - and money - they save on a daily , monthly and annual basis when they turn off electrical appliances . one thing consumers wo n't be able to track , though : how much energy they 'll save when they switch off their computers . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're out of shape .
they drink and smoke too much .
their general fitness level is unacceptable . reinhold robbe 's 2008 report , which he presented to his employer , the german parliament , on tuesday , march 4 , said that more than 40 percent of the country 's soldiers were overweight and over 70 percent were regular smokers .
sports often played a minor role in the army , and the soldiers ' physical abilities were alarming , the ombudsman said .
the german army was suffering from the effects of a passive lifestyle . robbe would n't go so far as to say that the troops were too unfit to fight .
he did , however , point out that : " every athletic soldier who can react quickly has an advantage on the field . " as the bundeswehr 's agony aunt , robbe should know .
his job is to provide civilian oversight of the armed forces and ensure that the country 's soldiers are being treated appropriately .
the ombudsman receives up to 6,000 complaints from soldiers each year , which make up part of the report he submits annually to parliament .
he also regularly visits the troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports could play a greater role in a soldier 's career robbe said on tuesday that soldiers ' poor state of health was not all their fault .
instead , he said , the bundeswehr needed to take a different approach to fitness and health .
the introduction of rations designated as " optimized provisions " had led to less bread and fruit being available to soldiers .
it had n't been an improvement but a cost-cutting measure . he also lamented the amount of bureaucracy soldiers have to deal with on a daily basis and the bundeswehr 's continuing lack of funds .
keeping them honest based on a swedish model , the ombudsman 's office was created at the same time as the bundeswehr itself , in 1955 .
in the wake of the german army 's entanglement in the crimes of the nazis , the idea was to prevent abuse of power by having a politician , rather than a soldier , act as a liaison between parliament and the armed forces . parliament chooses the ombudsman , usually from its own ranks , for the five-year post .
the office holder is required to lay down his or her parliamentary mandate and work exclusively as the ombudsman . the current officeholder , reinhold robbe , was a conscientious objector as a young man in the 1970s .
the social democrat is a defense policy specialist and a fervent believer in the need for mandatory military conscription . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the welsh assembly government is proposing tougher rules following the row over ffos-y-fran opencast mine .
residents have protested about the mine , near merthyr tydfil , claiming there will not be enough protection rom noise , dust and pollution .
ffos-y-fran will become one of europe 's biggest opencast sites and will mine 10m tonnes of coal over 17 years .
campaigners against ffos-y-fran , who have called for the 500m -lrb- 1,640ft -rrb- buffer zone , welcomed the debate , which will take place at the senedd in cardiff bay on tuesday .
but there is still anger that the opencast site had been allowed to go ahead with a buffer of just 40m -lrb- 130ft -rrb- to the nearest homes .
environment minister jane davidson has said coal will play a valuable role in filling the world 's energy gap , but the quality of life of people living near opencast sites must be taken into account .
the new guidance also means there will have to be compulsory health impact assessments before opencast proposals get the go ahead .
opponents of the scheme halted preparation work at the site in december by " occupying " two large excavating machines .
developer miller argent -lrb- south wales -rrb- has said the site will reclaim derelict land and bring benefits to the area .

his cameraman , the iranian photojournalist kaveh golestan , was killed .
five years on , he wanted to meet others whose lives have been affected by the same conflict and the progress of two young welsh soldiers who were injured in iraq for bbc wales ' week in week out programme .
coalition forces have been in iraq for five years .
the conflict has been bloody and increasingly unpopular .
more than 170 british troops have been killed - 13 from wales .
in recent months the number of british troops in iraq has been scaled down - but for some , the fight is n't over .
for peter hire and samantha bowen , the war in iraq has left its scars - both physical and psychological .
peter , 23 , from tredegar , was sent to iraq with the 12th regiment , royal artillery .
he enjoyed army life and was planning a long military career - but all that changed on 4 september , 2006 .
he was driving the lead vehicle in a convoy near the town of ad dayr , north of basra , when a roadside bomb exploded .
the two soldiers in the back of the vehicle were killed .
blind and deaf one of the doors of the vehicle landed on peter 's head , critically injuring him .
" they took me to baghdad and they cut half my skull out , my eye sockets were shattered and i broke my jaw in 3 places " he said .
" i 'm blind in my left eye , deaf in my left ear and i 've got brain damage .
" i have problems understanding certain things and coping with certain situations which i never would have before . "
peter was flown to the queen elizabeth hospital in birmingham , where he underwent emergency surgery .
he has no memory of the ten weeks after the explosion .
he spent months at the military 's rehabilitation centre , headley court in surrey .
during his recovery he met another young welsh soldier , samantha bowen , from mountain ash .
samantha , 21 , suffered severe injuries to her right leg when her base in al amara was attacked by a barrage of mortars .
she was hit by razor sharp shrapnel and would have bled to death within minutes without medical help . "
i still suffer from nightmares .
i can smell the smells on the night " samantha bowen " it did actually hit a very big artery in my leg .
i was bleeding pretty fast and pretty dangerously , " she told me .
samantha also bears mental scars .
she has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder - or ptsd - a psychological illness that can develop after exposure to a life-threatening event .
" i still suffer from nightmares , " she said .
" i can smell the smells on the night .
" i just wish i could forget everything about iraq or maybe better still everything about the army and i just wish i 'd never joined now " bitter samantha wears a brace on her foot and walks with a crutch .
she has had eleven operations on her leg and has regular physiotherapy sessions .
but she is bitter about the level of help she has received from the army for ptsd .
" physically they have done quite a lot for me and i 'm grateful for it " , she says .
" but mentally i think they have done nothing .
they 've given me counselling sessions but it 's not trauma focused and it has n't really helped with my problem . "
the ministry of defence would n't comment on individual cases but told week in week out it recognises mental illness as a serious and disabling condition which can be treated .
white wedding it is funding a new community mental health service for veterans at the university of wales hospital , cardiff .
samantha became one of its first patients after she was discharged from the army four weeks ago .
" my belief is that for veterans coming in with mental health symptoms , such as samantha 's that this is the appropriate service for an individual like that 's needs , " said consultant psychiatrist dr jonathan bisson , who runs the service .
samantha is hoping that this new service will help her to look to the future .
she 's planning to marry her fiancé , former soldier carl davidson , when her injuries improve .
" i want a lovely big white wedding .
i 'm moving to newcastle so i 'd like to get married in south wales , " she said .
" i think it will be quite emotional , because it will be an achievement to actually be able to walk down the aisle without a crutch . "

as one would expect from someone who had taken over editing british political facts from his father , the great david butler of nuffield college , he held in his head facts and figures , policy details and statistical quirks that never ceased to amaze .
who needed google when gareth was in the office .
he was a natural to steer bbc radio 4 's special election night coverage taking charge of editing the two general election programmes of 2001 and 2005 , countless local council elections , european polls and us election nights .
his last job at the bbc was as deputy editor of the politics show , a programme he had joined at its birth in 2003 .
the final programme he would edit would be from the world economic forum at davos , at the end of january 2008 , where we had gone to interview the prime minister .
future plans ...
gareth had decided that , after the best part of 20 years with the bbc , it was time to move on .
and we sat at dinner in the swiss alps listening to him talk excitedly about his plans for the future .
first there were the plans he was making with jess - who had brought him great personal happiness since they married last may ; there would be a cricket tour to the west indies with the bbc radio news cricket team that he ran .
then he would consider the career options : would it be with a public affairs company , a think-tank , a pollster ?
it sounded as though the options were abundant and that the head-hunters were circling .
just another quick word about this dinner ...
we learnt how gareth would pass car journeys with his two children from his first marriage - joel , 13 and sacha , 11 .
they would give him a year , any year from the middle-ages onwards , and he would provide a fascinating or obscure fact about that year .
needless to say once we discovered this , the rest of the dinner was spent trying to catch him out .
we failed miserably .
journalistic career after the dragon school and then abingdon , gareth won a scholarship to gonville and caius , cambridge where he graduated in 1986 with a first in history .
academia would have been a natural choice - as well as his father being a fellow of nuffield college , his mother marilyn was rector of exeter college , oxford and one of the country 's foremost literary critics .
but like his two brothers , he chose journalism .
after brief stints as a commons researcher with the former chancellor denis healey and labour frontbencher tom clarke gareth joined the bbc in 1988 at central talks and features in the current affairs department of bush house .
after bush house - he went on to special current affairs at radio four to work on the programmes " law in action " and " stop press . "
inevitably , gareth 's acute political antennae led him to the world at one and the world this weekend .
he became editor of the world this weekend in 1995 .
this was the start of what became a major problem - how to manage the competing demands in life of having a job which required one to work at the weekend , with an arsenal season ticket in your pocket .
the ingenious solution was a very peculiar rota pattern at the world this weekend which consisted of a big gap in the middle of saturday afternoon .
gareth then went on to work for the then head of bbc news , and now chief executive of the royal opera house , tony hall .
this was a job that required a rather different skill set .
here you needed the highly attuned antennae of the mandarin - dealing with complaints from the public , navigating a path through the often complex internal politics of the bbc and having the intellectual rigour to think through delicate editorial judgements on which as an organisation we are rightly judged by the public .
gareth upheld all that was good about the corporation 's public service values but it was his ability to understand and communicate nuance that lent itself so well to covering politics and why politics was always going to be the perfect job in journalism for him .
he finally arrived at millbank , the bbc 's studios at westminster , as an assistant editor of live programmes , producing programmes like dispatch box and most recently the politics show .
family bonds his family is tight-knit and loving .
once when gareth and i were off to speak to david cameron in his witney constituency we stopped at his parents ' house in oxford on the way to polish up the questions for my interview .
they could not have been more welcoming .
indeed david - someone who people of my generation regard as the father of modern psephology - came in to serve us with a tray of coffee and biscuits .
gareth was not a showy person but was starting to move into the limelight himself .
his first article since leaving the bbc was published yesterday in the magazine , progress .
something he would not live to see .

last updated : tuesday , 4 march 2008 , 08:44 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version gareth butler jon sopel presenter the politics show gareth the sudden death of gareth butler at the age of 42 has robbed politics and broadcasting of one of the cleverest , most knowledgeable and likeable people around .
as one would expect from someone who had taken over editing british political facts from his father , the great david butler of nuffield college , he held in his head facts and figures , policy details and statistical quirks that never ceased to amaze .
who needed google when gareth was in the office .
he was a natural to steer bbc radio 4 's special election night coverage taking charge of editing the two general election programmes of 2001 and 2005 , countless local council elections , european polls and us election nights .
his last job at the bbc was as deputy editor of the politics show , a programme he had joined at its birth in 2003 .
the final programme he would edit would be from the world economic forum at davos , at the end of january 2008 , where we had gone to interview the prime minister .
future plans ...
gareth had decided that , after the best part of 20 years with the bbc , it was time to move on .
and we sat at dinner in the swiss alps listening to him talk excitedly about his plans for the future .
first there were the plans he was making with jess - who had brought him great personal happiness since they married last may ; there would be a cricket tour to the west indies with the bbc radio news cricket team that he ran .
then he would consider the career options : would it be with a public affairs company , a think-tank , a pollster ?
it sounded as though the options were abundant and that the head-hunters were circling .
just another quick word about this dinner ...
we learnt how gareth would pass car journeys with his two children from his first marriage - joel , 13 and sacha , 11 .
they would give him a year , any year from the middle-ages onwards , and he would provide a fascinating or obscure fact about that year .
needless to say once we discovered this , the rest of the dinner was spent trying to catch him out .
we failed miserably .
journalistic career after the dragon school and then abingdon , gareth won a scholarship to gonville and caius , cambridge where he graduated in 1986 with a first in history .
academia would have been a natural choice - as well as his father being a fellow of nuffield college , his mother marilyn was rector of exeter college , oxford and one of the country 's foremost literary critics .
but like his two brothers , he chose journalism .
after brief stints as a commons researcher with the former chancellor denis healey and labour frontbencher tom clarke gareth joined the bbc in 1988 at central talks and features in the current affairs department of bush house .
after bush house - he went on to special current affairs at radio four to work on the programmes " law in action " and " stop press . "

hungarian ludwig von wohl persuaded senior intelligence figures that he could replicate the forecasts of the nazi leader 's personal astrologer .
he claimed that if london knew what advice hitler , born on 20 april , was getting , they would know his next move .
but the security service mi5 had warned that von wohl was a " charlatan " .
american tour von wohl , who was also known as louis de wohl , was a controversial figure .
although he was dismissed as a buffoon and a scoundrel by some of the military people he met , others suggested that he was extremely astute , with a keen insight into the thinking of leading nazis .
he can not believe that anyone is going to re-employ this dangerous charlatan and confidence-trick merchant mi6 despite dismissing his claims of being from hungarian nobility , mi5 hoped de wohl could feed them information about his clients among the " great and the good " .
but the special operations executive -lrb- soe -rrb- - the wartime sabotage organisation - recruited de wohl for its so2 propaganda section , giving him the rank of captain and an army uniform .
he is said to have loved to " strut " around london in his military clothes .
in 1940 soe sent de wohl on a lecture tour of the united states aimed at convincing a sceptical public that hitler could be defeated , and therefore that the us should enter the war .
his mission was regarded as a great success , with his talks and interviews being given significant publicity .
but the japanese attack on pearl harbour in december 1941 dramatically brought the us into the conflict as britain 's ally .
astrological advice de wohl returned to london and then came up with his proposal to examine the astrological advice being given to hitler by swiss stargazer karl ernst krafft .
de wohl claimed that as hitler relied heavily on krafft 's predictions , which were based on mathematics surrounding birthdates , the british could gain a unique insight into his thinking if they knew the astrological advice he was receiving .
the plan appealed to some leading figures , including the director of naval intelligence admiral john godfrey , who found hitler 's erratic strategic moves hard to work out .
while his plan was enthusiastically embraced by member of soe and the political warfare executive , mi5 and mi6 were appalled .
" one of our senior officers comments that he can not believe that anyone is going to re-employ this dangerous charlatan and confidence-trick merchant , " a report from mi6 said .
another mi5 officer said none of de wohl 's predictions had come true , apart from his forecast of italy 's entry into the war , which he made when it was " quite patent to anybody with the slightest knowledge of international affairs " .
historians now say that hitler took no notice at all of astrological forecasts .
all the released files can be viewed at the national archives in kew , west london .

in 1940 soe sent de wohl on a lecture tour of the united states aimed at convincing a sceptical public that hitler could be defeated , and therefore that the us should enter the war .
his mission was regarded as a great success , with his talks and interviews being given significant publicity .
but the japanese attack on pearl harbour in december 1941 dramatically brought the us into the conflict as britain 's ally .
astrological advice de wohl returned to london and then came up with his proposal to examine the astrological advice being given to hitler by swiss stargazer karl ernst krafft .
de wohl claimed that as hitler relied heavily on krafft 's predictions , which were based on mathematics surrounding birthdates , the british could gain a unique insight into his thinking if they knew the astrological advice he was receiving .
the plan appealed to some leading figures , including the director of naval intelligence admiral john godfrey , who found hitler 's erratic strategic moves hard to work out .
while his plan was enthusiastically embraced by member of soe and the political warfare executive , mi5 and mi6 were appalled .
" one of our senior officers comments that he can not believe that anyone is going to re-employ this dangerous charlatan and confidence-trick merchant , " a report from mi6 said .
another mi5 officer said none of de wohl 's predictions had come true , apart from his forecast of italy 's entry into the war , which he made when it was " quite patent to anybody with the slightest knowledge of international affairs " .
historians now say that hitler took no notice at all of astrological forecasts .

but the security service mi5 had warned that von wohl was a " charlatan " .
american tour von wohl , who was also known as louis de wohl , was a controversial figure .
although he was dismissed as a buffoon and a scoundrel by some of the military people he met , others suggested that he was extremely astute , with a keen insight into the thinking of leading nazis .
he can not believe that anyone is going to re-employ this dangerous charlatan and confidence-trick merchant mi6 despite dismissing his claims of being from hungarian nobility , mi5 hoped de wohl could feed them information about his clients among the " great and the good " .
but the special operations executive -lrb- soe -rrb- - the wartime sabotage organisation - recruited de wohl for its so2 propaganda section , giving him the rank of captain and an army uniform .
he is said to have loved to " strut " around london in his military clothes .
in 1940 soe sent de wohl on a lecture tour of the united states aimed at convincing a sceptical public that hitler could be defeated , and therefore that the us should enter the war .
his mission was regarded as a great success , with his talks and interviews being given significant publicity .
but the japanese attack on pearl harbour in december 1941 dramatically brought the us into the conflict as britain 's ally .
astrological advice de wohl returned to london and then came up with his proposal to examine the astrological advice being given to hitler by swiss stargazer karl ernst krafft .
de wohl claimed that as hitler relied heavily on krafft 's predictions , which were based on mathematics surrounding birthdates , the british could gain a unique insight into his thinking if they knew the astrological advice he was receiving .
the plan appealed to some leading figures , including the director of naval intelligence admiral john godfrey , who found hitler 's erratic strategic moves hard to work out .
while his plan was enthusiastically embraced by member of soe and the political warfare executive , mi5 and mi6 were appalled .
" one of our senior officers comments that he can not believe that anyone is going to re-employ this dangerous charlatan and confidence-trick merchant , " a report from mi6 said .
another mi5 officer said none of de wohl 's predictions had come true , apart from his forecast of italy 's entry into the war , which he made when it was " quite patent to anybody with the slightest knowledge of international affairs " .
historians now say that hitler took no notice at all of astrological forecasts .
all the released files can be viewed at the national archives in kew , west london .

beijing has threatened military attack if taiwan declares independence , and the island 's 22 march presidential election will be watched closely by the authorities on the mainland .
cyberspace concerns the us defence department released its annual report on chinese military power on monday evening .
the report said china was developing weapons that would disable its enemies ' space technology - such as satellites - in the event of a conflict .
it expressed concern about china 's decision to shoot down a defunct weather satellite in a test in january 2007 .
it also said that " numerous " cyber intrusions into computer networks around the world , including some owned by the us administration , apparently originated in china .
david sedney , a senior china specialist at the pentagon , told reporters there was no call for us alarm , but he said that washington was keen for beijing to be clearer about the reasons behind its expanding military costs .
" i think the biggest thing for people to be concerned about , really , is the fact that we do n't have that kind of strategic understanding of the chinese intentions , " he said .
" and that leads to uncertainty . "
in its report , the pentagon estimated that china 's total military spending in 2007 was between $ 97bn and $ 139bn .
last month , the bush administration requested $ 515bn for the next us fiscal year , not including extra spending for the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
there has recently been some progress in us-chinese military relations , including the installation of a joint telephone hotline .

rape crisis scotland is behind the adverts refocusing attention on the fact attacks can devastate lives .
women 's groups and politicians were shocked at a recent survey revealing a quarter of scots believed that raped women may be partly responsible .
the campaign comes as ministers are preparing to bring in radical reforms to the law on rape and sexual offences .
the scottish government is providing £ 200,000 to fund the advertisements which feature women flirting or wearing provocative clothing , under the slogan : " this is n't an invitation to rape me . "
the adverts are based on a successful campaign by us organisation peace over violence , and will be released in scotland this summer .
consent to sex it is the latest initiative to try to improve scotland 's rape conviction rate which , at 3.9 % , is one of the lowest in europe .
justice secretary kenny macaskill said there was an urgent need to bring public attitudes into the 21st century .
" it is hard to believe that in a modern scotland there are people who still think that if a woman is dressed in a certain way or has been drinking it 's her own fault if she is raped , " he added .
" similarly , people who believe that a woman ca n't be raped by her husband , or someone else she knows , are wrong .
a person does n't have to use physical force to make it rape .
we need to make sure that is clear . "
the government has pledged to modernise rape laws following a report by the scottish law commission . "
it is hard to believe that in a modern scotland there are people who still think that if a woman is dressed in a certain way or has been drinking it 's her own fault if she is raped " kenny macaskill justice secretary it recommended defining for the first time what consent means , suggesting both parties must freely consent to sex .
it is thought that in particular , this would give a drunken victim more legal protection .
sandy brindley , national co-ordinator of rape crisis scotland , said : " studies into public attitudes consistently show that many people blame women for rape if we have been flirting , are dressed in revealing clothing or are known to have had many sexual partners .
" what this means is that at least some of the people sitting in juries in rape trials are likely to hold these kinds of attitudes . "
legal changes must be underlined by concerted effort to challenge perceptions , she added .
" far too many people still think women are ' asking for it ' .
we hope that our new campaign - the first of its kind in scotland - will make people start to challenge their own and other people 's attitudes to rape . "

her knee is badly injured .
" i was returning from school when the cyclone came , " she says .
" i tried to run because i was afraid , but i fell and hurt my leg .
when i got home , the wind was so strong that the house collapsed .
i was trapped there all night . "
soso is just one of an estimated 322,000 people affected by cyclone ivan , which slammed into the east coast of madagascar on the 17 february , with winds of 230km / h -lrb- 142mph -rrb- . "
now i have no hope " amadine mamena , cyclone survivor it was of a similar intensity to hurricane katrina , which brought havoc to new orleans in 2005 .
so far more than 80 have died , more than 170 are missing and at least 187,000 are homeless and the government has asked for $ 30m in international aid .
soso lives in the village of ambodihazinina , on the east coast , which bore the brunt of the storm .
the journey there revealed the scale of the destruction .
fallen trees litter the road , wooden houses have been flattened or teeter on the brink of collapse .
madagascar is used to tropical storms .
it sits on a type of cyclone alley running through the indian ocean – but cyclone ivan was particularly cruel .
" devastation , kilometres of devastation , " observed bruno maes from unicef .
" i was here for the last cyclone season but i have never seen anything like this . "
although ambodihazinina was almost completely flattened , within days some of the houses had been resurrected .
but amadine mamena can not afford to do this .
" i don ’ t know how i will rebuild my house because we have no money .
all our savings were in our crops , but they 've been destroyed .
now i have no hope , " she told me .
more than two weeks after the cyclone made land , the district to the north of ambodihazinina is still cut off .
an aid operation is underway and bruno maes is hoping that unicef and other agencies can move swiftly .
" we hope to fly emergency medical supplies by helicopter to the inaccessible areas . "
rebuilding the rolling green hills and lush valleys ring to the sound of hammering as reconstruction continues apace .
but everyone seems to have one major concern - there is nothing to eat .
across the island , 41,000 hectares of rice fields and 134,000 hectares of other crops have been destroyed .
" before the cyclone , my rice was just ripening .
now it has all gone , " says subsistence farmer justin tombo .
" i can try to rebuild my home but my crops have gone . "
didier young of care international says many people have lost their roofs .
" when you lose your roof you lose everything , including your food stocks , " he says .
" the next harvest was supposed to be in may , but for many it will bring nothing . "
health workers say malnutrition , is on the rise , particularly amongst children .
with more tropical storms forecast in the coming weeks , there is a serious risk of a lingering humanitarian crisis after the blistering assault of cyclone ivan .
