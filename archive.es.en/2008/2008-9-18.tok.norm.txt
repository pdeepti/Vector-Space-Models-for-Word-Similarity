17 .
the deal was due to be formally announced thursday .
it had been explicitly backed by the government and was seen as an attempt to prevent the collapse of hbos -lrb- halifax bank of scotland -rrb- , analysts said .
" the key thing is to maintain stability in the banking system , " treasury secretary alistair darling said about the negotiations wednesday .
analysts in the city of london , the capital 's financial district , said there were concerns over competition issues and the apparent haste with which the deal was struck .
" in normal circumstances , this would not have happened , " said one .
merger to create britain 's largest bank the merger is expected to create a bank with a market value of 30 billion pounds , by far the biggest in britain .
it would have 38 million customers and 142,000 employees .
hbos , which has seen its share price fall by 50 percent since the credit crunch began a year ago , suffered badly from the fallout of monday 's lehman brothers collapse , with predators in the city pouncing on its vulnerability as a major mortgage lender .
analysts said the government had feared that hbos would become a " northern rock mark 2 " - after the collapse last year of british mortgage lender northern rock , which was nationalized in january .
on the london market wednesday , hbos shares fluctuated wildly , climbing as high as 220 pence and falling as low as 88 pence .
analysts said the government-backed merger talks were accelerated after hbos voiced concerns that depositors and lenders had begun to withdraw their credit from the bank .
" there were growing concerns in the hbos boardroom that a climate of fear was being created about its future that could have led to a funding crisis - or a northern rock-style run - on steroids , " said one .
" it was not in the government 's interest for there to be the faintest risk that it would have another northern rock on its hands . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one lawmaker has called for the " total reform " of kfw in the wake of a major payment error , while another has raised doubts about the costly bailout of crippled subsidiary ikb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the ikb bailout be less than certain ?
late thursday , sept .
18 , the kfw board is slated to meet in berlin for a formal vote to approve the sale of ikb deutsche industriebank , a subsidiary of kfw that was hit hard in by subprime mortgage exposure in the us , to us financial investor lone star .
seeking explanation for transfer the bank 's supervisory board , largely composed of german parliamentarians , will use that meeting to hear an explanation of kfw 's mistaken transfer of 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .
kfw declared the transfer , part of a swap arrangement , a " technical blunder . "
but critics said they should have held on to the money , knowing from sunday news reports that lehman was broke .
swaps are often programmed in advance into computers so that they happen without human intervention .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig said the remittance was " infuriating " and those to blame must be found , but an aide to economics minister michael glos - who currently sits at the head the kfw supervisory board - said it was too early to say if anyone would be punished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why did kfw send a payment to bankrupt firm ?
ahead of the meeting thursday , opposition parliamentarian and kfw supervisory board member juergen koppelin called for a total reform of the german state development bank .
he said he feared that losses through the faulty bank transfer could add up to far more than the 300 million euros already known .
lawmaker : ' total reform ' is needed " i think the consequence should be total reform , " koppelin told ard television news on thursday .
the supervisory board should be made smaller , and a fact-finding commission should be established to explain the error , he said .
another problem is that supervisory board members are not well enough informed by the kfw management board , he said .
that subject is also likely to be on the agenda at thursday afternoon 's final vote to approve the sale of kfw 's troubled subsidiary ikb to us financial investor lone star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos : too soon to say who will be punished while the deal is considered certain , green party politican and kfw supervisory board member christine scheel complained to the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that she and the other supervisory board members feel they have n't been adequately informed about the terms of the sale agreement .
20 questions for michael glos " i can not imagine that we can comprehend and decide upon such a complex deal in the form of a hand-out or , worse , a verbal explanation , " she told the paper .
scheel accused supervisory board leader michael glos of denying the supervisory board members any actual decision-making power by withholding the information .
she demanded that glos and kfw chairman ulrich schroeder answer 20 detailed questions on the sale .

late thursday , sept .
18 , the kfw board is slated to meet in berlin for a formal vote to approve the sale of ikb deutsche industriebank , a subsidiary of kfw that was hit hard in by subprime mortgage exposure in the us , to us financial investor lone star .
seeking explanation for transfer the bank 's supervisory board , largely composed of german parliamentarians , will use that meeting to hear an explanation of kfw 's mistaken transfer of 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .
kfw declared the transfer , part of a swap arrangement , a " technical blunder . "
but critics said they should have held on to the money , knowing from sunday news reports that lehman was broke .
swaps are often programmed in advance into computers so that they happen without human intervention .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig said the remittance was " infuriating " and those to blame must be found , but an aide to economics minister michael glos - who currently sits at the head the kfw supervisory board - said it was too early to say if anyone would be punished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why did kfw send a payment to bankrupt firm ?
ahead of the meeting thursday , opposition parliamentarian and kfw supervisory board member juergen koppelin called for a total reform of the german state development bank .
he said he feared that losses through the faulty bank transfer could add up to far more than the 300 million euros already known .
lawmaker : ' total reform ' is needed " i think the consequence should be total reform , " koppelin told ard television news on thursday .
the supervisory board should be made smaller , and a fact-finding commission should be established to explain the error , he said .
another problem is that supervisory board members are not well enough informed by the kfw management board , he said .
that subject is also likely to be on the agenda at thursday afternoon 's final vote to approve the sale of kfw 's troubled subsidiary ikb to us financial investor lone star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos : too soon to say who will be punished while the deal is considered certain , green party politican and kfw supervisory board member christine scheel complained to the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that she and the other supervisory board members feel they have n't been adequately informed about the terms of the sale agreement .
20 questions for michael glos " i can not imagine that we can comprehend and decide upon such a complex deal in the form of a hand-out or , worse , a verbal explanation , " she told the paper .
scheel accused supervisory board leader michael glos of denying the supervisory board members any actual decision-making power by withholding the information .
she demanded that glos and kfw chairman ulrich schroeder answer 20 detailed questions on the sale .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 18.09.2008 spd mulls supporting new law on late-term abortions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu wants more counselling for women facing late-term abortion germany 's conservative cdu has retracted its planned motion to amend the country 's laws on late-term abortions in order to give its coalition partner , the spd , time to consider adding its support . both coalition groups have confirmed to the passauer neue presse newspaper that the social democrats are taking time to consider a christian democrat motion that would tighten the laws regulating late-term abortions in germany .
despite several past attempts , the two coalition partners have never managed to find a common position on late-term abortions .
a late-term abortion is a termination which is carried out after the 20th week in a pregnancy when there is a risk to the physical or mental health of the mother .
most late-term abortions are carried out when prenatal diagnosis reveals that the fetus has a severe disability .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the cdu 's motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counselling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , spd : " i can see supporting this motion . "
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law would foresee a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .

despite several past attempts , the two coalition partners have never managed to find a common position on late-term abortions .
a late-term abortion is a termination which is carried out after the 20th week in a pregnancy when there is a risk to the physical or mental health of the mother .
most late-term abortions are carried out when prenatal diagnosis reveals that the fetus has a severe disability .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the cdu 's motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counselling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , spd : " i can see supporting this motion . "
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law would foresee a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .

an investigatory committee questioned two intelligence agents accused of aiding the us . two german spies in baghdad actively supported the 2003 us invasion of iraq despite government denials , opposition parties said . the politicians made their comments were before the two intelligence agents gave testimony behind closed doors to a parliamentary panel on thursday , sept .
18 . contradictory evidence " the records unfortunately contradict completely the government 's position that it was not involved , " norman paech , a member of the investigative committee from the left party , told reuters news service before the hearing . a federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- fact-finding commission on the iraq war has begun investigating the role played by current foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in the invasion . the bnd debriefed two agents in baghdad who they believe passed " relevant war data " to the bnd headquarters in pullach .

the case caused uproar when it leaked out in early 2006 , because both the german government and public opinion strongly opposed the us invasion .

" no evidence for this has been presented so far , " spd delegate michael hartmann told reuters . response from steinmeier steinmeier said in a newspaper interview that the public would not buy the argument that the presence of two bnd spies in iraq was enough " to make germany a warring party after the fact .

" " they did not inform south ossetian authorities about the possible aggression , they did not prevent this aggression , " he said . russian forces to stay : kouchner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diplomacy alone may not be able to shift russian forces from south ossetia or abkhazia france 's foreign minister said the world should not expect russia to pull out of georgia 's two breakaway provinces anytime soon . bernard kouchner 's comment was the clearest sign yet that the european union may be accepting the possibility that georgia will not regain control of south ossetia or abkhazia .
russia plans to station nearly 8,000 troops for a long-term stay in the two regions . asked by france-culture radio whether russia troops would pull back to georgia 's internationally recognized borders , kouchner replied : " no , i do n't think so .

and he 's also having some family problems . wolfgang porsche , who in addition to being the chairman of the german luxury carmaker that bears his name also happens to be one of piech 's cousins , is trying to unseat piech by buying up vw stock through porsche 's holding company .
the company currently owns 35 percent of vw ordinary stock and has plans to increase its share to over 50 percent in november . unwilling to relinquish control to porsche without a fight , piech decided , unexpectedly , not to show up for a board meeting over technical cooperation between porsche and vw 's upscale audi division last week . bildunterschrift : piech maintains a dual role as supervisory board chairman of vw and porsche heir the chairman 's absence gave the balance of power to the board 's workers representatives in a vote that ended in a tie and leaves porsche having to seek board approval for any cooperation with audi . when blood 's not thicker than water but the symbolic implications of the vote - and piech 's tacit support for the unions over his family - reverberated beyond the boardroom .
while it was not unusual for piech to take the side of the unions , that he did so in public against his own family was a precedent , said a former volkswagen manager , who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity . the normally reserved wolfgang porsche told germany 's focus magazine , " ferdinand is ruining the whole family .
this is unbelievable . " the conflict has advanced to a point where porsche has admitted there are plans to dethrone piech . " it 's not a matter anymore of whether he 's going or not .
but when and how , " said porsche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang porsche now -lrb- left -rrb- wants to unseat piech -lrb- right -rrb- unseating piech from vw 's 20-member supervisory board , however , will prove difficult , since the chairman enjoys support from labor unions . piech , unions vs. porsche , management last week some 40,000 union workers demonstrated outside vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg to protest against changing the controversial vw law . the state of lower saxony , where vw is based , also has a say in the family feud .
the state has only a 20 percent equity stake in volkswagen , but exercises enormous voting power thanks to the vw law , which gives the government veto power on major company decisions . workers were also nervous about porsche 's harsh management tactics with union leaders concerned about job cuts if porsche gains complete control of vw . volkswagen is by far lower saxony 's largest employer and state premier christian wulff , who also sits on the vw supervisory board , is looking to keep his state 's job motor humming , which aligns him with piech and unions . german newspapers have been speculating that piech now wants to get porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking off the volkswagen board and is using the unions to dilute the influence of his porsche relatives in vw company affairs . bildunterschrift : the demonstration was against the vw law , but directed at the unpopular porsche ceo no holy cows " the vw patriarch is escalating a conflict in which he should be acting as mediator , " wrote the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" above all he is hostile to wiedeking , who has become too powerful for his taste .
piech is holding a company with 330,000 employees hostage just because he does n't like the attitude of one manager . " piech has a record of collaborating with unions to get rid of management .
in 2006 he worked to oust then ceo bernd pischetsrieder , who got word he was fired through the press . piech sees himself as a visionary with a management style very much at odds with wiedeking 's approach to business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking -lrb- left -rrb- and piech -lrb- right -rrb- have different visions for vw " piech sees his vision endangered by wiedeking , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen .
" wiedeking said that there are no holy cows at vw , no more phaetons , no more bugattis . " there was always a cease-fire between piech and the porsches , but now it 's war .
wiedeking is destroying piech 's shining vision , " dudenhoeffer added . cease-fire turns to war for piech , profits are secondary to spectacular engineering feats , according to christoph stuermer , an auto analyst for global insight in frankfurt who has followed volkswagen and porsche for years . " piech is one of the most gifted car engineers on the planet , " he said .
" he wants to be the living michelangelo of cars . " piech 's talents have been profitable for volkswagen .
the company earned 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in profits on a turnover of 109 billion euros last year , surpassed ford to become no. 3 in the world in unit sales and is the globe 's most diverse automaker with brands including scania , seat , skoda , audi , bentley , lamborghini and bugatti . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : granddad ferdinand porsche designed the vw beetle but despite the overall profits and name recognition , it 's piech 's pet projects that irritate wiedeking most , stuermer said . " wiedeking is a porsche ceo from another corporate culture , " he said .
" he 's out to maximize profits by cutting costs and he snubbed everyone , telling off vw management , interfering with their way of doing business . " perhaps ferdinand " ferry " porsche , the namesake son of the man who developed the vw beetle and piech 's uncle , had the right idea in the 1970s when he said all porsche and piech family members working at porsche had to leave management to outsiders because of family squabbles . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united states is also keen to secure access to the resources for its own companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the btc pipeline is 1,800 kilometers -lrb- 1,118 miles -rrb- long turkey exerts considerable influence in the region on account of its ethnic and linguistic ties with the turkic peoples of central asia and its involvement in the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan -lrb- btc -rrb- oil pipeline . the pipeline connects oilfields in azerbaijan with shipping terminals in turkey via georgia .
but russia fears that the btc pipeline and plans for another one like it undermine its status as an energy-superpower . energy stability remains a challenge in a report published in may 2007 , the international crisis group came to the conclusion that " central asia is likely to see energy create instability within the region ; the chances are low that it will be a factor in improving european energy security any time soon . " the paris forum aims to overcome such gloomy predictions and has been convened expressly with the aim of fostering cooperation that will help defuse conflicts within the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been the motor for this meeting the meeting is being attended by representatives of the 27 member states of the eu as well as from the five central asian states . representatives from the eu commission , turkey , china , japan and russia are also present . afghanistan is there as an observer country , given its geographical proximity and the problems it shares with countries from the region . the european union strategy for central asia came into being in june 2007 on the instigation of germany which then held the rotating eu presidency and designated cooperation with central asia as an issue of top priority for the eu . dw staff -lrb- srh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and he 's also having some family problems . wolfgang porsche , who in addition to being the chairman of the german luxury carmaker that bears his name also happens to be one of piech 's cousins , is trying to unseat piech by buying up vw stock through porsche 's holding company .
the company currently owns 35 percent of vw ordinary stock and has plans to increase its share to over 50 percent in november . unwilling to relinquish control to porsche without a fight , piech decided , unexpectedly , not to show up for a board meeting over technical cooperation between porsche and vw 's upscale audi division last week . bildunterschrift : piech maintains a dual role as supervisory board chairman of vw and porsche heir the chairman 's absence gave the balance of power to the board 's workers representatives in a vote that ended in a tie and leaves porsche having to seek board approval for any cooperation with audi . when blood 's not thicker than water but the symbolic implications of the vote - and piech 's tacit support for the unions over his family - reverberated beyond the boardroom .
while it was not unusual for piech to take the side of the unions , that he did so in public against his own family was a precedent , said a former volkswagen manager , who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity . the normally reserved wolfgang porsche told germany 's focus magazine , " ferdinand is ruining the whole family .
this is unbelievable . " the conflict has advanced to a point where porsche has admitted there are plans to dethrone piech . " it 's not a matter anymore of whether he 's going or not .
but when and how , " said porsche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang porsche now -lrb- left -rrb- wants to unseat piech -lrb- right -rrb- unseating piech from vw 's 20-member supervisory board , however , will prove difficult , since the chairman enjoys support from labor unions . piech , unions vs. porsche , management last week some 40,000 union workers demonstrated outside vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg to protest against changing the controversial vw law . the state of lower saxony , where vw is based , also has a say in the family feud .
the state has only a 20 percent equity stake in volkswagen , but exercises enormous voting power thanks to the vw law , which gives the government veto power on major company decisions . workers were also nervous about porsche 's harsh management tactics with union leaders concerned about job cuts if porsche gains complete control of vw . volkswagen is by far lower saxony 's largest employer and state premier christian wulff , who also sits on the vw supervisory board , is looking to keep his state 's job motor humming , which aligns him with piech and unions . german newspapers have been speculating that piech now wants to get porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking off the volkswagen board and is using the unions to dilute the influence of his porsche relatives in vw company affairs . bildunterschrift : the demonstration was against the vw law , but directed at the unpopular porsche ceo no holy cows " the vw patriarch is escalating a conflict in which he should be acting as mediator , " wrote the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" above all he is hostile to wiedeking , who has become too powerful for his taste .
piech is holding a company with 330,000 employees hostage just because he does n't like the attitude of one manager . " piech has a record of collaborating with unions to get rid of management .
in 2006 he worked to oust then ceo bernd pischetsrieder , who got word he was fired through the press . piech sees himself as a visionary with a management style very much at odds with wiedeking 's approach to business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking -lrb- left -rrb- and piech -lrb- right -rrb- have different visions for vw " piech sees his vision endangered by wiedeking , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen .
" wiedeking said that there are no holy cows at vw , no more phaetons , no more bugattis . " there was always a cease-fire between piech and the porsches , but now it 's war .
wiedeking is destroying piech 's shining vision , " dudenhoeffer added . cease-fire turns to war for piech , profits are secondary to spectacular engineering feats , according to christoph stuermer , an auto analyst for global insight in frankfurt who has followed volkswagen and porsche for years . " piech is one of the most gifted car engineers on the planet , " he said .
" he wants to be the living michelangelo of cars . " piech 's talents have been profitable for volkswagen .
the company earned 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in profits on a turnover of 109 billion euros last year , surpassed ford to become no. 3 in the world in unit sales and is the globe 's most diverse automaker with brands including scania , seat , skoda , audi , bentley , lamborghini and bugatti . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : granddad ferdinand porsche designed the vw beetle but despite the overall profits and name recognition , it 's piech 's pet projects that irritate wiedeking most , stuermer said . " wiedeking is a porsche ceo from another corporate culture , " he said .
" he 's out to maximize profits by cutting costs and he snubbed everyone , telling off vw management , interfering with their way of doing business . " perhaps ferdinand " ferry " porsche , the namesake son of the man who developed the vw beetle and piech 's uncle , had the right idea in the 1970s when he said all porsche and piech family members working at porsche had to leave management to outsiders because of family squabbles . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 18.09.2008 german carmaker family feud plays out in vw boardroom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche aims to up its stake in vw to over 50 percent later this year as family-owned porsche continues to up its stake in vw , a nasty feud has broken out between volkswagen board chairman ferdinand piech and his cousins at porsche over the future of europe 's biggest carmaker . ferdinand piech is 71 , a billionaire and a brilliant technocrat who has reached the pinnacle of the automobile industry as supervisory board chairman of volkswagen , europe 's biggest automaker .
and he 's also having some family problems . wolfgang porsche , who in addition to being the chairman of the german luxury carmaker that bears his name also happens to be one of piech 's cousins , is trying to unseat piech by buying up vw stock through porsche 's holding company .
the company currently owns 35 percent of vw ordinary stock and has plans to increase its share to over 50 percent in november . unwilling to relinquish control to porsche without a fight , piech decided , unexpectedly , not to show up for a board meeting over technical cooperation between porsche and vw 's upscale audi division last week . bildunterschrift : piech maintains a dual role as supervisory board chairman of vw and porsche heir the chairman 's absence gave the balance of power to the board 's workers representatives in a vote that ended in a tie and leaves porsche having to seek board approval for any cooperation with audi . when blood 's not thicker than water but the symbolic implications of the vote - and piech 's tacit support for the unions over his family - reverberated beyond the boardroom .
while it was not unusual for piech to take the side of the unions , that he did so in public against his own family was a precedent , said a former volkswagen manager , who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity . the normally reserved wolfgang porsche told germany 's focus magazine , " ferdinand is ruining the whole family .
this is unbelievable . " the conflict has advanced to a point where porsche has admitted there are plans to dethrone piech . " it 's not a matter anymore of whether he 's going or not .
but when and how , " said porsche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang porsche now -lrb- left -rrb- wants to unseat piech -lrb- right -rrb- unseating piech from vw 's 20-member supervisory board , however , will prove difficult , since the chairman enjoys support from labor unions . piech , unions vs. porsche , management last week some 40,000 union workers demonstrated outside vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg to protest against changing the controversial vw law . the state of lower saxony , where vw is based , also has a say in the family feud .
the state has only a 20 percent equity stake in volkswagen , but exercises enormous voting power thanks to the vw law , which gives the government veto power on major company decisions . workers were also nervous about porsche 's harsh management tactics with union leaders concerned about job cuts if porsche gains complete control of vw . volkswagen is by far lower saxony 's largest employer and state premier christian wulff , who also sits on the vw supervisory board , is looking to keep his state 's job motor humming , which aligns him with piech and unions . german newspapers have been speculating that piech now wants to get porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking off the volkswagen board and is using the unions to dilute the influence of his porsche relatives in vw company affairs . bildunterschrift : the demonstration was against the vw law , but directed at the unpopular porsche ceo no holy cows " the vw patriarch is escalating a conflict in which he should be acting as mediator , " wrote the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" above all he is hostile to wiedeking , who has become too powerful for his taste .
piech is holding a company with 330,000 employees hostage just because he does n't like the attitude of one manager . " piech has a record of collaborating with unions to get rid of management .
in 2006 he worked to oust then ceo bernd pischetsrieder , who got word he was fired through the press . piech sees himself as a visionary with a management style very much at odds with wiedeking 's approach to business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking -lrb- left -rrb- and piech -lrb- right -rrb- have different visions for vw " piech sees his vision endangered by wiedeking , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen .
" wiedeking said that there are no holy cows at vw , no more phaetons , no more bugattis . " there was always a cease-fire between piech and the porsches , but now it 's war .
wiedeking is destroying piech 's shining vision , " dudenhoeffer added . cease-fire turns to war for piech , profits are secondary to spectacular engineering feats , according to christoph stuermer , an auto analyst for global insight in frankfurt who has followed volkswagen and porsche for years . " piech is one of the most gifted car engineers on the planet , " he said .
" he wants to be the living michelangelo of cars . " piech 's talents have been profitable for volkswagen .
the company earned 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in profits on a turnover of 109 billion euros last year , surpassed ford to become no. 3 in the world in unit sales and is the globe 's most diverse automaker with brands including scania , seat , skoda , audi , bentley , lamborghini and bugatti . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : granddad ferdinand porsche designed the vw beetle but despite the overall profits and name recognition , it 's piech 's pet projects that irritate wiedeking most , stuermer said . " wiedeking is a porsche ceo from another corporate culture , " he said .
" he 's out to maximize profits by cutting costs and he snubbed everyone , telling off vw management , interfering with their way of doing business . " perhaps ferdinand " ferry " porsche , the namesake son of the man who developed the vw beetle and piech 's uncle , had the right idea in the 1970s when he said all porsche and piech family members working at porsche had to leave management to outsiders because of family squabbles . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and he 's also having some family problems . wolfgang porsche , who in addition to being the chairman of the german luxury carmaker that bears his name also happens to be one of piech 's cousins , is trying to unseat piech by buying up vw stock through porsche 's holding company .
the company currently owns 35 percent of vw ordinary stock and has plans to increase its share to over 50 percent in november . unwilling to relinquish control to porsche without a fight , piech decided , unexpectedly , not to show up for a board meeting over technical cooperation between porsche and vw 's upscale audi division last week . bildunterschrift : piech maintains a dual role as supervisory board chairman of vw and porsche heir the chairman 's absence gave the balance of power to the board 's workers representatives in a vote that ended in a tie and leaves porsche having to seek board approval for any cooperation with audi . when blood 's not thicker than water but the symbolic implications of the vote - and piech 's tacit support for the unions over his family - reverberated beyond the boardroom .
while it was not unusual for piech to take the side of the unions , that he did so in public against his own family was a precedent , said a former volkswagen manager , who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity . the normally reserved wolfgang porsche told germany 's focus magazine , " ferdinand is ruining the whole family .

the state has only a 20 percent equity stake in volkswagen , but exercises enormous voting power thanks to the vw law , which gives the government veto power on major company decisions . workers were also nervous about porsche 's harsh management tactics with union leaders concerned about job cuts if porsche gains complete control of vw . volkswagen is by far lower saxony 's largest employer and state premier christian wulff , who also sits on the vw supervisory board , is looking to keep his state 's job motor humming , which aligns him with piech and unions . german newspapers have been speculating that piech now wants to get porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking off the volkswagen board and is using the unions to dilute the influence of his porsche relatives in vw company affairs . bildunterschrift : the demonstration was against the vw law , but directed at the unpopular porsche ceo no holy cows " the vw patriarch is escalating a conflict in which he should be acting as mediator , " wrote the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .

piech is holding a company with 330,000 employees hostage just because he does n't like the attitude of one manager . " piech has a record of collaborating with unions to get rid of management .

representatives from the two regions will meet to discuss possible cooperation on energy security . a main aim of the paris meeting on thursday , sept .
18 , is to establish lasting partnerships on security issues between the eu and the five central asian states kyrgystan , kazakhstan , uzbekistan , turkmenistan and tajikistan . against the background of the situation in the caucasus and afghanistan the two sides will hold consultations on combating terror , the fight against human and drug trafficking , as well as on energy and environmental security . many eyes on central asia the region between china , russia , afghanistan and iran is rich in natural resources . for europe , the development of central asia 's gas reserves via turkey and georgia , bypassing russia and iran , represents increased energy security . russia , the supplier of much of europe 's gas and oil , would like to exploit the central asian nations ' reserves for itself while china is increasingly stilling its thirst for energy in the region .
the united states is also keen to secure access to the resources for its own companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the btc pipeline is 1,800 kilometers -lrb- 1,118 miles -rrb- long turkey exerts considerable influence in the region on account of its ethnic and linguistic ties with the turkic peoples of central asia and its involvement in the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan -lrb- btc -rrb- oil pipeline . the pipeline connects oilfields in azerbaijan with shipping terminals in turkey via georgia .
but russia fears that the btc pipeline and plans for another one like it undermine its status as an energy-superpower . energy stability remains a challenge in a report published in may 2007 , the international crisis group came to the conclusion that " central asia is likely to see energy create instability within the region ; the chances are low that it will be a factor in improving european energy security any time soon . " the paris forum aims to overcome such gloomy predictions and has been convened expressly with the aim of fostering cooperation that will help defuse conflicts within the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been the motor for this meeting the meeting is being attended by representatives of the 27 member states of the eu as well as from the five central asian states . representatives from the eu commission , turkey , china , japan and russia are also present . afghanistan is there as an observer country , given its geographical proximity and the problems it shares with countries from the region . the european union strategy for central asia came into being in june 2007 on the instigation of germany which then held the rotating eu presidency and designated cooperation with central asia as an issue of top priority for the eu . dw staff -lrb- srh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she said the us and europe have to show moscow it is internationally isolating itself . the united states and european union have to stand up to moscow 's " bullying " and keep russia from benefiting from its military move into georgia , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice said in a harshly-worded speech on thursday . " we can not afford to validate the prejudices that some russian leaders seem to have : that if you pressure free nations enough , if you bully , and threaten , and lash out we will cave in , and forget , and eventually concede , " rice said according to excerpts released in advance by the state department .
" the united states and europe must stand up to this kind of behavior , and all who champion it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice 's comments are the harshest yet heard from the us government in her first major speech on russia since its military incursion into georgia last month , rice also said the russia-georgia war would not achieve the strategic objective moscow had hoped for . " russia 's leaders will not accomplish their primary war aim of removing georgia 's government , " she said .
" our strategic goal now is to make it clear to russia 's leaders that their choices are putting russia on a one-way path to self-imposed isolation and international irrelevance . " rice said the united states and europe must not allow russia 's " aggression " against the georgian government of president mikhail saakashvili to achieve any benefit . she said russia 's bid to join the world trade organization was now in question , as well as its attempt to join the organization of economic cooperation and development . russian forces drove deep into georgia in august after repelling an attempt by tbilisi to retake separatist south ossetia .
moscow then recognized south ossetia and separatist region abkhazia as independent states . no country except nicaragua has followed suit . georgia monitor mission talks freeze bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is demanding that south ossetian authorities decide on the osce mission rice 's comments came as talks on sending more monitors to georgia broke down because of disputes with russia on where they should be deployed , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said thursday . " we do n't see the point of continuing negotiations in vienna at this stage .
they have been put on hold .
the area of responsibility for monitors is the main sticking point , " said antti turunen of finland , currently chairing the policymaking permanent council of the 56-nation osce . " this is no longer , for the time being , a matter for diplomats , " said osce spokesman martin nesirky .
" this is elevated to the political level and needs to be dealt with in capitals . " georgia 's osce envoy blamed russia 's refusal to let monitors into breakaway south ossetia and moscow 's demand that local authorities should decide the future osce mandate because it now considers the region " independent . " russian envoy anvar azimov said south ossetia was loath to let monitors back in because , it said , they had failed to alert them to georgia 's offensive to wrest back the region , and so they should be stationed in territory " from which the aggression came . " " they did not inform south ossetian authorities about the possible aggression , they did not prevent this aggression , " he said . russian forces to stay : kouchner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diplomacy alone may not be able to shift russian forces from south ossetia or abkhazia france 's foreign minister said the world should not expect russia to pull out of georgia 's two breakaway provinces anytime soon . bernard kouchner 's comment was the clearest sign yet that the european union may be accepting the possibility that georgia will not regain control of south ossetia or abkhazia .
russia plans to station nearly 8,000 troops for a long-term stay in the two regions . asked by france-culture radio whether russia troops would pull back to georgia 's internationally recognized borders , kouchner replied : " no , i do n't think so .

representatives from the two regions will meet to discuss possible cooperation on energy security . a main aim of the paris meeting on thursday , sept .
18 , is to establish lasting partnerships on security issues between the eu and the five central asian states kyrgystan , kazakhstan , uzbekistan , turkmenistan and tajikistan . against the background of the situation in the caucasus and afghanistan the two sides will hold consultations on combating terror , the fight against human and drug trafficking , as well as on energy and environmental security . many eyes on central asia the region between china , russia , afghanistan and iran is rich in natural resources . for europe , the development of central asia 's gas reserves via turkey and georgia , bypassing russia and iran , represents increased energy security . russia , the supplier of much of europe 's gas and oil , would like to exploit the central asian nations ' reserves for itself while china is increasingly stilling its thirst for energy in the region .
the united states is also keen to secure access to the resources for its own companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the btc pipeline is 1,800 kilometers -lrb- 1,118 miles -rrb- long turkey exerts considerable influence in the region on account of its ethnic and linguistic ties with the turkic peoples of central asia and its involvement in the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan -lrb- btc -rrb- oil pipeline . the pipeline connects oilfields in azerbaijan with shipping terminals in turkey via georgia .
but russia fears that the btc pipeline and plans for another one like it undermine its status as an energy-superpower . energy stability remains a challenge in a report published in may 2007 , the international crisis group came to the conclusion that " central asia is likely to see energy create instability within the region ; the chances are low that it will be a factor in improving european energy security any time soon . " the paris forum aims to overcome such gloomy predictions and has been convened expressly with the aim of fostering cooperation that will help defuse conflicts within the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been the motor for this meeting the meeting is being attended by representatives of the 27 member states of the eu as well as from the five central asian states . representatives from the eu commission , turkey , china , japan and russia are also present . afghanistan is there as an observer country , given its geographical proximity and the problems it shares with countries from the region . the european union strategy for central asia came into being in june 2007 on the instigation of germany which then held the rotating eu presidency and designated cooperation with central asia as an issue of top priority for the eu . dw staff -lrb- srh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an investigatory committee questioned two intelligence agents accused of aiding the us . two german spies in baghdad actively supported the 2003 us invasion of iraq despite government denials , opposition parties said . the politicians made their comments were before the two intelligence agents gave testimony behind closed doors to a parliamentary panel on thursday , sept .
18 . contradictory evidence " the records unfortunately contradict completely the government 's position that it was not involved , " norman paech , a member of the investigative committee from the left party , told reuters news service before the hearing . a federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- fact-finding commission on the iraq war has begun investigating the role played by current foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in the invasion . the bnd debriefed two agents in baghdad who they believe passed " relevant war data " to the bnd headquarters in pullach .
that information was then sent to us headquarters in qatar , the bnd said . embarrassment for steinmeier the issue could prove embarrassing to steinmeier , the social democrats ' candidate for chancellor in next year 's elections .
as head of the chancellery under schroeder , it was steinmeier who oversaw intelligence operations at the time of the us invasion that toppled saddam hussein . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could steinmeier be facing a scandal ?
the case caused uproar when it leaked out in early 2006 , because both the german government and public opinion strongly opposed the us invasion .
then-chancellor schroeder tapped this anti-war sentiment to win a close election in 2002 . peach and fellow committee member hans-christian stroebele from the opposition green party said the spies in baghdad passed on information about expected resistance and coordinates for military positions that were subsequently bombed . information on bombing raids it was unclear whether steinmeier was aware of these activities , stroebele told reuters . max stadler from the free-market liberal fdp said it was important not to leap to conclusions , but that the spies had fed information on the effectiveness of bombing raids . in one case , us bombers struck an iraqi officers club twice in four days after getting feedback from the agents . the social democrats , now coalition partners with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives , rejected accusations that the spies ' work had led directly to military action . " no evidence for this has been presented so far , " spd delegate michael hartmann told reuters . response from steinmeier steinmeier said in a newspaper interview that the public would not buy the argument that the presence of two bnd spies in iraq was enough " to make germany a warring party after the fact . " germany 's spy chief and the agents had assured members of parliament in january 2006 that they did not help the united states pick out bombing targets during the invasion of iraq , but that failed to halt demands for an inquiry . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he did n't get paid for sharing his knowledge of the music industry with leaders of the 27-country bloc . on wednesday , sept .
17 , the rolling stones ' lead singer joined the chief executive officers of apple , emi , ebay , fiat , louis vuitton and other multinationals for a meeting in brussels with the eu 's competition commissioner neelie kroes .
sir mick and his partners were appointed as unpaid consultants to assist kroes in improving the workings of europe 's online retailing market .
no details of wednesday 's closed-door meeting emerged .
but jagger , 65 , was expected to have offered his expertise on the distribution and sale of music .
kroes has recently expressed concern that there are still too many unjustified barriers within europe to the sale of music and other multimedia content over the internet .
last year , for instance , eu regulators accused apple and other major record labels of breaching eu law by limiting consumers ' choices in buying music online .
and until recently , apple 's itunes stores in britain set higher prices for music downloads than in the 15 eu countries which share the euro .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 18.09.2008 spd mulls supporting new law on late-term abortions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu wants more counselling for women facing late-term abortion germany 's conservative cdu has retracted its planned motion to amend the country 's laws on late-term abortions in order to give its coalition partner , the spd , time to consider adding its support . both coalition groups have confirmed to the passauer neue presse newspaper that the social democrats are taking time to consider a christian democrat motion that would tighten the laws regulating late-term abortions in germany .
despite several past attempts , the two coalition partners have never managed to find a common position on late-term abortions .
a late-term abortion is a termination which is carried out after the 20th week in a pregnancy when there is a risk to the physical or mental health of the mother .
most late-term abortions are carried out when prenatal diagnosis reveals that the fetus has a severe disability .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the cdu 's motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counselling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , spd : " i can see supporting this motion . "

despite several past attempts , the two coalition partners have never managed to find a common position on late-term abortions .
a late-term abortion is a termination which is carried out after the 20th week in a pregnancy when there is a risk to the physical or mental health of the mother .
most late-term abortions are carried out when prenatal diagnosis reveals that the fetus has a severe disability .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the cdu 's motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counselling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .

she said the us and europe have to show moscow it is internationally isolating itself . the united states and european union have to stand up to moscow 's " bullying " and keep russia from benefiting from its military move into georgia , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice said in a harshly-worded speech on thursday . " we can not afford to validate the prejudices that some russian leaders seem to have : that if you pressure free nations enough , if you bully , and threaten , and lash out we will cave in , and forget , and eventually concede , " rice said according to excerpts released in advance by the state department .
" the united states and europe must stand up to this kind of behavior , and all who champion it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice 's comments are the harshest yet heard from the us government in her first major speech on russia since its military incursion into georgia last month , rice also said the russia-georgia war would not achieve the strategic objective moscow had hoped for . " russia 's leaders will not accomplish their primary war aim of removing georgia 's government , " she said .
" our strategic goal now is to make it clear to russia 's leaders that their choices are putting russia on a one-way path to self-imposed isolation and international irrelevance . " rice said the united states and europe must not allow russia 's " aggression " against the georgian government of president mikhail saakashvili to achieve any benefit . she said russia 's bid to join the world trade organization was now in question , as well as its attempt to join the organization of economic cooperation and development . russian forces drove deep into georgia in august after repelling an attempt by tbilisi to retake separatist south ossetia .
moscow then recognized south ossetia and separatist region abkhazia as independent states . no country except nicaragua has followed suit . georgia monitor mission talks freeze bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is demanding that south ossetian authorities decide on the osce mission rice 's comments came as talks on sending more monitors to georgia broke down because of disputes with russia on where they should be deployed , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said thursday . " we do n't see the point of continuing negotiations in vienna at this stage .
they have been put on hold .
the area of responsibility for monitors is the main sticking point , " said antti turunen of finland , currently chairing the policymaking permanent council of the 56-nation osce . " this is no longer , for the time being , a matter for diplomats , " said osce spokesman martin nesirky .
" this is elevated to the political level and needs to be dealt with in capitals . " georgia 's osce envoy blamed russia 's refusal to let monitors into breakaway south ossetia and moscow 's demand that local authorities should decide the future osce mandate because it now considers the region " independent . " russian envoy anvar azimov said south ossetia was loath to let monitors back in because , it said , they had failed to alert them to georgia 's offensive to wrest back the region , and so they should be stationed in territory " from which the aggression came . " " they did not inform south ossetian authorities about the possible aggression , they did not prevent this aggression , " he said . russian forces to stay : kouchner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diplomacy alone may not be able to shift russian forces from south ossetia or abkhazia france 's foreign minister said the world should not expect russia to pull out of georgia 's two breakaway provinces anytime soon . bernard kouchner 's comment was the clearest sign yet that the european union may be accepting the possibility that georgia will not regain control of south ossetia or abkhazia .
russia plans to station nearly 8,000 troops for a long-term stay in the two regions . asked by france-culture radio whether russia troops would pull back to georgia 's internationally recognized borders , kouchner replied : " no , i do n't think so .

the deal was due to be formally announced thursday .
it had been explicitly backed by the government and was seen as an attempt to prevent the collapse of hbos -lrb- halifax bank of scotland -rrb- , analysts said .
" the key thing is to maintain stability in the banking system , " treasury secretary alistair darling said about the negotiations wednesday .
analysts in the city of london , the capital 's financial district , said there were concerns over competition issues and the apparent haste with which the deal was struck .
" in normal circumstances , this would not have happened , " said one .
merger to create britain 's largest bank the merger is expected to create a bank with a market value of 30 billion pounds , by far the biggest in britain .
it would have 38 million customers and 142,000 employees .
hbos , which has seen its share price fall by 50 percent since the credit crunch began a year ago , suffered badly from the fallout of monday 's lehman brothers collapse , with predators in the city pouncing on its vulnerability as a major mortgage lender .
analysts said the government had feared that hbos would become a " northern rock mark 2 " - after the collapse last year of british mortgage lender northern rock , which was nationalized in january .
on the london market wednesday , hbos shares fluctuated wildly , climbing as high as 220 pence and falling as low as 88 pence .
analysts said the government-backed merger talks were accelerated after hbos voiced concerns that depositors and lenders had begun to withdraw their credit from the bank .
" there were growing concerns in the hbos boardroom that a climate of fear was being created about its future that could have led to a funding crisis - or a northern rock-style run - on steroids , " said one .
" it was not in the government 's interest for there to be the faintest risk that it would have another northern rock on its hands . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

international drug ring us authorities in washington said 175 of the arrests were of individual suspected of participating in the gulf cartel drug smuggling ring .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 18.09.2008 pressure mounts on german bank after mistaken payment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some opposition politicians are making hay from kfw 's troubles amid growing outrage over the planned bailout of a subsidiary and a mistaken money transfer , pressure is mounting on germany 's kfw development bank . amid the damaging fallout from the us banking crisis , german state development bank kfw has come under increased criticism from several of its own supervisory board members .
one lawmaker has called for the " total reform " of kfw in the wake of a major payment error , while another has raised doubts about the costly bailout of crippled subsidiary ikb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the ikb bailout be less than certain ?
late thursday , sept .
18 , the kfw board is slated to meet in berlin for a formal vote to approve the sale of ikb deutsche industriebank , a subsidiary of kfw that was hit hard in by subprime mortgage exposure in the us , to us financial investor lone star .
seeking explanation for transfer the bank 's supervisory board , largely composed of german parliamentarians , will use that meeting to hear an explanation of kfw 's mistaken transfer of 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .
kfw declared the transfer , part of a swap arrangement , a " technical blunder . "
but critics said they should have held on to the money , knowing from sunday news reports that lehman was broke .
swaps are often programmed in advance into computers so that they happen without human intervention .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig said the remittance was " infuriating " and those to blame must be found , but an aide to economics minister michael glos - who currently sits at the head the kfw supervisory board - said it was too early to say if anyone would be punished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why did kfw send a payment to bankrupt firm ?
ahead of the meeting thursday , opposition parliamentarian and kfw supervisory board member juergen koppelin called for a total reform of the german state development bank .
he said he feared that losses through the faulty bank transfer could add up to far more than the 300 million euros already known .
lawmaker : ' total reform ' is needed " i think the consequence should be total reform , " koppelin told ard television news on thursday .
the supervisory board should be made smaller , and a fact-finding commission should be established to explain the error , he said .
another problem is that supervisory board members are not well enough informed by the kfw management board , he said .
that subject is also likely to be on the agenda at thursday afternoon 's final vote to approve the sale of kfw 's troubled subsidiary ikb to us financial investor lone star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos : too soon to say who will be punished while the deal is considered certain , green party politican and kfw supervisory board member christine scheel complained to the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that she and the other supervisory board members feel they have n't been adequately informed about the terms of the sale agreement .
20 questions for michael glos " i can not imagine that we can comprehend and decide upon such a complex deal in the form of a hand-out or , worse , a verbal explanation , " she told the paper .
scheel accused supervisory board leader michael glos of denying the supervisory board members any actual decision-making power by withholding the information .
she demanded that glos and kfw chairman ulrich schroeder answer 20 detailed questions on the sale .
set up in 1948 to administer marshall plan funds , kfw is the german federal government 's in-house bank and lends to home-owners and industry . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and he 's also having some family problems . wolfgang porsche , who in addition to being the chairman of the german luxury carmaker that bears his name also happens to be one of piech 's cousins , is trying to unseat piech by buying up vw stock through porsche 's holding company .
the company currently owns 35 percent of vw ordinary stock and has plans to increase its share to over 50 percent in november . unwilling to relinquish control to porsche without a fight , piech decided , unexpectedly , not to show up for a board meeting over technical cooperation between porsche and vw 's upscale audi division last week . bildunterschrift : piech maintains a dual role as supervisory board chairman of vw and porsche heir the chairman 's absence gave the balance of power to the board 's workers representatives in a vote that ended in a tie and leaves porsche having to seek board approval for any cooperation with audi . when blood 's not thicker than water but the symbolic implications of the vote - and piech 's tacit support for the unions over his family - reverberated beyond the boardroom .
while it was not unusual for piech to take the side of the unions , that he did so in public against his own family was a precedent , said a former volkswagen manager , who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity . the normally reserved wolfgang porsche told germany 's focus magazine , " ferdinand is ruining the whole family .

the state has only a 20 percent equity stake in volkswagen , but exercises enormous voting power thanks to the vw law , which gives the government veto power on major company decisions . workers were also nervous about porsche 's harsh management tactics with union leaders concerned about job cuts if porsche gains complete control of vw . volkswagen is by far lower saxony 's largest employer and state premier christian wulff , who also sits on the vw supervisory board , is looking to keep his state 's job motor humming , which aligns him with piech and unions . german newspapers have been speculating that piech now wants to get porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking off the volkswagen board and is using the unions to dilute the influence of his porsche relatives in vw company affairs . bildunterschrift : the demonstration was against the vw law , but directed at the unpopular porsche ceo no holy cows " the vw patriarch is escalating a conflict in which he should be acting as mediator , " wrote the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .

and he 's also having some family problems . wolfgang porsche , who in addition to being the chairman of the german luxury carmaker that bears his name also happens to be one of piech 's cousins , is trying to unseat piech by buying up vw stock through porsche 's holding company .
the company currently owns 35 percent of vw ordinary stock and has plans to increase its share to over 50 percent in november . unwilling to relinquish control to porsche without a fight , piech decided , unexpectedly , not to show up for a board meeting over technical cooperation between porsche and vw 's upscale audi division last week . bildunterschrift : piech maintains a dual role as supervisory board chairman of vw and porsche heir the chairman 's absence gave the balance of power to the board 's workers representatives in a vote that ended in a tie and leaves porsche having to seek board approval for any cooperation with audi . when blood 's not thicker than water but the symbolic implications of the vote - and piech 's tacit support for the unions over his family - reverberated beyond the boardroom .
while it was not unusual for piech to take the side of the unions , that he did so in public against his own family was a precedent , said a former volkswagen manager , who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity . the normally reserved wolfgang porsche told germany 's focus magazine , " ferdinand is ruining the whole family .
this is unbelievable . " the conflict has advanced to a point where porsche has admitted there are plans to dethrone piech . " it 's not a matter anymore of whether he 's going or not .
but when and how , " said porsche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang porsche now -lrb- left -rrb- wants to unseat piech -lrb- right -rrb- unseating piech from vw 's 20-member supervisory board , however , will prove difficult , since the chairman enjoys support from labor unions . piech , unions vs. porsche , management last week some 40,000 union workers demonstrated outside vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg to protest against changing the controversial vw law . the state of lower saxony , where vw is based , also has a say in the family feud .
the state has only a 20 percent equity stake in volkswagen , but exercises enormous voting power thanks to the vw law , which gives the government veto power on major company decisions . workers were also nervous about porsche 's harsh management tactics with union leaders concerned about job cuts if porsche gains complete control of vw . volkswagen is by far lower saxony 's largest employer and state premier christian wulff , who also sits on the vw supervisory board , is looking to keep his state 's job motor humming , which aligns him with piech and unions . german newspapers have been speculating that piech now wants to get porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking off the volkswagen board and is using the unions to dilute the influence of his porsche relatives in vw company affairs . bildunterschrift : the demonstration was against the vw law , but directed at the unpopular porsche ceo no holy cows " the vw patriarch is escalating a conflict in which he should be acting as mediator , " wrote the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" above all he is hostile to wiedeking , who has become too powerful for his taste .
piech is holding a company with 330,000 employees hostage just because he does n't like the attitude of one manager . " piech has a record of collaborating with unions to get rid of management .
in 2006 he worked to oust then ceo bernd pischetsrieder , who got word he was fired through the press . piech sees himself as a visionary with a management style very much at odds with wiedeking 's approach to business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking -lrb- left -rrb- and piech -lrb- right -rrb- have different visions for vw " piech sees his vision endangered by wiedeking , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen .
" wiedeking said that there are no holy cows at vw , no more phaetons , no more bugattis . " there was always a cease-fire between piech and the porsches , but now it 's war .
wiedeking is destroying piech 's shining vision , " dudenhoeffer added . cease-fire turns to war for piech , profits are secondary to spectacular engineering feats , according to christoph stuermer , an auto analyst for global insight in frankfurt who has followed volkswagen and porsche for years . " piech is one of the most gifted car engineers on the planet , " he said .
" he wants to be the living michelangelo of cars . " piech 's talents have been profitable for volkswagen .
the company earned 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in profits on a turnover of 109 billion euros last year , surpassed ford to become no. 3 in the world in unit sales and is the globe 's most diverse automaker with brands including scania , seat , skoda , audi , bentley , lamborghini and bugatti . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : granddad ferdinand porsche designed the vw beetle but despite the overall profits and name recognition , it 's piech 's pet projects that irritate wiedeking most , stuermer said . " wiedeking is a porsche ceo from another corporate culture , " he said .
" he 's out to maximize profits by cutting costs and he snubbed everyone , telling off vw management , interfering with their way of doing business . " perhaps ferdinand " ferry " porsche , the namesake son of the man who developed the vw beetle and piech 's uncle , had the right idea in the 1970s when he said all porsche and piech family members working at porsche had to leave management to outsiders because of family squabbles . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 18.09.2008 pressure mounts on german bank after mistaken payment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some opposition politicians are making hay from kfw 's troubles amid growing outrage over the planned bailout of a subsidiary and a mistaken money transfer , pressure is mounting on germany 's kfw development bank . amid the damaging fallout from the us banking crisis , german state development bank kfw has come under increased criticism from several of its own supervisory board members .
one lawmaker has called for the " total reform " of kfw in the wake of a major payment error , while another has raised doubts about the costly bailout of crippled subsidiary ikb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the ikb bailout be less than certain ?
late thursday , sept .
18 , the kfw board is slated to meet in berlin for a formal vote to approve the sale of ikb deutsche industriebank , a subsidiary of kfw that was hit hard in by subprime mortgage exposure in the us , to us financial investor lone star .
seeking explanation for transfer the bank 's supervisory board , largely composed of german parliamentarians , will use that meeting to hear an explanation of kfw 's mistaken transfer of 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .
kfw declared the transfer , part of a swap arrangement , a " technical blunder . "
but critics said they should have held on to the money , knowing from sunday news reports that lehman was broke .
swaps are often programmed in advance into computers so that they happen without human intervention .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig said the remittance was " infuriating " and those to blame must be found , but an aide to economics minister michael glos - who currently sits at the head the kfw supervisory board - said it was too early to say if anyone would be punished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why did kfw send a payment to bankrupt firm ?
ahead of the meeting thursday , opposition parliamentarian and kfw supervisory board member juergen koppelin called for a total reform of the german state development bank .
he said he feared that losses through the faulty bank transfer could add up to far more than the 300 million euros already known .
lawmaker : ' total reform ' is needed " i think the consequence should be total reform , " koppelin told ard television news on thursday .
the supervisory board should be made smaller , and a fact-finding commission should be established to explain the error , he said .
another problem is that supervisory board members are not well enough informed by the kfw management board , he said .
that subject is also likely to be on the agenda at thursday afternoon 's final vote to approve the sale of kfw 's troubled subsidiary ikb to us financial investor lone star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos : too soon to say who will be punished while the deal is considered certain , green party politican and kfw supervisory board member christine scheel complained to the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that she and the other supervisory board members feel they have n't been adequately informed about the terms of the sale agreement .
20 questions for michael glos " i can not imagine that we can comprehend and decide upon such a complex deal in the form of a hand-out or , worse , a verbal explanation , " she told the paper .
scheel accused supervisory board leader michael glos of denying the supervisory board members any actual decision-making power by withholding the information .
she demanded that glos and kfw chairman ulrich schroeder answer 20 detailed questions on the sale .
set up in 1948 to administer marshall plan funds , kfw is the german federal government 's in-house bank and lends to home-owners and industry . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she said the us and europe have to show moscow it is internationally isolating itself . the united states and european union have to stand up to moscow 's " bullying " and keep russia from benefiting from its military move into georgia , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice said in a harshly-worded speech on thursday . " we can not afford to validate the prejudices that some russian leaders seem to have : that if you pressure free nations enough , if you bully , and threaten , and lash out we will cave in , and forget , and eventually concede , " rice said according to excerpts released in advance by the state department .
" the united states and europe must stand up to this kind of behavior , and all who champion it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice 's comments are the harshest yet heard from the us government in her first major speech on russia since its military incursion into georgia last month , rice also said the russia-georgia war would not achieve the strategic objective moscow had hoped for . " russia 's leaders will not accomplish their primary war aim of removing georgia 's government , " she said .
" our strategic goal now is to make it clear to russia 's leaders that their choices are putting russia on a one-way path to self-imposed isolation and international irrelevance . " rice said the united states and europe must not allow russia 's " aggression " against the georgian government of president mikhail saakashvili to achieve any benefit . she said russia 's bid to join the world trade organization was now in question , as well as its attempt to join the organization of economic cooperation and development . russian forces drove deep into georgia in august after repelling an attempt by tbilisi to retake separatist south ossetia .
moscow then recognized south ossetia and separatist region abkhazia as independent states . no country except nicaragua has followed suit . georgia monitor mission talks freeze bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is demanding that south ossetian authorities decide on the osce mission rice 's comments came as talks on sending more monitors to georgia broke down because of disputes with russia on where they should be deployed , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said thursday . " we do n't see the point of continuing negotiations in vienna at this stage .
they have been put on hold .
the area of responsibility for monitors is the main sticking point , " said antti turunen of finland , currently chairing the policymaking permanent council of the 56-nation osce . " this is no longer , for the time being , a matter for diplomats , " said osce spokesman martin nesirky .
" this is elevated to the political level and needs to be dealt with in capitals . " georgia 's osce envoy blamed russia 's refusal to let monitors into breakaway south ossetia and moscow 's demand that local authorities should decide the future osce mandate because it now considers the region " independent . " russian envoy anvar azimov said south ossetia was loath to let monitors back in because , it said , they had failed to alert them to georgia 's offensive to wrest back the region , and so they should be stationed in territory " from which the aggression came . " " they did not inform south ossetian authorities about the possible aggression , they did not prevent this aggression , " he said . russian forces to stay : kouchner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diplomacy alone may not be able to shift russian forces from south ossetia or abkhazia france 's foreign minister said the world should not expect russia to pull out of georgia 's two breakaway provinces anytime soon . bernard kouchner 's comment was the clearest sign yet that the european union may be accepting the possibility that georgia will not regain control of south ossetia or abkhazia .
russia plans to station nearly 8,000 troops for a long-term stay in the two regions . asked by france-culture radio whether russia troops would pull back to georgia 's internationally recognized borders , kouchner replied : " no , i do n't think so .

she said the us and europe have to show moscow it is internationally isolating itself . the united states and european union have to stand up to moscow 's " bullying " and keep russia from benefiting from its military move into georgia , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice said in a harshly-worded speech on thursday . " we can not afford to validate the prejudices that some russian leaders seem to have : that if you pressure free nations enough , if you bully , and threaten , and lash out we will cave in , and forget , and eventually concede , " rice said according to excerpts released in advance by the state department .
" the united states and europe must stand up to this kind of behavior , and all who champion it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice 's comments are the harshest yet heard from the us government in her first major speech on russia since its military incursion into georgia last month , rice also said the russia-georgia war would not achieve the strategic objective moscow had hoped for . " russia 's leaders will not accomplish their primary war aim of removing georgia 's government , " she said .
" our strategic goal now is to make it clear to russia 's leaders that their choices are putting russia on a one-way path to self-imposed isolation and international irrelevance . " rice said the united states and europe must not allow russia 's " aggression " against the georgian government of president mikhail saakashvili to achieve any benefit . she said russia 's bid to join the world trade organization was now in question , as well as its attempt to join the organization of economic cooperation and development . russian forces drove deep into georgia in august after repelling an attempt by tbilisi to retake separatist south ossetia .
moscow then recognized south ossetia and separatist region abkhazia as independent states . no country except nicaragua has followed suit . georgia monitor mission talks freeze bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is demanding that south ossetian authorities decide on the osce mission rice 's comments came as talks on sending more monitors to georgia broke down because of disputes with russia on where they should be deployed , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said thursday . " we do n't see the point of continuing negotiations in vienna at this stage .
they have been put on hold .
the area of responsibility for monitors is the main sticking point , " said antti turunen of finland , currently chairing the policymaking permanent council of the 56-nation osce . " this is no longer , for the time being , a matter for diplomats , " said osce spokesman martin nesirky .
" this is elevated to the political level and needs to be dealt with in capitals . " georgia 's osce envoy blamed russia 's refusal to let monitors into breakaway south ossetia and moscow 's demand that local authorities should decide the future osce mandate because it now considers the region " independent . " russian envoy anvar azimov said south ossetia was loath to let monitors back in because , it said , they had failed to alert them to georgia 's offensive to wrest back the region , and so they should be stationed in territory " from which the aggression came . " " they did not inform south ossetian authorities about the possible aggression , they did not prevent this aggression , " he said . russian forces to stay : kouchner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diplomacy alone may not be able to shift russian forces from south ossetia or abkhazia france 's foreign minister said the world should not expect russia to pull out of georgia 's two breakaway provinces anytime soon . bernard kouchner 's comment was the clearest sign yet that the european union may be accepting the possibility that georgia will not regain control of south ossetia or abkhazia .
russia plans to station nearly 8,000 troops for a long-term stay in the two regions . asked by france-culture radio whether russia troops would pull back to georgia 's internationally recognized borders , kouchner replied : " no , i do n't think so .

the index is to be distributed among leading archives to help descendants research the fate of their families .
the government said wednesday , sept .
17 , that it would give the list to israel 's yad vashem holocaust memorial , washington 's holocaust museum , the jewish claims conference and the international tracing service in bad arolsen , germany .
not released to the public privacy laws prevent the full release of the list to the public as yet .
the list is not definitive and will require more work to make it more accurate , said officials from germany 's remembrance , responsibility and future foundation , which compiled it .
the list was drawn up over a period of four years .
the government and a foundation that oversaw the compensation of nazi-era slave laborers provided 1.57 million euros -lrb- $ 2.24 million -rrb- to finance the project .
it constitutes another step towards the " reconstruction of the jewish identity , " said foundation director guenter saathoff .
between 500,000 and 550,000 jews lived in germany before 1933 .
by the end of the war , there were only some 20,000 jews living in the country , but most of these were not of german origin .
most were eastern european holocaust survivors who had ended up in german displaced persons camps . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one lawmaker has called for the " total reform " of kfw in the wake of a major payment error , while another has raised doubts about the costly bailout of crippled subsidiary ikb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the ikb bailout be less than certain ?
late thursday , sept .
18 , the kfw board is slated to meet in berlin for a formal vote to approve the sale of ikb deutsche industriebank , a subsidiary of kfw that was hit hard in by subprime mortgage exposure in the us , to us financial investor lone star .
seeking explanation for transfer the bank 's supervisory board , largely composed of german parliamentarians , will use that meeting to hear an explanation of kfw 's mistaken transfer of 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .
kfw declared the transfer , part of a swap arrangement , a " technical blunder . "
but critics said they should have held on to the money , knowing from sunday news reports that lehman was broke .
swaps are often programmed in advance into computers so that they happen without human intervention .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig said the remittance was " infuriating " and those to blame must be found , but an aide to economics minister michael glos - who currently sits at the head the kfw supervisory board - said it was too early to say if anyone would be punished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why did kfw send a payment to bankrupt firm ?
ahead of the meeting thursday , opposition parliamentarian and kfw supervisory board member juergen koppelin called for a total reform of the german state development bank .
he said he feared that losses through the faulty bank transfer could add up to far more than the 300 million euros already known .
lawmaker : ' total reform ' is needed " i think the consequence should be total reform , " koppelin told ard television news on thursday .
the supervisory board should be made smaller , and a fact-finding commission should be established to explain the error , he said .
another problem is that supervisory board members are not well enough informed by the kfw management board , he said .
that subject is also likely to be on the agenda at thursday afternoon 's final vote to approve the sale of kfw 's troubled subsidiary ikb to us financial investor lone star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos : too soon to say who will be punished while the deal is considered certain , green party politican and kfw supervisory board member christine scheel complained to the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that she and the other supervisory board members feel they have n't been adequately informed about the terms of the sale agreement .
20 questions for michael glos " i can not imagine that we can comprehend and decide upon such a complex deal in the form of a hand-out or , worse , a verbal explanation , " she told the paper .
scheel accused supervisory board leader michael glos of denying the supervisory board members any actual decision-making power by withholding the information .
she demanded that glos and kfw chairman ulrich schroeder answer 20 detailed questions on the sale .
set up in 1948 to administer marshall plan funds , kfw is the german federal government 's in-house bank and lends to home-owners and industry . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 18.09.2008 spd mulls supporting new law on late-term abortions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu wants more counselling for women facing late-term abortion germany 's conservative cdu has retracted its planned motion to amend the country 's laws on late-term abortions in order to give its coalition partner , the spd , time to consider adding its support . both coalition groups have confirmed to the passauer neue presse newspaper that the social democrats are taking time to consider a christian democrat motion that would tighten the laws regulating late-term abortions in germany .
despite several past attempts , the two coalition partners have never managed to find a common position on late-term abortions .
a late-term abortion is a termination which is carried out after the 20th week in a pregnancy when there is a risk to the physical or mental health of the mother .
most late-term abortions are carried out when prenatal diagnosis reveals that the fetus has a severe disability .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the cdu 's motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counselling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , spd : " i can see supporting this motion . "
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law would foresee a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .
mixed views within spd " that the spd is once again thinking about supporting our motion is an encouraging signal , " said johannes singhammer , the conservatives ' parliamentary spokesman on family affairs .
but within the spd , opinion is still split .
" i can see supporting this motion , " said renate schmidt , the spd 's former minister for family affairs .
but the social democrats ' deputy parliamentary group head , christel humme , speaks for others in the party who say that there is no need for new abortion legislation .
in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio , she said that , if anything , women should receive such counseling earlier on in their pregnancy before they are confronted with the knowledge that they are carrying a potentially disabled fetus .
" many women have said to me that if they had only known what was coming their way , then they might not have had amniocentesis done , for example , " humme said .
the spd 's former coalition partner , the green party , is against the cdu 's motion , calling it unnecessary .
neither the threat of a fine for doctors nor an increase in paperwork will help women who find themselves in a very difficult situation , said the green 's spokeswoman for women 's issues , irmingard schewe-gerigk . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iqbal haider , co-chairperson of the independent human rights commission of pakistan , estimates : " the overall figure is now definitely exceeding one million , including the displaced persons of balochistan and the frontier province .
i am astonished that the world conscience is silent on this very , very serious issue .
they help the afghan refugees in pakistan , but they are least bothered about the pathetic condition of the internally displaced persons ! "
new us strategy the military campaign against the taliban has been stepped up over the last few months , amid stronger pressure from washington .
both the new york times and the sunday times of london have reported that us president bush felt compelled to demonstrated his strength in the face of domestic criticism , and has in fact authorized commando operations in pakistan even without prior permission by the pakistani government .
however , pakistani troops are reported to have fired on us forces earlier this week to stop an incursion .
admiral mike mullen , top commander of the us military , was promptly dispatched to islamabad to limit the damage .
but american military activities have already become extremely unpopular with the pakistani population .
for his part , human rights activist iqbal haider wonders where the the militants are getting their equipment from : " they are all equipped with all the best of lethal weapons , including anti-aircraft guns , including mortars , including rocket launchers .
how on earth can they receive an abundance of such lethal weapons which are not available in any super market of the world ?
they get it with the connivance of the us and the intelligence agencies ! "
with anti-american sentiment growing in this way throughout pakistan , it is difficult to imagine a military solution in the border region . thomas bärthlein 18/09/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 reader response feedback on kashmir , korea and other issues our readers and asia compact listeners are passionate about sending in their views .

despite several past attempts , the two coalition partners have never managed to find a common position on late-term abortions .
a late-term abortion is a termination which is carried out after the 20th week in a pregnancy when there is a risk to the physical or mental health of the mother .
most late-term abortions are carried out when prenatal diagnosis reveals that the fetus has a severe disability .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the cdu 's motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counselling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , spd : " i can see supporting this motion . "
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law would foresee a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .
mixed views within spd " that the spd is once again thinking about supporting our motion is an encouraging signal , " said johannes singhammer , the conservatives ' parliamentary spokesman on family affairs .
but within the spd , opinion is still split .
" i can see supporting this motion , " said renate schmidt , the spd 's former minister for family affairs .
but the social democrats ' deputy parliamentary group head , christel humme , speaks for others in the party who say that there is no need for new abortion legislation .
in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio , she said that , if anything , women should receive such counseling earlier on in their pregnancy before they are confronted with the knowledge that they are carrying a potentially disabled fetus .
" many women have said to me that if they had only known what was coming their way , then they might not have had amniocentesis done , for example , " humme said .
the spd 's former coalition partner , the green party , is against the cdu 's motion , calling it unnecessary .
neither the threat of a fine for doctors nor an increase in paperwork will help women who find themselves in a very difficult situation , said the green 's spokeswoman for women 's issues , irmingard schewe-gerigk . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an investigatory committee questioned two intelligence agents accused of aiding the us . two german spies in baghdad actively supported the 2003 us invasion of iraq despite government denials , opposition parties said . the politicians made their comments were before the two intelligence agents gave testimony behind closed doors to a parliamentary panel on thursday , sept .
18 . contradictory evidence " the records unfortunately contradict completely the government 's position that it was not involved , " norman paech , a member of the investigative committee from the left party , told reuters news service before the hearing . a federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- fact-finding commission on the iraq war has begun investigating the role played by current foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in the invasion . the bnd debriefed two agents in baghdad who they believe passed " relevant war data " to the bnd headquarters in pullach .
that information was then sent to us headquarters in qatar , the bnd said . embarrassment for steinmeier the issue could prove embarrassing to steinmeier , the social democrats ' candidate for chancellor in next year 's elections .
as head of the chancellery under schroeder , it was steinmeier who oversaw intelligence operations at the time of the us invasion that toppled saddam hussein . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could steinmeier be facing a scandal ?
the case caused uproar when it leaked out in early 2006 , because both the german government and public opinion strongly opposed the us invasion .
then-chancellor schroeder tapped this anti-war sentiment to win a close election in 2002 . peach and fellow committee member hans-christian stroebele from the opposition green party said the spies in baghdad passed on information about expected resistance and coordinates for military positions that were subsequently bombed . information on bombing raids it was unclear whether steinmeier was aware of these activities , stroebele told reuters . max stadler from the free-market liberal fdp said it was important not to leap to conclusions , but that the spies had fed information on the effectiveness of bombing raids . in one case , us bombers struck an iraqi officers club twice in four days after getting feedback from the agents . the social democrats , now coalition partners with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives , rejected accusations that the spies ' work had led directly to military action . " no evidence for this has been presented so far , " spd delegate michael hartmann told reuters . response from steinmeier steinmeier said in a newspaper interview that the public would not buy the argument that the presence of two bnd spies in iraq was enough " to make germany a warring party after the fact . " germany 's spy chief and the agents had assured members of parliament in january 2006 that they did not help the united states pick out bombing targets during the invasion of iraq , but that failed to halt demands for an inquiry . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and he 's also having some family problems . wolfgang porsche , who in addition to being the chairman of the german luxury carmaker that bears his name also happens to be one of piech 's cousins , is trying to unseat piech by buying up vw stock through porsche 's holding company .
the company currently owns 35 percent of vw ordinary stock and has plans to increase its share to over 50 percent in november . unwilling to relinquish control to porsche without a fight , piech decided , unexpectedly , not to show up for a board meeting over technical cooperation between porsche and vw 's upscale audi division last week . bildunterschrift : piech maintains a dual role as supervisory board chairman of vw and porsche heir the chairman 's absence gave the balance of power to the board 's workers representatives in a vote that ended in a tie and leaves porsche having to seek board approval for any cooperation with audi . when blood 's not thicker than water but the symbolic implications of the vote - and piech 's tacit support for the unions over his family - reverberated beyond the boardroom .
while it was not unusual for piech to take the side of the unions , that he did so in public against his own family was a precedent , said a former volkswagen manager , who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity . the normally reserved wolfgang porsche told germany 's focus magazine , " ferdinand is ruining the whole family .

the state has only a 20 percent equity stake in volkswagen , but exercises enormous voting power thanks to the vw law , which gives the government veto power on major company decisions . workers were also nervous about porsche 's harsh management tactics with union leaders concerned about job cuts if porsche gains complete control of vw . volkswagen is by far lower saxony 's largest employer and state premier christian wulff , who also sits on the vw supervisory board , is looking to keep his state 's job motor humming , which aligns him with piech and unions . german newspapers have been speculating that piech now wants to get porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking off the volkswagen board and is using the unions to dilute the influence of his porsche relatives in vw company affairs . bildunterschrift : the demonstration was against the vw law , but directed at the unpopular porsche ceo no holy cows " the vw patriarch is escalating a conflict in which he should be acting as mediator , " wrote the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .

piech is holding a company with 330,000 employees hostage just because he does n't like the attitude of one manager . " piech has a record of collaborating with unions to get rid of management .

while it was not unusual for piech to take the side of the unions , that he did so in public against his own family was a precedent , said a former volkswagen manager , who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity . the normally reserved wolfgang porsche told germany 's focus magazine , " ferdinand is ruining the whole family .

" russian envoy anvar azimov said south ossetia was loath to let monitors back in because , it said , they had failed to alert them to georgia 's offensive to wrest back the region , and so they should be stationed in territory " from which the aggression came .

despite several past attempts , the two coalition partners have never managed to find a common position on late-term abortions .
a late-term abortion is a termination which is carried out after the 20th week in a pregnancy when there is a risk to the physical or mental health of the mother .
most late-term abortions are carried out when prenatal diagnosis reveals that the fetus has a severe disability .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the cdu 's motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counselling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , spd : " i can see supporting this motion . "
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law would foresee a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .
mixed views within spd " that the spd is once again thinking about supporting our motion is an encouraging signal , " said johannes singhammer , the conservatives ' parliamentary spokesman on family affairs .
but within the spd , opinion is still split .
" i can see supporting this motion , " said renate schmidt , the spd 's former minister for family affairs .
but the social democrats ' deputy parliamentary group head , christel humme , speaks for others in the party who say that there is no need for new abortion legislation .
in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio , she said that , if anything , women should receive such counseling earlier on in their pregnancy before they are confronted with the knowledge that they are carrying a potentially disabled fetus .
" many women have said to me that if they had only known what was coming their way , then they might not have had amniocentesis done , for example , " humme said .
the spd 's former coalition partner , the green party , is against the cdu 's motion , calling it unnecessary .

despite several past attempts , the two coalition partners have never managed to find a common position on late-term abortions .
a late-term abortion is a termination which is carried out after the 20th week in a pregnancy when there is a risk to the physical or mental health of the mother .
most late-term abortions are carried out when prenatal diagnosis reveals that the fetus has a severe disability .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the cdu 's motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counselling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , spd : " i can see supporting this motion . "
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law would foresee a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .
mixed views within spd " that the spd is once again thinking about supporting our motion is an encouraging signal , " said johannes singhammer , the conservatives ' parliamentary spokesman on family affairs .
but within the spd , opinion is still split .
" i can see supporting this motion , " said renate schmidt , the spd 's former minister for family affairs .
but the social democrats ' deputy parliamentary group head , christel humme , speaks for others in the party who say that there is no need for new abortion legislation .
in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio , she said that , if anything , women should receive such counseling earlier on in their pregnancy before they are confronted with the knowledge that they are carrying a potentially disabled fetus .

one lawmaker has called for the " total reform " of kfw in the wake of a major payment error , while another has raised doubts about the costly bailout of crippled subsidiary ikb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the ikb bailout be less than certain ?
late thursday , sept .
18 , the kfw board is slated to meet in berlin for a formal vote to approve the sale of ikb deutsche industriebank , a subsidiary of kfw that was hit hard in by subprime mortgage exposure in the us , to us financial investor lone star .
seeking explanation for transfer the bank 's supervisory board , largely composed of german parliamentarians , will use that meeting to hear an explanation of kfw 's mistaken transfer of 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .
kfw declared the transfer , part of a swap arrangement , a " technical blunder . "
but critics said they should have held on to the money , knowing from sunday news reports that lehman was broke .
swaps are often programmed in advance into computers so that they happen without human intervention .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig said the remittance was " infuriating " and those to blame must be found , but an aide to economics minister michael glos - who currently sits at the head the kfw supervisory board - said it was too early to say if anyone would be punished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why did kfw send a payment to bankrupt firm ?
ahead of the meeting thursday , opposition parliamentarian and kfw supervisory board member juergen koppelin called for a total reform of the german state development bank .
he said he feared that losses through the faulty bank transfer could add up to far more than the 300 million euros already known .
lawmaker : ' total reform ' is needed " i think the consequence should be total reform , " koppelin told ard television news on thursday .
the supervisory board should be made smaller , and a fact-finding commission should be established to explain the error , he said .
another problem is that supervisory board members are not well enough informed by the kfw management board , he said .
that subject is also likely to be on the agenda at thursday afternoon 's final vote to approve the sale of kfw 's troubled subsidiary ikb to us financial investor lone star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos : too soon to say who will be punished while the deal is considered certain , green party politican and kfw supervisory board member christine scheel complained to the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that she and the other supervisory board members feel they have n't been adequately informed about the terms of the sale agreement .
20 questions for michael glos " i can not imagine that we can comprehend and decide upon such a complex deal in the form of a hand-out or , worse , a verbal explanation , " she told the paper .
scheel accused supervisory board leader michael glos of denying the supervisory board members any actual decision-making power by withholding the information .
she demanded that glos and kfw chairman ulrich schroeder answer 20 detailed questions on the sale .

late thursday , sept .

seeking explanation for transfer the bank 's supervisory board , largely composed of german parliamentarians , will use that meeting to hear an explanation of kfw 's mistaken transfer of 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .
kfw declared the transfer , part of a swap arrangement , a " technical blunder . "
but critics said they should have held on to the money , knowing from sunday news reports that lehman was broke .
swaps are often programmed in advance into computers so that they happen without human intervention .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig said the remittance was " infuriating " and those to blame must be found , but an aide to economics minister michael glos - who currently sits at the head the kfw supervisory board - said it was too early to say if anyone would be punished .

ahead of the meeting thursday , opposition parliamentarian and kfw supervisory board member juergen koppelin called for a total reform of the german state development bank .
he said he feared that losses through the faulty bank transfer could add up to far more than the 300 million euros already known .
lawmaker : ' total reform ' is needed " i think the consequence should be total reform , " koppelin told ard television news on thursday .
the supervisory board should be made smaller , and a fact-finding commission should be established to explain the error , he said .
another problem is that supervisory board members are not well enough informed by the kfw management board , he said .
that subject is also likely to be on the agenda at thursday afternoon 's final vote to approve the sale of kfw 's troubled subsidiary ikb to us financial investor lone star .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 18.09.2008 german carmaker family feud plays out in vw boardroom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche aims to up its stake in vw to over 50 percent later this year as family-owned porsche continues to up its stake in vw , a nasty feud has broken out between volkswagen board chairman ferdinand piech and his cousins at porsche over the future of europe 's biggest carmaker . ferdinand piech is 71 , a billionaire and a brilliant technocrat who has reached the pinnacle of the automobile industry as supervisory board chairman of volkswagen , europe 's biggest automaker .
and he 's also having some family problems . wolfgang porsche , who in addition to being the chairman of the german luxury carmaker that bears his name also happens to be one of piech 's cousins , is trying to unseat piech by buying up vw stock through porsche 's holding company .
the company currently owns 35 percent of vw ordinary stock and has plans to increase its share to over 50 percent in november . unwilling to relinquish control to porsche without a fight , piech decided , unexpectedly , not to show up for a board meeting over technical cooperation between porsche and vw 's upscale audi division last week . bildunterschrift : piech maintains a dual role as supervisory board chairman of vw and porsche heir the chairman 's absence gave the balance of power to the board 's workers representatives in a vote that ended in a tie and leaves porsche having to seek board approval for any cooperation with audi . when blood 's not thicker than water but the symbolic implications of the vote - and piech 's tacit support for the unions over his family - reverberated beyond the boardroom .
while it was not unusual for piech to take the side of the unions , that he did so in public against his own family was a precedent , said a former volkswagen manager , who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity . the normally reserved wolfgang porsche told germany 's focus magazine , " ferdinand is ruining the whole family .
this is unbelievable . " the conflict has advanced to a point where porsche has admitted there are plans to dethrone piech . " it 's not a matter anymore of whether he 's going or not .
but when and how , " said porsche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang porsche now -lrb- left -rrb- wants to unseat piech -lrb- right -rrb- unseating piech from vw 's 20-member supervisory board , however , will prove difficult , since the chairman enjoys support from labor unions . piech , unions vs. porsche , management last week some 40,000 union workers demonstrated outside vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg to protest against changing the controversial vw law . the state of lower saxony , where vw is based , also has a say in the family feud .
the state has only a 20 percent equity stake in volkswagen , but exercises enormous voting power thanks to the vw law , which gives the government veto power on major company decisions . workers were also nervous about porsche 's harsh management tactics with union leaders concerned about job cuts if porsche gains complete control of vw . volkswagen is by far lower saxony 's largest employer and state premier christian wulff , who also sits on the vw supervisory board , is looking to keep his state 's job motor humming , which aligns him with piech and unions . german newspapers have been speculating that piech now wants to get porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking off the volkswagen board and is using the unions to dilute the influence of his porsche relatives in vw company affairs . bildunterschrift : the demonstration was against the vw law , but directed at the unpopular porsche ceo no holy cows " the vw patriarch is escalating a conflict in which he should be acting as mediator , " wrote the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" above all he is hostile to wiedeking , who has become too powerful for his taste .
piech is holding a company with 330,000 employees hostage just because he does n't like the attitude of one manager . " piech has a record of collaborating with unions to get rid of management .
in 2006 he worked to oust then ceo bernd pischetsrieder , who got word he was fired through the press . piech sees himself as a visionary with a management style very much at odds with wiedeking 's approach to business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking -lrb- left -rrb- and piech -lrb- right -rrb- have different visions for vw " piech sees his vision endangered by wiedeking , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen .
" wiedeking said that there are no holy cows at vw , no more phaetons , no more bugattis . " there was always a cease-fire between piech and the porsches , but now it 's war .
wiedeking is destroying piech 's shining vision , " dudenhoeffer added . cease-fire turns to war for piech , profits are secondary to spectacular engineering feats , according to christoph stuermer , an auto analyst for global insight in frankfurt who has followed volkswagen and porsche for years . " piech is one of the most gifted car engineers on the planet , " he said .
" he wants to be the living michelangelo of cars . " piech 's talents have been profitable for volkswagen .
the company earned 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in profits on a turnover of 109 billion euros last year , surpassed ford to become no. 3 in the world in unit sales and is the globe 's most diverse automaker with brands including scania , seat , skoda , audi , bentley , lamborghini and bugatti . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : granddad ferdinand porsche designed the vw beetle but despite the overall profits and name recognition , it 's piech 's pet projects that irritate wiedeking most , stuermer said . " wiedeking is a porsche ceo from another corporate culture , " he said .
" he 's out to maximize profits by cutting costs and he snubbed everyone , telling off vw management , interfering with their way of doing business . " perhaps ferdinand " ferry " porsche , the namesake son of the man who developed the vw beetle and piech 's uncle , had the right idea in the 1970s when he said all porsche and piech family members working at porsche had to leave management to outsiders because of family squabbles . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the attack on wednesday , which was reported to have killed five militants , came only hours after the top us military commander mike mullen had promised in islamabad to respect pakistan ’ s sovereignty .
meanwhile , the fate of hundreds of thousands of refugees from the fighting in the region bordering afghanistan is attracting more and more attention in pakistan . sher ali 's family is one of many .
they have abandoned their home in the bajaur agency bordering afghanistan and found refuge in the city of rawalpindi , just next to islamabad .
in bajaur , the pakistani army is fighting the taliban militants .
but more often than not , it is civilians who get hit , says sher ali : " they shoot at any child and any man they see , with artillery from far away .
you never know if they will hit your house or my house . "
the civilians get caught between the militant groups and the pakistani or even us forces .
for ordinary residents such as sher ali it has become difficult to discern who is on which side , which makes the situation even more dangerous .
" the situation over there is a mess " , he says .
" you ca n't tell who belongs to the taliban , who is with the government .
others have come from afghanistan or somewhere else . "
more than a million idps in pakistan ?
more and more people are fleeing the conflict zones , the tribal areas on the border with afghanistan such as bajaur and waziristan or the swat valley in the frontier province .
their numbers are difficult to gauge , as they do not stay in large refugee camps , but with relatives and friends all over the country .
the latest wave of internally displaced persons in pakistan comes on top of already large numbers of internal refugees in balochistan province , where the pakistan army has been waging war against baloch nationalist insurgents .
iqbal haider , co-chairperson of the independent human rights commission of pakistan , estimates : " the overall figure is now definitely exceeding one million , including the displaced persons of balochistan and the frontier province .
i am astonished that the world conscience is silent on this very , very serious issue .
they help the afghan refugees in pakistan , but they are least bothered about the pathetic condition of the internally displaced persons ! "
new us strategy the military campaign against the taliban has been stepped up over the last few months , amid stronger pressure from washington .
both the new york times and the sunday times of london have reported that us president bush felt compelled to demonstrated his strength in the face of domestic criticism , and has in fact authorized commando operations in pakistan even without prior permission by the pakistani government .
however , pakistani troops are reported to have fired on us forces earlier this week to stop an incursion .
admiral mike mullen , top commander of the us military , was promptly dispatched to islamabad to limit the damage .
but american military activities have already become extremely unpopular with the pakistani population .
for his part , human rights activist iqbal haider wonders where the the militants are getting their equipment from : " they are all equipped with all the best of lethal weapons , including anti-aircraft guns , including mortars , including rocket launchers .
how on earth can they receive an abundance of such lethal weapons which are not available in any super market of the world ?
they get it with the connivance of the us and the intelligence agencies ! "
with anti-american sentiment growing in this way throughout pakistan , it is difficult to imagine a military solution in the border region . thomas bärthlein 18/09/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

she said the us and europe have to show moscow it is internationally isolating itself . the united states and european union have to stand up to moscow 's " bullying " and keep russia from benefiting from its military move into georgia , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice said in a harshly-worded speech on thursday . " we can not afford to validate the prejudices that some russian leaders seem to have : that if you pressure free nations enough , if you bully , and threaten , and lash out we will cave in , and forget , and eventually concede , " rice said according to excerpts released in advance by the state department .
" the united states and europe must stand up to this kind of behavior , and all who champion it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice 's comments are the harshest yet heard from the us government in her first major speech on russia since its military incursion into georgia last month , rice also said the russia-georgia war would not achieve the strategic objective moscow had hoped for . " russia 's leaders will not accomplish their primary war aim of removing georgia 's government , " she said .
" our strategic goal now is to make it clear to russia 's leaders that their choices are putting russia on a one-way path to self-imposed isolation and international irrelevance . " rice said the united states and europe must not allow russia 's " aggression " against the georgian government of president mikhail saakashvili to achieve any benefit . she said russia 's bid to join the world trade organization was now in question , as well as its attempt to join the organization of economic cooperation and development . russian forces drove deep into georgia in august after repelling an attempt by tbilisi to retake separatist south ossetia .
moscow then recognized south ossetia and separatist region abkhazia as independent states . no country except nicaragua has followed suit . georgia monitor mission talks freeze bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is demanding that south ossetian authorities decide on the osce mission rice 's comments came as talks on sending more monitors to georgia broke down because of disputes with russia on where they should be deployed , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said thursday . " we do n't see the point of continuing negotiations in vienna at this stage .
they have been put on hold .
the area of responsibility for monitors is the main sticking point , " said antti turunen of finland , currently chairing the policymaking permanent council of the 56-nation osce . " this is no longer , for the time being , a matter for diplomats , " said osce spokesman martin nesirky .
" this is elevated to the political level and needs to be dealt with in capitals . " georgia 's osce envoy blamed russia 's refusal to let monitors into breakaway south ossetia and moscow 's demand that local authorities should decide the future osce mandate because it now considers the region " independent . " russian envoy anvar azimov said south ossetia was loath to let monitors back in because , it said , they had failed to alert them to georgia 's offensive to wrest back the region , and so they should be stationed in territory " from which the aggression came . " " they did not inform south ossetian authorities about the possible aggression , they did not prevent this aggression , " he said . russian forces to stay : kouchner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diplomacy alone may not be able to shift russian forces from south ossetia or abkhazia france 's foreign minister said the world should not expect russia to pull out of georgia 's two breakaway provinces anytime soon . bernard kouchner 's comment was the clearest sign yet that the european union may be accepting the possibility that georgia will not regain control of south ossetia or abkhazia .
russia plans to station nearly 8,000 troops for a long-term stay in the two regions . asked by france-culture radio whether russia troops would pull back to georgia 's internationally recognized borders , kouchner replied : " no , i do n't think so .

18 , is to establish lasting partnerships on security issues between the eu and the five central asian states kyrgystan , kazakhstan , uzbekistan , turkmenistan and tajikistan . against the background of the situation in the caucasus and afghanistan the two sides will hold consultations on combating terror , the fight against human and drug trafficking , as well as on energy and environmental security . many eyes on central asia the region between china , russia , afghanistan and iran is rich in natural resources . for europe , the development of central asia 's gas reserves via turkey and georgia , bypassing russia and iran , represents increased energy security . russia , the supplier of much of europe 's gas and oil , would like to exploit the central asian nations ' reserves for itself while china is increasingly stilling its thirst for energy in the region .
the united states is also keen to secure access to the resources for its own companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the btc pipeline is 1,800 kilometers -lrb- 1,118 miles -rrb- long turkey exerts considerable influence in the region on account of its ethnic and linguistic ties with the turkic peoples of central asia and its involvement in the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan -lrb- btc -rrb- oil pipeline . the pipeline connects oilfields in azerbaijan with shipping terminals in turkey via georgia .
but russia fears that the btc pipeline and plans for another one like it undermine its status as an energy-superpower . energy stability remains a challenge in a report published in may 2007 , the international crisis group came to the conclusion that " central asia is likely to see energy create instability within the region ; the chances are low that it will be a factor in improving european energy security any time soon . " the paris forum aims to overcome such gloomy predictions and has been convened expressly with the aim of fostering cooperation that will help defuse conflicts within the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been the motor for this meeting the meeting is being attended by representatives of the 27 member states of the eu as well as from the five central asian states . representatives from the eu commission , turkey , china , japan and russia are also present . afghanistan is there as an observer country , given its geographical proximity and the problems it shares with countries from the region . the european union strategy for central asia came into being in june 2007 on the instigation of germany which then held the rotating eu presidency and designated cooperation with central asia as an issue of top priority for the eu . dw staff -lrb- srh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , the rolling stones ' lead singer joined the chief executive officers of apple , emi , ebay , fiat , louis vuitton and other multinationals for a meeting in brussels with the eu 's competition commissioner neelie kroes .
sir mick and his partners were appointed as unpaid consultants to assist kroes in improving the workings of europe 's online retailing market .
no details of wednesday 's closed-door meeting emerged .
but jagger , 65 , was expected to have offered his expertise on the distribution and sale of music .
kroes has recently expressed concern that there are still too many unjustified barriers within europe to the sale of music and other multimedia content over the internet .
last year , for instance , eu regulators accused apple and other major record labels of breaching eu law by limiting consumers ' choices in buying music online .
and until recently , apple 's itunes stores in britain set higher prices for music downloads than in the 15 eu countries which share the euro .
a report drafted with the help of jagger is due to be published in october . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the index is to be distributed among leading archives to help descendants research the fate of their families .
the government said wednesday , sept .
17 , that it would give the list to israel 's yad vashem holocaust memorial , washington 's holocaust museum , the jewish claims conference and the international tracing service in bad arolsen , germany .
not released to the public privacy laws prevent the full release of the list to the public as yet .
the list is not definitive and will require more work to make it more accurate , said officials from germany 's remembrance , responsibility and future foundation , which compiled it .
the list was drawn up over a period of four years .
the government and a foundation that oversaw the compensation of nazi-era slave laborers provided 1.57 million euros -lrb- $ 2.24 million -rrb- to finance the project .
it constitutes another step towards the " reconstruction of the jewish identity , " said foundation director guenter saathoff .
between 500,000 and 550,000 jews lived in germany before 1933 .
by the end of the war , there were only some 20,000 jews living in the country , but most of these were not of german origin .
most were eastern european holocaust survivors who had ended up in german displaced persons camps . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the index is to be distributed among leading archives to help descendants research the fate of their families .
the government said wednesday , sept .
17 , that it would give the list to israel 's yad vashem holocaust memorial , washington 's holocaust museum , the jewish claims conference and the international tracing service in bad arolsen , germany .
not released to the public privacy laws prevent the full release of the list to the public as yet .
the list is not definitive and will require more work to make it more accurate , said officials from germany 's remembrance , responsibility and future foundation , which compiled it .
the list was drawn up over a period of four years .
the government and a foundation that oversaw the compensation of nazi-era slave laborers provided 1.57 million euros -lrb- $ 2.24 million -rrb- to finance the project .
it constitutes another step towards the " reconstruction of the jewish identity , " said foundation director guenter saathoff .
between 500,000 and 550,000 jews lived in germany before 1933 .
by the end of the war , there were only some 20,000 jews living in the country , but most of these were not of german origin .
most were eastern european holocaust survivors who had ended up in german displaced persons camps . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 .
the deal was due to be formally announced thursday .
it had been explicitly backed by the government and was seen as an attempt to prevent the collapse of hbos -lrb- halifax bank of scotland -rrb- , analysts said .
" the key thing is to maintain stability in the banking system , " treasury secretary alistair darling said about the negotiations wednesday .
analysts in the city of london , the capital 's financial district , said there were concerns over competition issues and the apparent haste with which the deal was struck .
" in normal circumstances , this would not have happened , " said one .
merger to create britain 's largest bank the merger is expected to create a bank with a market value of 30 billion pounds , by far the biggest in britain .
it would have 38 million customers and 142,000 employees .
hbos , which has seen its share price fall by 50 percent since the credit crunch began a year ago , suffered badly from the fallout of monday 's lehman brothers collapse , with predators in the city pouncing on its vulnerability as a major mortgage lender .
analysts said the government had feared that hbos would become a " northern rock mark 2 " - after the collapse last year of british mortgage lender northern rock , which was nationalized in january .
on the london market wednesday , hbos shares fluctuated wildly , climbing as high as 220 pence and falling as low as 88 pence .
analysts said the government-backed merger talks were accelerated after hbos voiced concerns that depositors and lenders had begun to withdraw their credit from the bank .
" there were growing concerns in the hbos boardroom that a climate of fear was being created about its future that could have led to a funding crisis - or a northern rock-style run - on steroids , " said one .
" it was not in the government 's interest for there to be the faintest risk that it would have another northern rock on its hands . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and he 's also having some family problems . wolfgang porsche , who in addition to being the chairman of the german luxury carmaker that bears his name also happens to be one of piech 's cousins , is trying to unseat piech by buying up vw stock through porsche 's holding company .
the company currently owns 35 percent of vw ordinary stock and has plans to increase its share to over 50 percent in november . unwilling to relinquish control to porsche without a fight , piech decided , unexpectedly , not to show up for a board meeting over technical cooperation between porsche and vw 's upscale audi division last week . bildunterschrift : piech maintains a dual role as supervisory board chairman of vw and porsche heir the chairman 's absence gave the balance of power to the board 's workers representatives in a vote that ended in a tie and leaves porsche having to seek board approval for any cooperation with audi . when blood 's not thicker than water but the symbolic implications of the vote - and piech 's tacit support for the unions over his family - reverberated beyond the boardroom .
while it was not unusual for piech to take the side of the unions , that he did so in public against his own family was a precedent , said a former volkswagen manager , who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity . the normally reserved wolfgang porsche told germany 's focus magazine , " ferdinand is ruining the whole family .
this is unbelievable . " the conflict has advanced to a point where porsche has admitted there are plans to dethrone piech . " it 's not a matter anymore of whether he 's going or not .
but when and how , " said porsche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang porsche now -lrb- left -rrb- wants to unseat piech -lrb- right -rrb- unseating piech from vw 's 20-member supervisory board , however , will prove difficult , since the chairman enjoys support from labor unions . piech , unions vs. porsche , management last week some 40,000 union workers demonstrated outside vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg to protest against changing the controversial vw law . the state of lower saxony , where vw is based , also has a say in the family feud .
the state has only a 20 percent equity stake in volkswagen , but exercises enormous voting power thanks to the vw law , which gives the government veto power on major company decisions . workers were also nervous about porsche 's harsh management tactics with union leaders concerned about job cuts if porsche gains complete control of vw . volkswagen is by far lower saxony 's largest employer and state premier christian wulff , who also sits on the vw supervisory board , is looking to keep his state 's job motor humming , which aligns him with piech and unions . german newspapers have been speculating that piech now wants to get porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking off the volkswagen board and is using the unions to dilute the influence of his porsche relatives in vw company affairs . bildunterschrift : the demonstration was against the vw law , but directed at the unpopular porsche ceo no holy cows " the vw patriarch is escalating a conflict in which he should be acting as mediator , " wrote the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" above all he is hostile to wiedeking , who has become too powerful for his taste .
piech is holding a company with 330,000 employees hostage just because he does n't like the attitude of one manager . " piech has a record of collaborating with unions to get rid of management .
in 2006 he worked to oust then ceo bernd pischetsrieder , who got word he was fired through the press . piech sees himself as a visionary with a management style very much at odds with wiedeking 's approach to business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking -lrb- left -rrb- and piech -lrb- right -rrb- have different visions for vw " piech sees his vision endangered by wiedeking , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen .
" wiedeking said that there are no holy cows at vw , no more phaetons , no more bugattis . " there was always a cease-fire between piech and the porsches , but now it 's war .
wiedeking is destroying piech 's shining vision , " dudenhoeffer added . cease-fire turns to war for piech , profits are secondary to spectacular engineering feats , according to christoph stuermer , an auto analyst for global insight in frankfurt who has followed volkswagen and porsche for years . " piech is one of the most gifted car engineers on the planet , " he said .
" he wants to be the living michelangelo of cars . " piech 's talents have been profitable for volkswagen .

and he 's also having some family problems . wolfgang porsche , who in addition to being the chairman of the german luxury carmaker that bears his name also happens to be one of piech 's cousins , is trying to unseat piech by buying up vw stock through porsche 's holding company .
the company currently owns 35 percent of vw ordinary stock and has plans to increase its share to over 50 percent in november . unwilling to relinquish control to porsche without a fight , piech decided , unexpectedly , not to show up for a board meeting over technical cooperation between porsche and vw 's upscale audi division last week . bildunterschrift : piech maintains a dual role as supervisory board chairman of vw and porsche heir the chairman 's absence gave the balance of power to the board 's workers representatives in a vote that ended in a tie and leaves porsche having to seek board approval for any cooperation with audi . when blood 's not thicker than water but the symbolic implications of the vote - and piech 's tacit support for the unions over his family - reverberated beyond the boardroom .
while it was not unusual for piech to take the side of the unions , that he did so in public against his own family was a precedent , said a former volkswagen manager , who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity . the normally reserved wolfgang porsche told germany 's focus magazine , " ferdinand is ruining the whole family .
this is unbelievable . " the conflict has advanced to a point where porsche has admitted there are plans to dethrone piech . " it 's not a matter anymore of whether he 's going or not .
but when and how , " said porsche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang porsche now -lrb- left -rrb- wants to unseat piech -lrb- right -rrb- unseating piech from vw 's 20-member supervisory board , however , will prove difficult , since the chairman enjoys support from labor unions . piech , unions vs. porsche , management last week some 40,000 union workers demonstrated outside vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg to protest against changing the controversial vw law . the state of lower saxony , where vw is based , also has a say in the family feud .
the state has only a 20 percent equity stake in volkswagen , but exercises enormous voting power thanks to the vw law , which gives the government veto power on major company decisions . workers were also nervous about porsche 's harsh management tactics with union leaders concerned about job cuts if porsche gains complete control of vw . volkswagen is by far lower saxony 's largest employer and state premier christian wulff , who also sits on the vw supervisory board , is looking to keep his state 's job motor humming , which aligns him with piech and unions . german newspapers have been speculating that piech now wants to get porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking off the volkswagen board and is using the unions to dilute the influence of his porsche relatives in vw company affairs . bildunterschrift : the demonstration was against the vw law , but directed at the unpopular porsche ceo no holy cows " the vw patriarch is escalating a conflict in which he should be acting as mediator , " wrote the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" above all he is hostile to wiedeking , who has become too powerful for his taste .
piech is holding a company with 330,000 employees hostage just because he does n't like the attitude of one manager . " piech has a record of collaborating with unions to get rid of management .
in 2006 he worked to oust then ceo bernd pischetsrieder , who got word he was fired through the press . piech sees himself as a visionary with a management style very much at odds with wiedeking 's approach to business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking -lrb- left -rrb- and piech -lrb- right -rrb- have different visions for vw " piech sees his vision endangered by wiedeking , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen .
" wiedeking said that there are no holy cows at vw , no more phaetons , no more bugattis . " there was always a cease-fire between piech and the porsches , but now it 's war .
wiedeking is destroying piech 's shining vision , " dudenhoeffer added . cease-fire turns to war for piech , profits are secondary to spectacular engineering feats , according to christoph stuermer , an auto analyst for global insight in frankfurt who has followed volkswagen and porsche for years .

the company currently owns 35 percent of vw ordinary stock and has plans to increase its share to over 50 percent in november . unwilling to relinquish control to porsche without a fight , piech decided , unexpectedly , not to show up for a board meeting over technical cooperation between porsche and vw 's upscale audi division last week . bildunterschrift : piech maintains a dual role as supervisory board chairman of vw and porsche heir the chairman 's absence gave the balance of power to the board 's workers representatives in a vote that ended in a tie and leaves porsche having to seek board approval for any cooperation with audi . when blood 's not thicker than water but the symbolic implications of the vote - and piech 's tacit support for the unions over his family - reverberated beyond the boardroom .
while it was not unusual for piech to take the side of the unions , that he did so in public against his own family was a precedent , said a former volkswagen manager , who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity . the normally reserved wolfgang porsche told germany 's focus magazine , " ferdinand is ruining the whole family .
this is unbelievable . " the conflict has advanced to a point where porsche has admitted there are plans to dethrone piech . " it 's not a matter anymore of whether he 's going or not .
but when and how , " said porsche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang porsche now -lrb- left -rrb- wants to unseat piech -lrb- right -rrb- unseating piech from vw 's 20-member supervisory board , however , will prove difficult , since the chairman enjoys support from labor unions . piech , unions vs. porsche , management last week some 40,000 union workers demonstrated outside vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg to protest against changing the controversial vw law . the state of lower saxony , where vw is based , also has a say in the family feud .
the state has only a 20 percent equity stake in volkswagen , but exercises enormous voting power thanks to the vw law , which gives the government veto power on major company decisions . workers were also nervous about porsche 's harsh management tactics with union leaders concerned about job cuts if porsche gains complete control of vw . volkswagen is by far lower saxony 's largest employer and state premier christian wulff , who also sits on the vw supervisory board , is looking to keep his state 's job motor humming , which aligns him with piech and unions . german newspapers have been speculating that piech now wants to get porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking off the volkswagen board and is using the unions to dilute the influence of his porsche relatives in vw company affairs . bildunterschrift : the demonstration was against the vw law , but directed at the unpopular porsche ceo no holy cows " the vw patriarch is escalating a conflict in which he should be acting as mediator , " wrote the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" above all he is hostile to wiedeking , who has become too powerful for his taste .
piech is holding a company with 330,000 employees hostage just because he does n't like the attitude of one manager . " piech has a record of collaborating with unions to get rid of management .
in 2006 he worked to oust then ceo bernd pischetsrieder , who got word he was fired through the press . piech sees himself as a visionary with a management style very much at odds with wiedeking 's approach to business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking -lrb- left -rrb- and piech -lrb- right -rrb- have different visions for vw " piech sees his vision endangered by wiedeking , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen .
" wiedeking said that there are no holy cows at vw , no more phaetons , no more bugattis . " there was always a cease-fire between piech and the porsches , but now it 's war .
wiedeking is destroying piech 's shining vision , " dudenhoeffer added . cease-fire turns to war for piech , profits are secondary to spectacular engineering feats , according to christoph stuermer , an auto analyst for global insight in frankfurt who has followed volkswagen and porsche for years . " piech is one of the most gifted car engineers on the planet , " he said .
" he wants to be the living michelangelo of cars . " piech 's talents have been profitable for volkswagen .
the company earned 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in profits on a turnover of 109 billion euros last year , surpassed ford to become no. 3 in the world in unit sales and is the globe 's most diverse automaker with brands including scania , seat , skoda , audi , bentley , lamborghini and bugatti . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : granddad ferdinand porsche designed the vw beetle but despite the overall profits and name recognition , it 's piech 's pet projects that irritate wiedeking most , stuermer said . " wiedeking is a porsche ceo from another corporate culture , " he said .
" he 's out to maximize profits by cutting costs and he snubbed everyone , telling off vw management , interfering with their way of doing business . " perhaps ferdinand " ferry " porsche , the namesake son of the man who developed the vw beetle and piech 's uncle , had the right idea in the 1970s when he said all porsche and piech family members working at porsche had to leave management to outsiders because of family squabbles . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal was due to be formally announced thursday .
it had been explicitly backed by the government and was seen as an attempt to prevent the collapse of hbos -lrb- halifax bank of scotland -rrb- , analysts said .
" the key thing is to maintain stability in the banking system , " treasury secretary alistair darling said about the negotiations wednesday .
analysts in the city of london , the capital 's financial district , said there were concerns over competition issues and the apparent haste with which the deal was struck .
" in normal circumstances , this would not have happened , " said one .
merger to create britain 's largest bank the merger is expected to create a bank with a market value of 30 billion pounds , by far the biggest in britain .
it would have 38 million customers and 142,000 employees .
hbos , which has seen its share price fall by 50 percent since the credit crunch began a year ago , suffered badly from the fallout of monday 's lehman brothers collapse , with predators in the city pouncing on its vulnerability as a major mortgage lender .
analysts said the government had feared that hbos would become a " northern rock mark 2 " - after the collapse last year of british mortgage lender northern rock , which was nationalized in january .
on the london market wednesday , hbos shares fluctuated wildly , climbing as high as 220 pence and falling as low as 88 pence .
analysts said the government-backed merger talks were accelerated after hbos voiced concerns that depositors and lenders had begun to withdraw their credit from the bank .
" there were growing concerns in the hbos boardroom that a climate of fear was being created about its future that could have led to a funding crisis - or a northern rock-style run - on steroids , " said one .

one lawmaker has called for the " total reform " of kfw in the wake of a major payment error , while another has raised doubts about the costly bailout of crippled subsidiary ikb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the ikb bailout be less than certain ?
late thursday , sept .
18 , the kfw board is slated to meet in berlin for a formal vote to approve the sale of ikb deutsche industriebank , a subsidiary of kfw that was hit hard in by subprime mortgage exposure in the us , to us financial investor lone star .
seeking explanation for transfer the bank 's supervisory board , largely composed of german parliamentarians , will use that meeting to hear an explanation of kfw 's mistaken transfer of 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .
kfw declared the transfer , part of a swap arrangement , a " technical blunder . "
but critics said they should have held on to the money , knowing from sunday news reports that lehman was broke .
swaps are often programmed in advance into computers so that they happen without human intervention .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig said the remittance was " infuriating " and those to blame must be found , but an aide to economics minister michael glos - who currently sits at the head the kfw supervisory board - said it was too early to say if anyone would be punished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why did kfw send a payment to bankrupt firm ?
ahead of the meeting thursday , opposition parliamentarian and kfw supervisory board member juergen koppelin called for a total reform of the german state development bank .
he said he feared that losses through the faulty bank transfer could add up to far more than the 300 million euros already known .
lawmaker : ' total reform ' is needed " i think the consequence should be total reform , " koppelin told ard television news on thursday .
the supervisory board should be made smaller , and a fact-finding commission should be established to explain the error , he said .
another problem is that supervisory board members are not well enough informed by the kfw management board , he said .
that subject is also likely to be on the agenda at thursday afternoon 's final vote to approve the sale of kfw 's troubled subsidiary ikb to us financial investor lone star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos : too soon to say who will be punished while the deal is considered certain , green party politican and kfw supervisory board member christine scheel complained to the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that she and the other supervisory board members feel they have n't been adequately informed about the terms of the sale agreement .
20 questions for michael glos " i can not imagine that we can comprehend and decide upon such a complex deal in the form of a hand-out or , worse , a verbal explanation , " she told the paper .
scheel accused supervisory board leader michael glos of denying the supervisory board members any actual decision-making power by withholding the information .
she demanded that glos and kfw chairman ulrich schroeder answer 20 detailed questions on the sale .

ahead of the meeting thursday , opposition parliamentarian and kfw supervisory board member juergen koppelin called for a total reform of the german state development bank .
he said he feared that losses through the faulty bank transfer could add up to far more than the 300 million euros already known .

the supervisory board should be made smaller , and a fact-finding commission should be established to explain the error , he said .
another problem is that supervisory board members are not well enough informed by the kfw management board , he said .
that subject is also likely to be on the agenda at thursday afternoon 's final vote to approve the sale of kfw 's troubled subsidiary ikb to us financial investor lone star .

despite several past attempts , the two coalition partners have never managed to find a common position on late-term abortions .
a late-term abortion is a termination which is carried out after the 20th week in a pregnancy when there is a risk to the physical or mental health of the mother .
most late-term abortions are carried out when prenatal diagnosis reveals that the fetus has a severe disability .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the cdu 's motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counselling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , spd : " i can see supporting this motion . "
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law would foresee a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .
mixed views within spd " that the spd is once again thinking about supporting our motion is an encouraging signal , " said johannes singhammer , the conservatives ' parliamentary spokesman on family affairs .
but within the spd , opinion is still split .
" i can see supporting this motion , " said renate schmidt , the spd 's former minister for family affairs .
but the social democrats ' deputy parliamentary group head , christel humme , speaks for others in the party who say that there is no need for new abortion legislation .
in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio , she said that , if anything , women should receive such counseling earlier on in their pregnancy before they are confronted with the knowledge that they are carrying a potentially disabled fetus .
" many women have said to me that if they had only known what was coming their way , then they might not have had amniocentesis done , for example , " humme said .
the spd 's former coalition partner , the green party , is against the cdu 's motion , calling it unnecessary .

despite several past attempts , the two coalition partners have never managed to find a common position on late-term abortions .
a late-term abortion is a termination which is carried out after the 20th week in a pregnancy when there is a risk to the physical or mental health of the mother .
most late-term abortions are carried out when prenatal diagnosis reveals that the fetus has a severe disability .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the cdu 's motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counselling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , spd : " i can see supporting this motion . "
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law would foresee a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .
mixed views within spd " that the spd is once again thinking about supporting our motion is an encouraging signal , " said johannes singhammer , the conservatives ' parliamentary spokesman on family affairs .
but within the spd , opinion is still split .
" i can see supporting this motion , " said renate schmidt , the spd 's former minister for family affairs .
but the social democrats ' deputy parliamentary group head , christel humme , speaks for others in the party who say that there is no need for new abortion legislation .
in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio , she said that , if anything , women should receive such counseling earlier on in their pregnancy before they are confronted with the knowledge that they are carrying a potentially disabled fetus .
" many women have said to me that if they had only known what was coming their way , then they might not have had amniocentesis done , for example , " humme said .
the spd 's former coalition partner , the green party , is against the cdu 's motion , calling it unnecessary .
neither the threat of a fine for doctors nor an increase in paperwork will help women who find themselves in a very difficult situation , said the green 's spokeswoman for women 's issues , irmingard schewe-gerigk . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

representatives from the two regions will meet to discuss possible cooperation on energy security . a main aim of the paris meeting on thursday , sept .
18 , is to establish lasting partnerships on security issues between the eu and the five central asian states kyrgystan , kazakhstan , uzbekistan , turkmenistan and tajikistan . against the background of the situation in the caucasus and afghanistan the two sides will hold consultations on combating terror , the fight against human and drug trafficking , as well as on energy and environmental security . many eyes on central asia the region between china , russia , afghanistan and iran is rich in natural resources . for europe , the development of central asia 's gas reserves via turkey and georgia , bypassing russia and iran , represents increased energy security . russia , the supplier of much of europe 's gas and oil , would like to exploit the central asian nations ' reserves for itself while china is increasingly stilling its thirst for energy in the region .
the united states is also keen to secure access to the resources for its own companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the btc pipeline is 1,800 kilometers -lrb- 1,118 miles -rrb- long turkey exerts considerable influence in the region on account of its ethnic and linguistic ties with the turkic peoples of central asia and its involvement in the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan -lrb- btc -rrb- oil pipeline . the pipeline connects oilfields in azerbaijan with shipping terminals in turkey via georgia .
but russia fears that the btc pipeline and plans for another one like it undermine its status as an energy-superpower . energy stability remains a challenge in a report published in may 2007 , the international crisis group came to the conclusion that " central asia is likely to see energy create instability within the region ; the chances are low that it will be a factor in improving european energy security any time soon . " the paris forum aims to overcome such gloomy predictions and has been convened expressly with the aim of fostering cooperation that will help defuse conflicts within the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been the motor for this meeting the meeting is being attended by representatives of the 27 member states of the eu as well as from the five central asian states . representatives from the eu commission , turkey , china , japan and russia are also present . afghanistan is there as an observer country , given its geographical proximity and the problems it shares with countries from the region . the european union strategy for central asia came into being in june 2007 on the instigation of germany which then held the rotating eu presidency and designated cooperation with central asia as an issue of top priority for the eu . dw staff -lrb- srh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she said the us and europe have to show moscow it is internationally isolating itself . the united states and european union have to stand up to moscow 's " bullying " and keep russia from benefiting from its military move into georgia , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice said in a harshly-worded speech on thursday . " we can not afford to validate the prejudices that some russian leaders seem to have : that if you pressure free nations enough , if you bully , and threaten , and lash out we will cave in , and forget , and eventually concede , " rice said according to excerpts released in advance by the state department .
" the united states and europe must stand up to this kind of behavior , and all who champion it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice 's comments are the harshest yet heard from the us government in her first major speech on russia since its military incursion into georgia last month , rice also said the russia-georgia war would not achieve the strategic objective moscow had hoped for . " russia 's leaders will not accomplish their primary war aim of removing georgia 's government , " she said .
" our strategic goal now is to make it clear to russia 's leaders that their choices are putting russia on a one-way path to self-imposed isolation and international irrelevance . " rice said the united states and europe must not allow russia 's " aggression " against the georgian government of president mikhail saakashvili to achieve any benefit . she said russia 's bid to join the world trade organization was now in question , as well as its attempt to join the organization of economic cooperation and development . russian forces drove deep into georgia in august after repelling an attempt by tbilisi to retake separatist south ossetia .
moscow then recognized south ossetia and separatist region abkhazia as independent states . no country except nicaragua has followed suit . georgia monitor mission talks freeze bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is demanding that south ossetian authorities decide on the osce mission rice 's comments came as talks on sending more monitors to georgia broke down because of disputes with russia on where they should be deployed , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said thursday . " we do n't see the point of continuing negotiations in vienna at this stage .
they have been put on hold .
the area of responsibility for monitors is the main sticking point , " said antti turunen of finland , currently chairing the policymaking permanent council of the 56-nation osce . " this is no longer , for the time being , a matter for diplomats , " said osce spokesman martin nesirky .
" this is elevated to the political level and needs to be dealt with in capitals . " georgia 's osce envoy blamed russia 's refusal to let monitors into breakaway south ossetia and moscow 's demand that local authorities should decide the future osce mandate because it now considers the region " independent . " russian envoy anvar azimov said south ossetia was loath to let monitors back in because , it said , they had failed to alert them to georgia 's offensive to wrest back the region , and so they should be stationed in territory " from which the aggression came . " " they did not inform south ossetian authorities about the possible aggression , they did not prevent this aggression , " he said . russian forces to stay : kouchner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diplomacy alone may not be able to shift russian forces from south ossetia or abkhazia france 's foreign minister said the world should not expect russia to pull out of georgia 's two breakaway provinces anytime soon . bernard kouchner 's comment was the clearest sign yet that the european union may be accepting the possibility that georgia will not regain control of south ossetia or abkhazia .
russia plans to station nearly 8,000 troops for a long-term stay in the two regions . asked by france-culture radio whether russia troops would pull back to georgia 's internationally recognized borders , kouchner replied : " no , i do n't think so .

the attack on wednesday , which was reported to have killed five militants , came only hours after the top us military commander mike mullen had promised in islamabad to respect pakistan ’ s sovereignty .
meanwhile , the fate of hundreds of thousands of refugees from the fighting in the region bordering afghanistan is attracting more and more attention in pakistan . sher ali 's family is one of many .
they have abandoned their home in the bajaur agency bordering afghanistan and found refuge in the city of rawalpindi , just next to islamabad .
in bajaur , the pakistani army is fighting the taliban militants .
but more often than not , it is civilians who get hit , says sher ali : " they shoot at any child and any man they see , with artillery from far away .
you never know if they will hit your house or my house . "
the civilians get caught between the militant groups and the pakistani or even us forces .
for ordinary residents such as sher ali it has become difficult to discern who is on which side , which makes the situation even more dangerous .
" the situation over there is a mess " , he says .
" you ca n't tell who belongs to the taliban , who is with the government .
others have come from afghanistan or somewhere else . "
more than a million idps in pakistan ?
more and more people are fleeing the conflict zones , the tribal areas on the border with afghanistan such as bajaur and waziristan or the swat valley in the frontier province .
their numbers are difficult to gauge , as they do not stay in large refugee camps , but with relatives and friends all over the country .
the latest wave of internally displaced persons in pakistan comes on top of already large numbers of internal refugees in balochistan province , where the pakistan army has been waging war against baloch nationalist insurgents .
iqbal haider , co-chairperson of the independent human rights commission of pakistan , estimates : " the overall figure is now definitely exceeding one million , including the displaced persons of balochistan and the frontier province .
i am astonished that the world conscience is silent on this very , very serious issue .
they help the afghan refugees in pakistan , but they are least bothered about the pathetic condition of the internally displaced persons ! "
new us strategy the military campaign against the taliban has been stepped up over the last few months , amid stronger pressure from washington .
both the new york times and the sunday times of london have reported that us president bush felt compelled to demonstrated his strength in the face of domestic criticism , and has in fact authorized commando operations in pakistan even without prior permission by the pakistani government .
however , pakistani troops are reported to have fired on us forces earlier this week to stop an incursion .
admiral mike mullen , top commander of the us military , was promptly dispatched to islamabad to limit the damage .
but american military activities have already become extremely unpopular with the pakistani population .
for his part , human rights activist iqbal haider wonders where the the militants are getting their equipment from : " they are all equipped with all the best of lethal weapons , including anti-aircraft guns , including mortars , including rocket launchers .
how on earth can they receive an abundance of such lethal weapons which are not available in any super market of the world ?

they have abandoned their home in the bajaur agency bordering afghanistan and found refuge in the city of rawalpindi , just next to islamabad .
in bajaur , the pakistani army is fighting the taliban militants .
but more often than not , it is civilians who get hit , says sher ali : " they shoot at any child and any man they see , with artillery from far away .
you never know if they will hit your house or my house . "
the civilians get caught between the militant groups and the pakistani or even us forces .
for ordinary residents such as sher ali it has become difficult to discern who is on which side , which makes the situation even more dangerous .

the latest wave of internally displaced persons in pakistan comes on top of already large numbers of internal refugees in balochistan province , where the pakistan army has been waging war against baloch nationalist insurgents .
iqbal haider , co-chairperson of the independent human rights commission of pakistan , estimates : " the overall figure is now definitely exceeding one million , including the displaced persons of balochistan and the frontier province .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 18.09.2008 spd mulls supporting new law on late-term abortions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu wants more counselling for women facing late-term abortion germany 's conservative cdu has retracted its planned motion to amend the country 's laws on late-term abortions in order to give its coalition partner , the spd , time to consider adding its support . both coalition groups have confirmed to the passauer neue presse newspaper that the social democrats are taking time to consider a christian democrat motion that would tighten the laws regulating late-term abortions in germany .
despite several past attempts , the two coalition partners have never managed to find a common position on late-term abortions .
a late-term abortion is a termination which is carried out after the 20th week in a pregnancy when there is a risk to the physical or mental health of the mother .
most late-term abortions are carried out when prenatal diagnosis reveals that the fetus has a severe disability .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the cdu 's motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counselling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , spd : " i can see supporting this motion . "
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law would foresee a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .
mixed views within spd " that the spd is once again thinking about supporting our motion is an encouraging signal , " said johannes singhammer , the conservatives ' parliamentary spokesman on family affairs .
but within the spd , opinion is still split .
" i can see supporting this motion , " said renate schmidt , the spd 's former minister for family affairs .
but the social democrats ' deputy parliamentary group head , christel humme , speaks for others in the party who say that there is no need for new abortion legislation .
in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio , she said that , if anything , women should receive such counseling earlier on in their pregnancy before they are confronted with the knowledge that they are carrying a potentially disabled fetus .
" many women have said to me that if they had only known what was coming their way , then they might not have had amniocentesis done , for example , " humme said .
the spd 's former coalition partner , the green party , is against the cdu 's motion , calling it unnecessary .
neither the threat of a fine for doctors nor an increase in paperwork will help women who find themselves in a very difficult situation , said the green 's spokeswoman for women 's issues , irmingard schewe-gerigk . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite several past attempts , the two coalition partners have never managed to find a common position on late-term abortions .
a late-term abortion is a termination which is carried out after the 20th week in a pregnancy when there is a risk to the physical or mental health of the mother .
most late-term abortions are carried out when prenatal diagnosis reveals that the fetus has a severe disability .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the cdu 's motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counselling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , spd : " i can see supporting this motion . "
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law would foresee a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .
mixed views within spd " that the spd is once again thinking about supporting our motion is an encouraging signal , " said johannes singhammer , the conservatives ' parliamentary spokesman on family affairs .
but within the spd , opinion is still split .
" i can see supporting this motion , " said renate schmidt , the spd 's former minister for family affairs .
but the social democrats ' deputy parliamentary group head , christel humme , speaks for others in the party who say that there is no need for new abortion legislation .
in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio , she said that , if anything , women should receive such counseling earlier on in their pregnancy before they are confronted with the knowledge that they are carrying a potentially disabled fetus .
" many women have said to me that if they had only known what was coming their way , then they might not have had amniocentesis done , for example , " humme said .
the spd 's former coalition partner , the green party , is against the cdu 's motion , calling it unnecessary .

one lawmaker has called for the " total reform " of kfw in the wake of a major payment error , while another has raised doubts about the costly bailout of crippled subsidiary ikb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the ikb bailout be less than certain ?
late thursday , sept .
18 , the kfw board is slated to meet in berlin for a formal vote to approve the sale of ikb deutsche industriebank , a subsidiary of kfw that was hit hard in by subprime mortgage exposure in the us , to us financial investor lone star .
seeking explanation for transfer the bank 's supervisory board , largely composed of german parliamentarians , will use that meeting to hear an explanation of kfw 's mistaken transfer of 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .
kfw declared the transfer , part of a swap arrangement , a " technical blunder . "
but critics said they should have held on to the money , knowing from sunday news reports that lehman was broke .
swaps are often programmed in advance into computers so that they happen without human intervention .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig said the remittance was " infuriating " and those to blame must be found , but an aide to economics minister michael glos - who currently sits at the head the kfw supervisory board - said it was too early to say if anyone would be punished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why did kfw send a payment to bankrupt firm ?
ahead of the meeting thursday , opposition parliamentarian and kfw supervisory board member juergen koppelin called for a total reform of the german state development bank .
he said he feared that losses through the faulty bank transfer could add up to far more than the 300 million euros already known .
lawmaker : ' total reform ' is needed " i think the consequence should be total reform , " koppelin told ard television news on thursday .
the supervisory board should be made smaller , and a fact-finding commission should be established to explain the error , he said .
another problem is that supervisory board members are not well enough informed by the kfw management board , he said .
that subject is also likely to be on the agenda at thursday afternoon 's final vote to approve the sale of kfw 's troubled subsidiary ikb to us financial investor lone star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos : too soon to say who will be punished while the deal is considered certain , green party politican and kfw supervisory board member christine scheel complained to the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that she and the other supervisory board members feel they have n't been adequately informed about the terms of the sale agreement .
20 questions for michael glos " i can not imagine that we can comprehend and decide upon such a complex deal in the form of a hand-out or , worse , a verbal explanation , " she told the paper .
scheel accused supervisory board leader michael glos of denying the supervisory board members any actual decision-making power by withholding the information .
she demanded that glos and kfw chairman ulrich schroeder answer 20 detailed questions on the sale .

he said he feared that losses through the faulty bank transfer could add up to far more than the 300 million euros already known .
lawmaker : ' total reform ' is needed " i think the consequence should be total reform , " koppelin told ard television news on thursday .
the supervisory board should be made smaller , and a fact-finding commission should be established to explain the error , he said .
another problem is that supervisory board members are not well enough informed by the kfw management board , he said .
that subject is also likely to be on the agenda at thursday afternoon 's final vote to approve the sale of kfw 's troubled subsidiary ikb to us financial investor lone star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos : too soon to say who will be punished while the deal is considered certain , green party politican and kfw supervisory board member christine scheel complained to the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that she and the other supervisory board members feel they have n't been adequately informed about the terms of the sale agreement .
20 questions for michael glos " i can not imagine that we can comprehend and decide upon such a complex deal in the form of a hand-out or , worse , a verbal explanation , " she told the paper .
scheel accused supervisory board leader michael glos of denying the supervisory board members any actual decision-making power by withholding the information .
she demanded that glos and kfw chairman ulrich schroeder answer 20 detailed questions on the sale .
set up in 1948 to administer marshall plan funds , kfw is the german federal government 's in-house bank and lends to home-owners and industry . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal was due to be formally announced thursday .
it had been explicitly backed by the government and was seen as an attempt to prevent the collapse of hbos -lrb- halifax bank of scotland -rrb- , analysts said .
" the key thing is to maintain stability in the banking system , " treasury secretary alistair darling said about the negotiations wednesday .
analysts in the city of london , the capital 's financial district , said there were concerns over competition issues and the apparent haste with which the deal was struck .

merger to create britain 's largest bank the merger is expected to create a bank with a market value of 30 billion pounds , by far the biggest in britain .

hbos , which has seen its share price fall by 50 percent since the credit crunch began a year ago , suffered badly from the fallout of monday 's lehman brothers collapse , with predators in the city pouncing on its vulnerability as a major mortgage lender .
analysts said the government had feared that hbos would become a " northern rock mark 2 " - after the collapse last year of british mortgage lender northern rock , which was nationalized in january .
on the london market wednesday , hbos shares fluctuated wildly , climbing as high as 220 pence and falling as low as 88 pence .
analysts said the government-backed merger talks were accelerated after hbos voiced concerns that depositors and lenders had begun to withdraw their credit from the bank .
" there were growing concerns in the hbos boardroom that a climate of fear was being created about its future that could have led to a funding crisis - or a northern rock-style run - on steroids , " said one .

but he did n't get paid for sharing his knowledge of the music industry with leaders of the 27-country bloc . on wednesday , sept .
17 , the rolling stones ' lead singer joined the chief executive officers of apple , emi , ebay , fiat , louis vuitton and other multinationals for a meeting in brussels with the eu 's competition commissioner neelie kroes .
sir mick and his partners were appointed as unpaid consultants to assist kroes in improving the workings of europe 's online retailing market .
no details of wednesday 's closed-door meeting emerged .
but jagger , 65 , was expected to have offered his expertise on the distribution and sale of music .
kroes has recently expressed concern that there are still too many unjustified barriers within europe to the sale of music and other multimedia content over the internet .
last year , for instance , eu regulators accused apple and other major record labels of breaching eu law by limiting consumers ' choices in buying music online .
and until recently , apple 's itunes stores in britain set higher prices for music downloads than in the 15 eu countries which share the euro .
a report drafted with the help of jagger is due to be published in october . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and he 's also having some family problems . wolfgang porsche , who in addition to being the chairman of the german luxury carmaker that bears his name also happens to be one of piech 's cousins , is trying to unseat piech by buying up vw stock through porsche 's holding company .
the company currently owns 35 percent of vw ordinary stock and has plans to increase its share to over 50 percent in november . unwilling to relinquish control to porsche without a fight , piech decided , unexpectedly , not to show up for a board meeting over technical cooperation between porsche and vw 's upscale audi division last week . bildunterschrift : piech maintains a dual role as supervisory board chairman of vw and porsche heir the chairman 's absence gave the balance of power to the board 's workers representatives in a vote that ended in a tie and leaves porsche having to seek board approval for any cooperation with audi . when blood 's not thicker than water but the symbolic implications of the vote - and piech 's tacit support for the unions over his family - reverberated beyond the boardroom .
while it was not unusual for piech to take the side of the unions , that he did so in public against his own family was a precedent , said a former volkswagen manager , who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity . the normally reserved wolfgang porsche told germany 's focus magazine , " ferdinand is ruining the whole family .
this is unbelievable . " the conflict has advanced to a point where porsche has admitted there are plans to dethrone piech . " it 's not a matter anymore of whether he 's going or not .
but when and how , " said porsche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang porsche now -lrb- left -rrb- wants to unseat piech -lrb- right -rrb- unseating piech from vw 's 20-member supervisory board , however , will prove difficult , since the chairman enjoys support from labor unions . piech , unions vs. porsche , management last week some 40,000 union workers demonstrated outside vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg to protest against changing the controversial vw law . the state of lower saxony , where vw is based , also has a say in the family feud .
the state has only a 20 percent equity stake in volkswagen , but exercises enormous voting power thanks to the vw law , which gives the government veto power on major company decisions . workers were also nervous about porsche 's harsh management tactics with union leaders concerned about job cuts if porsche gains complete control of vw . volkswagen is by far lower saxony 's largest employer and state premier christian wulff , who also sits on the vw supervisory board , is looking to keep his state 's job motor humming , which aligns him with piech and unions . german newspapers have been speculating that piech now wants to get porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking off the volkswagen board and is using the unions to dilute the influence of his porsche relatives in vw company affairs . bildunterschrift : the demonstration was against the vw law , but directed at the unpopular porsche ceo no holy cows " the vw patriarch is escalating a conflict in which he should be acting as mediator , " wrote the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" above all he is hostile to wiedeking , who has become too powerful for his taste .
piech is holding a company with 330,000 employees hostage just because he does n't like the attitude of one manager . " piech has a record of collaborating with unions to get rid of management .
in 2006 he worked to oust then ceo bernd pischetsrieder , who got word he was fired through the press . piech sees himself as a visionary with a management style very much at odds with wiedeking 's approach to business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking -lrb- left -rrb- and piech -lrb- right -rrb- have different visions for vw " piech sees his vision endangered by wiedeking , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen .
" wiedeking said that there are no holy cows at vw , no more phaetons , no more bugattis . " there was always a cease-fire between piech and the porsches , but now it 's war .
wiedeking is destroying piech 's shining vision , " dudenhoeffer added . cease-fire turns to war for piech , profits are secondary to spectacular engineering feats , according to christoph stuermer , an auto analyst for global insight in frankfurt who has followed volkswagen and porsche for years . " piech is one of the most gifted car engineers on the planet , " he said .
" he wants to be the living michelangelo of cars . " piech 's talents have been profitable for volkswagen .
the company earned 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in profits on a turnover of 109 billion euros last year , surpassed ford to become no. 3 in the world in unit sales and is the globe 's most diverse automaker with brands including scania , seat , skoda , audi , bentley , lamborghini and bugatti . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : granddad ferdinand porsche designed the vw beetle but despite the overall profits and name recognition , it 's piech 's pet projects that irritate wiedeking most , stuermer said . " wiedeking is a porsche ceo from another corporate culture , " he said .
" he 's out to maximize profits by cutting costs and he snubbed everyone , telling off vw management , interfering with their way of doing business . " perhaps ferdinand " ferry " porsche , the namesake son of the man who developed the vw beetle and piech 's uncle , had the right idea in the 1970s when he said all porsche and piech family members working at porsche had to leave management to outsiders because of family squabbles . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and he 's also having some family problems . wolfgang porsche , who in addition to being the chairman of the german luxury carmaker that bears his name also happens to be one of piech 's cousins , is trying to unseat piech by buying up vw stock through porsche 's holding company .
the company currently owns 35 percent of vw ordinary stock and has plans to increase its share to over 50 percent in november . unwilling to relinquish control to porsche without a fight , piech decided , unexpectedly , not to show up for a board meeting over technical cooperation between porsche and vw 's upscale audi division last week . bildunterschrift : piech maintains a dual role as supervisory board chairman of vw and porsche heir the chairman 's absence gave the balance of power to the board 's workers representatives in a vote that ended in a tie and leaves porsche having to seek board approval for any cooperation with audi . when blood 's not thicker than water but the symbolic implications of the vote - and piech 's tacit support for the unions over his family - reverberated beyond the boardroom .
while it was not unusual for piech to take the side of the unions , that he did so in public against his own family was a precedent , said a former volkswagen manager , who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity . the normally reserved wolfgang porsche told germany 's focus magazine , " ferdinand is ruining the whole family .
this is unbelievable . " the conflict has advanced to a point where porsche has admitted there are plans to dethrone piech . " it 's not a matter anymore of whether he 's going or not .

the state has only a 20 percent equity stake in volkswagen , but exercises enormous voting power thanks to the vw law , which gives the government veto power on major company decisions . workers were also nervous about porsche 's harsh management tactics with union leaders concerned about job cuts if porsche gains complete control of vw . volkswagen is by far lower saxony 's largest employer and state premier christian wulff , who also sits on the vw supervisory board , is looking to keep his state 's job motor humming , which aligns him with piech and unions . german newspapers have been speculating that piech now wants to get porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking off the volkswagen board and is using the unions to dilute the influence of his porsche relatives in vw company affairs . bildunterschrift : the demonstration was against the vw law , but directed at the unpopular porsche ceo no holy cows " the vw patriarch is escalating a conflict in which he should be acting as mediator , " wrote the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" above all he is hostile to wiedeking , who has become too powerful for his taste .
piech is holding a company with 330,000 employees hostage just because he does n't like the attitude of one manager . " piech has a record of collaborating with unions to get rid of management .
in 2006 he worked to oust then ceo bernd pischetsrieder , who got word he was fired through the press . piech sees himself as a visionary with a management style very much at odds with wiedeking 's approach to business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking -lrb- left -rrb- and piech -lrb- right -rrb- have different visions for vw " piech sees his vision endangered by wiedeking , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen .
" wiedeking said that there are no holy cows at vw , no more phaetons , no more bugattis . " there was always a cease-fire between piech and the porsches , but now it 's war .
wiedeking is destroying piech 's shining vision , " dudenhoeffer added . cease-fire turns to war for piech , profits are secondary to spectacular engineering feats , according to christoph stuermer , an auto analyst for global insight in frankfurt who has followed volkswagen and porsche for years . " piech is one of the most gifted car engineers on the planet , " he said .
" he wants to be the living michelangelo of cars . " piech 's talents have been profitable for volkswagen .
the company earned 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in profits on a turnover of 109 billion euros last year , surpassed ford to become no. 3 in the world in unit sales and is the globe 's most diverse automaker with brands including scania , seat , skoda , audi , bentley , lamborghini and bugatti . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : granddad ferdinand porsche designed the vw beetle but despite the overall profits and name recognition , it 's piech 's pet projects that irritate wiedeking most , stuermer said .

an investigatory committee questioned two intelligence agents accused of aiding the us . two german spies in baghdad actively supported the 2003 us invasion of iraq despite government denials , opposition parties said . the politicians made their comments were before the two intelligence agents gave testimony behind closed doors to a parliamentary panel on thursday , sept .
18 . contradictory evidence " the records unfortunately contradict completely the government 's position that it was not involved , " norman paech , a member of the investigative committee from the left party , told reuters news service before the hearing . a federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- fact-finding commission on the iraq war has begun investigating the role played by current foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in the invasion . the bnd debriefed two agents in baghdad who they believe passed " relevant war data " to the bnd headquarters in pullach .
that information was then sent to us headquarters in qatar , the bnd said . embarrassment for steinmeier the issue could prove embarrassing to steinmeier , the social democrats ' candidate for chancellor in next year 's elections .
as head of the chancellery under schroeder , it was steinmeier who oversaw intelligence operations at the time of the us invasion that toppled saddam hussein . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could steinmeier be facing a scandal ?
the case caused uproar when it leaked out in early 2006 , because both the german government and public opinion strongly opposed the us invasion .
then-chancellor schroeder tapped this anti-war sentiment to win a close election in 2002 . peach and fellow committee member hans-christian stroebele from the opposition green party said the spies in baghdad passed on information about expected resistance and coordinates for military positions that were subsequently bombed . information on bombing raids it was unclear whether steinmeier was aware of these activities , stroebele told reuters . max stadler from the free-market liberal fdp said it was important not to leap to conclusions , but that the spies had fed information on the effectiveness of bombing raids . in one case , us bombers struck an iraqi officers club twice in four days after getting feedback from the agents . the social democrats , now coalition partners with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives , rejected accusations that the spies ' work had led directly to military action . " no evidence for this has been presented so far , " spd delegate michael hartmann told reuters . response from steinmeier steinmeier said in a newspaper interview that the public would not buy the argument that the presence of two bnd spies in iraq was enough " to make germany a warring party after the fact . " germany 's spy chief and the agents had assured members of parliament in january 2006 that they did not help the united states pick out bombing targets during the invasion of iraq , but that failed to halt demands for an inquiry . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we can not afford to validate the prejudices that some russian leaders seem to have : that if you pressure free nations enough , if you bully , and threaten , and lash out we will cave in , and forget , and eventually concede , " rice said according to excerpts released in advance by the state department .
" the united states and europe must stand up to this kind of behavior , and all who champion it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice 's comments are the harshest yet heard from the us government in her first major speech on russia since its military incursion into georgia last month , rice also said the russia-georgia war would not achieve the strategic objective moscow had hoped for . " russia 's leaders will not accomplish their primary war aim of removing georgia 's government , " she said .
" our strategic goal now is to make it clear to russia 's leaders that their choices are putting russia on a one-way path to self-imposed isolation and international irrelevance . " rice said the united states and europe must not allow russia 's " aggression " against the georgian government of president mikhail saakashvili to achieve any benefit . she said russia 's bid to join the world trade organization was now in question , as well as its attempt to join the organization of economic cooperation and development . russian forces drove deep into georgia in august after repelling an attempt by tbilisi to retake separatist south ossetia .
moscow then recognized south ossetia and separatist region abkhazia as independent states . no country except nicaragua has followed suit . georgia monitor mission talks freeze bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is demanding that south ossetian authorities decide on the osce mission rice 's comments came as talks on sending more monitors to georgia broke down because of disputes with russia on where they should be deployed , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said thursday .

" this is elevated to the political level and needs to be dealt with in capitals . " georgia 's osce envoy blamed russia 's refusal to let monitors into breakaway south ossetia and moscow 's demand that local authorities should decide the future osce mandate because it now considers the region " independent . " russian envoy anvar azimov said south ossetia was loath to let monitors back in because , it said , they had failed to alert them to georgia 's offensive to wrest back the region , and so they should be stationed in territory " from which the aggression came . " " they did not inform south ossetian authorities about the possible aggression , they did not prevent this aggression , " he said . russian forces to stay : kouchner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diplomacy alone may not be able to shift russian forces from south ossetia or abkhazia france 's foreign minister said the world should not expect russia to pull out of georgia 's two breakaway provinces anytime soon . bernard kouchner 's comment was the clearest sign yet that the european union may be accepting the possibility that georgia will not regain control of south ossetia or abkhazia .

she said the us and europe have to show moscow it is internationally isolating itself . the united states and european union have to stand up to moscow 's " bullying " and keep russia from benefiting from its military move into georgia , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice said in a harshly-worded speech on thursday . " we can not afford to validate the prejudices that some russian leaders seem to have : that if you pressure free nations enough , if you bully , and threaten , and lash out we will cave in , and forget , and eventually concede , " rice said according to excerpts released in advance by the state department .
" the united states and europe must stand up to this kind of behavior , and all who champion it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice 's comments are the harshest yet heard from the us government in her first major speech on russia since its military incursion into georgia last month , rice also said the russia-georgia war would not achieve the strategic objective moscow had hoped for . " russia 's leaders will not accomplish their primary war aim of removing georgia 's government , " she said .
" our strategic goal now is to make it clear to russia 's leaders that their choices are putting russia on a one-way path to self-imposed isolation and international irrelevance . " rice said the united states and europe must not allow russia 's " aggression " against the georgian government of president mikhail saakashvili to achieve any benefit . she said russia 's bid to join the world trade organization was now in question , as well as its attempt to join the organization of economic cooperation and development . russian forces drove deep into georgia in august after repelling an attempt by tbilisi to retake separatist south ossetia .
moscow then recognized south ossetia and separatist region abkhazia as independent states . no country except nicaragua has followed suit . georgia monitor mission talks freeze bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is demanding that south ossetian authorities decide on the osce mission rice 's comments came as talks on sending more monitors to georgia broke down because of disputes with russia on where they should be deployed , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said thursday .

the sum was increased from the originally reported 300 million euros after taking changes in the dollar-euro exchange into account .
kfw , which holds government stock portfolios and makes soft loans to home-owners and students , suspended executive board members detlef leinberger and peter fleischer , said german economics minister peter glos .
glos chairs the supervisory board of kfw , dubbed " germany 's dumbest bank " by the mass-circulation paper bild on thursday .
a more junior manager was also suspended . the two " board members responsible " at the kfw development bank were suspended with immediate effect until the incident is cleared up , glos and german finance minister peer steinbrueck said in a joint statement .
kfw said earlier its exposure to the lehman failure , including the unwise remittance and 186 million euros in credit , totaled 536 million euros . the current global financial crisis has prompted steinbrueck to summon finance and banking leaders to a berlin summit next week , the business daily financial times deutschland reported . lone star sale approved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kfw sold its stake in the ikb bank to us equity firm lone star the supervisory board also approved the sale of a kfw subsidiary , ikb , to us private-equity investor lone star .

in germany 's worst hit from the us sub-prime meltdown , ikb lost hundreds of millions of euros last year after investing in nearly worthless structured-finance paper secured with us home mortgages . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite several past attempts , the two coalition partners have never managed to find a common position on late-term abortions .
a late-term abortion is a termination which is carried out after the 20th week in a pregnancy when there is a risk to the physical or mental health of the mother .
most late-term abortions are carried out when prenatal diagnosis reveals that the fetus has a severe disability .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the cdu 's motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counselling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , spd : " i can see supporting this motion . "
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law would foresee a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .
mixed views within spd " that the spd is once again thinking about supporting our motion is an encouraging signal , " said johannes singhammer , the conservatives ' parliamentary spokesman on family affairs .
but within the spd , opinion is still split .
" i can see supporting this motion , " said renate schmidt , the spd 's former minister for family affairs .
but the social democrats ' deputy parliamentary group head , christel humme , speaks for others in the party who say that there is no need for new abortion legislation .
in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio , she said that , if anything , women should receive such counseling earlier on in their pregnancy before they are confronted with the knowledge that they are carrying a potentially disabled fetus .
" many women have said to me that if they had only known what was coming their way , then they might not have had amniocentesis done , for example , " humme said .
the spd 's former coalition partner , the green party , is against the cdu 's motion , calling it unnecessary .
neither the threat of a fine for doctors nor an increase in paperwork will help women who find themselves in a very difficult situation , said the green 's spokeswoman for women 's issues , irmingard schewe-gerigk . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , spd : " i can see supporting this motion . "
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law would foresee a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .
mixed views within spd " that the spd is once again thinking about supporting our motion is an encouraging signal , " said johannes singhammer , the conservatives ' parliamentary spokesman on family affairs .
but within the spd , opinion is still split .
" i can see supporting this motion , " said renate schmidt , the spd 's former minister for family affairs .
but the social democrats ' deputy parliamentary group head , christel humme , speaks for others in the party who say that there is no need for new abortion legislation .
in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio , she said that , if anything , women should receive such counseling earlier on in their pregnancy before they are confronted with the knowledge that they are carrying a potentially disabled fetus .
" many women have said to me that if they had only known what was coming their way , then they might not have had amniocentesis done , for example , " humme said .
the spd 's former coalition partner , the green party , is against the cdu 's motion , calling it unnecessary .
neither the threat of a fine for doctors nor an increase in paperwork will help women who find themselves in a very difficult situation , said the green 's spokeswoman for women 's issues , irmingard schewe-gerigk . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one lawmaker has called for the " total reform " of kfw in the wake of a major payment error , while another has raised doubts about the costly bailout of crippled subsidiary ikb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the ikb bailout be less than certain ?
late thursday , sept .

seeking explanation for transfer the bank 's supervisory board , largely composed of german parliamentarians , will use that meeting to hear an explanation of kfw 's mistaken transfer of 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .
kfw declared the transfer , part of a swap arrangement , a " technical blunder . "
but critics said they should have held on to the money , knowing from sunday news reports that lehman was broke .
swaps are often programmed in advance into computers so that they happen without human intervention .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig said the remittance was " infuriating " and those to blame must be found , but an aide to economics minister michael glos - who currently sits at the head the kfw supervisory board - said it was too early to say if anyone would be punished .

ahead of the meeting thursday , opposition parliamentarian and kfw supervisory board member juergen koppelin called for a total reform of the german state development bank .
he said he feared that losses through the faulty bank transfer could add up to far more than the 300 million euros already known .
lawmaker : ' total reform ' is needed " i think the consequence should be total reform , " koppelin told ard television news on thursday .
the supervisory board should be made smaller , and a fact-finding commission should be established to explain the error , he said .
another problem is that supervisory board members are not well enough informed by the kfw management board , he said .
that subject is also likely to be on the agenda at thursday afternoon 's final vote to approve the sale of kfw 's troubled subsidiary ikb to us financial investor lone star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos : too soon to say who will be punished while the deal is considered certain , green party politican and kfw supervisory board member christine scheel complained to the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that she and the other supervisory board members feel they have n't been adequately informed about the terms of the sale agreement .
20 questions for michael glos " i can not imagine that we can comprehend and decide upon such a complex deal in the form of a hand-out or , worse , a verbal explanation , " she told the paper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 18.09.2008 pressure mounts on german bank after mistaken payment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some opposition politicians are making hay from kfw 's troubles amid growing outrage over the planned bailout of a subsidiary and a mistaken money transfer , pressure is mounting on germany 's kfw development bank . amid the damaging fallout from the us banking crisis , german state development bank kfw has come under increased criticism from several of its own supervisory board members .
one lawmaker has called for the " total reform " of kfw in the wake of a major payment error , while another has raised doubts about the costly bailout of crippled subsidiary ikb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the ikb bailout be less than certain ?
late thursday , sept .
18 , the kfw board is slated to meet in berlin for a formal vote to approve the sale of ikb deutsche industriebank , a subsidiary of kfw that was hit hard in by subprime mortgage exposure in the us , to us financial investor lone star .
seeking explanation for transfer the bank 's supervisory board , largely composed of german parliamentarians , will use that meeting to hear an explanation of kfw 's mistaken transfer of 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .
kfw declared the transfer , part of a swap arrangement , a " technical blunder . "
but critics said they should have held on to the money , knowing from sunday news reports that lehman was broke .
swaps are often programmed in advance into computers so that they happen without human intervention .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig said the remittance was " infuriating " and those to blame must be found , but an aide to economics minister michael glos - who currently sits at the head the kfw supervisory board - said it was too early to say if anyone would be punished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why did kfw send a payment to bankrupt firm ?
ahead of the meeting thursday , opposition parliamentarian and kfw supervisory board member juergen koppelin called for a total reform of the german state development bank .
he said he feared that losses through the faulty bank transfer could add up to far more than the 300 million euros already known .
lawmaker : ' total reform ' is needed " i think the consequence should be total reform , " koppelin told ard television news on thursday .
the supervisory board should be made smaller , and a fact-finding commission should be established to explain the error , he said .
another problem is that supervisory board members are not well enough informed by the kfw management board , he said .
that subject is also likely to be on the agenda at thursday afternoon 's final vote to approve the sale of kfw 's troubled subsidiary ikb to us financial investor lone star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos : too soon to say who will be punished while the deal is considered certain , green party politican and kfw supervisory board member christine scheel complained to the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that she and the other supervisory board members feel they have n't been adequately informed about the terms of the sale agreement .
20 questions for michael glos " i can not imagine that we can comprehend and decide upon such a complex deal in the form of a hand-out or , worse , a verbal explanation , " she told the paper .
scheel accused supervisory board leader michael glos of denying the supervisory board members any actual decision-making power by withholding the information .
she demanded that glos and kfw chairman ulrich schroeder answer 20 detailed questions on the sale .
set up in 1948 to administer marshall plan funds , kfw is the german federal government 's in-house bank and lends to home-owners and industry . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the willingness to change is what made new labour so dominant , he wrote in a pamphlet for think tank progress .
" now change beckons once again , " he said .
commentators say the article contains implicit criticism of the pm .
meanwhile , a number of senior party figures have said labour needs to " get off the back foot " and " rediscover the passion " that helped it into power .
' tax limits ' in the pamphlet , published just days before the labour conference , mr milburn said the public had reached the limits of what they would pay in taxes and said more power should be handed back from whitehall to local communities .
mr milburn wrote : " one of new labour 's key strengths has been its preparedness to face the future challenge rather than taking comfort in the past achievement .

the willingness to change is what made new labour so dominant , he wrote in a pamphlet for think tank progress .
" now change beckons once again , " he said .
commentators say the article contains implicit criticism of the pm .
meanwhile , a number of senior party figures have said labour needs to " get off the back foot " and " rediscover the passion " that helped it into power .
' tax limits ' in the pamphlet , published just days before the labour conference , mr milburn said the public had reached the limits of what they would pay in taxes and said more power should be handed back from whitehall to local communities .
mr milburn wrote : " one of new labour 's key strengths has been its preparedness to face the future challenge rather than taking comfort in the past achievement .
" the willingness to change is what has made new labour so dominant in british politics and forced even our most strident opponents into contemplating changes they once thought abhorrent .

ceredigion council decided to break with tradition a year ago and added frozen options to its menu of hot food in an attempt to cut costs .
but it is thought just 21 senior citizens are choosing frozen meals with more than 300 selecting the hot option .
the council said the " low " take-up was costing its social services department .
plans were to save some of the £ 170,000 it spends on meals-on-wheels annually by replacing daily fresh meals with frozen food delivered on a weekly or fortnightly basis .
however , these were opposed by plaid cymru and a compromise was reached allowing pensioners to choose between frozen and hot meals . "
i think the plaid cymru stance of opposing the introduction of frozen foods by the council has been completely vindicated " ellen ap gwynn , plaid cymru " at this stage , the take-up of pre-frozen meals is low , " said parry davies , director of ceredigion 's social services .
" although disappointing , that is not surprising to ceredigion 's social services department given the debate that occurred and the fact that the service has only been in place for a few months .
" had the arrangements proposed been adopted in their original format and implemented by the county council , the forecast savings to ceredigion 's social services budget would have been £ 120,000 .
" because the proposed arrangements were amended , the current forecast savings for 2008-09 are currently estimated to be in the region of £ 70,000 .
" it must be emphasised , however , that that estimate is based on financial analysis on the first quarter of the 2008-09 financial year . "
' completely vindicated ' plaid cymru councillors fought this year 's local elections on the meals-on-wheels issue and said the lack of numbers taking up the frozen food option proved it had been right to do so .
plaid cymru leader on ceredigion council , ellen ap gwynn , said : " we really pushed it hard and forced the council 's cabinet to fall back and have a rethink about introducing frozen foods .
" i think the plaid cymru stance of opposing the introduction of frozen foods by the council has been completely vindicated .
" obviously , the vast majority of people agree with us because they are choosing to eat locally-produced and freshly cooked meals which is what we wanted to continue in the first place . "
the council provides about 100,000 meals a year which benefit hundreds of local elderly and vulnerable people .

ceredigion council decided to break with tradition a year ago and added frozen options to its menu of hot food in an attempt to cut costs .
but it is thought just 21 senior citizens are choosing frozen meals with more than 300 selecting the hot option .
the council said the " low " take-up was costing its social services department .
plans were to save some of the £ 170,000 it spends on meals-on-wheels annually by replacing daily fresh meals with frozen food delivered on a weekly or fortnightly basis .
however , these were opposed by plaid cymru and a compromise was reached allowing pensioners to choose between frozen and hot meals .
i think the plaid cymru stance of opposing the introduction of frozen foods by the council has been completely vindicated ellen ap gwynn , plaid cymru " at this stage , the take-up of pre-frozen meals is low , " said parry davies , director of ceredigion 's social services .
" although disappointing , that is not surprising to ceredigion 's social services department given the debate that occurred and the fact that the service has only been in place for a few months .
" had the arrangements proposed been adopted in their original format and implemented by the county council , the forecast savings to ceredigion 's social services budget would have been £ 120,000 .
" because the proposed arrangements were amended , the current forecast savings for 2008-09 are currently estimated to be in the region of £ 70,000 .
" it must be emphasised , however , that that estimate is based on financial analysis on the first quarter of the 2008-09 financial year . "
' completely vindicated ' plaid cymru councillors fought this year 's local elections on the meals-on-wheels issue and said the lack of numbers taking up the frozen food option proved it had been right to do so .
plaid cymru leader on ceredigion council , ellen ap gwynn , said : " we really pushed it hard and forced the council 's cabinet to fall back and have a rethink about introducing frozen foods .
" i think the plaid cymru stance of opposing the introduction of frozen foods by the council has been completely vindicated .
" obviously , the vast majority of people agree with us because they are choosing to eat locally-produced and freshly cooked meals which is what we wanted to continue in the first place . "
the council provides about 100,000 meals a year which benefit hundreds of local elderly and vulnerable people .

by lucy fleming bbc news sorting out the mess of zimbabwe 's agricultural sector will be key to breathing life back into the country 's economy and to the success of the power-sharing deal signed this week .
the detailed agreement devotes a whole section to the " land question " .
it notes that the fast-tracked farm redistribution is " irreversible " , something president robert mugabe defiantly reiterated at the signing ceremony with the words : " zimbabwe 's land belongs to zimbabweans . "
" i do have neighbours who have really battled , because we do n't have the finance " new farmer musa kwedza hunger road trip of rural areas but farmer alan smith -lrb- not his real name -rrb- , who has been kicked off four properties since 2000 , says the deal also provides hope for white farmers wanting to get back to the soil .
" we still love the country .
if there is a chance to get back to productive farming without political interference and without the continuous threat of violence , i really believe that a lot of people -lsb- white farmers -rsb- would come back , " he said .
his optimism is based on a number of concessions in the new negotiated settlement .
firstly , there is to be an audit of the land to eliminate " multiple farm ownerships " .
this has long been a call by the former opposition movement for democratic change , which feels that much of the 11m hectares of prime farmland taken from 4,000 mainly white farmers has been given to ruling party loyalists .
" anyone who has multi farms which they obtained under the land reform programme would have to lose , because it 's one person per farm , " justice minister patrick chinamasa , zanu-pf negotiator of the power-sharing agreement , confirmed to the bbc .
security of tenure the deal also says that all zimbabweans can be considered for land " irrespective of race , gender , religion , ethnicity or political affiliation " .
for the commercial farmers union -lrb- cfu -rrb- , which claims its member have been unfairly prejudiced in the chaotic redistribution programme , it is a shift in policy .
" that is a tremendous positive from where we 've come from , " cfu president trevor gifford said .
he also points to the security of tenure the agreement guarantees to land holders , as key to rebooting the sector .
details of the guarantee are yet to be decided , mr chinamasa says , but it is likely that land , now considered state property , will be allocated on 99-year leases .
this will allow capital to be raised , which the justice minister says , has stunted new farmers , leaving them unable to pay for equipment and seeds . "
it 's our right to be compensated for what 's been taken away from us " farmer gordon stokes " i do have neighbours who have really battled , because we do n't have the finance , " businessman and new farmer musa kwedza , who was allocated a small-scale commercial farm in 2005 , told the bbc .
in his opinion , the land audit will weed out those who are not serious about farming and the security of tenure will spur growth .
mr smith agrees the leases will be a good compromise to allow farmers to raise cash - and it is money that the agricultural sector desperately needs .
" i 'm on the ground and basically everything has been laid to waste - buildings and barns - all the boreholes need to refitted , dams need to be repaired , " he says .
' once bitten , twice shy ' the deal calls on the international community to support land reform , and in particular it asks the uk to pay compensation to white farmers who lost their land .

it 's not like we took the land from anybody ; it was purchased , " said gordon stokes , who now farms in the uk .
but even if compensation was paid out , he has no intention of uprooting his family again .
" if you 've a reasonable job elsewhere , would you go back to no health service , a place where all the teachers have left and there is no security ? "
former farmer jason davies , who left zimbabwe for the uk 10 years ago , agrees .
" once bitten , twice shy , " he says .
" the risk is too high and it 's not stable enough .
when mugabe dies , there 's going to be a power struggle , then what happens ? "
some white farmers still in zimbabwe , like the 11 fighting their case at the southern african development community tribunal , alleging the land reforms were racist , are more dogged . "
they 're not getting their farms back .
anyone who wants to till the land must queue up like anybody else " justice minister patrick chinamasa and one former farmer in the capital , harare , told the bbc he " would not hesitate " to go back to the land if he was offered his old farm back , with or without compensation .
however , mr chinamasa is quick to point out that they can apply for land , but not request specific plots .
" they 're not getting their farms back .
anyone who wants to till the land must queue up like anybody else . "
he maintains the zanu-pf line that it is the uk to blame for snarling up land reform by reneging on promises to pay out compensation under former prime minister tony blair .
but the uk foreign office told the bbc the government had fulfilled its obligations under the 1979 lancaster house agreement and had " never agreed … to accept responsibility for compensation " .
" we have always expressed our willingness to work with others to support a fair and transparent process of land reform , " a spokesperson said .
" we will be willing to consider supporting such a process as part of the wider recovery package . "
' mugabe not the issue ' the tired dialogue even seems to have wearied mr chinamasa : " let 's not hark to the past … as far we are concerned the objectives of the liberation struggle have been confirmed . "
" i do n't have any doubt that zimbabwe will become the bread basket of africa again " farmer alan smith but for mr smith , it does not matter how the money is labelled , as long as it is forthcoming .
" whether it 's compensation or a grant is immaterial ; at the end of the day there has to be a financial injection in order to get the farms running again , " he says .
" i do n't have any doubt that zimbabwe will become the bread basket of africa again and i will be here to be a part of it .
it 's just a matter of time . "
mr kwedza is equally optimistic , but says the " wait-and-see attitude " from donors so far has been a disappointment .
" robert mugabe is not the issue .
the dispensation is new , " he says .
" it will be very exciting to see white farmers , black farmers - all of us - working side by side towards the turning around of this economy . "

by lucy fleming bbc news sorting out the mess of zimbabwe 's agricultural sector will be key to breathing life back into the country 's economy and to the success of the power-sharing deal signed this week .
the detailed agreement devotes a whole section to the " land question " .
it notes that the fast-tracked farm redistribution is " irreversible " , something president robert mugabe defiantly reiterated at the signing ceremony with the words : " zimbabwe 's land belongs to zimbabweans . "
i do have neighbours who have really battled , because we do n't have the finance new farmer musa kwedza hunger road trip of rural areas but farmer alan smith -lrb- not his real name -rrb- , who has been kicked off four properties since 2000 , says the deal also provides hope for white farmers wanting to get back to the soil .
" we still love the country .
if there is a chance to get back to productive farming without political interference and without the continuous threat of violence , i really believe that a lot of people -lsb- white farmers -rsb- would come back , " he said .
his optimism is based on a number of concessions in the new negotiated settlement .
firstly , there is to be an audit of the land to eliminate " multiple farm ownerships " .
this has long been a call by the former opposition movement for democratic change , which feels that much of the 11m hectares of prime farmland taken from 4,000 mainly white farmers has been given to ruling party loyalists .
" anyone who has multi farms which they obtained under the land reform programme would have to lose , because it 's one person per farm , " justice minister patrick chinamasa , zanu-pf negotiator of the power-sharing agreement , confirmed to the bbc .
security of tenure the deal also says that all zimbabweans can be considered for land " irrespective of race , gender , religion , ethnicity or political affiliation " .
the land redistribution was often turned violent and chaotic for the commercial farmers union -lrb- cfu -rrb- , which claims its member have been unfairly prejudiced in the chaotic redistribution programme , it is a shift in policy .
" that is a tremendous positive from where we 've come from , " cfu president trevor gifford said .
he also points to the security of tenure the agreement guarantees to land holders , as key to rebooting the sector .
details of the guarantee are yet to be decided , mr chinamasa says , but it is likely that land , now considered state property , will be allocated on 99-year leases .
this will allow capital to be raised , which the justice minister says , has stunted new farmers , leaving them unable to pay for equipment and seeds .
it 's our right to be compensated for what 's been taken away from us farmer gordon stokes " i do have neighbours who have really battled , because we do n't have the finance , " businessman and new farmer musa kwedza , who was allocated a small-scale commercial farm in 2005 , told the bbc .
in his opinion , the land audit will weed out those who are not serious about farming and the security of tenure will spur growth .
mr smith agrees the leases will be a good compromise to allow farmers to raise cash - and it is money that the agricultural sector desperately needs .
" i 'm on the ground and basically everything has been laid to waste - buildings and barns - all the boreholes need to refitted , dams need to be repaired , " he says .
' once bitten , twice shy ' the deal calls on the international community to support land reform , and in particular it asks the uk to pay compensation to white farmers who lost their land .

it 's not like we took the land from anybody ; it was purchased , " said gordon stokes , who now farms in the uk .
but even if compensation was paid out , he has no intention of uprooting his family again .
" if you 've a reasonable job elsewhere , would you go back to no health service , a place where all the teachers have left and there is no security ? "
former farmer jason davies , who left zimbabwe for the uk 10 years ago , agrees .
" once bitten , twice shy , " he says .
" the risk is too high and it 's not stable enough .
when mugabe dies , there 's going to be a power struggle , then what happens ? "
some white farmers still in zimbabwe , like the 11 fighting their case at the southern african development community tribunal , alleging the land reforms were racist , are more dogged .
they 're not getting their farms back .
anyone who wants to till the land must queue up like anybody else justice minister patrick chinamasa and one former farmer in the capital , harare , told the bbc he " would not hesitate " to go back to the land if he was offered his old farm back , with or without compensation .
however , mr chinamasa is quick to point out that they can apply for land , but not request specific plots .
" they 're not getting their farms back .
anyone who wants to till the land must queue up like anybody else . "
he maintains the zanu-pf line that it is the uk to blame for snarling up land reform by reneging on promises to pay out compensation under former prime minister tony blair .
but the uk foreign office told the bbc the government had fulfilled its obligations under the 1979 lancaster house agreement and had " never agreed … to accept responsibility for compensation " .
" we have always expressed our willingness to work with others to support a fair and transparent process of land reform , " a spokesperson said .
" we will be willing to consider supporting such a process as part of the wider recovery package . "
' mugabe not the issue ' the tired dialogue even seems to have wearied mr chinamasa : " let 's not hark to the past … as far we are concerned the objectives of the liberation struggle have been confirmed . "
i do n't have any doubt that zimbabwe will become the bread basket of africa again farmer alan smith but for mr smith , it does not matter how the money is labelled , as long as it is forthcoming .
" whether it 's compensation or a grant is immaterial ; at the end of the day there has to be a financial injection in order to get the farms running again , " he says .
" i do n't have any doubt that zimbabwe will become the bread basket of africa again and i will be here to be a part of it .
it 's just a matter of time . "
mr kwedza is equally optimistic , but says the " wait-and-see attitude " from donors so far has been a disappointment .
" robert mugabe is not the issue .
the dispensation is new , " he says .
" it will be very exciting to see white farmers , black farmers - all of us - working side by side towards the turning around of this economy . "

details of the guarantee are yet to be decided , mr chinamasa says , but it is likely that land , now considered state property , will be allocated on 99-year leases .
this will allow capital to be raised , which the justice minister says , has stunted new farmers , leaving them unable to pay for equipment and seeds .
it 's our right to be compensated for what 's been taken away from us farmer gordon stokes " i do have neighbours who have really battled , because we do n't have the finance , " businessman and new farmer musa kwedza , who was allocated a small-scale commercial farm in 2005 , told the bbc .
in his opinion , the land audit will weed out those who are not serious about farming and the security of tenure will spur growth .
mr smith agrees the leases will be a good compromise to allow farmers to raise cash - and it is money that the agricultural sector desperately needs .
" i 'm on the ground and basically everything has been laid to waste - buildings and barns - all the boreholes need to refitted , dams need to be repaired , " he says .
' once bitten , twice shy ' the deal calls on the international community to support land reform , and in particular it asks the uk to pay compensation to white farmers who lost their land .
read the agreement agreement between zanu-pf and mdc on resolving the challenges facing zimbabwe -lsb- 163.25kb -rsb- most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader download the reader here " it 's our right to be compensated for what 's been taken away from us .
it 's not like we took the land from anybody ; it was purchased , " said gordon stokes , who now farms in the uk .
but even if compensation was paid out , he has no intention of uprooting his family again .
" if you 've a reasonable job elsewhere , would you go back to no health service , a place where all the teachers have left and there is no security ? "
former farmer jason davies , who left zimbabwe for the uk 10 years ago , agrees .
" once bitten , twice shy , " he says .
" the risk is too high and it 's not stable enough .
when mugabe dies , there 's going to be a power struggle , then what happens ? "
some white farmers still in zimbabwe , like the 11 fighting their case at the southern african development community tribunal , alleging the land reforms were racist , are more dogged .
they 're not getting their farms back .
anyone who wants to till the land must queue up like anybody else justice minister patrick chinamasa and one former farmer in the capital , harare , told the bbc he " would not hesitate " to go back to the land if he was offered his old farm back , with or without compensation .
however , mr chinamasa is quick to point out that they can apply for land , but not request specific plots .
" they 're not getting their farms back .
anyone who wants to till the land must queue up like anybody else . "
he maintains the zanu-pf line that it is the uk to blame for snarling up land reform by reneging on promises to pay out compensation under former prime minister tony blair .
but the uk foreign office told the bbc the government had fulfilled its obligations under the 1979 lancaster house agreement and had " never agreed … to accept responsibility for compensation " .
" we have always expressed our willingness to work with others to support a fair and transparent process of land reform , " a spokesperson said .
" we will be willing to consider supporting such a process as part of the wider recovery package . "
' mugabe not the issue ' the tired dialogue even seems to have wearied mr chinamasa : " let 's not hark to the past … as far we are concerned the objectives of the liberation struggle have been confirmed . "
i do n't have any doubt that zimbabwe will become the bread basket of africa again farmer alan smith but for mr smith , it does not matter how the money is labelled , as long as it is forthcoming .
" whether it 's compensation or a grant is immaterial ; at the end of the day there has to be a financial injection in order to get the farms running again , " he says .
" i do n't have any doubt that zimbabwe will become the bread basket of africa again and i will be here to be a part of it .
it 's just a matter of time . "
mr kwedza is equally optimistic , but says the " wait-and-see attitude " from donors so far has been a disappointment .
" robert mugabe is not the issue .
the dispensation is new , " he says .
" it will be very exciting to see white farmers , black farmers - all of us - working side by side towards the turning around of this economy . "

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- q & a : lloyds tsb and hbos bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies 07:26 gmt , thursday , 18 september 2008 08:26 uk q & a : lloyds tsb and hbos lloyds tsb , one of the uk 's biggest high street banks , is to merge with hbos after effectively staging a rescue takeover .
together the banks hold close to one-third of the uk 's savings and mortgage market and a large slice of the personal banking and business banking markets .
the bbc explains the implications of the deal going through .
q. i 've got a mortgage with one of the banks – how will it affect me ?
hardly at all .
you will still be obliged to pay off your home loan at the agreed rate .
in due course you may find that you are receiving letters from a different administration department , with a different name on the letter head .
on its own , a merger should not affect the interest rate that you are charged currently as that is dictated by the bank of england and the rates banks charge each other in the wholesale financial markets .
q. and what about our savings account ?
you have nothing to worry about .
both banks are solvent , and the government 's desire to make sure no one even thinks that hbos might be in some sort of difficulty is , effectively , a state guarantee of safety for your savings .
plus , the financial services compensation scheme guarantees the first £ 35,000 of your cash anyway , in the event of an actual insolvency .
you can sleep easy .
q. but i have an account with both banks .
what then ?
under the terms of the financial services compensation scheme -lrb- fscs -rrb- , the compensation for savers in bust banks goes up to £ 35,000 per " authorised institution " , not per account .
if a newly merged bank became just one authorised institution with the financial services authority -lrb- fsa -rrb- then you would have cover for only the first £ 35,000 of your money , not more .
but banks sometimes retain their separate authorisations with the fsa after a merger , as in the case of the rbs and the natwest .
q. what happens to staff at these banks , will there be job cuts ?
yes .
when two huge businesses such as these merge , there are always likely to be job cuts where the companies ' operations overlap .
lloyds has confirmed the deal will trigger job losses but played down claims that up to 40,000 staff face the axe .
q. what about shareholders in the two banks ?
under the terms of the takeover deal , lloyds will offer 0.83 of its shares for each hbos share .
based on lloyds ' closing price of 279.75p on wednesday , this values hbos shares at 232p each .
while this is a 58 % premium over hbos 's closing share price of 147.1p on wednesday , it is still far lower than the near £ 10 a share seen in october last year .
if you have shares in lloyds tsb you may be wondering if this is really such a good deal .
if there is an underlying problem with the finances of hbos it will not disappear just because a bigger beast has swallowed it up .
it just means there is more money available to pay the cost .
and that is now going to be financed partly by your bank .
assuming that times in the banking business eventually return to some sort of normality , the new larger bank should , to some extent , return to its previous life - one in which it made profits on a gigantic scale .
that is simply because it will be the biggest bank in one of the world 's largest economies .
but for the time being your bank has become an even bigger bet on the health of the uk property market .
how lucky do you feel ?
q. where does the deal leave the other uk banks ?
on the face of it , at a considerable competitive disadvantage .
but if this move manages to squash any fears in the industry that insolvency lies around the corner for any bank , then they may well benefit from this general reassurance .
not all banks are the same though .
hbos was undoubtedly " too big to fail " .
the same can not be said of other smaller operators , especially those still heavily reliant for business on lending mortgages .
house prices are falling and mortgage lending is shrinking .
their finances are going to come under increasing strain , not less .
q. why this sudden merger , i thought both banks were sound ?
it looks like a rescue .
industry experts have calculated that hbos had to buy back £ 150bn of short term bonds - glorified ious - by june next year .
they would then need to re-sell them to raise fresh cash .
where would hbos get the cash ?
who might buy its bits of paper again ?
all this uncertainty seems to have contributed to the hbos share price collapsing .
and if a crisis of confidence grips the financial markets , it is all but impossible to shake off .
as the administrators to the now defunct us investment bank lehman brothers pointed out , if you are a bank and no one will trade with you , you are dead .

under the terms of the takeover deal , lloyds will offer 0.83 of its shares for each hbos share .
based on lloyds ' closing price of 279.75p on wednesday , this values hbos shares at 232p each .
while this is a 58 % premium over hbos 's closing share price of 147.1p on wednesday , it is still far lower than the near £ 10 a share seen in october last year .
if you have shares in lloyds tsb you may be wondering if this is really such a good deal .
if there is an underlying problem with the finances of hbos it will not disappear just because a bigger beast has swallowed it up .
it just means there is more money available to pay the cost .
and that is now going to be financed partly by your bank .
assuming that times in the banking business eventually return to some sort of normality , the new larger bank should , to some extent , return to its previous life - one in which it made profits on a gigantic scale .
that is simply because it will be the biggest bank in one of the world 's largest economies .
but for the time being your bank has become an even bigger bet on the health of the uk property market .
how lucky do you feel ?
q. where does the deal leave the other uk banks ?
on the face of it , at a considerable competitive disadvantage .
but if this move manages to squash any fears in the industry that insolvency lies around the corner for any bank , then they may well benefit from this general reassurance .
not all banks are the same though .
hbos was undoubtedly " too big to fail " .
the same can not be said of other smaller operators , especially those still heavily reliant for business on lending mortgages .
house prices are falling and mortgage lending is shrinking .
their finances are going to come under increasing strain , not less .
q. why this sudden merger , i thought both banks were sound ?
it looks like a rescue .
industry experts have calculated that hbos had to buy back £ 150bn of short term bonds - glorified ious - by june next year .
they would then need to re-sell them to raise fresh cash .
where would hbos get the cash ?
who might buy its bits of paper again ?
all this uncertainty seems to have contributed to the hbos share price collapsing .
and if a crisis of confidence grips the financial markets , it is all but impossible to shake off .
as the administrators to the now defunct us investment bank lehman brothers pointed out , if you are a bank and no one will trade with you , you are dead .

paul lewis of radio 4 's moneybox answers your questions lloyds tsb , one of the uk 's biggest high street banks , is to merge with hbos after effectively staging a rescue takeover .
together the banks hold close to one-third of the uk 's savings and mortgage market and a large slice of the personal banking and business banking markets .
the bbc explains the implications of the deal going through .
q. i 've got a mortgage with one of the banks – how will it affect me ?
hardly at all .
you will still be obliged to pay off your home loan at the agreed rate .
in due course you may find that you are receiving letters from a different administration department , with a different name on the letter head .
on its own , a merger should not affect the interest rate that you are charged currently as that is dictated by the bank of england and the rates banks charge each other in the wholesale financial markets .
q. and what about our savings account ?
you have nothing to worry about .
both banks are solvent , and the government 's desire to make sure no one even thinks that hbos might be in some sort of difficulty is , effectively , a state guarantee of safety for your savings .
plus , the financial services compensation scheme guarantees the first £ 35,000 of your cash anyway , in the event of an actual insolvency .
you can sleep easy .
q. but i have an account with both banks .
what then ?
under the terms of the financial services compensation scheme -lrb- fscs -rrb- , the compensation for savers in bust banks goes up to £ 35,000 per " authorised institution " , not per account .
if a newly merged bank became just one authorised institution with the financial services authority -lrb- fsa -rrb- then you would have cover for only the first £ 35,000 of your money , not more .
but banks sometimes retain their separate authorisations with the fsa after a merger , as in the case of the rbs and the natwest .
q. what happens to staff at these banks , will there be job cuts ?
yes .
when two huge businesses such as these merge , there are always likely to be job cuts where the companies ' operations overlap .

in one of many celebrations around the uk , as the countdown to the closing ceremony began , a parade of 200 children carrying flags from 147 countries bustled down stoke mandeville stadium 's athletic track to a burst of music .
about 50 veteran paralympians followed , some wearing medals , alongside aspiring competitors for 2012 .
they gathered at one end of the track , directly in front of stoke mandeville hospital .
it was on the hospital 's lawn , 60 years ago , that dr ludwig guttmann - a neurologist who set up stoke mandeville 's spinal injuries unit in 1944 - held a competition for 16 british war veterans with spinal injuries as part of a rehabilitation programme .
he passionately believed that his patients , with the right help and support , could lead fulfilling lives .
early sports included archery , bowls , darts and skittles , and the event coincided with the opening of the olympic games in london .
over the next decade it grew , and in 1960 an olympic-style games for 400 disabled athletes was held for the first time in rome .
' life back ' the crowd gathered on the field track outside stoke mandeville hospital on wednesday , as the crowd watched live coverage from beijing 's bird 's nest stadium - where a 206-strong british team had won 102 medals - on a big screen , cheers erupted as they were told the paralympics were " truly coming home " .
the birthplace of the paralympic movement clearly had a very special place in the hearts of the spectators .
john harris , who competed in five paralympic games , winning a gold for discus in 1984 , said stoke mandeville " gave him back his life " .
he was paralysed at the age of 18 after falling 50ft -lrb- 18m -rrb- from a fairground ride , " spent five months in hospital and then wasted the next three years in the pub " .
after training with body builders at a local gym , he joined a paraplegic sports club .
one year later , he was selected for wales .
but he said the paralympics were very different back then .
like barracks " when i came to train at stoke mandeville , about 20 of us lived in huts .
it was like army barracks ; we just had two toilets .
but it was a tremendous atmosphere and i made lifelong friends . "
the veteran paralympian , who has also completed a marathon , raised £ 50,000 for a sports centre and presented a radio programme , said he would not change his life and had " no regrets whatsoever " .
" i ca n't change light bulbs and i ca n't run for the bus , but i have had a terrific life , " he said .
he said most people who have accidents which result in spinal injuries are between 18 and 25 .
but the media had helped change the perception of disabilities .
john harris and kevan baker became lifelong friends at the paralympics " people had no idea what we could do , only what we could n't do .
now the paralympics is on tv , it has shown people 's personalities .
children are seeing ' superstars ' who they can look up to . "
kevan baker , who is chairman of wheelpower , british wheelchair sport , and has been a paraplegic since a road accident in 1979 , said when people have a spinal injury accident " they believe they have no life " .
sport enables people to forget about their wheelchair , he said .
but the former discus world record holder said that as the paralympics had become more " well-established - like the able-bodied world , " it had been made tougher for competitors , sometimes taking about seven years to become a paralympic athlete .
' life-changing ' one british hopeful who has hit eyes firmly set on london 2012 is steve brown .
he broke his neck two years ago when he was 25 after falling from a balcony .
he spent four months in stoke mandeville hospital , participating in archery and shooting competitions towards the end .
steve brown , 27 , wants to compete in the 2012 paralympics now he is training in the gb wheelchair rugby squad and is " very hopeful " for the next paralympics , having just missed out on beijing .
" i love rugby ; it was life-changing .
i have never been more dedicated about anything .
it dictates what i eat , where i sleep - i train 25-30 hours a week .
it really helped with my self-confidence too . "
mr brown said he spends about £ 12,000 a year on the sport - which included £ 5,000 on a custom made sports wheelchair .
he said anyone who had a life-changing accident should play sport because " it 's motivational and creates goals and challenges " .
" it should n't have taken me to lose two-thirds of my body movement to want to live life to the full - but it did , " he added .
as the ceremony in stoke mandeville continued , three ex-paralympians and three 2012 hopefuls hoisted three flags - including a specially-commissioned 60th anniversary flag .
nick fuller , head of education at the london organising committee of the olympic and paralympic games -lrb- locog -rrb- , said : " it 's great to see ex-paralympians and young 2012 hopefuls , and critically school children , being brought into the heart of the celebrations . "
the organisation has launched a " get set " education programme , which its chairman , sebastian coe , said he hoped would " inspire children and young people through the london 2012 games " .
in stoke mandeville , the most visible excitement and vigorous flag waving from the children came on the arrival of a huge , 18 inch square cake .
but as the crowd assembled between the hospital where dr ludwig guttmann had worked , and stoke mandeville stadium , the national centre for disability sport and successor to the 1964 sports centre the retired doctor raised money to build , his daughter said she felt incredibly proud .
" he had a great vision - and this is what he would have expected to see , " said mrs eva loeffler .

in one of many celebrations around the uk , as the countdown to the closing ceremony began , a parade of 200 children carrying flags from 147 countries bustled down stoke mandeville stadium 's athletic track to a burst of music .
about 50 veteran paralympians followed , some wearing medals , alongside aspiring competitors for 2012 .
they gathered at one end of the track , directly in front of stoke mandeville hospital .
it was on the hospital 's lawn , 60 years ago , that dr ludwig guttmann - a neurologist who set up stoke mandeville 's spinal injuries unit in 1944 - held a competition for 16 british war veterans with spinal injuries as part of a rehabilitation programme .
he passionately believed that his patients , with the right help and support , could lead fulfilling lives .
early sports included archery , bowls , darts and skittles , and the event coincided with the opening of the olympic games in london .
over the next decade it grew , and in 1960 an olympic-style games for 400 disabled athletes was held for the first time in rome .
' life back ' the crowd gathered on the field track outside stoke mandeville hospital on wednesday , as the crowd watched live coverage from beijing 's bird 's nest stadium - where a 206-strong british team had won 102 medals - on a big screen , cheers erupted as they were told the paralympics were " truly coming home " .
the birthplace of the paralympic movement clearly had a very special place in the hearts of the spectators .
john harris , who competed in five paralympic games , winning a gold for discus in 1984 , said stoke mandeville " gave him back his life " .
he was paralysed at the age of 18 after falling 50ft -lrb- 18m -rrb- from a fairground ride , " spent five months in hospital and then wasted the next three years in the pub " .
after training with body builders at a local gym , he joined a paraplegic sports club .
one year later , he was selected for wales .
but he said the paralympics were very different back then .
like barracks " when i came to train at stoke mandeville , about 20 of us lived in huts .
it was like army barracks ; we just had two toilets .
but it was a tremendous atmosphere and i made lifelong friends . "
the veteran paralympian , who has also completed a marathon , raised £ 50,000 for a sports centre and presented a radio programme , said he would not change his life and had " no regrets whatsoever " .
" i ca n't change light bulbs and i ca n't run for the bus , but i have had a terrific life , " he said .
he said most people who have accidents which result in spinal injuries are between 18 and 25 .
but the media had helped change the perception of disabilities .
john harris and kevan baker became lifelong friends at the paralympics " people had no idea what we could do , only what we could n't do .
now the paralympics is on tv , it has shown people 's personalities .
children are seeing ' superstars ' who they can look up to . "
kevan baker , who is chairman of wheelpower , british wheelchair sport , and has been a paraplegic since a road accident in 1979 , said when people have a spinal injury accident " they believe they have no life " .
sport enables people to forget about their wheelchair , he said .
but the former discus world record holder said that as the paralympics had become more " well-established - like the able-bodied world , " it had been made tougher for competitors , sometimes taking about seven years to become a paralympic athlete .
' life-changing ' one british hopeful who has hit eyes firmly set on london 2012 is steve brown .
he broke his neck two years ago when he was 25 after falling from a balcony .
he spent four months in stoke mandeville hospital , participating in archery and shooting competitions towards the end .
steve brown , 27 , wants to compete in the 2012 paralympics now he is training in the gb wheelchair rugby squad and is " very hopeful " for the next paralympics , having just missed out on beijing .
" i love rugby ; it was life-changing .
i have never been more dedicated about anything .
it dictates what i eat , where i sleep - i train 25-30 hours a week .
it really helped with my self-confidence too . "
mr brown said he spends about £ 12,000 a year on the sport - which included £ 5,000 on a custom made sports wheelchair .
he said anyone who had a life-changing accident should play sport because " it 's motivational and creates goals and challenges " .
" it should n't have taken me to lose two-thirds of my body movement to want to live life to the full - but it did , " he added .
as the ceremony in stoke mandeville continued , three ex-paralympians and three 2012 hopefuls hoisted three flags - including a specially-commissioned 60th anniversary flag .
nick fuller , head of education at the london organising committee of the olympic and paralympic games -lrb- locog -rrb- , said : " it 's great to see ex-paralympians and young 2012 hopefuls , and critically school children , being brought into the heart of the celebrations . "
the organisation has launched a " get set " education programme , which its chairman , sebastian coe , said he hoped would " inspire children and young people through the london 2012 games " .
in stoke mandeville , the most visible excitement and vigorous flag waving from the children came on the arrival of a huge , 18 inch square cake .
but as the crowd assembled between the hospital where dr ludwig guttmann had worked , and stoke mandeville stadium , the national centre for disability sport and successor to the 1964 sports centre the retired doctor raised money to build , his daughter said she felt incredibly proud .
" he had a great vision - and this is what he would have expected to see , " said mrs eva loeffler .

' life-changing ' one british hopeful who has hit eyes firmly set on london 2012 is steve brown .
he broke his neck two years ago when he was 25 after falling from a balcony .
he spent four months in stoke mandeville hospital , participating in archery and shooting competitions towards the end .
steve brown , 27 , wants to compete in the 2012 paralympics now he is training in the gb wheelchair rugby squad and is " very hopeful " for the next paralympics , having just missed out on beijing .
" i love rugby ; it was life-changing .
i have never been more dedicated about anything .
it dictates what i eat , where i sleep - i train 25-30 hours a week .
it really helped with my self-confidence too . "
mr brown said he spends about £ 12,000 a year on the sport - which included £ 5,000 on a custom made sports wheelchair .
he said anyone who had a life-changing accident should play sport because " it 's motivational and creates goals and challenges " .
" it should n't have taken me to lose two-thirds of my body movement to want to live life to the full - but it did , " he added .
as the ceremony in stoke mandeville continued , three ex-paralympians and three 2012 hopefuls hoisted three flags - including a specially-commissioned 60th anniversary flag .
nick fuller , head of education at the london organising committee of the olympic and paralympic games -lrb- locog -rrb- , said : " it 's great to see ex-paralympians and young 2012 hopefuls , and critically school children , being brought into the heart of the celebrations . "
the organisation has launched a " get set " education programme , which its chairman , sebastian coe , said he hoped would " inspire children and young people through the london 2012 games " .
in stoke mandeville , the most visible excitement and vigorous flag waving from the children came on the arrival of a huge , 18 inch square cake .
but as the crowd assembled between the hospital where dr ludwig guttmann had worked , and stoke mandeville stadium , the national centre for disability sport and successor to the 1964 sports centre the retired doctor raised money to build , his daughter said she felt incredibly proud .
" he had a great vision - and this is what he would have expected to see , " said mrs eva loeffler .

in one of many celebrations around the uk , as the countdown to the closing ceremony began , a parade of 200 children carrying flags from 147 countries bustled down stoke mandeville stadium 's athletic track to a burst of music .
about 50 veteran paralympians followed , some wearing medals , alongside aspiring competitors for 2012 .
they gathered at one end of the track , directly in front of stoke mandeville hospital .
it was on the hospital 's lawn , 60 years ago , that dr ludwig guttmann - a neurologist who set up stoke mandeville 's spinal injuries unit in 1944 - held a competition for 16 british war veterans with spinal injuries as part of a rehabilitation programme .
he passionately believed that his patients , with the right help and support , could lead fulfilling lives .
early sports included archery , bowls , darts and skittles , and the event coincided with the opening of the olympic games in london .
over the next decade it grew , and in 1960 an olympic-style games for 400 disabled athletes was held for the first time in rome .
' life back ' the crowd gathered on the field track outside stoke mandeville hospital on wednesday , as the crowd watched live coverage from beijing 's bird 's nest stadium - where a 206-strong british team had won 102 medals - on a big screen , cheers erupted as they were told the paralympics were " truly coming home " .
the birthplace of the paralympic movement clearly had a very special place in the hearts of the spectators .
john harris , who competed in five paralympic games , winning a gold for discus in 1984 , said stoke mandeville " gave him back his life " .
he was paralysed at the age of 18 after falling 50ft -lrb- 18m -rrb- from a fairground ride , " spent five months in hospital and then wasted the next three years in the pub " .
after training with body builders at a local gym , he joined a paraplegic sports club .
one year later , he was selected for wales .
but he said the paralympics were very different back then .
like barracks " when i came to train at stoke mandeville , about 20 of us lived in huts .
it was like army barracks ; we just had two toilets .
but it was a tremendous atmosphere and i made lifelong friends . "
the veteran paralympian , who has also completed a marathon , raised £ 50,000 for a sports centre and presented a radio programme , said he would not change his life and had " no regrets whatsoever " .
" i ca n't change light bulbs and i ca n't run for the bus , but i have had a terrific life , " he said .
he said most people who have accidents which result in spinal injuries are between 18 and 25 .
but the media had helped change the perception of disabilities .
john harris and kevan baker became lifelong friends at the paralympics " people had no idea what we could do , only what we could n't do .
now the paralympics is on tv , it has shown people 's personalities .
children are seeing ' superstars ' who they can look up to . "
kevan baker , who is chairman of wheelpower , british wheelchair sport , and has been a paraplegic since a road accident in 1979 , said when people have a spinal injury accident " they believe they have no life " .
sport enables people to forget about their wheelchair , he said .
but the former discus world record holder said that as the paralympics had become more " well-established - like the able-bodied world , " it had been made tougher for competitors , sometimes taking about seven years to become a paralympic athlete .

in one of many celebrations around the uk , as the countdown to the closing ceremony began , a parade of 200 children carrying flags from 147 countries bustled down stoke mandeville stadium 's athletic track to a burst of music .
about 50 veteran paralympians followed , some wearing medals , alongside aspiring competitors for 2012 .
they gathered at one end of the track , directly in front of stoke mandeville hospital .
it was on the hospital 's lawn , 60 years ago , that dr ludwig guttmann - a neurologist who set up stoke mandeville 's spinal injuries unit in 1944 - held a competition for 16 british war veterans with spinal injuries as part of a rehabilitation programme .
he passionately believed that his patients , with the right help and support , could lead fulfilling lives .
early sports included archery , bowls , darts and skittles , and the event coincided with the opening of the olympic games in london .
over the next decade it grew , and in 1960 an olympic-style games for 400 disabled athletes was held for the first time in rome .
' life back ' the crowd gathered on the field track outside stoke mandeville hospital on wednesday , as the crowd watched live coverage from beijing 's bird 's nest stadium - where a 206-strong british team had won 102 medals - on a big screen , cheers erupted as they were told the paralympics were " truly coming home " .
the birthplace of the paralympic movement clearly had a very special place in the hearts of the spectators .
john harris , who competed in five paralympic games , winning a gold for discus in 1984 , said stoke mandeville " gave him back his life " .
he was paralysed at the age of 18 after falling 50ft -lrb- 18m -rrb- from a fairground ride , " spent five months in hospital and then wasted the next three years in the pub " .
after training with body builders at a local gym , he joined a paraplegic sports club .
one year later , he was selected for wales .
but he said the paralympics were very different back then .
like barracks " when i came to train at stoke mandeville , about 20 of us lived in huts .
it was like army barracks ; we just had two toilets .
but it was a tremendous atmosphere and i made lifelong friends . "
the veteran paralympian , who has also completed a marathon , raised £ 50,000 for a sports centre and presented a radio programme , said he would not change his life and had " no regrets whatsoever " .
" i ca n't change light bulbs and i ca n't run for the bus , but i have had a terrific life , " he said .
he said most people who have accidents which result in spinal injuries are between 18 and 25 .
but the media had helped change the perception of disabilities .
john harris and kevan baker became lifelong friends at the paralympics " people had no idea what we could do , only what we could n't do .
now the paralympics is on tv , it has shown people 's personalities .
children are seeing ' superstars ' who they can look up to . "
kevan baker , who is chairman of wheelpower , british wheelchair sport , and has been a paraplegic since a road accident in 1979 , said when people have a spinal injury accident " they believe they have no life " .
sport enables people to forget about their wheelchair , he said .
but the former discus world record holder said that as the paralympics had become more " well-established - like the able-bodied world , " it had been made tougher for competitors , sometimes taking about seven years to become a paralympic athlete .
' life-changing ' one british hopeful who has hit eyes firmly set on london 2012 is steve brown .
he broke his neck two years ago when he was 25 after falling from a balcony .
he spent four months in stoke mandeville hospital , participating in archery and shooting competitions towards the end .
steve brown , 27 , wants to compete in the 2012 paralympics now he is training in the gb wheelchair rugby squad and is " very hopeful " for the next paralympics , having just missed out on beijing .
" i love rugby ; it was life-changing .
i have never been more dedicated about anything .
it dictates what i eat , where i sleep - i train 25-30 hours a week .
it really helped with my self-confidence too . "
mr brown said he spends about £ 12,000 a year on the sport - which included £ 5,000 on a custom made sports wheelchair .
he said anyone who had a life-changing accident should play sport because " it 's motivational and creates goals and challenges " .
" it should n't have taken me to lose two-thirds of my body movement to want to live life to the full - but it did , " he added .
as the ceremony in stoke mandeville continued , three ex-paralympians and three 2012 hopefuls hoisted three flags - including a specially-commissioned 60th anniversary flag .
nick fuller , head of education at the london organising committee of the olympic and paralympic games -lrb- locog -rrb- , said : " it 's great to see ex-paralympians and young 2012 hopefuls , and critically school children , being brought into the heart of the celebrations . "
the organisation has launched a " get set " education programme , which its chairman , sebastian coe , said he hoped would " inspire children and young people through the london 2012 games " .
in stoke mandeville , the most visible excitement and vigorous flag waving from the children came on the arrival of a huge , 18 inch square cake .
but as the crowd assembled between the hospital where dr ludwig guttmann had worked , and stoke mandeville stadium , the national centre for disability sport and successor to the 1964 sports centre the retired doctor raised money to build , his daughter said she felt incredibly proud .
" he had a great vision - and this is what he would have expected to see , " said mrs eva loeffler .

' life back ' the crowd gathered on the field track outside stoke mandeville hospital on wednesday , as the crowd watched live coverage from beijing 's bird 's nest stadium - where a 206-strong british team had won 102 medals - on a big screen , cheers erupted as they were told the paralympics were " truly coming home " .
the birthplace of the paralympic movement clearly had a very special place in the hearts of the spectators .
john harris , who competed in five paralympic games , winning a gold for discus in 1984 , said stoke mandeville " gave him back his life " .
he was paralysed at the age of 18 after falling 50ft -lrb- 18m -rrb- from a fairground ride , " spent five months in hospital and then wasted the next three years in the pub " .
after training with body builders at a local gym , he joined a paraplegic sports club .
one year later , he was selected for wales .
but he said the paralympics were very different back then .
like barracks " when i came to train at stoke mandeville , about 20 of us lived in huts .
it was like army barracks ; we just had two toilets .
but it was a tremendous atmosphere and i made lifelong friends . "
the veteran paralympian , who has also completed a marathon , raised £ 50,000 for a sports centre and presented a radio programme , said he would not change his life and had " no regrets whatsoever " .
" i ca n't change light bulbs and i ca n't run for the bus , but i have had a terrific life , " he said .
he said most people who have accidents which result in spinal injuries are between 18 and 25 .
but the media had helped change the perception of disabilities .
john harris and kevan baker became lifelong friends at the paralympics " people had no idea what we could do , only what we could n't do .
now the paralympics is on tv , it has shown people 's personalities .
children are seeing ' superstars ' who they can look up to . "
kevan baker , who is chairman of wheelpower , british wheelchair sport , and has been a paraplegic since a road accident in 1979 , said when people have a spinal injury accident " they believe they have no life " .
sport enables people to forget about their wheelchair , he said .
but the former discus world record holder said that as the paralympics had become more " well-established - like the able-bodied world , " it had been made tougher for competitors , sometimes taking about seven years to become a paralympic athlete .
' life-changing ' one british hopeful who has hit eyes firmly set on london 2012 is steve brown .
he broke his neck two years ago when he was 25 after falling from a balcony .
he spent four months in stoke mandeville hospital , participating in archery and shooting competitions towards the end .
steve brown , 27 , wants to compete in the 2012 paralympics now he is training in the gb wheelchair rugby squad and is " very hopeful " for the next paralympics , having just missed out on beijing .
" i love rugby ; it was life-changing .
i have never been more dedicated about anything .
it dictates what i eat , where i sleep - i train 25-30 hours a week .
it really helped with my self-confidence too . "
mr brown said he spends about £ 12,000 a year on the sport - which included £ 5,000 on a custom made sports wheelchair .
he said anyone who had a life-changing accident should play sport because " it 's motivational and creates goals and challenges " .
" it should n't have taken me to lose two-thirds of my body movement to want to live life to the full - but it did , " he added .
as the ceremony in stoke mandeville continued , three ex-paralympians and three 2012 hopefuls hoisted three flags - including a specially-commissioned 60th anniversary flag .
nick fuller , head of education at the london organising committee of the olympic and paralympic games -lrb- locog -rrb- , said : " it 's great to see ex-paralympians and young 2012 hopefuls , and critically school children , being brought into the heart of the celebrations . "
the organisation has launched a " get set " education programme , which its chairman , sebastian coe , said he hoped would " inspire children and young people through the london 2012 games " .
in stoke mandeville , the most visible excitement and vigorous flag waving from the children came on the arrival of a huge , 18 inch square cake .
but as the crowd assembled between the hospital where dr ludwig guttmann had worked , and stoke mandeville stadium , the national centre for disability sport and successor to the 1964 sports centre the retired doctor raised money to build , his daughter said she felt incredibly proud .
" he had a great vision - and this is what he would have expected to see , " said mrs eva loeffler .

in one of many celebrations around the uk , as the countdown to the closing ceremony began , a parade of 200 children carrying flags from 147 countries bustled down stoke mandeville stadium 's athletic track to a burst of music .
about 50 veteran paralympians followed , some wearing medals , alongside aspiring competitors for 2012 .
they gathered at one end of the track , directly in front of stoke mandeville hospital .
it was on the hospital 's lawn , 60 years ago , that dr ludwig guttmann - a neurologist who set up stoke mandeville 's spinal injuries unit in 1944 - held a competition for 16 british war veterans with spinal injuries as part of a rehabilitation programme .
he passionately believed that his patients , with the right help and support , could lead fulfilling lives .

the data protection company , which surveyed 300 taxi drivers , warned users to password-protect equipment amid rising fears of identity theft .

new devices - including mobiles , mp3 players and memory sticks - have the capacity to store tens of thousands of documents or pictures and millions of contacts and emails , making them a target for identity theft criminals and hackers .
a survey by credit reference agency equifax in april suggested 16 % of its customers put pin numbers on their mobile devices while 24 % recorded birthday dates .
