international safety monitors however have questioned the claims citing poor ukrainian accounting for nuclear materials , and corruption among government employees . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now eu ministers are calling on tougher rules , which discourage illegal immigrants while still encouraging skilled foreign labor . european union justice ministers have announced that europe should take complete control of migration into and out of the continent , working with the rest of the world to end illegal migration and manage legal flows .
the news comes as eu ministers meet with their counterparts in the southern french beach resort of cannes . the informal meeting , a regular feature of eu politics , is aimed at getting ministers to agree on the broad outline of policies , so that they will find it easier to agree on the technical details at future , formal meetings . monday 's talks were set to be dominated by a proposal from the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , to create a " pact on immigration and asylum " between the eu 's 27 member states . the pact , which would not be legally binding but would carry political weight , asks eu member states to strengthen the fight against illegal immigration , to crack down on the employers of illegal migrants and to live up to their responsibility to expel illegal residents from their territory . at the same time , the pact urges eu members to put in place targeted immigration policies which would attract highly-qualified foreigners , in particular , to europe .
and it calls on the eu to work closely with countries of origin and transit , supporting development on their territories and making it easier for immigrants to send money home as a way of making it more attractive for potential migrants to stay at home . language toned down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people enter the eu illegally every year however , a draft of the pact agreed immediately before the meeting tones down considerably the strong language used in the initial text .
where the first draft listed strengthened border control as its top priority , that was relegated to number three in later versions , being supplanted by the question of boosting legal migration . the first draft also prioritized " organizing the effective removal of irregular residents from the eu " - an emphasis which chimes in with the policy of france 's president nicolas sarkozy , who has set annual quotas for expelling illegal immigrants . but the later text used a much softer tone , calling for a general " fight against illegal immigration , especially assuring the return of foreigners who are in an irregular situation to their country of origin or a transit country . " the first draft of the pact also stated categorically that " massive and collective legalizations produce a major pull effect " and that member states " agree to give them up . "
but the latest draft simply calls on member states to limit their legalizations to a case-by-case system in the future . french experts critical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been heavily criticized for his stance while that compromise paves the way for broad eu acceptance of the text at a summit in october , the news on the domestic front was less promising for the french government in its immigration plans . as the meeting opened , the french press reported that a commission of french experts formed by sarkozy to discuss his migration policies had roundly criticized key points . binding immigration quotas would be " unrealistic and pointless , " and the national authorities have " no discretionary power to determine the flow " of migrants into france , especially on family grounds , left-wing daily la liberation quoted the report . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news comes as eu ministers meet with their counterparts in the southern french beach resort of cannes . the informal meeting , a regular feature of eu politics , is aimed at getting ministers to agree on the broad outline of policies , so that they will find it easier to agree on the technical details at future , formal meetings . monday 's talks were set to be dominated by a proposal from the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , to create a " pact on immigration and asylum " between the eu 's 27 member states . the pact , which would not be legally binding but would carry political weight , asks eu member states to strengthen the fight against illegal immigration , to crack down on the employers of illegal migrants and to live up to their responsibility to expel illegal residents from their territory . at the same time , the pact urges eu members to put in place targeted immigration policies which would attract highly-qualified foreigners , in particular , to europe .
and it calls on the eu to work closely with countries of origin and transit , supporting development on their territories and making it easier for immigrants to send money home as a way of making it more attractive for potential migrants to stay at home . language toned down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people enter the eu illegally every year however , a draft of the pact agreed immediately before the meeting tones down considerably the strong language used in the initial text .
where the first draft listed strengthened border control as its top priority , that was relegated to number three in later versions , being supplanted by the question of boosting legal migration . the first draft also prioritized " organizing the effective removal of irregular residents from the eu " - an emphasis which chimes in with the policy of france 's president nicolas sarkozy , who has set annual quotas for expelling illegal immigrants . but the later text used a much softer tone , calling for a general " fight against illegal immigration , especially assuring the return of foreigners who are in an irregular situation to their country of origin or a transit country . " the first draft of the pact also stated categorically that " massive and collective legalizations produce a major pull effect " and that member states " agree to give them up . "
but the latest draft simply calls on member states to limit their legalizations to a case-by-case system in the future . french experts critical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been heavily criticized for his stance while that compromise paves the way for broad eu acceptance of the text at a summit in october , the news on the domestic front was less promising for the french government in its immigration plans . as the meeting opened , the french press reported that a commission of french experts formed by sarkozy to discuss his migration policies had roundly criticized key points . binding immigration quotas would be " unrealistic and pointless , " and the national authorities have " no discretionary power to determine the flow " of migrants into france , especially on family grounds , left-wing daily la liberation quoted the report . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first step would call on all sides to denounce violence and to allow the return of 250,000 refugees , spiegel reported .
the second would be to organize a donor 's conference to raise funds necessary for reconstruction .
the third step would be to find a political solution which would determine whether abkhazia remained part of georgia or was granted independence .

france , which holds the rotating presidency of the european union , said on monday that it was very concerned and called " on all parties to exercise the greatest restraint and for the resumption of dialogue as quickly as possible in order to avoid an escalation in violence . "

germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier proposed a three-step solution to the conflict to a group of united nations experts on the region last week .
the first step would call on all sides to denounce violence and to allow the return of 250,000 refugees , spiegel reported .
the second would be to organize a donor 's conference to raise funds necessary for reconstruction .
the third step would be to find a political solution which would determine whether abkhazia remained part of georgia or was granted independence .

russia and georgia have blamed each other for the blasts in gali , which killed a security chief , a united nations translator and two others .
on monday , the secretary-general of the council of europe , terry davis , described the attack as terrorism .
" these murders risk further aggravation of the tensions in the country , and i am very concerned that the situation may spin out of control , " he said in a statement .
france , which holds the rotating presidency of the european union , said on monday that it was very concerned and called " on all parties to exercise the greatest restraint and for the resumption of dialogue as quickly as possible in order to avoid an escalation in violence . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 08.07.2008 us , czech republic seal anti-missile radar system deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech-based radar system will be used to direct us interceptor missiles the czech government has agreed to host facilities that would be used as part of the defensive shield the us wants to build in europe .
but the plans are unpopular among czechs and many others . us secretary of state condoleezza rice announced that the deal had been reached after meeting with her counterpart karel schwarzenberg in prague .
" we face with the iranians , and so do our allies and friends , a growing missile threat that is getting ever longer and ever deeper , and where the iranian appetite for nuclear technology ... is still unchecked , " rice told reporters in czech capital .
the radar system is part of a defensive shield intended to protect europe against missile attacks by so-called " rouge states " like iran .
washington hopes that the entire shield will be functional some time between 2011 and 2013 .
but rice said the next us president would have to decide whether and how to go ahead with the shield .
high speed collisions bildunterschrift : this is how the system would work in the proposed system , radar stations in the czech republic would be responsible for locating enemy missiles detected by us satellites .
that data would then be relayed to interceptor missiles or " kill vehicles " stations in neighboring poland .
the inceptors would then be sent speeding off to collide with and destroy the hostile missiles .
but questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the proposed system - in particular whether it would be capable of distinguishing between missile with live warheads and decoys .
and while tuesday 's deal could prove an important step in realizing washington 's ambitious plans , shield proponents will still have to overcome a lot of popular and political resistance rto what many fear could be the start a new cold war .
feuds galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most czechs would rather not have the shield rice 's visit to prague was accompanied by protests , with demonstrators unfurling banners reading " do n't make a target of us . "
" we believe that this could start another arms race , and we believe this will not raise the security of the czech republic , " protestor frantisek smrcka told the dpe news agency .
an opinion poll in june suggested that 68 percent of czechs were against becoming involved in the shield system .
and the current czech government has only a razor-thin majority in the parliament and could face difficulties getting the deal approved .
meanwhile , despite 14 months of negotiations , the us has yet to reach an agreement with poland , where the interceptor missiles would be stationed .
poland is insisting on billions of dollars in us aid to modernize its armed forces in return for hosting the facilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is n't happy about the prospect of these on its doorstep and russia has repeatedly expressed its opposition to having a strong us military presence in its former back yard , threatening to retarget nuclear missiles at europe if the shield is put into place .
washington has been at pains to assure the kremlin that the shield is not directed against russia .
" we want the system to be transparent to the russians , " rice told reporters on tuesday .
but the system , assuming it ever gets built , could ultimately ratchet up tensions instead of making europeans feel more secure . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two young men were given long jail terms for beating an elderly man in a subway .
the case triggered a bitter debate in germany about whether ethnic minorities should be blamed for increasing juvenile violence . a 21-year-old turkish national will spend 12 years in jail while his 18-year-old greek national accomplice will go to jail for 8.5 years .
the defense council had wanted to two young men to be convicted for assault , which would have carried a two-year jail term .
the court called the attack , which occurred just before christmas in 2007 , a " completely meaningless act . "
the men , who grew up in germany , were convicted of attempted murder in the attack on a 76-year-old former teacher .
the attack was filmed by the munich subway 's closed-circuit tv cameras .
the retired teacher had reportedly rebuked the two young men for smoking in a non-smoking zone .
the men responded by knocking him to the ground and kicking him in the head .
the man was seriously injured with a triple fracture to the skull and internal bleeding , but survived .

" i am not normally the kind of person who hits old people .
i was so drunk , i am sorry . "
case quickly turned political the victim said he did not regard the apologies as sincere , remarking that the young men " played soccer with my head . "
the assault became a political weapon in the hands of roland koch , premier of the neighboring state of hesse .
koch spoke out against what he saw as the courts ' reluctance to jail teen troublemakers for minor violence .
in his re-election campaign , koch and other center-right figures called for special youth jails , or boot camps , which would focus on arduous exercise and military-style discipline .
koch 's campaign drew attacks from opposition parties , who accused him of exploiting anti-immigrant sentiment for political gain .

but they were also under intense pressure to make real progress on the climate change front .
having failed to agree on medium-term cuts to greenhouse gas emissions , they issued a statement saying they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least -lrb- a -rrb- 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050 . "
jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission , said he was " very happy about the results of the g8 on climate change . "
german chancellor angela merkel said they had made " clear progress . "
" this is a significant step forward from heiligendamm , " merkel told reporters , referring to last year 's g8 meeting which she hosted in the northern german spa town .
" this means that the international community will no longer get off the hook , " she said .
however , south africa 's environment minister marthinus van schalkwyk said the g8 had made no progress at all in stabilising the planet .
" as it is expressed in the g8 statement , the long-term goal is an empty slogan without substance , " he said .
the g8 deal was full of ambiguity .
senior japanese official koji tsuruoka said the long-term goal should be seen as a " political vision " without a clear base year and that it is not legally binding .
but pressure groups and scientists said the leaders were merely burying their heads in the sand .
opponents scathing of g8 's empty words james hansen , one of the world 's most respected climate scientists , slammed the summit 's outcome as " worse than worthless . "
the leaders " are taking actions that guarantee that we deliver to our children climate catastrophes that are out of our control , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the g8 debates , the ice caps continue to melt " while the arctic is melting , the g8 are postponing action .
instead of climate protection , the world got nothing but flowery words , " said greenpeace 's daniel mittler .
" if this is a step forward , we will never prevent climate chaos in time . "
" the texas oilman has once again prevented the g8 from undergoing the energy revolution it needs , " mittler said .
" bush is a lame duck , so who cares what he thinks about 2050 ? "
oxfam international said that the g8 's ' 50 by 50 ' climate goal left the world with a " 50/50 chance of a climate meltdown . "
the charity called tuesday 's announcement " another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now . "
base measurement year missing from agreement critics pointed out that not only does the deal still need to be endorsed by the rest of the world , possibly at a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- meeting in copenhagen next year ; it also does n't contain a base year on which to measure the cuts .
this is because no agreement was reached among the g8 leaders .
while the eu had suggested using 1990 as a base , canada called for a much more recent date , while host japan made no suggestions at all .
moreover , russia said it would sign up to the deal , but only if it was not legally binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush would be 104 by the time the deal reaches fruition " it 's unprecedented and it is quite unrealistic that one government should take responsibility for something 42 years ahead , " said alexander pankin , a russian foreign ministry official .
as ben wikler of avaaz.org , a pressure group , noted , by the time 2050 comes us president george w bush will be 104 and japan 's premier , yasuo fukuda , will be 114 .
unfccc chief criticizes 50-50 deal un climate change chief yvo de boer joined the debate , saying that the g8 summit goal of halving global warming emissions by 2050 was too distant and too vague .
de boer , in an interview with afp news agency , said the summit statement had " some positive elements , " as it acknowledged rich and poor countries had different responsibilities for emissions and priority had to be given to eradicating poverty .
but how rich countries intend to cut their own emissions in the next dozen years - a period deemed critical by scientists - is " completely missing , " he complained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer pointed out many holes in the g8 's agreement " if it 's not clear that rich nations are going to lead , then why should poor nations follow ? " said de boer , the executive secretary of the unfccc .
de boer spelt out what he saw as several deficiencies in the toyako statement .
" the problem is that a -rrb- 2050 is very far away ; b -rrb- it 's not clear what is going to serve as the baseline for this 50-percent reduction ; c -rrb- it 's not clear how this reduction is going to be divided up between rich nations and poor nations ; and d -rrb- it 's not clear how the rich nation portion of that minus 50 is going to be divided amongst individual countries , " he said .
de boer also questioned whether the statement amounted to a major step forward in diplomatic language compared to the 2007 g8 summit in heiligendamm .
" last year they were talking about eight countries seriously considering and adopting a 50-percent reduction goal , " he said .
" now they are suggesting that 180 countries seriously consider adopting a 50-percent reduction goal . "
energy , food and oil crises , africa also on agenda before issuing the climate statement , the g8 leaders had previously turned their attention to the economy , warning that spiraling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth .
" we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement .
the leaders further stressed that the surge in food prices had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . "
on oil , they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
other proposed solutions included boosting short-term production and refining capacities and greater market transparency to avoid speculation .
on the demand side , countries should reduce their dependence on hydrocarbons and improve energy efficiency , they said .

a promise to stick to their pledge to raise by 25 billion dollars the level of annual aid they give to africa by 2010 , meanwhile , was slammed by non-governmental organizations as too little too late .
on the issue of zimbabwe , russia opposed new sanctions against the regime of president robert mugabe .

but they were also under intense pressure to make real progress on the climate change front .
having failed to agree on medium-term cuts to greenhouse gas emissions , they issued a statement saying they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least -lrb- a -rrb- 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050 . "
jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission , said he was " very happy about the results of the g8 on climate change . "
german chancellor angela merkel said they had made " clear progress . "
" this is a significant step forward from heiligendamm , " merkel told reporters , referring to last year 's g8 meeting which she hosted in the northern german spa town .
" this means that the international community will no longer get off the hook , " she said .
however , south africa 's environment minister marthinus van schalkwyk said the g8 had made no progress at all in stabilising the planet .
" as it is expressed in the g8 statement , the long-term goal is an empty slogan without substance , " he said .
the g8 deal was full of ambiguity .
senior japanese official koji tsuruoka said the long-term goal should be seen as a " political vision " without a clear base year and that it is not legally binding .
but pressure groups and scientists said the leaders were merely burying their heads in the sand .
opponents scathing of g8 's empty words james hansen , one of the world 's most respected climate scientists , slammed the summit 's outcome as " worse than worthless . "
the leaders " are taking actions that guarantee that we deliver to our children climate catastrophes that are out of our control , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the g8 debates , the ice caps continue to melt " while the arctic is melting , the g8 are postponing action .
instead of climate protection , the world got nothing but flowery words , " said greenpeace 's daniel mittler .
" if this is a step forward , we will never prevent climate chaos in time . "
" the texas oilman has once again prevented the g8 from undergoing the energy revolution it needs , " mittler said .
" bush is a lame duck , so who cares what he thinks about 2050 ? "
oxfam international said that the g8 's ' 50 by 50 ' climate goal left the world with a " 50/50 chance of a climate meltdown . "
the charity called tuesday 's announcement " another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now . "
base measurement year missing from agreement critics pointed out that not only does the deal still need to be endorsed by the rest of the world , possibly at a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- meeting in copenhagen next year ; it also does n't contain a base year on which to measure the cuts .
this is because no agreement was reached among the g8 leaders .
while the eu had suggested using 1990 as a base , canada called for a much more recent date , while host japan made no suggestions at all .
moreover , russia said it would sign up to the deal , but only if it was not legally binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush would be 104 by the time the deal reaches fruition " it 's unprecedented and it is quite unrealistic that one government should take responsibility for something 42 years ahead , " said alexander pankin , a russian foreign ministry official .
as ben wikler of avaaz.org , a pressure group , noted , by the time 2050 comes us president george w bush will be 104 and japan 's premier , yasuo fukuda , will be 114 .
unfccc chief criticizes 50-50 deal un climate change chief yvo de boer joined the debate , saying that the g8 summit goal of halving global warming emissions by 2050 was too distant and too vague .
de boer , in an interview with afp news agency , said the summit statement had " some positive elements , " as it acknowledged rich and poor countries had different responsibilities for emissions and priority had to be given to eradicating poverty .
but how rich countries intend to cut their own emissions in the next dozen years - a period deemed critical by scientists - is " completely missing , " he complained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer pointed out many holes in the g8 's agreement " if it 's not clear that rich nations are going to lead , then why should poor nations follow ? " said de boer , the executive secretary of the unfccc .
de boer spelt out what he saw as several deficiencies in the toyako statement .
" the problem is that a -rrb- 2050 is very far away ; b -rrb- it 's not clear what is going to serve as the baseline for this 50-percent reduction ; c -rrb- it 's not clear how this reduction is going to be divided up between rich nations and poor nations ; and d -rrb- it 's not clear how the rich nation portion of that minus 50 is going to be divided amongst individual countries , " he said .
de boer also questioned whether the statement amounted to a major step forward in diplomatic language compared to the 2007 g8 summit in heiligendamm .
" last year they were talking about eight countries seriously considering and adopting a 50-percent reduction goal , " he said .
" now they are suggesting that 180 countries seriously consider adopting a 50-percent reduction goal . "
energy , food and oil crises , africa also on agenda before issuing the climate statement , the g8 leaders had previously turned their attention to the economy , warning that spiraling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth .
" we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement .
the leaders further stressed that the surge in food prices had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . "
on oil , they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
other proposed solutions included boosting short-term production and refining capacities and greater market transparency to avoid speculation .
on the demand side , countries should reduce their dependence on hydrocarbons and improve energy efficiency , they said .

a promise to stick to their pledge to raise by 25 billion dollars the level of annual aid they give to africa by 2010 , meanwhile , was slammed by non-governmental organizations as too little too late .
on the issue of zimbabwe , russia opposed new sanctions against the regime of president robert mugabe .

but the plans are unpopular among czechs and many others . us secretary of state condoleezza rice announced that the deal had been reached after meeting with her counterpart karel schwarzenberg in prague .
" we face with the iranians , and so do our allies and friends , a growing missile threat that is getting ever longer and ever deeper , and where the iranian appetite for nuclear technology ... is still unchecked , " rice told reporters in czech capital .
the radar system is part of a defensive shield intended to protect europe against missile attacks by so-called " rouge states " like iran .
washington hopes that the entire shield will be functional some time between 2011 and 2013 .
but rice said the next us president would have to decide whether and how to go ahead with the shield .
high speed collisions bildunterschrift : this is how the system would work in the proposed system , radar stations in the czech republic would be responsible for locating enemy missiles detected by us satellites .
that data would then be relayed to interceptor missiles or " kill vehicles " stations in neighboring poland .
the inceptors would then be sent speeding off to collide with and destroy the hostile missiles .
but questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the proposed system - in particular whether it would be capable of distinguishing between missile with live warheads and decoys .
and while tuesday 's deal could prove an important step in realizing washington 's ambitious plans , shield proponents will still have to overcome a lot of popular and political resistance rto what many fear could be the start a new cold war .
feuds galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most czechs would rather not have the shield rice 's visit to prague was accompanied by protests , with demonstrators unfurling banners reading " do n't make a target of us . "
" we believe that this could start another arms race , and we believe this will not raise the security of the czech republic , " protestor frantisek smrcka told the dpe news agency .
an opinion poll in june suggested that 68 percent of czechs were against becoming involved in the shield system .
and the current czech government has only a razor-thin majority in the parliament and could face difficulties getting the deal approved .
meanwhile , despite 14 months of negotiations , the us has yet to reach an agreement with poland , where the interceptor missiles would be stationed .
poland is insisting on billions of dollars in us aid to modernize its armed forces in return for hosting the facilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is n't happy about the prospect of these on its doorstep and russia has repeatedly expressed its opposition to having a strong us military presence in its former back yard , threatening to retarget nuclear missiles at europe if the shield is put into place .
washington has been at pains to assure the kremlin that the shield is not directed against russia .
" we want the system to be transparent to the russians , " rice told reporters on tuesday .
but the system , assuming it ever gets built , could ultimately ratchet up tensions instead of making europeans feel more secure . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the plans are unpopular among czechs and many others . us secretary of state condoleezza rice announced that the deal had been reached after meeting with her counterpart karel schwarzenberg in prague .
" we face with the iranians , and so do our allies and friends , a growing missile threat that is getting ever longer and ever deeper , and where the iranian appetite for nuclear technology ... is still unchecked , " rice told reporters in czech capital .
the radar system is part of a defensive shield intended to protect europe against missile attacks by so-called " rouge states " like iran .
washington hopes that the entire shield will be functional some time between 2011 and 2013 .
but rice said the next us president would have to decide whether and how to go ahead with the shield .
high speed collisions bildunterschrift : this is how the system would work in the proposed system , radar stations in the czech republic would be responsible for locating enemy missiles detected by us satellites .
that data would then be relayed to interceptor missiles or " kill vehicles " stations in neighboring poland .
the inceptors would then be sent speeding off to collide with and destroy the hostile missiles .
but questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the proposed system - in particular whether it would be capable of distinguishing between missile with live warheads and decoys .
and while tuesday 's deal could prove an important step in realizing washington 's ambitious plans , shield proponents will still have to overcome a lot of popular and political resistance rto what many fear could be the start a new cold war .
feuds galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most czechs would rather not have the shield rice 's visit to prague was accompanied by protests , with demonstrators unfurling banners reading " do n't make a target of us . "
" we believe that this could start another arms race , and we believe this will not raise the security of the czech republic , " protestor frantisek smrcka told the dpe news agency .
an opinion poll in june suggested that 68 percent of czechs were against becoming involved in the shield system .
and the current czech government has only a razor-thin majority in the parliament and could face difficulties getting the deal approved .
meanwhile , despite 14 months of negotiations , the us has yet to reach an agreement with poland , where the interceptor missiles would be stationed .
poland is insisting on billions of dollars in us aid to modernize its armed forces in return for hosting the facilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is n't happy about the prospect of these on its doorstep and russia has repeatedly expressed its opposition to having a strong us military presence in its former back yard , threatening to retarget nuclear missiles at europe if the shield is put into place .
washington has been at pains to assure the kremlin that the shield is not directed against russia .
" we want the system to be transparent to the russians , " rice told reporters on tuesday .

but they were also under intense pressure to make real progress on the climate change front .
having failed to agree on medium-term cuts to greenhouse gas emissions , they issued a statement saying they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least -lrb- a -rrb- 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050 . "
jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission , said he was " very happy about the results of the g8 on climate change . "
german chancellor angela merkel said they had made " clear progress . "
" this is a significant step forward from heiligendamm , " merkel told reporters , referring to last year 's g8 meeting which she hosted in the northern german spa town .
" this means that the international community will no longer get off the hook , " she said .
however , south africa 's environment minister marthinus van schalkwyk said the g8 had made no progress at all in stabilising the planet .
" as it is expressed in the g8 statement , the long-term goal is an empty slogan without substance , " he said .
the g8 deal was full of ambiguity .
senior japanese official koji tsuruoka said the long-term goal should be seen as a " political vision " without a clear base year and that it is not legally binding .
but pressure groups and scientists said the leaders were merely burying their heads in the sand .
opponents scathing of g8 's empty words james hansen , one of the world 's most respected climate scientists , slammed the summit 's outcome as " worse than worthless . "
the leaders " are taking actions that guarantee that we deliver to our children climate catastrophes that are out of our control , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the g8 debates , the ice caps continue to melt " while the arctic is melting , the g8 are postponing action .
instead of climate protection , the world got nothing but flowery words , " said greenpeace 's daniel mittler .
" if this is a step forward , we will never prevent climate chaos in time . "
" the texas oilman has once again prevented the g8 from undergoing the energy revolution it needs , " mittler said .
" bush is a lame duck , so who cares what he thinks about 2050 ? "
oxfam international said that the g8 's ' 50 by 50 ' climate goal left the world with a " 50/50 chance of a climate meltdown . "
the charity called tuesday 's announcement " another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now . "
base measurement year missing from agreement critics pointed out that not only does the deal still need to be endorsed by the rest of the world , possibly at a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- meeting in copenhagen next year ; it also does n't contain a base year on which to measure the cuts .
this is because no agreement was reached among the g8 leaders .
while the eu had suggested using 1990 as a base , canada called for a much more recent date , while host japan made no suggestions at all .
moreover , russia said it would sign up to the deal , but only if it was not legally binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush would be 104 by the time the deal reaches fruition " it 's unprecedented and it is quite unrealistic that one government should take responsibility for something 42 years ahead , " said alexander pankin , a russian foreign ministry official .
as ben wikler of avaaz.org , a pressure group , noted , by the time 2050 comes us president george w bush will be 104 and japan 's premier , yasuo fukuda , will be 114 .
unfccc chief criticizes 50-50 deal un climate change chief yvo de boer joined the debate , saying that the g8 summit goal of halving global warming emissions by 2050 was too distant and too vague .
de boer , in an interview with afp news agency , said the summit statement had " some positive elements , " as it acknowledged rich and poor countries had different responsibilities for emissions and priority had to be given to eradicating poverty .
but how rich countries intend to cut their own emissions in the next dozen years - a period deemed critical by scientists - is " completely missing , " he complained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer pointed out many holes in the g8 's agreement " if it 's not clear that rich nations are going to lead , then why should poor nations follow ? " said de boer , the executive secretary of the unfccc .
de boer spelt out what he saw as several deficiencies in the toyako statement .
" the problem is that a -rrb- 2050 is very far away ; b -rrb- it 's not clear what is going to serve as the baseline for this 50-percent reduction ; c -rrb- it 's not clear how this reduction is going to be divided up between rich nations and poor nations ; and d -rrb- it 's not clear how the rich nation portion of that minus 50 is going to be divided amongst individual countries , " he said .
de boer also questioned whether the statement amounted to a major step forward in diplomatic language compared to the 2007 g8 summit in heiligendamm .
" last year they were talking about eight countries seriously considering and adopting a 50-percent reduction goal , " he said .
" now they are suggesting that 180 countries seriously consider adopting a 50-percent reduction goal . "
energy , food and oil crises , africa also on agenda before issuing the climate statement , the g8 leaders had previously turned their attention to the economy , warning that spiraling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth .
" we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement .
the leaders further stressed that the surge in food prices had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . "
on oil , they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
other proposed solutions included boosting short-term production and refining capacities and greater market transparency to avoid speculation .
on the demand side , countries should reduce their dependence on hydrocarbons and improve energy efficiency , they said .

a promise to stick to their pledge to raise by 25 billion dollars the level of annual aid they give to africa by 2010 , meanwhile , was slammed by non-governmental organizations as too little too late .

but they were also under intense pressure to make real progress on the climate change front .
having failed to agree on medium-term cuts to greenhouse gas emissions , they issued a statement saying they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least -lrb- a -rrb- 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050 . "
jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission , said he was " very happy about the results of the g8 on climate change . "
german chancellor angela merkel said they had made " clear progress . "
" this is a significant step forward from heiligendamm , " merkel told reporters , referring to last year 's g8 meeting which she hosted in the northern german spa town .
" this means that the international community will no longer get off the hook , " she said .
however , south africa 's environment minister marthinus van schalkwyk said the g8 had made no progress at all in stabilising the planet .
" as it is expressed in the g8 statement , the long-term goal is an empty slogan without substance , " he said .
the g8 deal was full of ambiguity .
senior japanese official koji tsuruoka said the long-term goal should be seen as a " political vision " without a clear base year and that it is not legally binding .
but pressure groups and scientists said the leaders were merely burying their heads in the sand .
opponents scathing of g8 's empty words james hansen , one of the world 's most respected climate scientists , slammed the summit 's outcome as " worse than worthless . "
the leaders " are taking actions that guarantee that we deliver to our children climate catastrophes that are out of our control , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the g8 debates , the ice caps continue to melt " while the arctic is melting , the g8 are postponing action .
instead of climate protection , the world got nothing but flowery words , " said greenpeace 's daniel mittler .
" if this is a step forward , we will never prevent climate chaos in time . "
" the texas oilman has once again prevented the g8 from undergoing the energy revolution it needs , " mittler said .
" bush is a lame duck , so who cares what he thinks about 2050 ? "
oxfam international said that the g8 's ' 50 by 50 ' climate goal left the world with a " 50/50 chance of a climate meltdown . "
the charity called tuesday 's announcement " another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now . "
base measurement year missing from agreement critics pointed out that not only does the deal still need to be endorsed by the rest of the world , possibly at a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- meeting in copenhagen next year ; it also does n't contain a base year on which to measure the cuts .
this is because no agreement was reached among the g8 leaders .
while the eu had suggested using 1990 as a base , canada called for a much more recent date , while host japan made no suggestions at all .
moreover , russia said it would sign up to the deal , but only if it was not legally binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush would be 104 by the time the deal reaches fruition " it 's unprecedented and it is quite unrealistic that one government should take responsibility for something 42 years ahead , " said alexander pankin , a russian foreign ministry official .
as ben wikler of avaaz.org , a pressure group , noted , by the time 2050 comes us president george w bush will be 104 and japan 's premier , yasuo fukuda , will be 114 .
unfccc chief criticizes 50-50 deal un climate change chief yvo de boer joined the debate , saying that the g8 summit goal of halving global warming emissions by 2050 was too distant and too vague .
de boer , in an interview with afp news agency , said the summit statement had " some positive elements , " as it acknowledged rich and poor countries had different responsibilities for emissions and priority had to be given to eradicating poverty .
but how rich countries intend to cut their own emissions in the next dozen years - a period deemed critical by scientists - is " completely missing , " he complained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer pointed out many holes in the g8 's agreement " if it 's not clear that rich nations are going to lead , then why should poor nations follow ? " said de boer , the executive secretary of the unfccc .
de boer spelt out what he saw as several deficiencies in the toyako statement .
" the problem is that a -rrb- 2050 is very far away ; b -rrb- it 's not clear what is going to serve as the baseline for this 50-percent reduction ; c -rrb- it 's not clear how this reduction is going to be divided up between rich nations and poor nations ; and d -rrb- it 's not clear how the rich nation portion of that minus 50 is going to be divided amongst individual countries , " he said .
de boer also questioned whether the statement amounted to a major step forward in diplomatic language compared to the 2007 g8 summit in heiligendamm .
" last year they were talking about eight countries seriously considering and adopting a 50-percent reduction goal , " he said .
" now they are suggesting that 180 countries seriously consider adopting a 50-percent reduction goal . "
energy , food and oil crises , africa also on agenda before issuing the climate statement , the g8 leaders had previously turned their attention to the economy , warning that spiraling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth .
" we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement .
the leaders further stressed that the surge in food prices had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . "
on oil , they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
other proposed solutions included boosting short-term production and refining capacities and greater market transparency to avoid speculation .
on the demand side , countries should reduce their dependence on hydrocarbons and improve energy efficiency , they said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis is likely to increase global poverty meanwhile , they warned that high food prices risked pushing millions more people back into poverty and called on other donors to increase their contributions to the un 's world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- .
a promise to stick to their pledge to raise by 25 billion dollars the level of annual aid they give to africa by 2010 , meanwhile , was slammed by non-governmental organizations as too little too late .
on the issue of zimbabwe , russia opposed new sanctions against the regime of president robert mugabe .
gaffs galore there were also a series of blunders and diplomatic incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarko is making a habit of rubbing people the wrong way french president nicolas sarkozy risked offending the hosting nation by refusing to hold a bilateral meeting with fukuda , while the us delegation was forced to apologize after distributing an unflattering biography of italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .

de boer , in an interview with afp news agency , said the summit statement had " some positive elements , " as it acknowledged rich and poor countries had different responsibilities for emissions and priority had to be given to eradicating poverty .
but how rich countries intend to cut their own emissions in the next dozen years - a period deemed critical by scientists - is " completely missing , " he complained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer pointed out many holes in the g8 's agreement " if it 's not clear that rich nations are going to lead , then why should poor nations follow ? " said de boer , the executive secretary of the unfccc .
de boer spelt out what he saw as several deficiencies in the toyako statement .
" the problem is that a -rrb- 2050 is very far away ; b -rrb- it 's not clear what is going to serve as the baseline for this 50-percent reduction ; c -rrb- it 's not clear how this reduction is going to be divided up between rich nations and poor nations ; and d -rrb- it 's not clear how the rich nation portion of that minus 50 is going to be divided amongst individual countries , " he said .
de boer also questioned whether the statement amounted to a major step forward in diplomatic language compared to the 2007 g8 summit in heiligendamm .
" last year they were talking about eight countries seriously considering and adopting a 50-percent reduction goal , " he said .
" now they are suggesting that 180 countries seriously consider adopting a 50-percent reduction goal . "
energy , food and oil crises , africa also on agenda before issuing the climate statement , the g8 leaders had previously turned their attention to the economy , warning that spiraling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth .
" we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement .
the leaders further stressed that the surge in food prices had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . "
on oil , they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
other proposed solutions included boosting short-term production and refining capacities and greater market transparency to avoid speculation .
on the demand side , countries should reduce their dependence on hydrocarbons and improve energy efficiency , they said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis is likely to increase global poverty meanwhile , they warned that high food prices risked pushing millions more people back into poverty and called on other donors to increase their contributions to the un 's world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- .
a promise to stick to their pledge to raise by 25 billion dollars the level of annual aid they give to africa by 2010 , meanwhile , was slammed by non-governmental organizations as too little too late .
on the issue of zimbabwe , russia opposed new sanctions against the regime of president robert mugabe .

the men , who grew up in germany , were convicted of attempted murder in the attack on a 76-year-old former teacher .
the attack was filmed by the munich subway 's closed-circuit tv cameras .
the retired teacher had reportedly rebuked the two young men for smoking in a non-smoking zone .

" i am not normally the kind of person who hits old people .
i was so drunk , i am sorry . "

in his re-election campaign , koch and other center-right figures called for special youth jails , or boot camps , which would focus on arduous exercise and military-style discipline .

but the plans are unpopular among czechs and many others . us secretary of state condoleezza rice announced that the deal had been reached after meeting with her counterpart karel schwarzenberg in prague .
" we face with the iranians , and so do our allies and friends , a growing missile threat that is getting ever longer and ever deeper , and where the iranian appetite for nuclear technology ... is still unchecked , " rice told reporters in czech capital .
the radar system is part of a defensive shield intended to protect europe against missile attacks by so-called " rouge states " like iran .
washington hopes that the entire shield will be functional some time between 2011 and 2013 .
but rice said the next us president would have to decide whether and how to go ahead with the shield .
high speed collisions bildunterschrift : this is how the system would work in the proposed system , radar stations in the czech republic would be responsible for locating enemy missiles detected by us satellites .
that data would then be relayed to interceptor missiles or " kill vehicles " stations in neighboring poland .
the inceptors would then be sent speeding off to collide with and destroy the hostile missiles .
but questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the proposed system - in particular whether it would be capable of distinguishing between missile with live warheads and decoys .
and while tuesday 's deal could prove an important step in realizing washington 's ambitious plans , shield proponents will still have to overcome a lot of popular and political resistance rto what many fear could be the start a new cold war .
feuds galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most czechs would rather not have the shield rice 's visit to prague was accompanied by protests , with demonstrators unfurling banners reading " do n't make a target of us . "
" we believe that this could start another arms race , and we believe this will not raise the security of the czech republic , " protestor frantisek smrcka told the dpe news agency .
an opinion poll in june suggested that 68 percent of czechs were against becoming involved in the shield system .
and the current czech government has only a razor-thin majority in the parliament and could face difficulties getting the deal approved .
meanwhile , despite 14 months of negotiations , the us has yet to reach an agreement with poland , where the interceptor missiles would be stationed .
poland is insisting on billions of dollars in us aid to modernize its armed forces in return for hosting the facilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is n't happy about the prospect of these on its doorstep and russia has repeatedly expressed its opposition to having a strong us military presence in its former back yard , threatening to retarget nuclear missiles at europe if the shield is put into place .
washington has been at pains to assure the kremlin that the shield is not directed against russia .
" we want the system to be transparent to the russians , " rice told reporters on tuesday .
but the system , assuming it ever gets built , could ultimately ratchet up tensions instead of making europeans feel more secure . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now eu ministers are calling on tougher rules , which discourage illegal immigrants while still encouraging skilled foreign labor . european union justice ministers have announced that europe should take complete control of migration into and out of the continent , working with the rest of the world to end illegal migration and manage legal flows .
the news comes as eu ministers meet with their counterparts in the southern french beach resort of cannes . the informal meeting , a regular feature of eu politics , is aimed at getting ministers to agree on the broad outline of policies , so that they will find it easier to agree on the technical details at future , formal meetings . monday 's talks were set to be dominated by a proposal from the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , to create a " pact on immigration and asylum " between the eu 's 27 member states . the pact , which would not be legally binding but would carry political weight , asks eu member states to strengthen the fight against illegal immigration , to crack down on the employers of illegal migrants and to live up to their responsibility to expel illegal residents from their territory . at the same time , the pact urges eu members to put in place targeted immigration policies which would attract highly-qualified foreigners , in particular , to europe .
and it calls on the eu to work closely with countries of origin and transit , supporting development on their territories and making it easier for immigrants to send money home as a way of making it more attractive for potential migrants to stay at home . language toned down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people enter the eu illegally every year however , a draft of the pact agreed immediately before the meeting tones down considerably the strong language used in the initial text .
where the first draft listed strengthened border control as its top priority , that was relegated to number three in later versions , being supplanted by the question of boosting legal migration . the first draft also prioritized " organizing the effective removal of irregular residents from the eu " - an emphasis which chimes in with the policy of france 's president nicolas sarkozy , who has set annual quotas for expelling illegal immigrants . but the later text used a much softer tone , calling for a general " fight against illegal immigration , especially assuring the return of foreigners who are in an irregular situation to their country of origin or a transit country . " the first draft of the pact also stated categorically that " massive and collective legalizations produce a major pull effect " and that member states " agree to give them up . "
but the latest draft simply calls on member states to limit their legalizations to a case-by-case system in the future . french experts critical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been heavily criticized for his stance while that compromise paves the way for broad eu acceptance of the text at a summit in october , the news on the domestic front was less promising for the french government in its immigration plans . as the meeting opened , the french press reported that a commission of french experts formed by sarkozy to discuss his migration policies had roundly criticized key points . binding immigration quotas would be " unrealistic and pointless , " and the national authorities have " no discretionary power to determine the flow " of migrants into france , especially on family grounds , left-wing daily la liberation quoted the report . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" full-fledged eu membership is the core interest of the republic of serbia and its citizens , " he told the parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian and eu officials signing an accord earlier this year " therefore , one of the first moves of the new government will be to submit the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- to the national parliament for ratification , " he said . on the eve of the may 11 polls the eu signed the saa with serbia , providing a boost to the pro-european bloc .

" the government 's main objective is for serbia to gain eu candidate country status by the end of this year or by the beginning of next year , through the acceleration of economic and other reforms envisaged by the saa . " brussels has already said it would support serbia 's new government . however , before progress can continue towards eu membership , belgrade must arrest war-crime suspects still on the loose - something the socialist party -lrb- sps -rrb- has vowed to block . kosovo sticking point serbia has downgraded diplomatic relations with all the nations - more than 40 , including leading western powers - that have recognized kosovo since it declared independence in february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's president boris tadic virtually all major serbian leaders said they would never recognize kosovo , viewed by serbs as their heartland . economically , cvetkovic has to deal with stalled reforms , bloated spending , an overrated national currency and rising prices , all complicated by endemic corruption . cvetkovic singled out the fight against corruption as one of his priorities , like most of his predecessors .

critics have said the reason for this is that the real goal of the unlikely bedfellows - the democrats and the socialists - is to keep the ultra-nationalists lurking in opposition . if that is the case , the new government might make gestures that would prolong its stay in power , while avoiding hard decisions that would reap long-term benefits , such as cutting national spending or capturing the war criminals still at large . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , environmentalists said the agreement did n't go far enough . the groundbreaking deal , brokered by g8 hosts japan and propelled by the european union , overcame the resistance of us president george w. bush , who had refused to ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change and who continues to block plans for medium-term cuts . the binding measures should be brought into the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , which will culminate in a meeting in copenhagen at the end of 2009 . in a statement , g8 leaders said they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least a 50 percent reduction of global emissions by 2050 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 leaders are on the japanese island of hokkaido the leaders further said that such a challenge would require " a global response " and the contributions from " all major economies , consistent with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities . " g8 leaders said they wanted to work with the nearly 200 nations involved in un climate change talks to meet the 2050 goal . the g8 communique said mid-term goals would be needed to achieve that goal , but did not give any numerical targets .
brussels , however , has called for clear interim targets . the agreement was hailed by jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission . " this is a strong signal to citizens around the world , " he said .
" we have agreed a long-term goal of at least 50 percent reduction of emissions by 2050 , and we have agreed that we should also set up mid-term targets . " now we need to go the extra mile to secure an ambitious global deal in copenhagen , " he said . environmentalists critical environmental groups were less pleased .
one pressure group said the g8 leaders had done little more than restate last year 's g8 commitment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say the g8 is n't taking a strong enough stance on the environment " the g8 are crawling forward on emissions cuts at a time when giant leaps and bounds are needed , " said peter grant of tearfund , a christian relief and development agency . at their meeting in the german resort of heiligendamm last year , g8 leaders had agreed only to " consider seriously " the 2050 target . this time round , they said they " shared " the unfccc 's vision and that they would " consider and adopt " the targets . but critics were adamant that the g8 leaders had in fact failed by not specifying targets for 2020 , merely postponing the problem to future generations . " in the year 2050 , -lrb- canadian prime minister stephen -rrb- harper will be 91 , bush will be 104 and -lrb- japanese prime minister yasuo -rrb- fukuda will be 114 .
so we do n't necessarily believe their commitments , " said ben wikler of avaaz.org , an environmentalist group . fuel and food soaring oil and food prices were also high on the agenda on the second day of this summit in a luxury mountain-top hotel on the japanese island of hokkaido . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil prices are painful for europe , but hitting poor countries especially hard high prices for oil and food pose a " serious challenge to stable worldwide economic growth , " g8 leaders from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states warned on tuesday . in the face of skyrocketing prices , the g8 said it wanted to bring major oil producers and consumers together for a summit to discuss output and pricing .
oil prices have about doubled over the past year and last week hit a record high of $ 145.85 a barrel .
g8 leaders called for increased production and refinement to help slow the price rise . to cushion the blow , which is taking an especially heavy toll on poor countries , officials have said the g8 would unveil a series of measures to help africa , particularly its farmers , and would affirm its commitment to give $ 50 billion in extra aid money in 2010 , half of which would go to the world 's poorest continent . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 08.07.2008 eu justice ministers call for tougher immigration policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union ministers have called for a change to immigration rules migration into and out of the european continent has always been a touchy issue .
now eu ministers are calling on tougher rules , which discourage illegal immigrants while still encouraging skilled foreign labor . european union justice ministers have announced that europe should take complete control of migration into and out of the continent , working with the rest of the world to end illegal migration and manage legal flows .
the news comes as eu ministers meet with their counterparts in the southern french beach resort of cannes . the informal meeting , a regular feature of eu politics , is aimed at getting ministers to agree on the broad outline of policies , so that they will find it easier to agree on the technical details at future , formal meetings . monday 's talks were set to be dominated by a proposal from the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , to create a " pact on immigration and asylum " between the eu 's 27 member states . the pact , which would not be legally binding but would carry political weight , asks eu member states to strengthen the fight against illegal immigration , to crack down on the employers of illegal migrants and to live up to their responsibility to expel illegal residents from their territory . at the same time , the pact urges eu members to put in place targeted immigration policies which would attract highly-qualified foreigners , in particular , to europe .
and it calls on the eu to work closely with countries of origin and transit , supporting development on their territories and making it easier for immigrants to send money home as a way of making it more attractive for potential migrants to stay at home . language toned down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people enter the eu illegally every year however , a draft of the pact agreed immediately before the meeting tones down considerably the strong language used in the initial text .
where the first draft listed strengthened border control as its top priority , that was relegated to number three in later versions , being supplanted by the question of boosting legal migration . the first draft also prioritized " organizing the effective removal of irregular residents from the eu " - an emphasis which chimes in with the policy of france 's president nicolas sarkozy , who has set annual quotas for expelling illegal immigrants . but the later text used a much softer tone , calling for a general " fight against illegal immigration , especially assuring the return of foreigners who are in an irregular situation to their country of origin or a transit country . " the first draft of the pact also stated categorically that " massive and collective legalizations produce a major pull effect " and that member states " agree to give them up . "
but the latest draft simply calls on member states to limit their legalizations to a case-by-case system in the future . french experts critical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been heavily criticized for his stance while that compromise paves the way for broad eu acceptance of the text at a summit in october , the news on the domestic front was less promising for the french government in its immigration plans . as the meeting opened , the french press reported that a commission of french experts formed by sarkozy to discuss his migration policies had roundly criticized key points . binding immigration quotas would be " unrealistic and pointless , " and the national authorities have " no discretionary power to determine the flow " of migrants into france , especially on family grounds , left-wing daily la liberation quoted the report . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier proposed a three-step solution to the conflict to a group of united nations experts on the region last week .
the first step would call on all sides to denounce violence and to allow the return of 250,000 refugees , spiegel reported .
the second would be to organize a donor 's conference to raise funds necessary for reconstruction .
the third step would be to find a political solution which would determine whether abkhazia remained part of georgia or was granted independence .
" we stand at a critical crossroads , " steinmeier reportedly said , warning participants not to " play around " with negotiations .
bombings add to tension european leaders have grown increasingly concerned in recent days that the tensions in the region are leading towards a military conflict .
on sunday , six explosions rocked the border between abkhazia and georgia .
russia and georgia have blamed each other for the blasts in gali , which killed a security chief , a united nations translator and two others .
on monday , the secretary-general of the council of europe , terry davis , described the attack as terrorism .
" these murders risk further aggravation of the tensions in the country , and i am very concerned that the situation may spin out of control , " he said in a statement .
france , which holds the rotating presidency of the european union , said on monday that it was very concerned and called " on all parties to exercise the greatest restraint and for the resumption of dialogue as quickly as possible in order to avoid an escalation in violence . "

g8 leaders called for increased production and refinement to help slow the price rise . to cushion the blow , which is taking an especially heavy toll on poor countries , officials have said the g8 would unveil a series of measures to help africa , particularly its farmers , and would affirm its commitment to give $ 50 billion in extra aid money in 2010 , half of which would go to the world 's poorest continent . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

g8 leaders called for increased production and refinement to help slow the price rise . to cushion the blow , which is taking an especially heavy toll on poor countries , officials have said the g8 would unveil a series of measures to help africa , particularly its farmers , and would affirm its commitment to give $ 50 billion in extra aid money in 2010 , half of which would go to the world 's poorest continent . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news comes as eu ministers meet with their counterparts in the southern french beach resort of cannes . the informal meeting , a regular feature of eu politics , is aimed at getting ministers to agree on the broad outline of policies , so that they will find it easier to agree on the technical details at future , formal meetings . monday 's talks were set to be dominated by a proposal from the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , to create a " pact on immigration and asylum " between the eu 's 27 member states . the pact , which would not be legally binding but would carry political weight , asks eu member states to strengthen the fight against illegal immigration , to crack down on the employers of illegal migrants and to live up to their responsibility to expel illegal residents from their territory . at the same time , the pact urges eu members to put in place targeted immigration policies which would attract highly-qualified foreigners , in particular , to europe .

" the first draft of the pact also stated categorically that " massive and collective legalizations produce a major pull effect " and that member states " agree to give them up . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de g8 summit -pipe- 08.07.2008 environmentalists slam g8 's emissions deal as meaningless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green pressure groups say the agreement is just another postponement of action as g8 leaders trumpeted their landmark deal to cut global emissions by 50 per cent by 2050 , the ' 50/50 ' agreement , which has yet to be sealed , was quickly lambasted by environmentalists as virtually meaningless . meeting for the second day at a luxury mountain resort overlooking lake toyako , in the northern island of hokkaido , the heads of state and government of the world 's seven richest countries plus russia turned their minds to the global economic slowdown , spiraling food and oil prices and the need to boost aid to africa .
but they were also under intense pressure to make real progress on the climate change front .
having failed to agree on medium-term cuts to greenhouse gas emissions , they issued a statement saying they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least -lrb- a -rrb- 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050 . "
jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission , said he was " very happy about the results of the g8 on climate change . "
german chancellor angela merkel said they had made " clear progress . "
" this is a significant step forward from heiligendamm , " merkel told reporters , referring to last year 's g8 meeting which she hosted in the northern german spa town .
" this means that the international community will no longer get off the hook , " she said .
however , south africa 's environment minister marthinus van schalkwyk said the g8 had made no progress at all in stabilising the planet .
" as it is expressed in the g8 statement , the long-term goal is an empty slogan without substance , " he said .
the g8 deal was full of ambiguity .
senior japanese official koji tsuruoka said the long-term goal should be seen as a " political vision " without a clear base year and that it is not legally binding .
but pressure groups and scientists said the leaders were merely burying their heads in the sand .
opponents scathing of g8 's empty words james hansen , one of the world 's most respected climate scientists , slammed the summit 's outcome as " worse than worthless . "
the leaders " are taking actions that guarantee that we deliver to our children climate catastrophes that are out of our control , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the g8 debates , the ice caps continue to melt " while the arctic is melting , the g8 are postponing action .
instead of climate protection , the world got nothing but flowery words , " said greenpeace 's daniel mittler .
" if this is a step forward , we will never prevent climate chaos in time . "
" the texas oilman has once again prevented the g8 from undergoing the energy revolution it needs , " mittler said .
" bush is a lame duck , so who cares what he thinks about 2050 ? "
oxfam international said that the g8 's ' 50 by 50 ' climate goal left the world with a " 50/50 chance of a climate meltdown . "
the charity called tuesday 's announcement " another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now . "
base measurement year missing from agreement critics pointed out that not only does the deal still need to be endorsed by the rest of the world , possibly at a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- meeting in copenhagen next year ; it also does n't contain a base year on which to measure the cuts .
this is because no agreement was reached among the g8 leaders .
while the eu had suggested using 1990 as a base , canada called for a much more recent date , while host japan made no suggestions at all .
moreover , russia said it would sign up to the deal , but only if it was not legally binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush would be 104 by the time the deal reaches fruition " it 's unprecedented and it is quite unrealistic that one government should take responsibility for something 42 years ahead , " said alexander pankin , a russian foreign ministry official .
as ben wikler of avaaz.org , a pressure group , noted , by the time 2050 comes us president george w bush will be 104 and japan 's premier , yasuo fukuda , will be 114 .
unfccc chief criticizes 50-50 deal un climate change chief yvo de boer joined the debate , saying that the g8 summit goal of halving global warming emissions by 2050 was too distant and too vague .
de boer , in an interview with afp news agency , said the summit statement had " some positive elements , " as it acknowledged rich and poor countries had different responsibilities for emissions and priority had to be given to eradicating poverty .
but how rich countries intend to cut their own emissions in the next dozen years - a period deemed critical by scientists - is " completely missing , " he complained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer pointed out many holes in the g8 's agreement " if it 's not clear that rich nations are going to lead , then why should poor nations follow ? " said de boer , the executive secretary of the unfccc .
de boer spelt out what he saw as several deficiencies in the toyako statement .
" the problem is that a -rrb- 2050 is very far away ; b -rrb- it 's not clear what is going to serve as the baseline for this 50-percent reduction ; c -rrb- it 's not clear how this reduction is going to be divided up between rich nations and poor nations ; and d -rrb- it 's not clear how the rich nation portion of that minus 50 is going to be divided amongst individual countries , " he said .
de boer also questioned whether the statement amounted to a major step forward in diplomatic language compared to the 2007 g8 summit in heiligendamm .
" last year they were talking about eight countries seriously considering and adopting a 50-percent reduction goal , " he said .
" now they are suggesting that 180 countries seriously consider adopting a 50-percent reduction goal . "
energy , food and oil crises , africa also on agenda before issuing the climate statement , the g8 leaders had previously turned their attention to the economy , warning that spiraling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth .
" we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement .
the leaders further stressed that the surge in food prices had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . "
on oil , they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
other proposed solutions included boosting short-term production and refining capacities and greater market transparency to avoid speculation .
on the demand side , countries should reduce their dependence on hydrocarbons and improve energy efficiency , they said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis is likely to increase global poverty meanwhile , they warned that high food prices risked pushing millions more people back into poverty and called on other donors to increase their contributions to the un 's world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- .
a promise to stick to their pledge to raise by 25 billion dollars the level of annual aid they give to africa by 2010 , meanwhile , was slammed by non-governmental organizations as too little too late .
on the issue of zimbabwe , russia opposed new sanctions against the regime of president robert mugabe .
gaffs galore there were also a series of blunders and diplomatic incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarko is making a habit of rubbing people the wrong way french president nicolas sarkozy risked offending the hosting nation by refusing to hold a bilateral meeting with fukuda , while the us delegation was forced to apologize after distributing an unflattering biography of italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .

but they were also under intense pressure to make real progress on the climate change front .
having failed to agree on medium-term cuts to greenhouse gas emissions , they issued a statement saying they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least -lrb- a -rrb- 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050 . "
jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission , said he was " very happy about the results of the g8 on climate change . "
german chancellor angela merkel said they had made " clear progress . "
" this is a significant step forward from heiligendamm , " merkel told reporters , referring to last year 's g8 meeting which she hosted in the northern german spa town .
" this means that the international community will no longer get off the hook , " she said .
however , south africa 's environment minister marthinus van schalkwyk said the g8 had made no progress at all in stabilising the planet .
" as it is expressed in the g8 statement , the long-term goal is an empty slogan without substance , " he said .
the g8 deal was full of ambiguity .
senior japanese official koji tsuruoka said the long-term goal should be seen as a " political vision " without a clear base year and that it is not legally binding .
but pressure groups and scientists said the leaders were merely burying their heads in the sand .
opponents scathing of g8 's empty words james hansen , one of the world 's most respected climate scientists , slammed the summit 's outcome as " worse than worthless . "
the leaders " are taking actions that guarantee that we deliver to our children climate catastrophes that are out of our control , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the g8 debates , the ice caps continue to melt " while the arctic is melting , the g8 are postponing action .
instead of climate protection , the world got nothing but flowery words , " said greenpeace 's daniel mittler .
" if this is a step forward , we will never prevent climate chaos in time . "
" the texas oilman has once again prevented the g8 from undergoing the energy revolution it needs , " mittler said .
" bush is a lame duck , so who cares what he thinks about 2050 ? "
oxfam international said that the g8 's ' 50 by 50 ' climate goal left the world with a " 50/50 chance of a climate meltdown . "
the charity called tuesday 's announcement " another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now . "
base measurement year missing from agreement critics pointed out that not only does the deal still need to be endorsed by the rest of the world , possibly at a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- meeting in copenhagen next year ; it also does n't contain a base year on which to measure the cuts .
this is because no agreement was reached among the g8 leaders .
while the eu had suggested using 1990 as a base , canada called for a much more recent date , while host japan made no suggestions at all .
moreover , russia said it would sign up to the deal , but only if it was not legally binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush would be 104 by the time the deal reaches fruition " it 's unprecedented and it is quite unrealistic that one government should take responsibility for something 42 years ahead , " said alexander pankin , a russian foreign ministry official .
as ben wikler of avaaz.org , a pressure group , noted , by the time 2050 comes us president george w bush will be 104 and japan 's premier , yasuo fukuda , will be 114 .
unfccc chief criticizes 50-50 deal un climate change chief yvo de boer joined the debate , saying that the g8 summit goal of halving global warming emissions by 2050 was too distant and too vague .
de boer , in an interview with afp news agency , said the summit statement had " some positive elements , " as it acknowledged rich and poor countries had different responsibilities for emissions and priority had to be given to eradicating poverty .
but how rich countries intend to cut their own emissions in the next dozen years - a period deemed critical by scientists - is " completely missing , " he complained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer pointed out many holes in the g8 's agreement " if it 's not clear that rich nations are going to lead , then why should poor nations follow ? " said de boer , the executive secretary of the unfccc .
de boer spelt out what he saw as several deficiencies in the toyako statement .
" the problem is that a -rrb- 2050 is very far away ; b -rrb- it 's not clear what is going to serve as the baseline for this 50-percent reduction ; c -rrb- it 's not clear how this reduction is going to be divided up between rich nations and poor nations ; and d -rrb- it 's not clear how the rich nation portion of that minus 50 is going to be divided amongst individual countries , " he said .
de boer also questioned whether the statement amounted to a major step forward in diplomatic language compared to the 2007 g8 summit in heiligendamm .
" last year they were talking about eight countries seriously considering and adopting a 50-percent reduction goal , " he said .
" now they are suggesting that 180 countries seriously consider adopting a 50-percent reduction goal . "
energy , food and oil crises , africa also on agenda before issuing the climate statement , the g8 leaders had previously turned their attention to the economy , warning that spiraling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth .
" we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement .
the leaders further stressed that the surge in food prices had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . "
on oil , they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
other proposed solutions included boosting short-term production and refining capacities and greater market transparency to avoid speculation .
on the demand side , countries should reduce their dependence on hydrocarbons and improve energy efficiency , they said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis is likely to increase global poverty meanwhile , they warned that high food prices risked pushing millions more people back into poverty and called on other donors to increase their contributions to the un 's world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- .
a promise to stick to their pledge to raise by 25 billion dollars the level of annual aid they give to africa by 2010 , meanwhile , was slammed by non-governmental organizations as too little too late .
on the issue of zimbabwe , russia opposed new sanctions against the regime of president robert mugabe .
gaffs galore there were also a series of blunders and diplomatic incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarko is making a habit of rubbing people the wrong way french president nicolas sarkozy risked offending the hosting nation by refusing to hold a bilateral meeting with fukuda , while the us delegation was forced to apologize after distributing an unflattering biography of italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .

however , environmentalists said the agreement did n't go far enough . the groundbreaking deal , brokered by g8 hosts japan and propelled by the european union , overcame the resistance of us president george w. bush , who had refused to ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change and who continues to block plans for medium-term cuts . the binding measures should be brought into the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , which will culminate in a meeting in copenhagen at the end of 2009 . in a statement , g8 leaders said they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least a 50 percent reduction of global emissions by 2050 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 leaders are on the japanese island of hokkaido the leaders further said that such a challenge would require " a global response " and the contributions from " all major economies , consistent with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities . " g8 leaders said they wanted to work with the nearly 200 nations involved in un climate change talks to meet the 2050 goal . the g8 communique said mid-term goals would be needed to achieve that goal , but did not give any numerical targets .
brussels , however , has called for clear interim targets . the agreement was hailed by jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission . " this is a strong signal to citizens around the world , " he said .
" we have agreed a long-term goal of at least 50 percent reduction of emissions by 2050 , and we have agreed that we should also set up mid-term targets . " now we need to go the extra mile to secure an ambitious global deal in copenhagen , " he said . environmentalists critical environmental groups were less pleased .
one pressure group said the g8 leaders had done little more than restate last year 's g8 commitment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say the g8 is n't taking a strong enough stance on the environment " the g8 are crawling forward on emissions cuts at a time when giant leaps and bounds are needed , " said peter grant of tearfund , a christian relief and development agency . at their meeting in the german resort of heiligendamm last year , g8 leaders had agreed only to " consider seriously " the 2050 target . this time round , they said they " shared " the unfccc 's vision and that they would " consider and adopt " the targets . but critics were adamant that the g8 leaders had in fact failed by not specifying targets for 2020 , merely postponing the problem to future generations . " in the year 2050 , -lrb- canadian prime minister stephen -rrb- harper will be 91 , bush will be 104 and -lrb- japanese prime minister yasuo -rrb- fukuda will be 114 .
so we do n't necessarily believe their commitments , " said ben wikler of avaaz.org , an environmentalist group . fuel and food soaring oil and food prices were also high on the agenda on the second day of this summit in a luxury mountain-top hotel on the japanese island of hokkaido . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil prices are painful for europe , but hitting poor countries especially hard high prices for oil and food pose a " serious challenge to stable worldwide economic growth , " g8 leaders from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states warned on tuesday . in the face of skyrocketing prices , the g8 said it wanted to bring major oil producers and consumers together for a summit to discuss output and pricing .
oil prices have about doubled over the past year and last week hit a record high of $ 145.85 a barrel .
g8 leaders called for increased production and refinement to help slow the price rise . to cushion the blow , which is taking an especially heavy toll on poor countries , officials have said the g8 would unveil a series of measures to help africa , particularly its farmers , and would affirm its commitment to give $ 50 billion in extra aid money in 2010 , half of which would go to the world 's poorest continent . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , environmentalists said the agreement did n't go far enough . the groundbreaking deal , brokered by g8 hosts japan and propelled by the european union , overcame the resistance of us president george w. bush , who had refused to ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change and who continues to block plans for medium-term cuts . the binding measures should be brought into the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , which will culminate in a meeting in copenhagen at the end of 2009 . in a statement , g8 leaders said they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least a 50 percent reduction of global emissions by 2050 .

now eu ministers are calling on tougher rules , which discourage illegal immigrants while still encouraging skilled foreign labor . european union justice ministers have announced that europe should take complete control of migration into and out of the continent , working with the rest of the world to end illegal migration and manage legal flows .
the news comes as eu ministers meet with their counterparts in the southern french beach resort of cannes . the informal meeting , a regular feature of eu politics , is aimed at getting ministers to agree on the broad outline of policies , so that they will find it easier to agree on the technical details at future , formal meetings . monday 's talks were set to be dominated by a proposal from the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , to create a " pact on immigration and asylum " between the eu 's 27 member states . the pact , which would not be legally binding but would carry political weight , asks eu member states to strengthen the fight against illegal immigration , to crack down on the employers of illegal migrants and to live up to their responsibility to expel illegal residents from their territory . at the same time , the pact urges eu members to put in place targeted immigration policies which would attract highly-qualified foreigners , in particular , to europe .
and it calls on the eu to work closely with countries of origin and transit , supporting development on their territories and making it easier for immigrants to send money home as a way of making it more attractive for potential migrants to stay at home . language toned down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people enter the eu illegally every year however , a draft of the pact agreed immediately before the meeting tones down considerably the strong language used in the initial text .
where the first draft listed strengthened border control as its top priority , that was relegated to number three in later versions , being supplanted by the question of boosting legal migration . the first draft also prioritized " organizing the effective removal of irregular residents from the eu " - an emphasis which chimes in with the policy of france 's president nicolas sarkozy , who has set annual quotas for expelling illegal immigrants . but the later text used a much softer tone , calling for a general " fight against illegal immigration , especially assuring the return of foreigners who are in an irregular situation to their country of origin or a transit country . " the first draft of the pact also stated categorically that " massive and collective legalizations produce a major pull effect " and that member states " agree to give them up . "
but the latest draft simply calls on member states to limit their legalizations to a case-by-case system in the future . french experts critical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been heavily criticized for his stance while that compromise paves the way for broad eu acceptance of the text at a summit in october , the news on the domestic front was less promising for the french government in its immigration plans . as the meeting opened , the french press reported that a commission of french experts formed by sarkozy to discuss his migration policies had roundly criticized key points . binding immigration quotas would be " unrealistic and pointless , " and the national authorities have " no discretionary power to determine the flow " of migrants into france , especially on family grounds , left-wing daily la liberation quoted the report . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the defense council had wanted to two young men to be convicted for assault , which would have carried a two-year jail term .
the court called the attack , which occurred just before christmas in 2007 , a " completely meaningless act . "
the men , who grew up in germany , were convicted of attempted murder in the attack on a 76-year-old former teacher .
the attack was filmed by the munich subway 's closed-circuit tv cameras .
the retired teacher had reportedly rebuked the two young men for smoking in a non-smoking zone .

" i am not normally the kind of person who hits old people .
i was so drunk , i am sorry . "

but the plans are unpopular among czechs and many others . us secretary of state condoleezza rice announced that the deal had been reached after meeting with her counterpart karel schwarzenberg in prague .
" we face with the iranians , and so do our allies and friends , a growing missile threat that is getting ever longer and ever deeper , and where the iranian appetite for nuclear technology ... is still unchecked , " rice told reporters in czech capital .
the radar system is part of a defensive shield intended to protect europe against missile attacks by so-called " rouge states " like iran .
washington hopes that the entire shield will be functional some time between 2011 and 2013 .
but rice said the next us president would have to decide whether and how to go ahead with the shield .
high speed collisions bildunterschrift : this is how the system would work in the proposed system , radar stations in the czech republic would be responsible for locating enemy missiles detected by us satellites .
that data would then be relayed to interceptor missiles or " kill vehicles " stations in neighboring poland .
the inceptors would then be sent speeding off to collide with and destroy the hostile missiles .
but questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the proposed system - in particular whether it would be capable of distinguishing between missile with live warheads and decoys .
and while tuesday 's deal could prove an important step in realizing washington 's ambitious plans , shield proponents will still have to overcome a lot of popular and political resistance rto what many fear could be the start a new cold war .
feuds galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most czechs would rather not have the shield rice 's visit to prague was accompanied by protests , with demonstrators unfurling banners reading " do n't make a target of us . "
" we believe that this could start another arms race , and we believe this will not raise the security of the czech republic , " protestor frantisek smrcka told the dpe news agency .
an opinion poll in june suggested that 68 percent of czechs were against becoming involved in the shield system .
and the current czech government has only a razor-thin majority in the parliament and could face difficulties getting the deal approved .
meanwhile , despite 14 months of negotiations , the us has yet to reach an agreement with poland , where the interceptor missiles would be stationed .
poland is insisting on billions of dollars in us aid to modernize its armed forces in return for hosting the facilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is n't happy about the prospect of these on its doorstep and russia has repeatedly expressed its opposition to having a strong us military presence in its former back yard , threatening to retarget nuclear missiles at europe if the shield is put into place .
washington has been at pains to assure the kremlin that the shield is not directed against russia .
" we want the system to be transparent to the russians , " rice told reporters on tuesday .
but the system , assuming it ever gets built , could ultimately ratchet up tensions instead of making europeans feel more secure . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the plans are unpopular among czechs and many others . us secretary of state condoleezza rice announced that the deal had been reached after meeting with her counterpart karel schwarzenberg in prague .
" we face with the iranians , and so do our allies and friends , a growing missile threat that is getting ever longer and ever deeper , and where the iranian appetite for nuclear technology ... is still unchecked , " rice told reporters in czech capital .
the radar system is part of a defensive shield intended to protect europe against missile attacks by so-called " rouge states " like iran .
washington hopes that the entire shield will be functional some time between 2011 and 2013 .
but rice said the next us president would have to decide whether and how to go ahead with the shield .
high speed collisions bildunterschrift : this is how the system would work in the proposed system , radar stations in the czech republic would be responsible for locating enemy missiles detected by us satellites .
that data would then be relayed to interceptor missiles or " kill vehicles " stations in neighboring poland .
the inceptors would then be sent speeding off to collide with and destroy the hostile missiles .
but questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the proposed system - in particular whether it would be capable of distinguishing between missile with live warheads and decoys .
and while tuesday 's deal could prove an important step in realizing washington 's ambitious plans , shield proponents will still have to overcome a lot of popular and political resistance rto what many fear could be the start a new cold war .
feuds galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most czechs would rather not have the shield rice 's visit to prague was accompanied by protests , with demonstrators unfurling banners reading " do n't make a target of us . "
" we believe that this could start another arms race , and we believe this will not raise the security of the czech republic , " protestor frantisek smrcka told the dpe news agency .
an opinion poll in june suggested that 68 percent of czechs were against becoming involved in the shield system .
and the current czech government has only a razor-thin majority in the parliament and could face difficulties getting the deal approved .
meanwhile , despite 14 months of negotiations , the us has yet to reach an agreement with poland , where the interceptor missiles would be stationed .
poland is insisting on billions of dollars in us aid to modernize its armed forces in return for hosting the facilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is n't happy about the prospect of these on its doorstep and russia has repeatedly expressed its opposition to having a strong us military presence in its former back yard , threatening to retarget nuclear missiles at europe if the shield is put into place .
washington has been at pains to assure the kremlin that the shield is not directed against russia .
" we want the system to be transparent to the russians , " rice told reporters on tuesday .

the controversial election was marred by violence , with more than 100 people killed and thousands displaced . " the coming months will be difficult for zimbabwe , so i think we need to provide assistance to these people , " marchal said at a press briefing held in the zimbabwean capital .
" the -lrb- european -rrb- commission delegation should remain here and should be as active as it has been hitherto , if not more . " states over governments several european countries have called for renewed sanctions on zimbabwe .

he said the eu committed 91 million euros -lrb- $ 142 million -rrb- last year to help pay for a variety of projects related to health , basic education , food aid and human rights . eu presses for more sanctions the bloc is also backing a drive by the us and the uk to push the un security council to impose visa and financial sanctions against mugabe and his top officials . zimbabwean government officials are already on an extended sanctions list from europe and the us which bars officials within mugabe ’ s inner circle and their families from traveling to europe and the us and from doing business with these countries . participants at the g8 summit currently underway in japan have indicated that they may impose further sanctions on zimbabwe unless the african union -lrb- au -rrb- and southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- act quickly to resolve the zimbabwe crisis . stanley kwenda send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier proposed a three-step solution to the conflict to a group of united nations experts on the region last week .
the first step would call on all sides to denounce violence and to allow the return of 250,000 refugees , spiegel reported .
the second would be to organize a donor 's conference to raise funds necessary for reconstruction .
the third step would be to find a political solution which would determine whether abkhazia remained part of georgia or was granted independence .
" we stand at a critical crossroads , " steinmeier reportedly said , warning participants not to " play around " with negotiations .
bombings add to tension european leaders have grown increasingly concerned in recent days that the tensions in the region are leading towards a military conflict .
on sunday , six explosions rocked the border between abkhazia and georgia .
russia and georgia have blamed each other for the blasts in gali , which killed a security chief , a united nations translator and two others .
on monday , the secretary-general of the council of europe , terry davis , described the attack as terrorism .
" these murders risk further aggravation of the tensions in the country , and i am very concerned that the situation may spin out of control , " he said in a statement .
france , which holds the rotating presidency of the european union , said on monday that it was very concerned and called " on all parties to exercise the greatest restraint and for the resumption of dialogue as quickly as possible in order to avoid an escalation in violence . "
georgia , russia at odds abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgian rule in the early 1990s .
during the conflict that followed the breakup of the soviet union , several thousand people were killed and hundreds of thousands were forced to flee their homes and have become refugees in georgia .
georgia regularly accuses russia of seeking to annex abkhazia and derail its efforts to join the nato military alliance .
russia accuses georgia of trying to take back the separatist province of abkhazia by force .
russia 's defense ministry recently warned that such a move could " turn the conflict into a new war . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de g8 summit -pipe- 08.07.2008 environmentalists slam g8 's emissions deal as meaningless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green pressure groups say the agreement is just another postponement of action as g8 leaders trumpeted their landmark deal to cut global emissions by 50 per cent by 2050 , the ' 50/50 ' agreement , which has yet to be sealed , was quickly lambasted by environmentalists as virtually meaningless . meeting for the second day at a luxury mountain resort overlooking lake toyako , in the northern island of hokkaido , the heads of state and government of the world 's seven richest countries plus russia turned their minds to the global economic slowdown , spiraling food and oil prices and the need to boost aid to africa .
but they were also under intense pressure to make real progress on the climate change front .
having failed to agree on medium-term cuts to greenhouse gas emissions , they issued a statement saying they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least -lrb- a -rrb- 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050 . "
jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission , said he was " very happy about the results of the g8 on climate change . "
german chancellor angela merkel said they had made " clear progress . "
" this is a significant step forward from heiligendamm , " merkel told reporters , referring to last year 's g8 meeting which she hosted in the northern german spa town .
" this means that the international community will no longer get off the hook , " she said .
however , south africa 's environment minister marthinus van schalkwyk said the g8 had made no progress at all in stabilising the planet .
" as it is expressed in the g8 statement , the long-term goal is an empty slogan without substance , " he said .
the g8 deal was full of ambiguity .
senior japanese official koji tsuruoka said the long-term goal should be seen as a " political vision " without a clear base year and that it is not legally binding .
but pressure groups and scientists said the leaders were merely burying their heads in the sand .
opponents scathing of g8 's empty words james hansen , one of the world 's most respected climate scientists , slammed the summit 's outcome as " worse than worthless . "
the leaders " are taking actions that guarantee that we deliver to our children climate catastrophes that are out of our control , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the g8 debates , the ice caps continue to melt " while the arctic is melting , the g8 are postponing action .
instead of climate protection , the world got nothing but flowery words , " said greenpeace 's daniel mittler .
" if this is a step forward , we will never prevent climate chaos in time . "
" the texas oilman has once again prevented the g8 from undergoing the energy revolution it needs , " mittler said .
" bush is a lame duck , so who cares what he thinks about 2050 ? "
oxfam international said that the g8 's ' 50 by 50 ' climate goal left the world with a " 50/50 chance of a climate meltdown . "
the charity called tuesday 's announcement " another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now . "
base measurement year missing from agreement critics pointed out that not only does the deal still need to be endorsed by the rest of the world , possibly at a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- meeting in copenhagen next year ; it also does n't contain a base year on which to measure the cuts .
this is because no agreement was reached among the g8 leaders .
while the eu had suggested using 1990 as a base , canada called for a much more recent date , while host japan made no suggestions at all .
moreover , russia said it would sign up to the deal , but only if it was not legally binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush would be 104 by the time the deal reaches fruition " it 's unprecedented and it is quite unrealistic that one government should take responsibility for something 42 years ahead , " said alexander pankin , a russian foreign ministry official .

unfccc chief criticizes 50-50 deal un climate change chief yvo de boer joined the debate , saying that the g8 summit goal of halving global warming emissions by 2050 was too distant and too vague .
de boer , in an interview with afp news agency , said the summit statement had " some positive elements , " as it acknowledged rich and poor countries had different responsibilities for emissions and priority had to be given to eradicating poverty .
but how rich countries intend to cut their own emissions in the next dozen years - a period deemed critical by scientists - is " completely missing , " he complained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer pointed out many holes in the g8 's agreement " if it 's not clear that rich nations are going to lead , then why should poor nations follow ? " said de boer , the executive secretary of the unfccc .
de boer spelt out what he saw as several deficiencies in the toyako statement .
" the problem is that a -rrb- 2050 is very far away ; b -rrb- it 's not clear what is going to serve as the baseline for this 50-percent reduction ; c -rrb- it 's not clear how this reduction is going to be divided up between rich nations and poor nations ; and d -rrb- it 's not clear how the rich nation portion of that minus 50 is going to be divided amongst individual countries , " he said .
de boer also questioned whether the statement amounted to a major step forward in diplomatic language compared to the 2007 g8 summit in heiligendamm .
" last year they were talking about eight countries seriously considering and adopting a 50-percent reduction goal , " he said .
" now they are suggesting that 180 countries seriously consider adopting a 50-percent reduction goal . "
energy , food and oil crises , africa also on agenda before issuing the climate statement , the g8 leaders had previously turned their attention to the economy , warning that spiraling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth .
" we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement .
the leaders further stressed that the surge in food prices had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . "
on oil , they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
other proposed solutions included boosting short-term production and refining capacities and greater market transparency to avoid speculation .
on the demand side , countries should reduce their dependence on hydrocarbons and improve energy efficiency , they said .

but they were also under intense pressure to make real progress on the climate change front .
having failed to agree on medium-term cuts to greenhouse gas emissions , they issued a statement saying they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least -lrb- a -rrb- 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050 . "
jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission , said he was " very happy about the results of the g8 on climate change . "
german chancellor angela merkel said they had made " clear progress . "
" this is a significant step forward from heiligendamm , " merkel told reporters , referring to last year 's g8 meeting which she hosted in the northern german spa town .
" this means that the international community will no longer get off the hook , " she said .
however , south africa 's environment minister marthinus van schalkwyk said the g8 had made no progress at all in stabilising the planet .
" as it is expressed in the g8 statement , the long-term goal is an empty slogan without substance , " he said .
the g8 deal was full of ambiguity .
senior japanese official koji tsuruoka said the long-term goal should be seen as a " political vision " without a clear base year and that it is not legally binding .
but pressure groups and scientists said the leaders were merely burying their heads in the sand .
opponents scathing of g8 's empty words james hansen , one of the world 's most respected climate scientists , slammed the summit 's outcome as " worse than worthless . "
the leaders " are taking actions that guarantee that we deliver to our children climate catastrophes that are out of our control , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the g8 debates , the ice caps continue to melt " while the arctic is melting , the g8 are postponing action .
instead of climate protection , the world got nothing but flowery words , " said greenpeace 's daniel mittler .
" if this is a step forward , we will never prevent climate chaos in time . "
" the texas oilman has once again prevented the g8 from undergoing the energy revolution it needs , " mittler said .
" bush is a lame duck , so who cares what he thinks about 2050 ? "
oxfam international said that the g8 's ' 50 by 50 ' climate goal left the world with a " 50/50 chance of a climate meltdown . "

germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier proposed a three-step solution to the conflict to a group of united nations experts on the region last week .
the first step would call on all sides to denounce violence and to allow the return of 250,000 refugees , spiegel reported .
the second would be to organize a donor 's conference to raise funds necessary for reconstruction .
the third step would be to find a political solution which would determine whether abkhazia remained part of georgia or was granted independence .
" we stand at a critical crossroads , " steinmeier reportedly said , warning participants not to " play around " with negotiations .
bombings add to tension european leaders have grown increasingly concerned in recent days that the tensions in the region are leading towards a military conflict .
on sunday , six explosions rocked the border between abkhazia and georgia .
russia and georgia have blamed each other for the blasts in gali , which killed a security chief , a united nations translator and two others .
on monday , the secretary-general of the council of europe , terry davis , described the attack as terrorism .
" these murders risk further aggravation of the tensions in the country , and i am very concerned that the situation may spin out of control , " he said in a statement .
france , which holds the rotating presidency of the european union , said on monday that it was very concerned and called " on all parties to exercise the greatest restraint and for the resumption of dialogue as quickly as possible in order to avoid an escalation in violence . "
georgia , russia at odds abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgian rule in the early 1990s .
during the conflict that followed the breakup of the soviet union , several thousand people were killed and hundreds of thousands were forced to flee their homes and have become refugees in georgia .
georgia regularly accuses russia of seeking to annex abkhazia and derail its efforts to join the nato military alliance .
russia accuses georgia of trying to take back the separatist province of abkhazia by force .
russia 's defense ministry recently warned that such a move could " turn the conflict into a new war . "

1 , 2008 for anyone wanting german nationality , reflect cultural biases . turkish community chairman kenan kolat said the 310 multiple-choice questions published by the interior ministry tested not only knowledge of germany but " to some extent also attitudes . "
the test is additional to existing naturalization requirements .
one question asks what allows people in germany to speak out openly against the government .
the possible answers are : freedom of religion , taxation , right to vote , freedom of opinion .
another question references germany 's christian heritage by asking what the last four weeks before christmas are called .
the following choices are given : all souls ' day , harvest festival , advent , all saints ' day .
citizenship courses make much more sense than a test , kolat said in an interview with the cologne-based daily koelner stadt-anzeiger .
multiple-choice exam thirty-three questions will be chosen at random from a longer list which will be made public beforehand .
more than half of the questions will need to be answered correctly .
integration courses to prepare for the test will remain optional .
kolat said he favored citizenship courses instead of a test .
candidates could be asked to list the colors of the german flag and how they are displayed .
they will need to know cultural reference points such as who composed the " ode to joy . "
and they will be required to beef up on trivia such as the names of germany 's mountain ranges .
not all questions easy kolat suggested putting the questions to germans at information stands in berlin .
" it would be interesting to see how that goes off , " he said .
the academics from berlin 's humboldt university who compiled the questions tested them in schools , taking as their guinea pigs pupils of both german and immigrant origin . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 2008 for anyone wanting german nationality , reflect cultural biases . turkish community chairman kenan kolat said the 310 multiple-choice questions published by the interior ministry tested not only knowledge of germany but " to some extent also attitudes . "
the test is additional to existing naturalization requirements .
one question asks what allows people in germany to speak out openly against the government .
the possible answers are : freedom of religion , taxation , right to vote , freedom of opinion .
another question references germany 's christian heritage by asking what the last four weeks before christmas are called .
the following choices are given : all souls ' day , harvest festival , advent , all saints ' day .
citizenship courses make much more sense than a test , kolat said in an interview with the cologne-based daily koelner stadt-anzeiger .
multiple-choice exam thirty-three questions will be chosen at random from a longer list which will be made public beforehand .
more than half of the questions will need to be answered correctly .
integration courses to prepare for the test will remain optional .
kolat said he favored citizenship courses instead of a test .
candidates could be asked to list the colors of the german flag and how they are displayed .
they will need to know cultural reference points such as who composed the " ode to joy . "
and they will be required to beef up on trivia such as the names of germany 's mountain ranges .
not all questions easy kolat suggested putting the questions to germans at information stands in berlin .

1 , 2008 for anyone wanting german nationality , reflect cultural biases . turkish community chairman kenan kolat said the 310 multiple-choice questions published by the interior ministry tested not only knowledge of germany but " to some extent also attitudes . "
the test is additional to existing naturalization requirements .
one question asks what allows people in germany to speak out openly against the government .
the possible answers are : freedom of religion , taxation , right to vote , freedom of opinion .
another question references germany 's christian heritage by asking what the last four weeks before christmas are called .
the following choices are given : all souls ' day , harvest festival , advent , all saints ' day .
citizenship courses make much more sense than a test , kolat said in an interview with the cologne-based daily koelner stadt-anzeiger .
multiple-choice exam thirty-three questions will be chosen at random from a longer list which will be made public beforehand .
more than half of the questions will need to be answered correctly .
integration courses to prepare for the test will remain optional .
kolat said he favored citizenship courses instead of a test .
candidates could be asked to list the colors of the german flag and how they are displayed .
they will need to know cultural reference points such as who composed the " ode to joy . "
and they will be required to beef up on trivia such as the names of germany 's mountain ranges .
not all questions easy kolat suggested putting the questions to germans at information stands in berlin .
" it would be interesting to see how that goes off , " he said .
the academics from berlin 's humboldt university who compiled the questions tested them in schools , taking as their guinea pigs pupils of both german and immigrant origin . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , environmentalists said the agreement did n't go far enough . the groundbreaking deal , brokered by g8 hosts japan and propelled by the european union , overcame the resistance of us president george w. bush , who had refused to ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change and who continues to block plans for medium-term cuts . the binding measures should be brought into the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , which will culminate in a meeting in copenhagen at the end of 2009 . in a statement , g8 leaders said they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least a 50 percent reduction of global emissions by 2050 .

" g8 leaders said they wanted to work with the nearly 200 nations involved in un climate change talks to meet the 2050 goal . the g8 communique said mid-term goals would be needed to achieve that goal , but did not give any numerical targets .
brussels , however , has called for clear interim targets . the agreement was hailed by jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission . " this is a strong signal to citizens around the world , " he said .
" we have agreed a long-term goal of at least 50 percent reduction of emissions by 2050 , and we have agreed that we should also set up mid-term targets . " now we need to go the extra mile to secure an ambitious global deal in copenhagen , " he said . environmentalists critical environmental groups were less pleased .

oil prices have about doubled over the past year and last week hit a record high of $ 145.85 a barrel .
g8 leaders called for increased production and refinement to help slow the price rise . to cushion the blow , which is taking an especially heavy toll on poor countries , officials have said the g8 would unveil a series of measures to help africa , particularly its farmers , and would affirm its commitment to give $ 50 billion in extra aid money in 2010 , half of which would go to the world 's poorest continent . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the plans are unpopular among czechs and many others . us secretary of state condoleezza rice announced that the deal had been reached after meeting with her counterpart karel schwarzenberg in prague .
" we face with the iranians , and so do our allies and friends , a growing missile threat that is getting ever longer and ever deeper , and where the iranian appetite for nuclear technology ... is still unchecked , " rice told reporters in czech capital .
the radar system is part of a defensive shield intended to protect europe against missile attacks by so-called " rouge states " like iran .
washington hopes that the entire shield will be functional some time between 2011 and 2013 .
but rice said the next us president would have to decide whether and how to go ahead with the shield .
high speed collisions bildunterschrift : this is how the system would work in the proposed system , radar stations in the czech republic would be responsible for locating enemy missiles detected by us satellites .
that data would then be relayed to interceptor missiles or " kill vehicles " stations in neighboring poland .
the inceptors would then be sent speeding off to collide with and destroy the hostile missiles .
but questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the proposed system - in particular whether it would be capable of distinguishing between missile with live warheads and decoys .
and while tuesday 's deal could prove an important step in realizing washington 's ambitious plans , shield proponents will still have to overcome a lot of popular and political resistance rto what many fear could be the start a new cold war .
feuds galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most czechs would rather not have the shield rice 's visit to prague was accompanied by protests , with demonstrators unfurling banners reading " do n't make a target of us . "
" we believe that this could start another arms race , and we believe this will not raise the security of the czech republic , " protestor frantisek smrcka told the dpe news agency .
an opinion poll in june suggested that 68 percent of czechs were against becoming involved in the shield system .
and the current czech government has only a razor-thin majority in the parliament and could face difficulties getting the deal approved .
meanwhile , despite 14 months of negotiations , the us has yet to reach an agreement with poland , where the interceptor missiles would be stationed .
poland is insisting on billions of dollars in us aid to modernize its armed forces in return for hosting the facilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is n't happy about the prospect of these on its doorstep and russia has repeatedly expressed its opposition to having a strong us military presence in its former back yard , threatening to retarget nuclear missiles at europe if the shield is put into place .
washington has been at pains to assure the kremlin that the shield is not directed against russia .
" we want the system to be transparent to the russians , " rice told reporters on tuesday .
but the system , assuming it ever gets built , could ultimately ratchet up tensions instead of making europeans feel more secure . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 08.07.2008 eu justice ministers call for tougher immigration policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union ministers have called for a change to immigration rules migration into and out of the european continent has always been a touchy issue .
now eu ministers are calling on tougher rules , which discourage illegal immigrants while still encouraging skilled foreign labor . european union justice ministers have announced that europe should take complete control of migration into and out of the continent , working with the rest of the world to end illegal migration and manage legal flows .
the news comes as eu ministers meet with their counterparts in the southern french beach resort of cannes . the informal meeting , a regular feature of eu politics , is aimed at getting ministers to agree on the broad outline of policies , so that they will find it easier to agree on the technical details at future , formal meetings . monday 's talks were set to be dominated by a proposal from the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , to create a " pact on immigration and asylum " between the eu 's 27 member states . the pact , which would not be legally binding but would carry political weight , asks eu member states to strengthen the fight against illegal immigration , to crack down on the employers of illegal migrants and to live up to their responsibility to expel illegal residents from their territory . at the same time , the pact urges eu members to put in place targeted immigration policies which would attract highly-qualified foreigners , in particular , to europe .
and it calls on the eu to work closely with countries of origin and transit , supporting development on their territories and making it easier for immigrants to send money home as a way of making it more attractive for potential migrants to stay at home . language toned down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people enter the eu illegally every year however , a draft of the pact agreed immediately before the meeting tones down considerably the strong language used in the initial text .

the controversial election was marred by violence , with more than 100 people killed and thousands displaced . " the coming months will be difficult for zimbabwe , so i think we need to provide assistance to these people , " marchal said at a press briefing held in the zimbabwean capital .
" the -lrb- european -rrb- commission delegation should remain here and should be as active as it has been hitherto , if not more . " states over governments several european countries have called for renewed sanctions on zimbabwe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de g8 summit -pipe- 08.07.2008 environmentalists slam g8 's emissions deal as meaningless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green pressure groups say the agreement is just another postponement of action as g8 leaders trumpeted their landmark deal to cut global emissions by 50 per cent by 2050 , the ' 50/50 ' agreement , which has yet to be sealed , was quickly lambasted by environmentalists as virtually meaningless . meeting for the second day at a luxury mountain resort overlooking lake toyako , in the northern island of hokkaido , the heads of state and government of the world 's seven richest countries plus russia turned their minds to the global economic slowdown , spiraling food and oil prices and the need to boost aid to africa .
but they were also under intense pressure to make real progress on the climate change front .
having failed to agree on medium-term cuts to greenhouse gas emissions , they issued a statement saying they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least -lrb- a -rrb- 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050 . "
jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission , said he was " very happy about the results of the g8 on climate change . "
german chancellor angela merkel said they had made " clear progress . "
" this is a significant step forward from heiligendamm , " merkel told reporters , referring to last year 's g8 meeting which she hosted in the northern german spa town .
" this means that the international community will no longer get off the hook , " she said .
however , south africa 's environment minister marthinus van schalkwyk said the g8 had made no progress at all in stabilising the planet .
" as it is expressed in the g8 statement , the long-term goal is an empty slogan without substance , " he said .
the g8 deal was full of ambiguity .
senior japanese official koji tsuruoka said the long-term goal should be seen as a " political vision " without a clear base year and that it is not legally binding .
but pressure groups and scientists said the leaders were merely burying their heads in the sand .
opponents scathing of g8 's empty words james hansen , one of the world 's most respected climate scientists , slammed the summit 's outcome as " worse than worthless . "
the leaders " are taking actions that guarantee that we deliver to our children climate catastrophes that are out of our control , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the g8 debates , the ice caps continue to melt " while the arctic is melting , the g8 are postponing action .
instead of climate protection , the world got nothing but flowery words , " said greenpeace 's daniel mittler .
" if this is a step forward , we will never prevent climate chaos in time . "
" the texas oilman has once again prevented the g8 from undergoing the energy revolution it needs , " mittler said .
" bush is a lame duck , so who cares what he thinks about 2050 ? "
oxfam international said that the g8 's ' 50 by 50 ' climate goal left the world with a " 50/50 chance of a climate meltdown . "
the charity called tuesday 's announcement " another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now . "
base measurement year missing from agreement critics pointed out that not only does the deal still need to be endorsed by the rest of the world , possibly at a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- meeting in copenhagen next year ; it also does n't contain a base year on which to measure the cuts .
this is because no agreement was reached among the g8 leaders .
while the eu had suggested using 1990 as a base , canada called for a much more recent date , while host japan made no suggestions at all .
moreover , russia said it would sign up to the deal , but only if it was not legally binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush would be 104 by the time the deal reaches fruition " it 's unprecedented and it is quite unrealistic that one government should take responsibility for something 42 years ahead , " said alexander pankin , a russian foreign ministry official .
as ben wikler of avaaz.org , a pressure group , noted , by the time 2050 comes us president george w bush will be 104 and japan 's premier , yasuo fukuda , will be 114 .
unfccc chief criticizes 50-50 deal un climate change chief yvo de boer joined the debate , saying that the g8 summit goal of halving global warming emissions by 2050 was too distant and too vague .
de boer , in an interview with afp news agency , said the summit statement had " some positive elements , " as it acknowledged rich and poor countries had different responsibilities for emissions and priority had to be given to eradicating poverty .
but how rich countries intend to cut their own emissions in the next dozen years - a period deemed critical by scientists - is " completely missing , " he complained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer pointed out many holes in the g8 's agreement " if it 's not clear that rich nations are going to lead , then why should poor nations follow ? " said de boer , the executive secretary of the unfccc .
de boer spelt out what he saw as several deficiencies in the toyako statement .
" the problem is that a -rrb- 2050 is very far away ; b -rrb- it 's not clear what is going to serve as the baseline for this 50-percent reduction ; c -rrb- it 's not clear how this reduction is going to be divided up between rich nations and poor nations ; and d -rrb- it 's not clear how the rich nation portion of that minus 50 is going to be divided amongst individual countries , " he said .
de boer also questioned whether the statement amounted to a major step forward in diplomatic language compared to the 2007 g8 summit in heiligendamm .
" last year they were talking about eight countries seriously considering and adopting a 50-percent reduction goal , " he said .
" now they are suggesting that 180 countries seriously consider adopting a 50-percent reduction goal . "
energy , food and oil crises , africa also on agenda before issuing the climate statement , the g8 leaders had previously turned their attention to the economy , warning that spiraling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth .
" we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement .
the leaders further stressed that the surge in food prices had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . "
on oil , they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
other proposed solutions included boosting short-term production and refining capacities and greater market transparency to avoid speculation .
on the demand side , countries should reduce their dependence on hydrocarbons and improve energy efficiency , they said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis is likely to increase global poverty meanwhile , they warned that high food prices risked pushing millions more people back into poverty and called on other donors to increase their contributions to the un 's world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- .
a promise to stick to their pledge to raise by 25 billion dollars the level of annual aid they give to africa by 2010 , meanwhile , was slammed by non-governmental organizations as too little too late .
on the issue of zimbabwe , russia opposed new sanctions against the regime of president robert mugabe .
gaffs galore there were also a series of blunders and diplomatic incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarko is making a habit of rubbing people the wrong way french president nicolas sarkozy risked offending the hosting nation by refusing to hold a bilateral meeting with fukuda , while the us delegation was forced to apologize after distributing an unflattering biography of italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .

" this means that the international community will no longer get off the hook , " she said .
however , south africa 's environment minister marthinus van schalkwyk said the g8 had made no progress at all in stabilising the planet .
" as it is expressed in the g8 statement , the long-term goal is an empty slogan without substance , " he said .
the g8 deal was full of ambiguity .
senior japanese official koji tsuruoka said the long-term goal should be seen as a " political vision " without a clear base year and that it is not legally binding .
but pressure groups and scientists said the leaders were merely burying their heads in the sand .
opponents scathing of g8 's empty words james hansen , one of the world 's most respected climate scientists , slammed the summit 's outcome as " worse than worthless . "
the leaders " are taking actions that guarantee that we deliver to our children climate catastrophes that are out of our control , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the g8 debates , the ice caps continue to melt " while the arctic is melting , the g8 are postponing action .
instead of climate protection , the world got nothing but flowery words , " said greenpeace 's daniel mittler .
" if this is a step forward , we will never prevent climate chaos in time . "
" the texas oilman has once again prevented the g8 from undergoing the energy revolution it needs , " mittler said .
" bush is a lame duck , so who cares what he thinks about 2050 ? "
oxfam international said that the g8 's ' 50 by 50 ' climate goal left the world with a " 50/50 chance of a climate meltdown . "
the charity called tuesday 's announcement " another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now . "
base measurement year missing from agreement critics pointed out that not only does the deal still need to be endorsed by the rest of the world , possibly at a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- meeting in copenhagen next year ; it also does n't contain a base year on which to measure the cuts .
this is because no agreement was reached among the g8 leaders .
while the eu had suggested using 1990 as a base , canada called for a much more recent date , while host japan made no suggestions at all .
moreover , russia said it would sign up to the deal , but only if it was not legally binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush would be 104 by the time the deal reaches fruition " it 's unprecedented and it is quite unrealistic that one government should take responsibility for something 42 years ahead , " said alexander pankin , a russian foreign ministry official .
as ben wikler of avaaz.org , a pressure group , noted , by the time 2050 comes us president george w bush will be 104 and japan 's premier , yasuo fukuda , will be 114 .
unfccc chief criticizes 50-50 deal un climate change chief yvo de boer joined the debate , saying that the g8 summit goal of halving global warming emissions by 2050 was too distant and too vague .
de boer , in an interview with afp news agency , said the summit statement had " some positive elements , " as it acknowledged rich and poor countries had different responsibilities for emissions and priority had to be given to eradicating poverty .
but how rich countries intend to cut their own emissions in the next dozen years - a period deemed critical by scientists - is " completely missing , " he complained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer pointed out many holes in the g8 's agreement " if it 's not clear that rich nations are going to lead , then why should poor nations follow ? " said de boer , the executive secretary of the unfccc .
de boer spelt out what he saw as several deficiencies in the toyako statement .
" the problem is that a -rrb- 2050 is very far away ; b -rrb- it 's not clear what is going to serve as the baseline for this 50-percent reduction ; c -rrb- it 's not clear how this reduction is going to be divided up between rich nations and poor nations ; and d -rrb- it 's not clear how the rich nation portion of that minus 50 is going to be divided amongst individual countries , " he said .
de boer also questioned whether the statement amounted to a major step forward in diplomatic language compared to the 2007 g8 summit in heiligendamm .
" last year they were talking about eight countries seriously considering and adopting a 50-percent reduction goal , " he said .
" now they are suggesting that 180 countries seriously consider adopting a 50-percent reduction goal . "
energy , food and oil crises , africa also on agenda before issuing the climate statement , the g8 leaders had previously turned their attention to the economy , warning that spiraling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth .
" we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement .
the leaders further stressed that the surge in food prices had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . "
on oil , they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
other proposed solutions included boosting short-term production and refining capacities and greater market transparency to avoid speculation .
on the demand side , countries should reduce their dependence on hydrocarbons and improve energy efficiency , they said .

a promise to stick to their pledge to raise by 25 billion dollars the level of annual aid they give to africa by 2010 , meanwhile , was slammed by non-governmental organizations as too little too late .

but they were also under intense pressure to make real progress on the climate change front .
having failed to agree on medium-term cuts to greenhouse gas emissions , they issued a statement saying they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least -lrb- a -rrb- 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050 . "
jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission , said he was " very happy about the results of the g8 on climate change . "
german chancellor angela merkel said they had made " clear progress . "
" this is a significant step forward from heiligendamm , " merkel told reporters , referring to last year 's g8 meeting which she hosted in the northern german spa town .
" this means that the international community will no longer get off the hook , " she said .
however , south africa 's environment minister marthinus van schalkwyk said the g8 had made no progress at all in stabilising the planet .
" as it is expressed in the g8 statement , the long-term goal is an empty slogan without substance , " he said .
the g8 deal was full of ambiguity .
senior japanese official koji tsuruoka said the long-term goal should be seen as a " political vision " without a clear base year and that it is not legally binding .
but pressure groups and scientists said the leaders were merely burying their heads in the sand .
opponents scathing of g8 's empty words james hansen , one of the world 's most respected climate scientists , slammed the summit 's outcome as " worse than worthless . "
the leaders " are taking actions that guarantee that we deliver to our children climate catastrophes that are out of our control , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the g8 debates , the ice caps continue to melt " while the arctic is melting , the g8 are postponing action .
instead of climate protection , the world got nothing but flowery words , " said greenpeace 's daniel mittler .
" if this is a step forward , we will never prevent climate chaos in time . "
" the texas oilman has once again prevented the g8 from undergoing the energy revolution it needs , " mittler said .
" bush is a lame duck , so who cares what he thinks about 2050 ? "
oxfam international said that the g8 's ' 50 by 50 ' climate goal left the world with a " 50/50 chance of a climate meltdown . "
the charity called tuesday 's announcement " another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now . "
base measurement year missing from agreement critics pointed out that not only does the deal still need to be endorsed by the rest of the world , possibly at a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- meeting in copenhagen next year ; it also does n't contain a base year on which to measure the cuts .
this is because no agreement was reached among the g8 leaders .
while the eu had suggested using 1990 as a base , canada called for a much more recent date , while host japan made no suggestions at all .
moreover , russia said it would sign up to the deal , but only if it was not legally binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush would be 104 by the time the deal reaches fruition " it 's unprecedented and it is quite unrealistic that one government should take responsibility for something 42 years ahead , " said alexander pankin , a russian foreign ministry official .
as ben wikler of avaaz.org , a pressure group , noted , by the time 2050 comes us president george w bush will be 104 and japan 's premier , yasuo fukuda , will be 114 .
unfccc chief criticizes 50-50 deal un climate change chief yvo de boer joined the debate , saying that the g8 summit goal of halving global warming emissions by 2050 was too distant and too vague .
de boer , in an interview with afp news agency , said the summit statement had " some positive elements , " as it acknowledged rich and poor countries had different responsibilities for emissions and priority had to be given to eradicating poverty .
but how rich countries intend to cut their own emissions in the next dozen years - a period deemed critical by scientists - is " completely missing , " he complained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer pointed out many holes in the g8 's agreement " if it 's not clear that rich nations are going to lead , then why should poor nations follow ? " said de boer , the executive secretary of the unfccc .
de boer spelt out what he saw as several deficiencies in the toyako statement .
" the problem is that a -rrb- 2050 is very far away ; b -rrb- it 's not clear what is going to serve as the baseline for this 50-percent reduction ; c -rrb- it 's not clear how this reduction is going to be divided up between rich nations and poor nations ; and d -rrb- it 's not clear how the rich nation portion of that minus 50 is going to be divided amongst individual countries , " he said .
de boer also questioned whether the statement amounted to a major step forward in diplomatic language compared to the 2007 g8 summit in heiligendamm .
" last year they were talking about eight countries seriously considering and adopting a 50-percent reduction goal , " he said .
" now they are suggesting that 180 countries seriously consider adopting a 50-percent reduction goal . "
energy , food and oil crises , africa also on agenda before issuing the climate statement , the g8 leaders had previously turned their attention to the economy , warning that spiraling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth .
" we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement .
the leaders further stressed that the surge in food prices had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . "
on oil , they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
other proposed solutions included boosting short-term production and refining capacities and greater market transparency to avoid speculation .
on the demand side , countries should reduce their dependence on hydrocarbons and improve energy efficiency , they said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis is likely to increase global poverty meanwhile , they warned that high food prices risked pushing millions more people back into poverty and called on other donors to increase their contributions to the un 's world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- .
a promise to stick to their pledge to raise by 25 billion dollars the level of annual aid they give to africa by 2010 , meanwhile , was slammed by non-governmental organizations as too little too late .
on the issue of zimbabwe , russia opposed new sanctions against the regime of president robert mugabe .
gaffs galore there were also a series of blunders and diplomatic incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarko is making a habit of rubbing people the wrong way french president nicolas sarkozy risked offending the hosting nation by refusing to hold a bilateral meeting with fukuda , while the us delegation was forced to apologize after distributing an unflattering biography of italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 08.07.2008 us , czech republic seal anti-missile radar system deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech-based radar system will be used to direct us interceptor missiles the czech government has agreed to host facilities that would be used as part of the defensive shield the us wants to build in europe .
but the plans are unpopular among czechs and many others . us secretary of state condoleezza rice announced that the deal had been reached after meeting with her counterpart karel schwarzenberg in prague .
" we face with the iranians , and so do our allies and friends , a growing missile threat that is getting ever longer and ever deeper , and where the iranian appetite for nuclear technology ... is still unchecked , " rice told reporters in czech capital .
the radar system is part of a defensive shield intended to protect europe against missile attacks by so-called " rouge states " like iran .
washington hopes that the entire shield will be functional some time between 2011 and 2013 .
but rice said the next us president would have to decide whether and how to go ahead with the shield .
high speed collisions bildunterschrift : this is how the system would work in the proposed system , radar stations in the czech republic would be responsible for locating enemy missiles detected by us satellites .
that data would then be relayed to interceptor missiles or " kill vehicles " stations in neighboring poland .
the inceptors would then be sent speeding off to collide with and destroy the hostile missiles .
but questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the proposed system - in particular whether it would be capable of distinguishing between missile with live warheads and decoys .
and while tuesday 's deal could prove an important step in realizing washington 's ambitious plans , shield proponents will still have to overcome a lot of popular and political resistance rto what many fear could be the start a new cold war .
feuds galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most czechs would rather not have the shield rice 's visit to prague was accompanied by protests , with demonstrators unfurling banners reading " do n't make a target of us . "
" we believe that this could start another arms race , and we believe this will not raise the security of the czech republic , " protestor frantisek smrcka told the dpe news agency .
an opinion poll in june suggested that 68 percent of czechs were against becoming involved in the shield system .
and the current czech government has only a razor-thin majority in the parliament and could face difficulties getting the deal approved .
meanwhile , despite 14 months of negotiations , the us has yet to reach an agreement with poland , where the interceptor missiles would be stationed .

germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier proposed a three-step solution to the conflict to a group of united nations experts on the region last week .
the first step would call on all sides to denounce violence and to allow the return of 250,000 refugees , spiegel reported .
the second would be to organize a donor 's conference to raise funds necessary for reconstruction .
the third step would be to find a political solution which would determine whether abkhazia remained part of georgia or was granted independence .

on monday , the secretary-general of the council of europe , terry davis , described the attack as terrorism .
" these murders risk further aggravation of the tensions in the country , and i am very concerned that the situation may spin out of control , " he said in a statement .

germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier proposed a three-step solution to the conflict to a group of united nations experts on the region last week .
the first step would call on all sides to denounce violence and to allow the return of 250,000 refugees , spiegel reported .
the second would be to organize a donor 's conference to raise funds necessary for reconstruction .
the third step would be to find a political solution which would determine whether abkhazia remained part of georgia or was granted independence .
" we stand at a critical crossroads , " steinmeier reportedly said , warning participants not to " play around " with negotiations .
bombings add to tension european leaders have grown increasingly concerned in recent days that the tensions in the region are leading towards a military conflict .
on sunday , six explosions rocked the border between abkhazia and georgia .
russia and georgia have blamed each other for the blasts in gali , which killed a security chief , a united nations translator and two others .
on monday , the secretary-general of the council of europe , terry davis , described the attack as terrorism .
" these murders risk further aggravation of the tensions in the country , and i am very concerned that the situation may spin out of control , " he said in a statement .
france , which holds the rotating presidency of the european union , said on monday that it was very concerned and called " on all parties to exercise the greatest restraint and for the resumption of dialogue as quickly as possible in order to avoid an escalation in violence . "

1 , 2008 for anyone wanting german nationality , reflect cultural biases . turkish community chairman kenan kolat said the 310 multiple-choice questions published by the interior ministry tested not only knowledge of germany but " to some extent also attitudes . "
the test is additional to existing naturalization requirements .
one question asks what allows people in germany to speak out openly against the government .
the possible answers are : freedom of religion , taxation , right to vote , freedom of opinion .
another question references germany 's christian heritage by asking what the last four weeks before christmas are called .
the following choices are given : all souls ' day , harvest festival , advent , all saints ' day .
citizenship courses make much more sense than a test , kolat said in an interview with the cologne-based daily koelner stadt-anzeiger .
multiple-choice exam thirty-three questions will be chosen at random from a longer list which will be made public beforehand .
more than half of the questions will need to be answered correctly .
integration courses to prepare for the test will remain optional .
kolat said he favored citizenship courses instead of a test .
candidates could be asked to list the colors of the german flag and how they are displayed .
they will need to know cultural reference points such as who composed the " ode to joy . "
and they will be required to beef up on trivia such as the names of germany 's mountain ranges .
not all questions easy kolat suggested putting the questions to germans at information stands in berlin .
" it would be interesting to see how that goes off , " he said .
the academics from berlin 's humboldt university who compiled the questions tested them in schools , taking as their guinea pigs pupils of both german and immigrant origin . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , environmentalists said the agreement did n't go far enough . the groundbreaking deal , brokered by g8 hosts japan and propelled by the european union , overcame the resistance of us president george w. bush , who had refused to ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change and who continues to block plans for medium-term cuts . the binding measures should be brought into the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , which will culminate in a meeting in copenhagen at the end of 2009 . in a statement , g8 leaders said they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least a 50 percent reduction of global emissions by 2050 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 leaders are on the japanese island of hokkaido the leaders further said that such a challenge would require " a global response " and the contributions from " all major economies , consistent with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities . " g8 leaders said they wanted to work with the nearly 200 nations involved in un climate change talks to meet the 2050 goal . the g8 communique said mid-term goals would be needed to achieve that goal , but did not give any numerical targets .
brussels , however , has called for clear interim targets . the agreement was hailed by jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission . " this is a strong signal to citizens around the world , " he said .
" we have agreed a long-term goal of at least 50 percent reduction of emissions by 2050 , and we have agreed that we should also set up mid-term targets . " now we need to go the extra mile to secure an ambitious global deal in copenhagen , " he said . environmentalists critical environmental groups were less pleased .
one pressure group said the g8 leaders had done little more than restate last year 's g8 commitment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say the g8 is n't taking a strong enough stance on the environment " the g8 are crawling forward on emissions cuts at a time when giant leaps and bounds are needed , " said peter grant of tearfund , a christian relief and development agency . at their meeting in the german resort of heiligendamm last year , g8 leaders had agreed only to " consider seriously " the 2050 target . this time round , they said they " shared " the unfccc 's vision and that they would " consider and adopt " the targets . but critics were adamant that the g8 leaders had in fact failed by not specifying targets for 2020 , merely postponing the problem to future generations . " in the year 2050 , -lrb- canadian prime minister stephen -rrb- harper will be 91 , bush will be 104 and -lrb- japanese prime minister yasuo -rrb- fukuda will be 114 .
so we do n't necessarily believe their commitments , " said ben wikler of avaaz.org , an environmentalist group . fuel and food soaring oil and food prices were also high on the agenda on the second day of this summit in a luxury mountain-top hotel on the japanese island of hokkaido . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil prices are painful for europe , but hitting poor countries especially hard high prices for oil and food pose a " serious challenge to stable worldwide economic growth , " g8 leaders from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states warned on tuesday . in the face of skyrocketing prices , the g8 said it wanted to bring major oil producers and consumers together for a summit to discuss output and pricing .
oil prices have about doubled over the past year and last week hit a record high of $ 145.85 a barrel .
g8 leaders called for increased production and refinement to help slow the price rise . to cushion the blow , which is taking an especially heavy toll on poor countries , officials have said the g8 would unveil a series of measures to help africa , particularly its farmers , and would affirm its commitment to give $ 50 billion in extra aid money in 2010 , half of which would go to the world 's poorest continent . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics have said the reason for this is that the real goal of the unlikely bedfellows - the democrats and the socialists - is to keep the ultra-nationalists lurking in opposition . if that is the case , the new government might make gestures that would prolong its stay in power , while avoiding hard decisions that would reap long-term benefits , such as cutting national spending or capturing the war criminals still at large . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" full-fledged eu membership is the core interest of the republic of serbia and its citizens , " he told the parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian and eu officials signing an accord earlier this year " therefore , one of the first moves of the new government will be to submit the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- to the national parliament for ratification , " he said . on the eve of the may 11 polls the eu signed the saa with serbia , providing a boost to the pro-european bloc .
but both sides have yet to ratify the accord , which is considered the first step towards full membership in the 27-member bloc . " the government 's main objective is for serbia to gain eu candidate country status by the end of this year or by the beginning of next year , through the acceleration of economic and other reforms envisaged by the saa . " brussels has already said it would support serbia 's new government . however , before progress can continue towards eu membership , belgrade must arrest war-crime suspects still on the loose - something the socialist party -lrb- sps -rrb- has vowed to block . kosovo sticking point serbia has downgraded diplomatic relations with all the nations - more than 40 , including leading western powers - that have recognized kosovo since it declared independence in february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's president boris tadic virtually all major serbian leaders said they would never recognize kosovo , viewed by serbs as their heartland . economically , cvetkovic has to deal with stalled reforms , bloated spending , an overrated national currency and rising prices , all complicated by endemic corruption . cvetkovic singled out the fight against corruption as one of his priorities , like most of his predecessors .
neither the socialist party heads of government from 1990-2000 nor those from the democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- from 2000-2004 have a good track record on this issue . difficult tasks ahead cvetkovic now plans to lead a cabinet of 27 members , the largest since slobodan milosevic 's last government , ruling until 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians celebrated with the new kosovo flag in february the ruling coalition was forged between pro-european president boris tadic 's democratic party and milosevic 's socialist party , along with several ethnic minority representatives . the democrats had been fierce opponents of the socialist party since 1990 , when it slobodan milosevic led it and the country into war and international isolation . politically and diplomatically , the new authorities face the difficult task of reconciling the aspiration of the majority in serbia for the country 's membership of the european union with the hurt over kosovo 's secession , which followed a nod from the west . the opposition has accused the coalition of lacking a clear game plan .
critics have said the reason for this is that the real goal of the unlikely bedfellows - the democrats and the socialists - is to keep the ultra-nationalists lurking in opposition . if that is the case , the new government might make gestures that would prolong its stay in power , while avoiding hard decisions that would reap long-term benefits , such as cutting national spending or capturing the war criminals still at large . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the test is additional to existing naturalization requirements .
one question asks what allows people in germany to speak out openly against the government .
the possible answers are : freedom of religion , taxation , right to vote , freedom of opinion .
another question references germany 's christian heritage by asking what the last four weeks before christmas are called .
the following choices are given : all souls ' day , harvest festival , advent , all saints ' day .
citizenship courses make much more sense than a test , kolat said in an interview with the cologne-based daily koelner stadt-anzeiger .
multiple-choice exam thirty-three questions will be chosen at random from a longer list which will be made public beforehand .
more than half of the questions will need to be answered correctly .
integration courses to prepare for the test will remain optional .
kolat said he favored citizenship courses instead of a test .
candidates could be asked to list the colors of the german flag and how they are displayed .
they will need to know cultural reference points such as who composed the " ode to joy . "
and they will be required to beef up on trivia such as the names of germany 's mountain ranges .

but the plans are unpopular among czechs and many others . us secretary of state condoleezza rice announced that the deal had been reached after meeting with her counterpart karel schwarzenberg in prague .
" we face with the iranians , and so do our allies and friends , a growing missile threat that is getting ever longer and ever deeper , and where the iranian appetite for nuclear technology ... is still unchecked , " rice told reporters in czech capital .
the radar system is part of a defensive shield intended to protect europe against missile attacks by so-called " rouge states " like iran .
washington hopes that the entire shield will be functional some time between 2011 and 2013 .
but rice said the next us president would have to decide whether and how to go ahead with the shield .
high speed collisions bildunterschrift : this is how the system would work in the proposed system , radar stations in the czech republic would be responsible for locating enemy missiles detected by us satellites .
that data would then be relayed to interceptor missiles or " kill vehicles " stations in neighboring poland .
the inceptors would then be sent speeding off to collide with and destroy the hostile missiles .
but questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the proposed system - in particular whether it would be capable of distinguishing between missile with live warheads and decoys .
and while tuesday 's deal could prove an important step in realizing washington 's ambitious plans , shield proponents will still have to overcome a lot of popular and political resistance rto what many fear could be the start a new cold war .
feuds galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most czechs would rather not have the shield rice 's visit to prague was accompanied by protests , with demonstrators unfurling banners reading " do n't make a target of us . "
" we believe that this could start another arms race , and we believe this will not raise the security of the czech republic , " protestor frantisek smrcka told the dpe news agency .
an opinion poll in june suggested that 68 percent of czechs were against becoming involved in the shield system .
and the current czech government has only a razor-thin majority in the parliament and could face difficulties getting the deal approved .
meanwhile , despite 14 months of negotiations , the us has yet to reach an agreement with poland , where the interceptor missiles would be stationed .
poland is insisting on billions of dollars in us aid to modernize its armed forces in return for hosting the facilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is n't happy about the prospect of these on its doorstep and russia has repeatedly expressed its opposition to having a strong us military presence in its former back yard , threatening to retarget nuclear missiles at europe if the shield is put into place .
washington has been at pains to assure the kremlin that the shield is not directed against russia .
" we want the system to be transparent to the russians , " rice told reporters on tuesday .

two young men were given long jail terms for beating an elderly man in a subway .
the case triggered a bitter debate in germany about whether ethnic minorities should be blamed for increasing juvenile violence . a 21-year-old turkish national will spend 12 years in jail while his 18-year-old greek national accomplice will go to jail for 8.5 years .
the defense council had wanted to two young men to be convicted for assault , which would have carried a two-year jail term .
the court called the attack , which occurred just before christmas in 2007 , a " completely meaningless act . "
the men , who grew up in germany , were convicted of attempted murder in the attack on a 76-year-old former teacher .
the attack was filmed by the munich subway 's closed-circuit tv cameras .
the retired teacher had reportedly rebuked the two young men for smoking in a non-smoking zone .
the men responded by knocking him to the ground and kicking him in the head .
the man was seriously injured with a triple fracture to the skull and internal bleeding , but survived .
men offer apologies , excuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance footage captured the brutal attack the accused , 17 and 20 at the time of the attack , were convicted by a youth court in munich .

" to this day i can not say why i did something like that , " serkan a. said in a statement read in court by his lawyer .
" i had no intention of killing him . "
" i am ashamed , " spyridon l. said .
" i am not normally the kind of person who hits old people .
i was so drunk , i am sorry . "
case quickly turned political the victim said he did not regard the apologies as sincere , remarking that the young men " played soccer with my head . "
the assault became a political weapon in the hands of roland koch , premier of the neighboring state of hesse .
koch spoke out against what he saw as the courts ' reluctance to jail teen troublemakers for minor violence .
in his re-election campaign , koch and other center-right figures called for special youth jails , or boot camps , which would focus on arduous exercise and military-style discipline .
koch 's campaign drew attacks from opposition parties , who accused him of exploiting anti-immigrant sentiment for political gain .
his conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- lost the january poll .
calls for deportation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch wants to toughen laws against juvenile offenders throughout january , the german news media highlighted cases of violence by minority youths amid calls for deportation of offenders , but the controversy has since calmed .
bavarian conservatives have called for a change in laws to maeke it easier to deport convicted criminals .
bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann said he would like to see the two men sent back to their parents ' countries when they complete their jail terms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 08.07.2008 eu justice ministers call for tougher immigration policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union ministers have called for a change to immigration rules migration into and out of the european continent has always been a touchy issue .
now eu ministers are calling on tougher rules , which discourage illegal immigrants while still encouraging skilled foreign labor . european union justice ministers have announced that europe should take complete control of migration into and out of the continent , working with the rest of the world to end illegal migration and manage legal flows .
the news comes as eu ministers meet with their counterparts in the southern french beach resort of cannes . the informal meeting , a regular feature of eu politics , is aimed at getting ministers to agree on the broad outline of policies , so that they will find it easier to agree on the technical details at future , formal meetings . monday 's talks were set to be dominated by a proposal from the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , to create a " pact on immigration and asylum " between the eu 's 27 member states . the pact , which would not be legally binding but would carry political weight , asks eu member states to strengthen the fight against illegal immigration , to crack down on the employers of illegal migrants and to live up to their responsibility to expel illegal residents from their territory . at the same time , the pact urges eu members to put in place targeted immigration policies which would attract highly-qualified foreigners , in particular , to europe .
and it calls on the eu to work closely with countries of origin and transit , supporting development on their territories and making it easier for immigrants to send money home as a way of making it more attractive for potential migrants to stay at home . language toned down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people enter the eu illegally every year however , a draft of the pact agreed immediately before the meeting tones down considerably the strong language used in the initial text .
where the first draft listed strengthened border control as its top priority , that was relegated to number three in later versions , being supplanted by the question of boosting legal migration . the first draft also prioritized " organizing the effective removal of irregular residents from the eu " - an emphasis which chimes in with the policy of france 's president nicolas sarkozy , who has set annual quotas for expelling illegal immigrants . but the later text used a much softer tone , calling for a general " fight against illegal immigration , especially assuring the return of foreigners who are in an irregular situation to their country of origin or a transit country . " the first draft of the pact also stated categorically that " massive and collective legalizations produce a major pull effect " and that member states " agree to give them up . "
but the latest draft simply calls on member states to limit their legalizations to a case-by-case system in the future . french experts critical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been heavily criticized for his stance while that compromise paves the way for broad eu acceptance of the text at a summit in october , the news on the domestic front was less promising for the french government in its immigration plans . as the meeting opened , the french press reported that a commission of french experts formed by sarkozy to discuss his migration policies had roundly criticized key points . binding immigration quotas would be " unrealistic and pointless , " and the national authorities have " no discretionary power to determine the flow " of migrants into france , especially on family grounds , left-wing daily la liberation quoted the report . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now eu ministers are calling on tougher rules , which discourage illegal immigrants while still encouraging skilled foreign labor . european union justice ministers have announced that europe should take complete control of migration into and out of the continent , working with the rest of the world to end illegal migration and manage legal flows .
the news comes as eu ministers meet with their counterparts in the southern french beach resort of cannes . the informal meeting , a regular feature of eu politics , is aimed at getting ministers to agree on the broad outline of policies , so that they will find it easier to agree on the technical details at future , formal meetings . monday 's talks were set to be dominated by a proposal from the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , to create a " pact on immigration and asylum " between the eu 's 27 member states . the pact , which would not be legally binding but would carry political weight , asks eu member states to strengthen the fight against illegal immigration , to crack down on the employers of illegal migrants and to live up to their responsibility to expel illegal residents from their territory . at the same time , the pact urges eu members to put in place targeted immigration policies which would attract highly-qualified foreigners , in particular , to europe .
and it calls on the eu to work closely with countries of origin and transit , supporting development on their territories and making it easier for immigrants to send money home as a way of making it more attractive for potential migrants to stay at home . language toned down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people enter the eu illegally every year however , a draft of the pact agreed immediately before the meeting tones down considerably the strong language used in the initial text .
where the first draft listed strengthened border control as its top priority , that was relegated to number three in later versions , being supplanted by the question of boosting legal migration . the first draft also prioritized " organizing the effective removal of irregular residents from the eu " - an emphasis which chimes in with the policy of france 's president nicolas sarkozy , who has set annual quotas for expelling illegal immigrants . but the later text used a much softer tone , calling for a general " fight against illegal immigration , especially assuring the return of foreigners who are in an irregular situation to their country of origin or a transit country . " the first draft of the pact also stated categorically that " massive and collective legalizations produce a major pull effect " and that member states " agree to give them up . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de g8 summit -pipe- 08.07.2008 environmentalists slam g8 's emissions deal as meaningless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green pressure groups say the agreement is just another postponement of action as g8 leaders trumpeted their landmark deal to cut global emissions by 50 per cent by 2050 , the ' 50/50 ' agreement , which has yet to be sealed , was quickly lambasted by environmentalists as virtually meaningless . meeting for the second day at a luxury mountain resort overlooking lake toyako , in the northern island of hokkaido , the heads of state and government of the world 's seven richest countries plus russia turned their minds to the global economic slowdown , spiraling food and oil prices and the need to boost aid to africa .
but they were also under intense pressure to make real progress on the climate change front .
having failed to agree on medium-term cuts to greenhouse gas emissions , they issued a statement saying they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least -lrb- a -rrb- 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050 . "
jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission , said he was " very happy about the results of the g8 on climate change . "
german chancellor angela merkel said they had made " clear progress . "
" this is a significant step forward from heiligendamm , " merkel told reporters , referring to last year 's g8 meeting which she hosted in the northern german spa town .
" this means that the international community will no longer get off the hook , " she said .
however , south africa 's environment minister marthinus van schalkwyk said the g8 had made no progress at all in stabilising the planet .
" as it is expressed in the g8 statement , the long-term goal is an empty slogan without substance , " he said .
the g8 deal was full of ambiguity .
senior japanese official koji tsuruoka said the long-term goal should be seen as a " political vision " without a clear base year and that it is not legally binding .
but pressure groups and scientists said the leaders were merely burying their heads in the sand .
opponents scathing of g8 's empty words james hansen , one of the world 's most respected climate scientists , slammed the summit 's outcome as " worse than worthless . "
the leaders " are taking actions that guarantee that we deliver to our children climate catastrophes that are out of our control , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the g8 debates , the ice caps continue to melt " while the arctic is melting , the g8 are postponing action .
instead of climate protection , the world got nothing but flowery words , " said greenpeace 's daniel mittler .
" if this is a step forward , we will never prevent climate chaos in time . "
" the texas oilman has once again prevented the g8 from undergoing the energy revolution it needs , " mittler said .
" bush is a lame duck , so who cares what he thinks about 2050 ? "
oxfam international said that the g8 's ' 50 by 50 ' climate goal left the world with a " 50/50 chance of a climate meltdown . "
the charity called tuesday 's announcement " another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now . "
base measurement year missing from agreement critics pointed out that not only does the deal still need to be endorsed by the rest of the world , possibly at a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- meeting in copenhagen next year ; it also does n't contain a base year on which to measure the cuts .
this is because no agreement was reached among the g8 leaders .
while the eu had suggested using 1990 as a base , canada called for a much more recent date , while host japan made no suggestions at all .
moreover , russia said it would sign up to the deal , but only if it was not legally binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush would be 104 by the time the deal reaches fruition " it 's unprecedented and it is quite unrealistic that one government should take responsibility for something 42 years ahead , " said alexander pankin , a russian foreign ministry official .
as ben wikler of avaaz.org , a pressure group , noted , by the time 2050 comes us president george w bush will be 104 and japan 's premier , yasuo fukuda , will be 114 .
unfccc chief criticizes 50-50 deal un climate change chief yvo de boer joined the debate , saying that the g8 summit goal of halving global warming emissions by 2050 was too distant and too vague .
de boer , in an interview with afp news agency , said the summit statement had " some positive elements , " as it acknowledged rich and poor countries had different responsibilities for emissions and priority had to be given to eradicating poverty .
but how rich countries intend to cut their own emissions in the next dozen years - a period deemed critical by scientists - is " completely missing , " he complained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer pointed out many holes in the g8 's agreement " if it 's not clear that rich nations are going to lead , then why should poor nations follow ? " said de boer , the executive secretary of the unfccc .
de boer spelt out what he saw as several deficiencies in the toyako statement .
" the problem is that a -rrb- 2050 is very far away ; b -rrb- it 's not clear what is going to serve as the baseline for this 50-percent reduction ; c -rrb- it 's not clear how this reduction is going to be divided up between rich nations and poor nations ; and d -rrb- it 's not clear how the rich nation portion of that minus 50 is going to be divided amongst individual countries , " he said .
de boer also questioned whether the statement amounted to a major step forward in diplomatic language compared to the 2007 g8 summit in heiligendamm .
" last year they were talking about eight countries seriously considering and adopting a 50-percent reduction goal , " he said .
" now they are suggesting that 180 countries seriously consider adopting a 50-percent reduction goal . "
energy , food and oil crises , africa also on agenda before issuing the climate statement , the g8 leaders had previously turned their attention to the economy , warning that spiraling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth .
" we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement .
the leaders further stressed that the surge in food prices had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . "
on oil , they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
other proposed solutions included boosting short-term production and refining capacities and greater market transparency to avoid speculation .
on the demand side , countries should reduce their dependence on hydrocarbons and improve energy efficiency , they said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis is likely to increase global poverty meanwhile , they warned that high food prices risked pushing millions more people back into poverty and called on other donors to increase their contributions to the un 's world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- .
a promise to stick to their pledge to raise by 25 billion dollars the level of annual aid they give to africa by 2010 , meanwhile , was slammed by non-governmental organizations as too little too late .
on the issue of zimbabwe , russia opposed new sanctions against the regime of president robert mugabe .
gaffs galore there were also a series of blunders and diplomatic incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarko is making a habit of rubbing people the wrong way french president nicolas sarkozy risked offending the hosting nation by refusing to hold a bilateral meeting with fukuda , while the us delegation was forced to apologize after distributing an unflattering biography of italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .

but they were also under intense pressure to make real progress on the climate change front .
having failed to agree on medium-term cuts to greenhouse gas emissions , they issued a statement saying they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least -lrb- a -rrb- 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050 . "
jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission , said he was " very happy about the results of the g8 on climate change . "
german chancellor angela merkel said they had made " clear progress . "
" this is a significant step forward from heiligendamm , " merkel told reporters , referring to last year 's g8 meeting which she hosted in the northern german spa town .
" this means that the international community will no longer get off the hook , " she said .
however , south africa 's environment minister marthinus van schalkwyk said the g8 had made no progress at all in stabilising the planet .
" as it is expressed in the g8 statement , the long-term goal is an empty slogan without substance , " he said .
the g8 deal was full of ambiguity .
senior japanese official koji tsuruoka said the long-term goal should be seen as a " political vision " without a clear base year and that it is not legally binding .
but pressure groups and scientists said the leaders were merely burying their heads in the sand .
opponents scathing of g8 's empty words james hansen , one of the world 's most respected climate scientists , slammed the summit 's outcome as " worse than worthless . "
the leaders " are taking actions that guarantee that we deliver to our children climate catastrophes that are out of our control , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the g8 debates , the ice caps continue to melt " while the arctic is melting , the g8 are postponing action .
instead of climate protection , the world got nothing but flowery words , " said greenpeace 's daniel mittler .
" if this is a step forward , we will never prevent climate chaos in time . "
" the texas oilman has once again prevented the g8 from undergoing the energy revolution it needs , " mittler said .
" bush is a lame duck , so who cares what he thinks about 2050 ? "
oxfam international said that the g8 's ' 50 by 50 ' climate goal left the world with a " 50/50 chance of a climate meltdown . "
the charity called tuesday 's announcement " another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now . "
base measurement year missing from agreement critics pointed out that not only does the deal still need to be endorsed by the rest of the world , possibly at a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- meeting in copenhagen next year ; it also does n't contain a base year on which to measure the cuts .
this is because no agreement was reached among the g8 leaders .
while the eu had suggested using 1990 as a base , canada called for a much more recent date , while host japan made no suggestions at all .
moreover , russia said it would sign up to the deal , but only if it was not legally binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush would be 104 by the time the deal reaches fruition " it 's unprecedented and it is quite unrealistic that one government should take responsibility for something 42 years ahead , " said alexander pankin , a russian foreign ministry official .
as ben wikler of avaaz.org , a pressure group , noted , by the time 2050 comes us president george w bush will be 104 and japan 's premier , yasuo fukuda , will be 114 .
unfccc chief criticizes 50-50 deal un climate change chief yvo de boer joined the debate , saying that the g8 summit goal of halving global warming emissions by 2050 was too distant and too vague .
de boer , in an interview with afp news agency , said the summit statement had " some positive elements , " as it acknowledged rich and poor countries had different responsibilities for emissions and priority had to be given to eradicating poverty .
but how rich countries intend to cut their own emissions in the next dozen years - a period deemed critical by scientists - is " completely missing , " he complained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer pointed out many holes in the g8 's agreement " if it 's not clear that rich nations are going to lead , then why should poor nations follow ? " said de boer , the executive secretary of the unfccc .
de boer spelt out what he saw as several deficiencies in the toyako statement .
" the problem is that a -rrb- 2050 is very far away ; b -rrb- it 's not clear what is going to serve as the baseline for this 50-percent reduction ; c -rrb- it 's not clear how this reduction is going to be divided up between rich nations and poor nations ; and d -rrb- it 's not clear how the rich nation portion of that minus 50 is going to be divided amongst individual countries , " he said .
de boer also questioned whether the statement amounted to a major step forward in diplomatic language compared to the 2007 g8 summit in heiligendamm .
" last year they were talking about eight countries seriously considering and adopting a 50-percent reduction goal , " he said .
" now they are suggesting that 180 countries seriously consider adopting a 50-percent reduction goal . "
energy , food and oil crises , africa also on agenda before issuing the climate statement , the g8 leaders had previously turned their attention to the economy , warning that spiraling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth .
" we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement .
the leaders further stressed that the surge in food prices had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . "
on oil , they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
other proposed solutions included boosting short-term production and refining capacities and greater market transparency to avoid speculation .
on the demand side , countries should reduce their dependence on hydrocarbons and improve energy efficiency , they said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer pointed out many holes in the g8 's agreement " if it 's not clear that rich nations are going to lead , then why should poor nations follow ? " said de boer , the executive secretary of the unfccc .
de boer spelt out what he saw as several deficiencies in the toyako statement .
" the problem is that a -rrb- 2050 is very far away ; b -rrb- it 's not clear what is going to serve as the baseline for this 50-percent reduction ; c -rrb- it 's not clear how this reduction is going to be divided up between rich nations and poor nations ; and d -rrb- it 's not clear how the rich nation portion of that minus 50 is going to be divided amongst individual countries , " he said .
de boer also questioned whether the statement amounted to a major step forward in diplomatic language compared to the 2007 g8 summit in heiligendamm .
" last year they were talking about eight countries seriously considering and adopting a 50-percent reduction goal , " he said .
" now they are suggesting that 180 countries seriously consider adopting a 50-percent reduction goal . "
energy , food and oil crises , africa also on agenda before issuing the climate statement , the g8 leaders had previously turned their attention to the economy , warning that spiraling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth .
" we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement .
the leaders further stressed that the surge in food prices had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . "
on oil , they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
other proposed solutions included boosting short-term production and refining capacities and greater market transparency to avoid speculation .
on the demand side , countries should reduce their dependence on hydrocarbons and improve energy efficiency , they said .

germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier proposed a three-step solution to the conflict to a group of united nations experts on the region last week .
the first step would call on all sides to denounce violence and to allow the return of 250,000 refugees , spiegel reported .
the second would be to organize a donor 's conference to raise funds necessary for reconstruction .
the third step would be to find a political solution which would determine whether abkhazia remained part of georgia or was granted independence .
" we stand at a critical crossroads , " steinmeier reportedly said , warning participants not to " play around " with negotiations .
bombings add to tension european leaders have grown increasingly concerned in recent days that the tensions in the region are leading towards a military conflict .
on sunday , six explosions rocked the border between abkhazia and georgia .
russia and georgia have blamed each other for the blasts in gali , which killed a security chief , a united nations translator and two others .
on monday , the secretary-general of the council of europe , terry davis , described the attack as terrorism .
" these murders risk further aggravation of the tensions in the country , and i am very concerned that the situation may spin out of control , " he said in a statement .
france , which holds the rotating presidency of the european union , said on monday that it was very concerned and called " on all parties to exercise the greatest restraint and for the resumption of dialogue as quickly as possible in order to avoid an escalation in violence . "
georgia , russia at odds abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgian rule in the early 1990s .
during the conflict that followed the breakup of the soviet union , several thousand people were killed and hundreds of thousands were forced to flee their homes and have become refugees in georgia .
georgia regularly accuses russia of seeking to annex abkhazia and derail its efforts to join the nato military alliance .
russia accuses georgia of trying to take back the separatist province of abkhazia by force .
russia 's defense ministry recently warned that such a move could " turn the conflict into a new war . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de g8 summit -pipe- 08.07.2008 environmentalists slam g8 's emissions deal as meaningless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green pressure groups say the agreement is just another postponement of action as g8 leaders trumpeted their landmark deal to cut global emissions by 50 per cent by 2050 , the ' 50/50 ' agreement , which has yet to be sealed , was quickly lambasted by environmentalists as virtually meaningless . meeting for the second day at a luxury mountain resort overlooking lake toyako , in the northern island of hokkaido , the heads of state and government of the world 's seven richest countries plus russia turned their minds to the global economic slowdown , spiraling food and oil prices and the need to boost aid to africa .
but they were also under intense pressure to make real progress on the climate change front .
having failed to agree on medium-term cuts to greenhouse gas emissions , they issued a statement saying they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least -lrb- a -rrb- 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050 . "
jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission , said he was " very happy about the results of the g8 on climate change . "
german chancellor angela merkel said they had made " clear progress . "
" this is a significant step forward from heiligendamm , " merkel told reporters , referring to last year 's g8 meeting which she hosted in the northern german spa town .
" this means that the international community will no longer get off the hook , " she said .
however , south africa 's environment minister marthinus van schalkwyk said the g8 had made no progress at all in stabilising the planet .
" as it is expressed in the g8 statement , the long-term goal is an empty slogan without substance , " he said .
the g8 deal was full of ambiguity .
senior japanese official koji tsuruoka said the long-term goal should be seen as a " political vision " without a clear base year and that it is not legally binding .
but pressure groups and scientists said the leaders were merely burying their heads in the sand .
opponents scathing of g8 's empty words james hansen , one of the world 's most respected climate scientists , slammed the summit 's outcome as " worse than worthless . "
the leaders " are taking actions that guarantee that we deliver to our children climate catastrophes that are out of our control , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the g8 debates , the ice caps continue to melt " while the arctic is melting , the g8 are postponing action .
instead of climate protection , the world got nothing but flowery words , " said greenpeace 's daniel mittler .
" if this is a step forward , we will never prevent climate chaos in time . "
" the texas oilman has once again prevented the g8 from undergoing the energy revolution it needs , " mittler said .
" bush is a lame duck , so who cares what he thinks about 2050 ? "
oxfam international said that the g8 's ' 50 by 50 ' climate goal left the world with a " 50/50 chance of a climate meltdown . "
the charity called tuesday 's announcement " another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now . "
base measurement year missing from agreement critics pointed out that not only does the deal still need to be endorsed by the rest of the world , possibly at a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- meeting in copenhagen next year ; it also does n't contain a base year on which to measure the cuts .
this is because no agreement was reached among the g8 leaders .
while the eu had suggested using 1990 as a base , canada called for a much more recent date , while host japan made no suggestions at all .
moreover , russia said it would sign up to the deal , but only if it was not legally binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush would be 104 by the time the deal reaches fruition " it 's unprecedented and it is quite unrealistic that one government should take responsibility for something 42 years ahead , " said alexander pankin , a russian foreign ministry official .
as ben wikler of avaaz.org , a pressure group , noted , by the time 2050 comes us president george w bush will be 104 and japan 's premier , yasuo fukuda , will be 114 .
unfccc chief criticizes 50-50 deal un climate change chief yvo de boer joined the debate , saying that the g8 summit goal of halving global warming emissions by 2050 was too distant and too vague .
de boer , in an interview with afp news agency , said the summit statement had " some positive elements , " as it acknowledged rich and poor countries had different responsibilities for emissions and priority had to be given to eradicating poverty .
but how rich countries intend to cut their own emissions in the next dozen years - a period deemed critical by scientists - is " completely missing , " he complained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer pointed out many holes in the g8 's agreement " if it 's not clear that rich nations are going to lead , then why should poor nations follow ? " said de boer , the executive secretary of the unfccc .

germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier proposed a three-step solution to the conflict to a group of united nations experts on the region last week .
the first step would call on all sides to denounce violence and to allow the return of 250,000 refugees , spiegel reported .
the second would be to organize a donor 's conference to raise funds necessary for reconstruction .
the third step would be to find a political solution which would determine whether abkhazia remained part of georgia or was granted independence .
" we stand at a critical crossroads , " steinmeier reportedly said , warning participants not to " play around " with negotiations .
bombings add to tension european leaders have grown increasingly concerned in recent days that the tensions in the region are leading towards a military conflict .
on sunday , six explosions rocked the border between abkhazia and georgia .
russia and georgia have blamed each other for the blasts in gali , which killed a security chief , a united nations translator and two others .
on monday , the secretary-general of the council of europe , terry davis , described the attack as terrorism .
" these murders risk further aggravation of the tensions in the country , and i am very concerned that the situation may spin out of control , " he said in a statement .
france , which holds the rotating presidency of the european union , said on monday that it was very concerned and called " on all parties to exercise the greatest restraint and for the resumption of dialogue as quickly as possible in order to avoid an escalation in violence . "
georgia , russia at odds abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgian rule in the early 1990s .
during the conflict that followed the breakup of the soviet union , several thousand people were killed and hundreds of thousands were forced to flee their homes and have become refugees in georgia .

germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier proposed a three-step solution to the conflict to a group of united nations experts on the region last week .
the first step would call on all sides to denounce violence and to allow the return of 250,000 refugees , spiegel reported .
the second would be to organize a donor 's conference to raise funds necessary for reconstruction .
the third step would be to find a political solution which would determine whether abkhazia remained part of georgia or was granted independence .

on monday , the secretary-general of the council of europe , terry davis , described the attack as terrorism .
" these murders risk further aggravation of the tensions in the country , and i am very concerned that the situation may spin out of control , " he said in a statement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 08.07.2008 eu justice ministers call for tougher immigration policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union ministers have called for a change to immigration rules migration into and out of the european continent has always been a touchy issue .
now eu ministers are calling on tougher rules , which discourage illegal immigrants while still encouraging skilled foreign labor . european union justice ministers have announced that europe should take complete control of migration into and out of the continent , working with the rest of the world to end illegal migration and manage legal flows .
the news comes as eu ministers meet with their counterparts in the southern french beach resort of cannes . the informal meeting , a regular feature of eu politics , is aimed at getting ministers to agree on the broad outline of policies , so that they will find it easier to agree on the technical details at future , formal meetings . monday 's talks were set to be dominated by a proposal from the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , to create a " pact on immigration and asylum " between the eu 's 27 member states . the pact , which would not be legally binding but would carry political weight , asks eu member states to strengthen the fight against illegal immigration , to crack down on the employers of illegal migrants and to live up to their responsibility to expel illegal residents from their territory . at the same time , the pact urges eu members to put in place targeted immigration policies which would attract highly-qualified foreigners , in particular , to europe .

where the first draft listed strengthened border control as its top priority , that was relegated to number three in later versions , being supplanted by the question of boosting legal migration . the first draft also prioritized " organizing the effective removal of irregular residents from the eu " - an emphasis which chimes in with the policy of france 's president nicolas sarkozy , who has set annual quotas for expelling illegal immigrants . but the later text used a much softer tone , calling for a general " fight against illegal immigration , especially assuring the return of foreigners who are in an irregular situation to their country of origin or a transit country . " the first draft of the pact also stated categorically that " massive and collective legalizations produce a major pull effect " and that member states " agree to give them up . "
but the latest draft simply calls on member states to limit their legalizations to a case-by-case system in the future . french experts critical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been heavily criticized for his stance while that compromise paves the way for broad eu acceptance of the text at a summit in october , the news on the domestic front was less promising for the french government in its immigration plans . as the meeting opened , the french press reported that a commission of french experts formed by sarkozy to discuss his migration policies had roundly criticized key points . binding immigration quotas would be " unrealistic and pointless , " and the national authorities have " no discretionary power to determine the flow " of migrants into france , especially on family grounds , left-wing daily la liberation quoted the report . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , environmentalists said the agreement did n't go far enough . the groundbreaking deal , brokered by g8 hosts japan and propelled by the european union , overcame the resistance of us president george w. bush , who had refused to ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change and who continues to block plans for medium-term cuts . the binding measures should be brought into the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , which will culminate in a meeting in copenhagen at the end of 2009 . in a statement , g8 leaders said they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least a 50 percent reduction of global emissions by 2050 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 leaders are on the japanese island of hokkaido the leaders further said that such a challenge would require " a global response " and the contributions from " all major economies , consistent with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities . " g8 leaders said they wanted to work with the nearly 200 nations involved in un climate change talks to meet the 2050 goal . the g8 communique said mid-term goals would be needed to achieve that goal , but did not give any numerical targets .
brussels , however , has called for clear interim targets . the agreement was hailed by jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission . " this is a strong signal to citizens around the world , " he said .
" we have agreed a long-term goal of at least 50 percent reduction of emissions by 2050 , and we have agreed that we should also set up mid-term targets . " now we need to go the extra mile to secure an ambitious global deal in copenhagen , " he said . environmentalists critical environmental groups were less pleased .
one pressure group said the g8 leaders had done little more than restate last year 's g8 commitment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say the g8 is n't taking a strong enough stance on the environment " the g8 are crawling forward on emissions cuts at a time when giant leaps and bounds are needed , " said peter grant of tearfund , a christian relief and development agency . at their meeting in the german resort of heiligendamm last year , g8 leaders had agreed only to " consider seriously " the 2050 target . this time round , they said they " shared " the unfccc 's vision and that they would " consider and adopt " the targets . but critics were adamant that the g8 leaders had in fact failed by not specifying targets for 2020 , merely postponing the problem to future generations . " in the year 2050 , -lrb- canadian prime minister stephen -rrb- harper will be 91 , bush will be 104 and -lrb- japanese prime minister yasuo -rrb- fukuda will be 114 .
so we do n't necessarily believe their commitments , " said ben wikler of avaaz.org , an environmentalist group . fuel and food soaring oil and food prices were also high on the agenda on the second day of this summit in a luxury mountain-top hotel on the japanese island of hokkaido . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil prices are painful for europe , but hitting poor countries especially hard high prices for oil and food pose a " serious challenge to stable worldwide economic growth , " g8 leaders from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states warned on tuesday . in the face of skyrocketing prices , the g8 said it wanted to bring major oil producers and consumers together for a summit to discuss output and pricing .
oil prices have about doubled over the past year and last week hit a record high of $ 145.85 a barrel .
g8 leaders called for increased production and refinement to help slow the price rise . to cushion the blow , which is taking an especially heavy toll on poor countries , officials have said the g8 would unveil a series of measures to help africa , particularly its farmers , and would affirm its commitment to give $ 50 billion in extra aid money in 2010 , half of which would go to the world 's poorest continent . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the plans are unpopular among czechs and many others . us secretary of state condoleezza rice announced that the deal had been reached after meeting with her counterpart karel schwarzenberg in prague .
" we face with the iranians , and so do our allies and friends , a growing missile threat that is getting ever longer and ever deeper , and where the iranian appetite for nuclear technology ... is still unchecked , " rice told reporters in czech capital .
the radar system is part of a defensive shield intended to protect europe against missile attacks by so-called " rouge states " like iran .
washington hopes that the entire shield will be functional some time between 2011 and 2013 .
but rice said the next us president would have to decide whether and how to go ahead with the shield .
high speed collisions bildunterschrift : this is how the system would work in the proposed system , radar stations in the czech republic would be responsible for locating enemy missiles detected by us satellites .
that data would then be relayed to interceptor missiles or " kill vehicles " stations in neighboring poland .
the inceptors would then be sent speeding off to collide with and destroy the hostile missiles .
but questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the proposed system - in particular whether it would be capable of distinguishing between missile with live warheads and decoys .
and while tuesday 's deal could prove an important step in realizing washington 's ambitious plans , shield proponents will still have to overcome a lot of popular and political resistance rto what many fear could be the start a new cold war .
feuds galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most czechs would rather not have the shield rice 's visit to prague was accompanied by protests , with demonstrators unfurling banners reading " do n't make a target of us . "
" we believe that this could start another arms race , and we believe this will not raise the security of the czech republic , " protestor frantisek smrcka told the dpe news agency .
an opinion poll in june suggested that 68 percent of czechs were against becoming involved in the shield system .
and the current czech government has only a razor-thin majority in the parliament and could face difficulties getting the deal approved .
meanwhile , despite 14 months of negotiations , the us has yet to reach an agreement with poland , where the interceptor missiles would be stationed .
poland is insisting on billions of dollars in us aid to modernize its armed forces in return for hosting the facilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is n't happy about the prospect of these on its doorstep and russia has repeatedly expressed its opposition to having a strong us military presence in its former back yard , threatening to retarget nuclear missiles at europe if the shield is put into place .
washington has been at pains to assure the kremlin that the shield is not directed against russia .
" we want the system to be transparent to the russians , " rice told reporters on tuesday .
but the system , assuming it ever gets built , could ultimately ratchet up tensions instead of making europeans feel more secure . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de g8 summit -pipe- 08.07.2008 environmentalists slam g8 's emissions deal as meaningless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green pressure groups say the agreement is just another postponement of action as g8 leaders trumpeted their landmark deal to cut global emissions by 50 per cent by 2050 , the ' 50/50 ' agreement , which has yet to be sealed , was quickly lambasted by environmentalists as virtually meaningless . meeting for the second day at a luxury mountain resort overlooking lake toyako , in the northern island of hokkaido , the heads of state and government of the world 's seven richest countries plus russia turned their minds to the global economic slowdown , spiraling food and oil prices and the need to boost aid to africa .
but they were also under intense pressure to make real progress on the climate change front .
having failed to agree on medium-term cuts to greenhouse gas emissions , they issued a statement saying they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least -lrb- a -rrb- 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050 . "
jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission , said he was " very happy about the results of the g8 on climate change . "
german chancellor angela merkel said they had made " clear progress . "
" this is a significant step forward from heiligendamm , " merkel told reporters , referring to last year 's g8 meeting which she hosted in the northern german spa town .
" this means that the international community will no longer get off the hook , " she said .
however , south africa 's environment minister marthinus van schalkwyk said the g8 had made no progress at all in stabilising the planet .
" as it is expressed in the g8 statement , the long-term goal is an empty slogan without substance , " he said .
the g8 deal was full of ambiguity .
senior japanese official koji tsuruoka said the long-term goal should be seen as a " political vision " without a clear base year and that it is not legally binding .
but pressure groups and scientists said the leaders were merely burying their heads in the sand .
opponents scathing of g8 's empty words james hansen , one of the world 's most respected climate scientists , slammed the summit 's outcome as " worse than worthless . "
the leaders " are taking actions that guarantee that we deliver to our children climate catastrophes that are out of our control , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the g8 debates , the ice caps continue to melt " while the arctic is melting , the g8 are postponing action .
instead of climate protection , the world got nothing but flowery words , " said greenpeace 's daniel mittler .
" if this is a step forward , we will never prevent climate chaos in time . "
" the texas oilman has once again prevented the g8 from undergoing the energy revolution it needs , " mittler said .
" bush is a lame duck , so who cares what he thinks about 2050 ? "
oxfam international said that the g8 's ' 50 by 50 ' climate goal left the world with a " 50/50 chance of a climate meltdown . "
the charity called tuesday 's announcement " another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now . "
base measurement year missing from agreement critics pointed out that not only does the deal still need to be endorsed by the rest of the world , possibly at a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- meeting in copenhagen next year ; it also does n't contain a base year on which to measure the cuts .
this is because no agreement was reached among the g8 leaders .
while the eu had suggested using 1990 as a base , canada called for a much more recent date , while host japan made no suggestions at all .
moreover , russia said it would sign up to the deal , but only if it was not legally binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush would be 104 by the time the deal reaches fruition " it 's unprecedented and it is quite unrealistic that one government should take responsibility for something 42 years ahead , " said alexander pankin , a russian foreign ministry official .
as ben wikler of avaaz.org , a pressure group , noted , by the time 2050 comes us president george w bush will be 104 and japan 's premier , yasuo fukuda , will be 114 .
unfccc chief criticizes 50-50 deal un climate change chief yvo de boer joined the debate , saying that the g8 summit goal of halving global warming emissions by 2050 was too distant and too vague .
de boer , in an interview with afp news agency , said the summit statement had " some positive elements , " as it acknowledged rich and poor countries had different responsibilities for emissions and priority had to be given to eradicating poverty .
but how rich countries intend to cut their own emissions in the next dozen years - a period deemed critical by scientists - is " completely missing , " he complained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer pointed out many holes in the g8 's agreement " if it 's not clear that rich nations are going to lead , then why should poor nations follow ? " said de boer , the executive secretary of the unfccc .
de boer spelt out what he saw as several deficiencies in the toyako statement .
" the problem is that a -rrb- 2050 is very far away ; b -rrb- it 's not clear what is going to serve as the baseline for this 50-percent reduction ; c -rrb- it 's not clear how this reduction is going to be divided up between rich nations and poor nations ; and d -rrb- it 's not clear how the rich nation portion of that minus 50 is going to be divided amongst individual countries , " he said .
de boer also questioned whether the statement amounted to a major step forward in diplomatic language compared to the 2007 g8 summit in heiligendamm .
" last year they were talking about eight countries seriously considering and adopting a 50-percent reduction goal , " he said .
" now they are suggesting that 180 countries seriously consider adopting a 50-percent reduction goal . "

1 , 2008 for anyone wanting german nationality , reflect cultural biases . turkish community chairman kenan kolat said the 310 multiple-choice questions published by the interior ministry tested not only knowledge of germany but " to some extent also attitudes . "
the test is additional to existing naturalization requirements .
one question asks what allows people in germany to speak out openly against the government .
the possible answers are : freedom of religion , taxation , right to vote , freedom of opinion .
another question references germany 's christian heritage by asking what the last four weeks before christmas are called .
the following choices are given : all souls ' day , harvest festival , advent , all saints ' day .
citizenship courses make much more sense than a test , kolat said in an interview with the cologne-based daily koelner stadt-anzeiger .
multiple-choice exam thirty-three questions will be chosen at random from a longer list which will be made public beforehand .
more than half of the questions will need to be answered correctly .
integration courses to prepare for the test will remain optional .
kolat said he favored citizenship courses instead of a test .
candidates could be asked to list the colors of the german flag and how they are displayed .
they will need to know cultural reference points such as who composed the " ode to joy . "
and they will be required to beef up on trivia such as the names of germany 's mountain ranges .
not all questions easy kolat suggested putting the questions to germans at information stands in berlin .
" it would be interesting to see how that goes off , " he said .
the academics from berlin 's humboldt university who compiled the questions tested them in schools , taking as their guinea pigs pupils of both german and immigrant origin . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is a significant step forward from heiligendamm , " merkel told reporters , referring to last year 's g8 meeting which she hosted in the northern german spa town .
" this means that the international community will no longer get off the hook , " she said .
however , south africa 's environment minister marthinus van schalkwyk said the g8 had made no progress at all in stabilising the planet .
" as it is expressed in the g8 statement , the long-term goal is an empty slogan without substance , " he said .
the g8 deal was full of ambiguity .
senior japanese official koji tsuruoka said the long-term goal should be seen as a " political vision " without a clear base year and that it is not legally binding .
but pressure groups and scientists said the leaders were merely burying their heads in the sand .
opponents scathing of g8 's empty words james hansen , one of the world 's most respected climate scientists , slammed the summit 's outcome as " worse than worthless . "
the leaders " are taking actions that guarantee that we deliver to our children climate catastrophes that are out of our control , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the g8 debates , the ice caps continue to melt " while the arctic is melting , the g8 are postponing action .
instead of climate protection , the world got nothing but flowery words , " said greenpeace 's daniel mittler .
" if this is a step forward , we will never prevent climate chaos in time . "
" the texas oilman has once again prevented the g8 from undergoing the energy revolution it needs , " mittler said .
" bush is a lame duck , so who cares what he thinks about 2050 ? "
oxfam international said that the g8 's ' 50 by 50 ' climate goal left the world with a " 50/50 chance of a climate meltdown . "
the charity called tuesday 's announcement " another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now . "
base measurement year missing from agreement critics pointed out that not only does the deal still need to be endorsed by the rest of the world , possibly at a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- meeting in copenhagen next year ; it also does n't contain a base year on which to measure the cuts .
this is because no agreement was reached among the g8 leaders .
while the eu had suggested using 1990 as a base , canada called for a much more recent date , while host japan made no suggestions at all .
moreover , russia said it would sign up to the deal , but only if it was not legally binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush would be 104 by the time the deal reaches fruition " it 's unprecedented and it is quite unrealistic that one government should take responsibility for something 42 years ahead , " said alexander pankin , a russian foreign ministry official .
as ben wikler of avaaz.org , a pressure group , noted , by the time 2050 comes us president george w bush will be 104 and japan 's premier , yasuo fukuda , will be 114 .
unfccc chief criticizes 50-50 deal un climate change chief yvo de boer joined the debate , saying that the g8 summit goal of halving global warming emissions by 2050 was too distant and too vague .
de boer , in an interview with afp news agency , said the summit statement had " some positive elements , " as it acknowledged rich and poor countries had different responsibilities for emissions and priority had to be given to eradicating poverty .
but how rich countries intend to cut their own emissions in the next dozen years - a period deemed critical by scientists - is " completely missing , " he complained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer pointed out many holes in the g8 's agreement " if it 's not clear that rich nations are going to lead , then why should poor nations follow ? " said de boer , the executive secretary of the unfccc .
de boer spelt out what he saw as several deficiencies in the toyako statement .
" the problem is that a -rrb- 2050 is very far away ; b -rrb- it 's not clear what is going to serve as the baseline for this 50-percent reduction ; c -rrb- it 's not clear how this reduction is going to be divided up between rich nations and poor nations ; and d -rrb- it 's not clear how the rich nation portion of that minus 50 is going to be divided amongst individual countries , " he said .
de boer also questioned whether the statement amounted to a major step forward in diplomatic language compared to the 2007 g8 summit in heiligendamm .
" last year they were talking about eight countries seriously considering and adopting a 50-percent reduction goal , " he said .
" now they are suggesting that 180 countries seriously consider adopting a 50-percent reduction goal . "
energy , food and oil crises , africa also on agenda before issuing the climate statement , the g8 leaders had previously turned their attention to the economy , warning that spiraling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth .
" we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement .
the leaders further stressed that the surge in food prices had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . "
on oil , they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
other proposed solutions included boosting short-term production and refining capacities and greater market transparency to avoid speculation .
on the demand side , countries should reduce their dependence on hydrocarbons and improve energy efficiency , they said .

a promise to stick to their pledge to raise by 25 billion dollars the level of annual aid they give to africa by 2010 , meanwhile , was slammed by non-governmental organizations as too little too late .

but they were also under intense pressure to make real progress on the climate change front .
having failed to agree on medium-term cuts to greenhouse gas emissions , they issued a statement saying they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least -lrb- a -rrb- 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050 . "

" full-fledged eu membership is the core interest of the republic of serbia and its citizens , " he told the parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian and eu officials signing an accord earlier this year " therefore , one of the first moves of the new government will be to submit the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- to the national parliament for ratification , " he said . on the eve of the may 11 polls the eu signed the saa with serbia , providing a boost to the pro-european bloc .
but both sides have yet to ratify the accord , which is considered the first step towards full membership in the 27-member bloc . " the government 's main objective is for serbia to gain eu candidate country status by the end of this year or by the beginning of next year , through the acceleration of economic and other reforms envisaged by the saa . " brussels has already said it would support serbia 's new government . however , before progress can continue towards eu membership , belgrade must arrest war-crime suspects still on the loose - something the socialist party -lrb- sps -rrb- has vowed to block . kosovo sticking point serbia has downgraded diplomatic relations with all the nations - more than 40 , including leading western powers - that have recognized kosovo since it declared independence in february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's president boris tadic virtually all major serbian leaders said they would never recognize kosovo , viewed by serbs as their heartland . economically , cvetkovic has to deal with stalled reforms , bloated spending , an overrated national currency and rising prices , all complicated by endemic corruption . cvetkovic singled out the fight against corruption as one of his priorities , like most of his predecessors .
neither the socialist party heads of government from 1990-2000 nor those from the democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- from 2000-2004 have a good track record on this issue . difficult tasks ahead cvetkovic now plans to lead a cabinet of 27 members , the largest since slobodan milosevic 's last government , ruling until 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians celebrated with the new kosovo flag in february the ruling coalition was forged between pro-european president boris tadic 's democratic party and milosevic 's socialist party , along with several ethnic minority representatives . the democrats had been fierce opponents of the socialist party since 1990 , when it slobodan milosevic led it and the country into war and international isolation . politically and diplomatically , the new authorities face the difficult task of reconciling the aspiration of the majority in serbia for the country 's membership of the european union with the hurt over kosovo 's secession , which followed a nod from the west . the opposition has accused the coalition of lacking a clear game plan .
critics have said the reason for this is that the real goal of the unlikely bedfellows - the democrats and the socialists - is to keep the ultra-nationalists lurking in opposition . if that is the case , the new government might make gestures that would prolong its stay in power , while avoiding hard decisions that would reap long-term benefits , such as cutting national spending or capturing the war criminals still at large . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" full-fledged eu membership is the core interest of the republic of serbia and its citizens , " he told the parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian and eu officials signing an accord earlier this year " therefore , one of the first moves of the new government will be to submit the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- to the national parliament for ratification , " he said . on the eve of the may 11 polls the eu signed the saa with serbia , providing a boost to the pro-european bloc .
but both sides have yet to ratify the accord , which is considered the first step towards full membership in the 27-member bloc . " the government 's main objective is for serbia to gain eu candidate country status by the end of this year or by the beginning of next year , through the acceleration of economic and other reforms envisaged by the saa . " brussels has already said it would support serbia 's new government . however , before progress can continue towards eu membership , belgrade must arrest war-crime suspects still on the loose - something the socialist party -lrb- sps -rrb- has vowed to block . kosovo sticking point serbia has downgraded diplomatic relations with all the nations - more than 40 , including leading western powers - that have recognized kosovo since it declared independence in february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's president boris tadic virtually all major serbian leaders said they would never recognize kosovo , viewed by serbs as their heartland . economically , cvetkovic has to deal with stalled reforms , bloated spending , an overrated national currency and rising prices , all complicated by endemic corruption . cvetkovic singled out the fight against corruption as one of his priorities , like most of his predecessors .
neither the socialist party heads of government from 1990-2000 nor those from the democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- from 2000-2004 have a good track record on this issue . difficult tasks ahead cvetkovic now plans to lead a cabinet of 27 members , the largest since slobodan milosevic 's last government , ruling until 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians celebrated with the new kosovo flag in february the ruling coalition was forged between pro-european president boris tadic 's democratic party and milosevic 's socialist party , along with several ethnic minority representatives . the democrats had been fierce opponents of the socialist party since 1990 , when it slobodan milosevic led it and the country into war and international isolation . politically and diplomatically , the new authorities face the difficult task of reconciling the aspiration of the majority in serbia for the country 's membership of the european union with the hurt over kosovo 's secession , which followed a nod from the west . the opposition has accused the coalition of lacking a clear game plan .
critics have said the reason for this is that the real goal of the unlikely bedfellows - the democrats and the socialists - is to keep the ultra-nationalists lurking in opposition . if that is the case , the new government might make gestures that would prolong its stay in power , while avoiding hard decisions that would reap long-term benefits , such as cutting national spending or capturing the war criminals still at large . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now eu ministers are calling on tougher rules , which discourage illegal immigrants while still encouraging skilled foreign labor . european union justice ministers have announced that europe should take complete control of migration into and out of the continent , working with the rest of the world to end illegal migration and manage legal flows .
the news comes as eu ministers meet with their counterparts in the southern french beach resort of cannes . the informal meeting , a regular feature of eu politics , is aimed at getting ministers to agree on the broad outline of policies , so that they will find it easier to agree on the technical details at future , formal meetings . monday 's talks were set to be dominated by a proposal from the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , to create a " pact on immigration and asylum " between the eu 's 27 member states . the pact , which would not be legally binding but would carry political weight , asks eu member states to strengthen the fight against illegal immigration , to crack down on the employers of illegal migrants and to live up to their responsibility to expel illegal residents from their territory . at the same time , the pact urges eu members to put in place targeted immigration policies which would attract highly-qualified foreigners , in particular , to europe .
and it calls on the eu to work closely with countries of origin and transit , supporting development on their territories and making it easier for immigrants to send money home as a way of making it more attractive for potential migrants to stay at home . language toned down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people enter the eu illegally every year however , a draft of the pact agreed immediately before the meeting tones down considerably the strong language used in the initial text .
where the first draft listed strengthened border control as its top priority , that was relegated to number three in later versions , being supplanted by the question of boosting legal migration . the first draft also prioritized " organizing the effective removal of irregular residents from the eu " - an emphasis which chimes in with the policy of france 's president nicolas sarkozy , who has set annual quotas for expelling illegal immigrants . but the later text used a much softer tone , calling for a general " fight against illegal immigration , especially assuring the return of foreigners who are in an irregular situation to their country of origin or a transit country . " the first draft of the pact also stated categorically that " massive and collective legalizations produce a major pull effect " and that member states " agree to give them up . "

the news comes as eu ministers meet with their counterparts in the southern french beach resort of cannes . the informal meeting , a regular feature of eu politics , is aimed at getting ministers to agree on the broad outline of policies , so that they will find it easier to agree on the technical details at future , formal meetings . monday 's talks were set to be dominated by a proposal from the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , to create a " pact on immigration and asylum " between the eu 's 27 member states . the pact , which would not be legally binding but would carry political weight , asks eu member states to strengthen the fight against illegal immigration , to crack down on the employers of illegal migrants and to live up to their responsibility to expel illegal residents from their territory . at the same time , the pact urges eu members to put in place targeted immigration policies which would attract highly-qualified foreigners , in particular , to europe .
and it calls on the eu to work closely with countries of origin and transit , supporting development on their territories and making it easier for immigrants to send money home as a way of making it more attractive for potential migrants to stay at home . language toned down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people enter the eu illegally every year however , a draft of the pact agreed immediately before the meeting tones down considerably the strong language used in the initial text .
where the first draft listed strengthened border control as its top priority , that was relegated to number three in later versions , being supplanted by the question of boosting legal migration . the first draft also prioritized " organizing the effective removal of irregular residents from the eu " - an emphasis which chimes in with the policy of france 's president nicolas sarkozy , who has set annual quotas for expelling illegal immigrants . but the later text used a much softer tone , calling for a general " fight against illegal immigration , especially assuring the return of foreigners who are in an irregular situation to their country of origin or a transit country . " the first draft of the pact also stated categorically that " massive and collective legalizations produce a major pull effect " and that member states " agree to give them up . "
but the latest draft simply calls on member states to limit their legalizations to a case-by-case system in the future . french experts critical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been heavily criticized for his stance while that compromise paves the way for broad eu acceptance of the text at a summit in october , the news on the domestic front was less promising for the french government in its immigration plans . as the meeting opened , the french press reported that a commission of french experts formed by sarkozy to discuss his migration policies had roundly criticized key points . binding immigration quotas would be " unrealistic and pointless , " and the national authorities have " no discretionary power to determine the flow " of migrants into france , especially on family grounds , left-wing daily la liberation quoted the report . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de g8 summit -pipe- 08.07.2008 environmentalists slam g8 's emissions deal as meaningless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green pressure groups say the agreement is just another postponement of action as g8 leaders trumpeted their landmark deal to cut global emissions by 50 per cent by 2050 , the ' 50/50 ' agreement , which has yet to be sealed , was quickly lambasted by environmentalists as virtually meaningless . meeting for the second day at a luxury mountain resort overlooking lake toyako , in the northern island of hokkaido , the heads of state and government of the world 's seven richest countries plus russia turned their minds to the global economic slowdown , spiraling food and oil prices and the need to boost aid to africa .
but they were also under intense pressure to make real progress on the climate change front .
having failed to agree on medium-term cuts to greenhouse gas emissions , they issued a statement saying they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least -lrb- a -rrb- 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050 . "
jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission , said he was " very happy about the results of the g8 on climate change . "
german chancellor angela merkel said they had made " clear progress . "
" this is a significant step forward from heiligendamm , " merkel told reporters , referring to last year 's g8 meeting which she hosted in the northern german spa town .
" this means that the international community will no longer get off the hook , " she said .
however , south africa 's environment minister marthinus van schalkwyk said the g8 had made no progress at all in stabilising the planet .
" as it is expressed in the g8 statement , the long-term goal is an empty slogan without substance , " he said .
the g8 deal was full of ambiguity .
senior japanese official koji tsuruoka said the long-term goal should be seen as a " political vision " without a clear base year and that it is not legally binding .
but pressure groups and scientists said the leaders were merely burying their heads in the sand .
opponents scathing of g8 's empty words james hansen , one of the world 's most respected climate scientists , slammed the summit 's outcome as " worse than worthless . "
the leaders " are taking actions that guarantee that we deliver to our children climate catastrophes that are out of our control , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the g8 debates , the ice caps continue to melt " while the arctic is melting , the g8 are postponing action .
instead of climate protection , the world got nothing but flowery words , " said greenpeace 's daniel mittler .
" if this is a step forward , we will never prevent climate chaos in time . "
" the texas oilman has once again prevented the g8 from undergoing the energy revolution it needs , " mittler said .
" bush is a lame duck , so who cares what he thinks about 2050 ? "
oxfam international said that the g8 's ' 50 by 50 ' climate goal left the world with a " 50/50 chance of a climate meltdown . "
the charity called tuesday 's announcement " another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now . "
base measurement year missing from agreement critics pointed out that not only does the deal still need to be endorsed by the rest of the world , possibly at a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- meeting in copenhagen next year ; it also does n't contain a base year on which to measure the cuts .
this is because no agreement was reached among the g8 leaders .
while the eu had suggested using 1990 as a base , canada called for a much more recent date , while host japan made no suggestions at all .
moreover , russia said it would sign up to the deal , but only if it was not legally binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush would be 104 by the time the deal reaches fruition " it 's unprecedented and it is quite unrealistic that one government should take responsibility for something 42 years ahead , " said alexander pankin , a russian foreign ministry official .
as ben wikler of avaaz.org , a pressure group , noted , by the time 2050 comes us president george w bush will be 104 and japan 's premier , yasuo fukuda , will be 114 .
unfccc chief criticizes 50-50 deal un climate change chief yvo de boer joined the debate , saying that the g8 summit goal of halving global warming emissions by 2050 was too distant and too vague .
de boer , in an interview with afp news agency , said the summit statement had " some positive elements , " as it acknowledged rich and poor countries had different responsibilities for emissions and priority had to be given to eradicating poverty .
but how rich countries intend to cut their own emissions in the next dozen years - a period deemed critical by scientists - is " completely missing , " he complained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer pointed out many holes in the g8 's agreement " if it 's not clear that rich nations are going to lead , then why should poor nations follow ? " said de boer , the executive secretary of the unfccc .
de boer spelt out what he saw as several deficiencies in the toyako statement .
" the problem is that a -rrb- 2050 is very far away ; b -rrb- it 's not clear what is going to serve as the baseline for this 50-percent reduction ; c -rrb- it 's not clear how this reduction is going to be divided up between rich nations and poor nations ; and d -rrb- it 's not clear how the rich nation portion of that minus 50 is going to be divided amongst individual countries , " he said .
de boer also questioned whether the statement amounted to a major step forward in diplomatic language compared to the 2007 g8 summit in heiligendamm .
" last year they were talking about eight countries seriously considering and adopting a 50-percent reduction goal , " he said .
" now they are suggesting that 180 countries seriously consider adopting a 50-percent reduction goal . "
energy , food and oil crises , africa also on agenda before issuing the climate statement , the g8 leaders had previously turned their attention to the economy , warning that spiraling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth .
" we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement .
the leaders further stressed that the surge in food prices had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . "
on oil , they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
other proposed solutions included boosting short-term production and refining capacities and greater market transparency to avoid speculation .
on the demand side , countries should reduce their dependence on hydrocarbons and improve energy efficiency , they said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis is likely to increase global poverty meanwhile , they warned that high food prices risked pushing millions more people back into poverty and called on other donors to increase their contributions to the un 's world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- .
a promise to stick to their pledge to raise by 25 billion dollars the level of annual aid they give to africa by 2010 , meanwhile , was slammed by non-governmental organizations as too little too late .
on the issue of zimbabwe , russia opposed new sanctions against the regime of president robert mugabe .
gaffs galore there were also a series of blunders and diplomatic incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarko is making a habit of rubbing people the wrong way french president nicolas sarkozy risked offending the hosting nation by refusing to hold a bilateral meeting with fukuda , while the us delegation was forced to apologize after distributing an unflattering biography of italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .

but the plans are unpopular among czechs and many others . us secretary of state condoleezza rice announced that the deal had been reached after meeting with her counterpart karel schwarzenberg in prague .
" we face with the iranians , and so do our allies and friends , a growing missile threat that is getting ever longer and ever deeper , and where the iranian appetite for nuclear technology ... is still unchecked , " rice told reporters in czech capital .
the radar system is part of a defensive shield intended to protect europe against missile attacks by so-called " rouge states " like iran .
washington hopes that the entire shield will be functional some time between 2011 and 2013 .
but rice said the next us president would have to decide whether and how to go ahead with the shield .
high speed collisions bildunterschrift : this is how the system would work in the proposed system , radar stations in the czech republic would be responsible for locating enemy missiles detected by us satellites .
that data would then be relayed to interceptor missiles or " kill vehicles " stations in neighboring poland .

but questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the proposed system - in particular whether it would be capable of distinguishing between missile with live warheads and decoys .
and while tuesday 's deal could prove an important step in realizing washington 's ambitious plans , shield proponents will still have to overcome a lot of popular and political resistance rto what many fear could be the start a new cold war .

" we believe that this could start another arms race , and we believe this will not raise the security of the czech republic , " protestor frantisek smrcka told the dpe news agency .
an opinion poll in june suggested that 68 percent of czechs were against becoming involved in the shield system .
and the current czech government has only a razor-thin majority in the parliament and could face difficulties getting the deal approved .
meanwhile , despite 14 months of negotiations , the us has yet to reach an agreement with poland , where the interceptor missiles would be stationed .
poland is insisting on billions of dollars in us aid to modernize its armed forces in return for hosting the facilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is n't happy about the prospect of these on its doorstep and russia has repeatedly expressed its opposition to having a strong us military presence in its former back yard , threatening to retarget nuclear missiles at europe if the shield is put into place .
washington has been at pains to assure the kremlin that the shield is not directed against russia .
" we want the system to be transparent to the russians , " rice told reporters on tuesday .

however , environmentalists said the agreement did n't go far enough . the groundbreaking deal , brokered by g8 hosts japan and propelled by the european union , overcame the resistance of us president george w. bush , who had refused to ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change and who continues to block plans for medium-term cuts . the binding measures should be brought into the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , which will culminate in a meeting in copenhagen at the end of 2009 . in a statement , g8 leaders said they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least a 50 percent reduction of global emissions by 2050 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 leaders are on the japanese island of hokkaido the leaders further said that such a challenge would require " a global response " and the contributions from " all major economies , consistent with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities . " g8 leaders said they wanted to work with the nearly 200 nations involved in un climate change talks to meet the 2050 goal . the g8 communique said mid-term goals would be needed to achieve that goal , but did not give any numerical targets .
brussels , however , has called for clear interim targets . the agreement was hailed by jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission . " this is a strong signal to citizens around the world , " he said .
" we have agreed a long-term goal of at least 50 percent reduction of emissions by 2050 , and we have agreed that we should also set up mid-term targets . " now we need to go the extra mile to secure an ambitious global deal in copenhagen , " he said . environmentalists critical environmental groups were less pleased .
one pressure group said the g8 leaders had done little more than restate last year 's g8 commitment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say the g8 is n't taking a strong enough stance on the environment " the g8 are crawling forward on emissions cuts at a time when giant leaps and bounds are needed , " said peter grant of tearfund , a christian relief and development agency . at their meeting in the german resort of heiligendamm last year , g8 leaders had agreed only to " consider seriously " the 2050 target . this time round , they said they " shared " the unfccc 's vision and that they would " consider and adopt " the targets . but critics were adamant that the g8 leaders had in fact failed by not specifying targets for 2020 , merely postponing the problem to future generations . " in the year 2050 , -lrb- canadian prime minister stephen -rrb- harper will be 91 , bush will be 104 and -lrb- japanese prime minister yasuo -rrb- fukuda will be 114 .
so we do n't necessarily believe their commitments , " said ben wikler of avaaz.org , an environmentalist group . fuel and food soaring oil and food prices were also high on the agenda on the second day of this summit in a luxury mountain-top hotel on the japanese island of hokkaido . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil prices are painful for europe , but hitting poor countries especially hard high prices for oil and food pose a " serious challenge to stable worldwide economic growth , " g8 leaders from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states warned on tuesday . in the face of skyrocketing prices , the g8 said it wanted to bring major oil producers and consumers together for a summit to discuss output and pricing .
oil prices have about doubled over the past year and last week hit a record high of $ 145.85 a barrel .
g8 leaders called for increased production and refinement to help slow the price rise . to cushion the blow , which is taking an especially heavy toll on poor countries , officials have said the g8 would unveil a series of measures to help africa , particularly its farmers , and would affirm its commitment to give $ 50 billion in extra aid money in 2010 , half of which would go to the world 's poorest continent . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de g8 summit -pipe- 08.07.2008 environmentalists slam g8 's emissions deal as meaningless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green pressure groups say the agreement is just another postponement of action as g8 leaders trumpeted their landmark deal to cut global emissions by 50 per cent by 2050 , the ' 50/50 ' agreement , which has yet to be sealed , was quickly lambasted by environmentalists as virtually meaningless . meeting for the second day at a luxury mountain resort overlooking lake toyako , in the northern island of hokkaido , the heads of state and government of the world 's seven richest countries plus russia turned their minds to the global economic slowdown , spiraling food and oil prices and the need to boost aid to africa .
but they were also under intense pressure to make real progress on the climate change front .
having failed to agree on medium-term cuts to greenhouse gas emissions , they issued a statement saying they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least -lrb- a -rrb- 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050 . "
jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission , said he was " very happy about the results of the g8 on climate change . "
german chancellor angela merkel said they had made " clear progress . "
" this is a significant step forward from heiligendamm , " merkel told reporters , referring to last year 's g8 meeting which she hosted in the northern german spa town .
" this means that the international community will no longer get off the hook , " she said .
however , south africa 's environment minister marthinus van schalkwyk said the g8 had made no progress at all in stabilising the planet .
" as it is expressed in the g8 statement , the long-term goal is an empty slogan without substance , " he said .
the g8 deal was full of ambiguity .
senior japanese official koji tsuruoka said the long-term goal should be seen as a " political vision " without a clear base year and that it is not legally binding .
but pressure groups and scientists said the leaders were merely burying their heads in the sand .
opponents scathing of g8 's empty words james hansen , one of the world 's most respected climate scientists , slammed the summit 's outcome as " worse than worthless . "
the leaders " are taking actions that guarantee that we deliver to our children climate catastrophes that are out of our control , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the g8 debates , the ice caps continue to melt " while the arctic is melting , the g8 are postponing action .
instead of climate protection , the world got nothing but flowery words , " said greenpeace 's daniel mittler .
" if this is a step forward , we will never prevent climate chaos in time . "
" the texas oilman has once again prevented the g8 from undergoing the energy revolution it needs , " mittler said .
" bush is a lame duck , so who cares what he thinks about 2050 ? "
oxfam international said that the g8 's ' 50 by 50 ' climate goal left the world with a " 50/50 chance of a climate meltdown . "
the charity called tuesday 's announcement " another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now . "
base measurement year missing from agreement critics pointed out that not only does the deal still need to be endorsed by the rest of the world , possibly at a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- meeting in copenhagen next year ; it also does n't contain a base year on which to measure the cuts .
this is because no agreement was reached among the g8 leaders .
while the eu had suggested using 1990 as a base , canada called for a much more recent date , while host japan made no suggestions at all .
moreover , russia said it would sign up to the deal , but only if it was not legally binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush would be 104 by the time the deal reaches fruition " it 's unprecedented and it is quite unrealistic that one government should take responsibility for something 42 years ahead , " said alexander pankin , a russian foreign ministry official .
as ben wikler of avaaz.org , a pressure group , noted , by the time 2050 comes us president george w bush will be 104 and japan 's premier , yasuo fukuda , will be 114 .
unfccc chief criticizes 50-50 deal un climate change chief yvo de boer joined the debate , saying that the g8 summit goal of halving global warming emissions by 2050 was too distant and too vague .
de boer , in an interview with afp news agency , said the summit statement had " some positive elements , " as it acknowledged rich and poor countries had different responsibilities for emissions and priority had to be given to eradicating poverty .
but how rich countries intend to cut their own emissions in the next dozen years - a period deemed critical by scientists - is " completely missing , " he complained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer pointed out many holes in the g8 's agreement " if it 's not clear that rich nations are going to lead , then why should poor nations follow ? " said de boer , the executive secretary of the unfccc .
de boer spelt out what he saw as several deficiencies in the toyako statement .
" the problem is that a -rrb- 2050 is very far away ; b -rrb- it 's not clear what is going to serve as the baseline for this 50-percent reduction ; c -rrb- it 's not clear how this reduction is going to be divided up between rich nations and poor nations ; and d -rrb- it 's not clear how the rich nation portion of that minus 50 is going to be divided amongst individual countries , " he said .
de boer also questioned whether the statement amounted to a major step forward in diplomatic language compared to the 2007 g8 summit in heiligendamm .
" last year they were talking about eight countries seriously considering and adopting a 50-percent reduction goal , " he said .
" now they are suggesting that 180 countries seriously consider adopting a 50-percent reduction goal . "
energy , food and oil crises , africa also on agenda before issuing the climate statement , the g8 leaders had previously turned their attention to the economy , warning that spiraling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth .
" we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement .
the leaders further stressed that the surge in food prices had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . "
on oil , they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
other proposed solutions included boosting short-term production and refining capacities and greater market transparency to avoid speculation .
on the demand side , countries should reduce their dependence on hydrocarbons and improve energy efficiency , they said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis is likely to increase global poverty meanwhile , they warned that high food prices risked pushing millions more people back into poverty and called on other donors to increase their contributions to the un 's world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- .
a promise to stick to their pledge to raise by 25 billion dollars the level of annual aid they give to africa by 2010 , meanwhile , was slammed by non-governmental organizations as too little too late .
on the issue of zimbabwe , russia opposed new sanctions against the regime of president robert mugabe .
gaffs galore there were also a series of blunders and diplomatic incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarko is making a habit of rubbing people the wrong way french president nicolas sarkozy risked offending the hosting nation by refusing to hold a bilateral meeting with fukuda , while the us delegation was forced to apologize after distributing an unflattering biography of italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de g8 summit -pipe- 08.07.2008 environmentalists slam g8 's emissions deal as meaningless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green pressure groups say the agreement is just another postponement of action as g8 leaders trumpeted their landmark deal to cut global emissions by 50 per cent by 2050 , the ' 50/50 ' agreement , which has yet to be sealed , was quickly lambasted by environmentalists as virtually meaningless . meeting for the second day at a luxury mountain resort overlooking lake toyako , in the northern island of hokkaido , the heads of state and government of the world 's seven richest countries plus russia turned their minds to the global economic slowdown , spiraling food and oil prices and the need to boost aid to africa .
but they were also under intense pressure to make real progress on the climate change front .
having failed to agree on medium-term cuts to greenhouse gas emissions , they issued a statement saying they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least -lrb- a -rrb- 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050 . "
jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission , said he was " very happy about the results of the g8 on climate change . "
german chancellor angela merkel said they had made " clear progress . "
" this is a significant step forward from heiligendamm , " merkel told reporters , referring to last year 's g8 meeting which she hosted in the northern german spa town .
" this means that the international community will no longer get off the hook , " she said .
however , south africa 's environment minister marthinus van schalkwyk said the g8 had made no progress at all in stabilising the planet .
" as it is expressed in the g8 statement , the long-term goal is an empty slogan without substance , " he said .
the g8 deal was full of ambiguity .
senior japanese official koji tsuruoka said the long-term goal should be seen as a " political vision " without a clear base year and that it is not legally binding .
but pressure groups and scientists said the leaders were merely burying their heads in the sand .
opponents scathing of g8 's empty words james hansen , one of the world 's most respected climate scientists , slammed the summit 's outcome as " worse than worthless . "
the leaders " are taking actions that guarantee that we deliver to our children climate catastrophes that are out of our control , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the g8 debates , the ice caps continue to melt " while the arctic is melting , the g8 are postponing action .
instead of climate protection , the world got nothing but flowery words , " said greenpeace 's daniel mittler .
" if this is a step forward , we will never prevent climate chaos in time . "
" the texas oilman has once again prevented the g8 from undergoing the energy revolution it needs , " mittler said .
" bush is a lame duck , so who cares what he thinks about 2050 ? "
oxfam international said that the g8 's ' 50 by 50 ' climate goal left the world with a " 50/50 chance of a climate meltdown . "
the charity called tuesday 's announcement " another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now . "
base measurement year missing from agreement critics pointed out that not only does the deal still need to be endorsed by the rest of the world , possibly at a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- meeting in copenhagen next year ; it also does n't contain a base year on which to measure the cuts .
this is because no agreement was reached among the g8 leaders .
while the eu had suggested using 1990 as a base , canada called for a much more recent date , while host japan made no suggestions at all .
moreover , russia said it would sign up to the deal , but only if it was not legally binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush would be 104 by the time the deal reaches fruition " it 's unprecedented and it is quite unrealistic that one government should take responsibility for something 42 years ahead , " said alexander pankin , a russian foreign ministry official .
as ben wikler of avaaz.org , a pressure group , noted , by the time 2050 comes us president george w bush will be 104 and japan 's premier , yasuo fukuda , will be 114 .
unfccc chief criticizes 50-50 deal un climate change chief yvo de boer joined the debate , saying that the g8 summit goal of halving global warming emissions by 2050 was too distant and too vague .
de boer , in an interview with afp news agency , said the summit statement had " some positive elements , " as it acknowledged rich and poor countries had different responsibilities for emissions and priority had to be given to eradicating poverty .
but how rich countries intend to cut their own emissions in the next dozen years - a period deemed critical by scientists - is " completely missing , " he complained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer pointed out many holes in the g8 's agreement " if it 's not clear that rich nations are going to lead , then why should poor nations follow ? " said de boer , the executive secretary of the unfccc .
de boer spelt out what he saw as several deficiencies in the toyako statement .
" the problem is that a -rrb- 2050 is very far away ; b -rrb- it 's not clear what is going to serve as the baseline for this 50-percent reduction ; c -rrb- it 's not clear how this reduction is going to be divided up between rich nations and poor nations ; and d -rrb- it 's not clear how the rich nation portion of that minus 50 is going to be divided amongst individual countries , " he said .
de boer also questioned whether the statement amounted to a major step forward in diplomatic language compared to the 2007 g8 summit in heiligendamm .
" last year they were talking about eight countries seriously considering and adopting a 50-percent reduction goal , " he said .
" now they are suggesting that 180 countries seriously consider adopting a 50-percent reduction goal . "
energy , food and oil crises , africa also on agenda before issuing the climate statement , the g8 leaders had previously turned their attention to the economy , warning that spiraling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth .
" we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement .
the leaders further stressed that the surge in food prices had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . "
on oil , they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
other proposed solutions included boosting short-term production and refining capacities and greater market transparency to avoid speculation .
on the demand side , countries should reduce their dependence on hydrocarbons and improve energy efficiency , they said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis is likely to increase global poverty meanwhile , they warned that high food prices risked pushing millions more people back into poverty and called on other donors to increase their contributions to the un 's world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- .
a promise to stick to their pledge to raise by 25 billion dollars the level of annual aid they give to africa by 2010 , meanwhile , was slammed by non-governmental organizations as too little too late .
on the issue of zimbabwe , russia opposed new sanctions against the regime of president robert mugabe .
gaffs galore there were also a series of blunders and diplomatic incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarko is making a habit of rubbing people the wrong way french president nicolas sarkozy risked offending the hosting nation by refusing to hold a bilateral meeting with fukuda , while the us delegation was forced to apologize after distributing an unflattering biography of italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .

but the plans are unpopular among czechs and many others . us secretary of state condoleezza rice announced that the deal had been reached after meeting with her counterpart karel schwarzenberg in prague .
" we face with the iranians , and so do our allies and friends , a growing missile threat that is getting ever longer and ever deeper , and where the iranian appetite for nuclear technology ... is still unchecked , " rice told reporters in czech capital .
the radar system is part of a defensive shield intended to protect europe against missile attacks by so-called " rouge states " like iran .
washington hopes that the entire shield will be functional some time between 2011 and 2013 .
but rice said the next us president would have to decide whether and how to go ahead with the shield .
high speed collisions bildunterschrift : this is how the system would work in the proposed system , radar stations in the czech republic would be responsible for locating enemy missiles detected by us satellites .
that data would then be relayed to interceptor missiles or " kill vehicles " stations in neighboring poland .
the inceptors would then be sent speeding off to collide with and destroy the hostile missiles .
but questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the proposed system - in particular whether it would be capable of distinguishing between missile with live warheads and decoys .
and while tuesday 's deal could prove an important step in realizing washington 's ambitious plans , shield proponents will still have to overcome a lot of popular and political resistance rto what many fear could be the start a new cold war .
feuds galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most czechs would rather not have the shield rice 's visit to prague was accompanied by protests , with demonstrators unfurling banners reading " do n't make a target of us . "
" we believe that this could start another arms race , and we believe this will not raise the security of the czech republic , " protestor frantisek smrcka told the dpe news agency .
an opinion poll in june suggested that 68 percent of czechs were against becoming involved in the shield system .
and the current czech government has only a razor-thin majority in the parliament and could face difficulties getting the deal approved .
meanwhile , despite 14 months of negotiations , the us has yet to reach an agreement with poland , where the interceptor missiles would be stationed .
poland is insisting on billions of dollars in us aid to modernize its armed forces in return for hosting the facilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is n't happy about the prospect of these on its doorstep and russia has repeatedly expressed its opposition to having a strong us military presence in its former back yard , threatening to retarget nuclear missiles at europe if the shield is put into place .
washington has been at pains to assure the kremlin that the shield is not directed against russia .
" we want the system to be transparent to the russians , " rice told reporters on tuesday .
but the system , assuming it ever gets built , could ultimately ratchet up tensions instead of making europeans feel more secure . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de us missile shield plan continues to rankle poland has sent its foreign minister to the united states in hopes of salvaging a missile defense deal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de g8 summit -pipe- 08.07.2008 environmentalists slam g8 's emissions deal as meaningless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green pressure groups say the agreement is just another postponement of action as g8 leaders trumpeted their landmark deal to cut global emissions by 50 per cent by 2050 , the ' 50/50 ' agreement , which has yet to be sealed , was quickly lambasted by environmentalists as virtually meaningless . meeting for the second day at a luxury mountain resort overlooking lake toyako , in the northern island of hokkaido , the heads of state and government of the world 's seven richest countries plus russia turned their minds to the global economic slowdown , spiraling food and oil prices and the need to boost aid to africa .
but they were also under intense pressure to make real progress on the climate change front .
having failed to agree on medium-term cuts to greenhouse gas emissions , they issued a statement saying they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least -lrb- a -rrb- 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050 . "
jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission , said he was " very happy about the results of the g8 on climate change . "
german chancellor angela merkel said they had made " clear progress . "
" this is a significant step forward from heiligendamm , " merkel told reporters , referring to last year 's g8 meeting which she hosted in the northern german spa town .
" this means that the international community will no longer get off the hook , " she said .
however , south africa 's environment minister marthinus van schalkwyk said the g8 had made no progress at all in stabilising the planet .
" as it is expressed in the g8 statement , the long-term goal is an empty slogan without substance , " he said .
the g8 deal was full of ambiguity .
senior japanese official koji tsuruoka said the long-term goal should be seen as a " political vision " without a clear base year and that it is not legally binding .
but pressure groups and scientists said the leaders were merely burying their heads in the sand .
opponents scathing of g8 's empty words james hansen , one of the world 's most respected climate scientists , slammed the summit 's outcome as " worse than worthless . "
the leaders " are taking actions that guarantee that we deliver to our children climate catastrophes that are out of our control , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the g8 debates , the ice caps continue to melt " while the arctic is melting , the g8 are postponing action .
instead of climate protection , the world got nothing but flowery words , " said greenpeace 's daniel mittler .
" if this is a step forward , we will never prevent climate chaos in time . "
" the texas oilman has once again prevented the g8 from undergoing the energy revolution it needs , " mittler said .
" bush is a lame duck , so who cares what he thinks about 2050 ? "
oxfam international said that the g8 's ' 50 by 50 ' climate goal left the world with a " 50/50 chance of a climate meltdown . "
the charity called tuesday 's announcement " another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now . "
base measurement year missing from agreement critics pointed out that not only does the deal still need to be endorsed by the rest of the world , possibly at a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- meeting in copenhagen next year ; it also does n't contain a base year on which to measure the cuts .
this is because no agreement was reached among the g8 leaders .
while the eu had suggested using 1990 as a base , canada called for a much more recent date , while host japan made no suggestions at all .
moreover , russia said it would sign up to the deal , but only if it was not legally binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush would be 104 by the time the deal reaches fruition " it 's unprecedented and it is quite unrealistic that one government should take responsibility for something 42 years ahead , " said alexander pankin , a russian foreign ministry official .
as ben wikler of avaaz.org , a pressure group , noted , by the time 2050 comes us president george w bush will be 104 and japan 's premier , yasuo fukuda , will be 114 .
unfccc chief criticizes 50-50 deal un climate change chief yvo de boer joined the debate , saying that the g8 summit goal of halving global warming emissions by 2050 was too distant and too vague .
de boer , in an interview with afp news agency , said the summit statement had " some positive elements , " as it acknowledged rich and poor countries had different responsibilities for emissions and priority had to be given to eradicating poverty .
but how rich countries intend to cut their own emissions in the next dozen years - a period deemed critical by scientists - is " completely missing , " he complained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer pointed out many holes in the g8 's agreement " if it 's not clear that rich nations are going to lead , then why should poor nations follow ? " said de boer , the executive secretary of the unfccc .
de boer spelt out what he saw as several deficiencies in the toyako statement .
" the problem is that a -rrb- 2050 is very far away ; b -rrb- it 's not clear what is going to serve as the baseline for this 50-percent reduction ; c -rrb- it 's not clear how this reduction is going to be divided up between rich nations and poor nations ; and d -rrb- it 's not clear how the rich nation portion of that minus 50 is going to be divided amongst individual countries , " he said .
de boer also questioned whether the statement amounted to a major step forward in diplomatic language compared to the 2007 g8 summit in heiligendamm .
" last year they were talking about eight countries seriously considering and adopting a 50-percent reduction goal , " he said .
" now they are suggesting that 180 countries seriously consider adopting a 50-percent reduction goal . "
energy , food and oil crises , africa also on agenda before issuing the climate statement , the g8 leaders had previously turned their attention to the economy , warning that spiraling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth .
" we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement .
the leaders further stressed that the surge in food prices had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . "
on oil , they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
other proposed solutions included boosting short-term production and refining capacities and greater market transparency to avoid speculation .
on the demand side , countries should reduce their dependence on hydrocarbons and improve energy efficiency , they said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis is likely to increase global poverty meanwhile , they warned that high food prices risked pushing millions more people back into poverty and called on other donors to increase their contributions to the un 's world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- .
a promise to stick to their pledge to raise by 25 billion dollars the level of annual aid they give to africa by 2010 , meanwhile , was slammed by non-governmental organizations as too little too late .
on the issue of zimbabwe , russia opposed new sanctions against the regime of president robert mugabe .
gaffs galore there were also a series of blunders and diplomatic incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarko is making a habit of rubbing people the wrong way french president nicolas sarkozy risked offending the hosting nation by refusing to hold a bilateral meeting with fukuda , while the us delegation was forced to apologize after distributing an unflattering biography of italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .

but they were also under intense pressure to make real progress on the climate change front .
having failed to agree on medium-term cuts to greenhouse gas emissions , they issued a statement saying they would " consider and adopt " the goal of achieving " at least -lrb- a -rrb- 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050 . "
jose manuel barroso , the head of the european union 's executive body , the european commission , said he was " very happy about the results of the g8 on climate change . "
german chancellor angela merkel said they had made " clear progress . "
" this is a significant step forward from heiligendamm , " merkel told reporters , referring to last year 's g8 meeting which she hosted in the northern german spa town .
" this means that the international community will no longer get off the hook , " she said .
however , south africa 's environment minister marthinus van schalkwyk said the g8 had made no progress at all in stabilising the planet .
" as it is expressed in the g8 statement , the long-term goal is an empty slogan without substance , " he said .
the g8 deal was full of ambiguity .
senior japanese official koji tsuruoka said the long-term goal should be seen as a " political vision " without a clear base year and that it is not legally binding .
but pressure groups and scientists said the leaders were merely burying their heads in the sand .
opponents scathing of g8 's empty words james hansen , one of the world 's most respected climate scientists , slammed the summit 's outcome as " worse than worthless . "
the leaders " are taking actions that guarantee that we deliver to our children climate catastrophes that are out of our control , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the g8 debates , the ice caps continue to melt " while the arctic is melting , the g8 are postponing action .
instead of climate protection , the world got nothing but flowery words , " said greenpeace 's daniel mittler .
" if this is a step forward , we will never prevent climate chaos in time . "
" the texas oilman has once again prevented the g8 from undergoing the energy revolution it needs , " mittler said .
" bush is a lame duck , so who cares what he thinks about 2050 ? "
oxfam international said that the g8 's ' 50 by 50 ' climate goal left the world with a " 50/50 chance of a climate meltdown . "
the charity called tuesday 's announcement " another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now . "
base measurement year missing from agreement critics pointed out that not only does the deal still need to be endorsed by the rest of the world , possibly at a united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- meeting in copenhagen next year ; it also does n't contain a base year on which to measure the cuts .
this is because no agreement was reached among the g8 leaders .
while the eu had suggested using 1990 as a base , canada called for a much more recent date , while host japan made no suggestions at all .
moreover , russia said it would sign up to the deal , but only if it was not legally binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush would be 104 by the time the deal reaches fruition " it 's unprecedented and it is quite unrealistic that one government should take responsibility for something 42 years ahead , " said alexander pankin , a russian foreign ministry official .
as ben wikler of avaaz.org , a pressure group , noted , by the time 2050 comes us president george w bush will be 104 and japan 's premier , yasuo fukuda , will be 114 .
unfccc chief criticizes 50-50 deal un climate change chief yvo de boer joined the debate , saying that the g8 summit goal of halving global warming emissions by 2050 was too distant and too vague .
de boer , in an interview with afp news agency , said the summit statement had " some positive elements , " as it acknowledged rich and poor countries had different responsibilities for emissions and priority had to be given to eradicating poverty .
but how rich countries intend to cut their own emissions in the next dozen years - a period deemed critical by scientists - is " completely missing , " he complained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer pointed out many holes in the g8 's agreement " if it 's not clear that rich nations are going to lead , then why should poor nations follow ? " said de boer , the executive secretary of the unfccc .
de boer spelt out what he saw as several deficiencies in the toyako statement .
" the problem is that a -rrb- 2050 is very far away ; b -rrb- it 's not clear what is going to serve as the baseline for this 50-percent reduction ; c -rrb- it 's not clear how this reduction is going to be divided up between rich nations and poor nations ; and d -rrb- it 's not clear how the rich nation portion of that minus 50 is going to be divided amongst individual countries , " he said .
de boer also questioned whether the statement amounted to a major step forward in diplomatic language compared to the 2007 g8 summit in heiligendamm .
" last year they were talking about eight countries seriously considering and adopting a 50-percent reduction goal , " he said .
" now they are suggesting that 180 countries seriously consider adopting a 50-percent reduction goal . "
energy , food and oil crises , africa also on agenda before issuing the climate statement , the g8 leaders had previously turned their attention to the economy , warning that spiraling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth .
" we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement .
the leaders further stressed that the surge in food prices had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . "
on oil , they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
other proposed solutions included boosting short-term production and refining capacities and greater market transparency to avoid speculation .
on the demand side , countries should reduce their dependence on hydrocarbons and improve energy efficiency , they said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis is likely to increase global poverty meanwhile , they warned that high food prices risked pushing millions more people back into poverty and called on other donors to increase their contributions to the un 's world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- .
a promise to stick to their pledge to raise by 25 billion dollars the level of annual aid they give to africa by 2010 , meanwhile , was slammed by non-governmental organizations as too little too late .
on the issue of zimbabwe , russia opposed new sanctions against the regime of president robert mugabe .
gaffs galore there were also a series of blunders and diplomatic incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarko is making a habit of rubbing people the wrong way french president nicolas sarkozy risked offending the hosting nation by refusing to hold a bilateral meeting with fukuda , while the us delegation was forced to apologize after distributing an unflattering biography of italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .

1 , 2008 for anyone wanting german nationality , reflect cultural biases . turkish community chairman kenan kolat said the 310 multiple-choice questions published by the interior ministry tested not only knowledge of germany but " to some extent also attitudes . "
the test is additional to existing naturalization requirements .
one question asks what allows people in germany to speak out openly against the government .
the possible answers are : freedom of religion , taxation , right to vote , freedom of opinion .
another question references germany 's christian heritage by asking what the last four weeks before christmas are called .
the following choices are given : all souls ' day , harvest festival , advent , all saints ' day .
citizenship courses make much more sense than a test , kolat said in an interview with the cologne-based daily koelner stadt-anzeiger .
multiple-choice exam thirty-three questions will be chosen at random from a longer list which will be made public beforehand .
more than half of the questions will need to be answered correctly .
integration courses to prepare for the test will remain optional .
kolat said he favored citizenship courses instead of a test .
candidates could be asked to list the colors of the german flag and how they are displayed .
they will need to know cultural reference points such as who composed the " ode to joy . "
and they will be required to beef up on trivia such as the names of germany 's mountain ranges .
not all questions easy kolat suggested putting the questions to germans at information stands in berlin .
" it would be interesting to see how that goes off , " he said .
the academics from berlin 's humboldt university who compiled the questions tested them in schools , taking as their guinea pigs pupils of both german and immigrant origin . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the plans are unpopular among czechs and many others . us secretary of state condoleezza rice announced that the deal had been reached after meeting with her counterpart karel schwarzenberg in prague .
" we face with the iranians , and so do our allies and friends , a growing missile threat that is getting ever longer and ever deeper , and where the iranian appetite for nuclear technology ... is still unchecked , " rice told reporters in czech capital .
the radar system is part of a defensive shield intended to protect europe against missile attacks by so-called " rouge states " like iran .
washington hopes that the entire shield will be functional some time between 2011 and 2013 .
but rice said the next us president would have to decide whether and how to go ahead with the shield .
high speed collisions bildunterschrift : this is how the system would work in the proposed system , radar stations in the czech republic would be responsible for locating enemy missiles detected by us satellites .
that data would then be relayed to interceptor missiles or " kill vehicles " stations in neighboring poland .
the inceptors would then be sent speeding off to collide with and destroy the hostile missiles .
but questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the proposed system - in particular whether it would be capable of distinguishing between missile with live warheads and decoys .
and while tuesday 's deal could prove an important step in realizing washington 's ambitious plans , shield proponents will still have to overcome a lot of popular and political resistance rto what many fear could be the start a new cold war .
feuds galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most czechs would rather not have the shield rice 's visit to prague was accompanied by protests , with demonstrators unfurling banners reading " do n't make a target of us . "
" we believe that this could start another arms race , and we believe this will not raise the security of the czech republic , " protestor frantisek smrcka told the dpe news agency .
an opinion poll in june suggested that 68 percent of czechs were against becoming involved in the shield system .
and the current czech government has only a razor-thin majority in the parliament and could face difficulties getting the deal approved .
meanwhile , despite 14 months of negotiations , the us has yet to reach an agreement with poland , where the interceptor missiles would be stationed .
poland is insisting on billions of dollars in us aid to modernize its armed forces in return for hosting the facilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is n't happy about the prospect of these on its doorstep and russia has repeatedly expressed its opposition to having a strong us military presence in its former back yard , threatening to retarget nuclear missiles at europe if the shield is put into place .
washington has been at pains to assure the kremlin that the shield is not directed against russia .
" we want the system to be transparent to the russians , " rice told reporters on tuesday .
but the system , assuming it ever gets built , could ultimately ratchet up tensions instead of making europeans feel more secure . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the plans are unpopular among czechs and many others . us secretary of state condoleezza rice announced that the deal had been reached after meeting with her counterpart karel schwarzenberg in prague .
" we face with the iranians , and so do our allies and friends , a growing missile threat that is getting ever longer and ever deeper , and where the iranian appetite for nuclear technology ... is still unchecked , " rice told reporters in czech capital .
the radar system is part of a defensive shield intended to protect europe against missile attacks by so-called " rouge states " like iran .
washington hopes that the entire shield will be functional some time between 2011 and 2013 .
but rice said the next us president would have to decide whether and how to go ahead with the shield .
high speed collisions bildunterschrift : this is how the system would work in the proposed system , radar stations in the czech republic would be responsible for locating enemy missiles detected by us satellites .
that data would then be relayed to interceptor missiles or " kill vehicles " stations in neighboring poland .
the inceptors would then be sent speeding off to collide with and destroy the hostile missiles .
but questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the proposed system - in particular whether it would be capable of distinguishing between missile with live warheads and decoys .
and while tuesday 's deal could prove an important step in realizing washington 's ambitious plans , shield proponents will still have to overcome a lot of popular and political resistance rto what many fear could be the start a new cold war .
feuds galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most czechs would rather not have the shield rice 's visit to prague was accompanied by protests , with demonstrators unfurling banners reading " do n't make a target of us . "
" we believe that this could start another arms race , and we believe this will not raise the security of the czech republic , " protestor frantisek smrcka told the dpe news agency .
an opinion poll in june suggested that 68 percent of czechs were against becoming involved in the shield system .
and the current czech government has only a razor-thin majority in the parliament and could face difficulties getting the deal approved .
meanwhile , despite 14 months of negotiations , the us has yet to reach an agreement with poland , where the interceptor missiles would be stationed .
poland is insisting on billions of dollars in us aid to modernize its armed forces in return for hosting the facilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is n't happy about the prospect of these on its doorstep and russia has repeatedly expressed its opposition to having a strong us military presence in its former back yard , threatening to retarget nuclear missiles at europe if the shield is put into place .
washington has been at pains to assure the kremlin that the shield is not directed against russia .
" we want the system to be transparent to the russians , " rice told reporters on tuesday .
but the system , assuming it ever gets built , could ultimately ratchet up tensions instead of making europeans feel more secure . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now eu ministers are calling on tougher rules , which discourage illegal immigrants while still encouraging skilled foreign labor . european union justice ministers have announced that europe should take complete control of migration into and out of the continent , working with the rest of the world to end illegal migration and manage legal flows .
the news comes as eu ministers meet with their counterparts in the southern french beach resort of cannes . the informal meeting , a regular feature of eu politics , is aimed at getting ministers to agree on the broad outline of policies , so that they will find it easier to agree on the technical details at future , formal meetings . monday 's talks were set to be dominated by a proposal from the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , to create a " pact on immigration and asylum " between the eu 's 27 member states . the pact , which would not be legally binding but would carry political weight , asks eu member states to strengthen the fight against illegal immigration , to crack down on the employers of illegal migrants and to live up to their responsibility to expel illegal residents from their territory . at the same time , the pact urges eu members to put in place targeted immigration policies which would attract highly-qualified foreigners , in particular , to europe .
and it calls on the eu to work closely with countries of origin and transit , supporting development on their territories and making it easier for immigrants to send money home as a way of making it more attractive for potential migrants to stay at home . language toned down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people enter the eu illegally every year however , a draft of the pact agreed immediately before the meeting tones down considerably the strong language used in the initial text .
where the first draft listed strengthened border control as its top priority , that was relegated to number three in later versions , being supplanted by the question of boosting legal migration . the first draft also prioritized " organizing the effective removal of irregular residents from the eu " - an emphasis which chimes in with the policy of france 's president nicolas sarkozy , who has set annual quotas for expelling illegal immigrants . but the later text used a much softer tone , calling for a general " fight against illegal immigration , especially assuring the return of foreigners who are in an irregular situation to their country of origin or a transit country . " the first draft of the pact also stated categorically that " massive and collective legalizations produce a major pull effect " and that member states " agree to give them up . "
but the latest draft simply calls on member states to limit their legalizations to a case-by-case system in the future . french experts critical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been heavily criticized for his stance while that compromise paves the way for broad eu acceptance of the text at a summit in october , the news on the domestic front was less promising for the french government in its immigration plans . as the meeting opened , the french press reported that a commission of french experts formed by sarkozy to discuss his migration policies had roundly criticized key points . binding immigration quotas would be " unrealistic and pointless , " and the national authorities have " no discretionary power to determine the flow " of migrants into france , especially on family grounds , left-wing daily la liberation quoted the report . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when beijing bid for the olympics in 2001 , it said its air would meet world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- standards .
the bbc put this to the test using a hand-held detector to test for airborne particles known as pm10 .
we found that the city 's air failed to meet the who 's air quality guidelines for pm10 on six days out of seven .
these particles are caused by traffic , construction work and factory emissions .
they are responsible for much of this city 's pollution .
on one of these days , the pollution reading was seven times over the who 's air quality guideline .
beijing 's air will be fundamental to the success or failure of this city 's games the bbc 's james reynolds reynolds ' china : testing pollution by comparison , recent readings done in london - the site of the 2012 games - all fall within the who 's guidelines .
beijing insists that there is still time to get things right .
later this month it is imposing a series of emergency air-quality measures which will take cars off the streets and shut down building sites .
one official has told the bbc that he is confident that beijing will still fulfil its clean air promise .

health secretary nicola sturgeon told a british medical association conference how she intends to prevent firms getting a foothold in gp care .
in england a host of firms are bidding for contracts to run gp services after encouragement from ministers .
ms sturgeon said there was a " battle of ideas " on the future of healthcare .
i am firmly opposed to the privatisation of healthcare nicola sturgeon health secretary for scotland scotland already has a much cooler relationship with the private sector than england does .
it only uses private firms for hospital treatment as a last resort - unlike england where one in 10 non-emergency nhs operations is carried out by the private sector .
in gp care , there has been much more gradual involvement , but deals have been or are in the process of being signed in london and derbyshire .
doctors also say the forthcoming creation of a network of polyclinics will lead to further privatisation .
in scotland , there has only been one example of a company bidding for a gp contract .
this happened in lanarkshire in 2006 , but the firm was not successful after a local outcry .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
now the scottish national party administration is looking to ensure that it does not happen at all by barring private firms from bidding for family doctor contracts .
there are a range of contracts to which health chiefs can sign doctors up .
just one of them allows deals to be done with private firms and it is this one the scottish ministers are targeting .
ms sturgeon said : " i think there is a battle of ideas going on about the future direction of healthcare .
" a battle between the values of the market , of internal competition and contestability and the values of public service , of co-operation and collaboration .
" i am firmly opposed to the privatisation of healthcare and to this end the scottish government will legislate to make sure there is no privatisation of gp services by the backdoor . "
the move was welcomed by dr hamish meldrum , chairman of the bma , who gave a speech praising the approach of scotland at the opening of the four-day conference in edinburgh on monday .
he said : " this is yet another example of how scotland has got it right when it comes to the nhs .
" it is encouraging to note how in scotland they are demonstrating that they are committed to a public service when it comes to health - i only hope the government in westminster takes note . "
but a department of health spokeswoman said ministers in england were committed to the private sector .
" where the private sector offers high quality patient care , good value for money and is meeting local needs we will continue to bring them into working as part of the family of nhs providers . "

the people 's dispensary for sick animals -lrb- pdsa -rrb- claims the growing number of owners who overfeed their animals could be guilty of " killing their pets with kindness " .

built in ad142 on the orders of then roman emperor antoninus pius as a defence against celtic tribes after the conquest of southern scotland , the wall spanned 37 miles -lrb- 59.5km -rrb- across central scotland .
the decision to grant it world heritage status also marks a further addition to the frontiers of the roman empire world heritage site , an ambitious international project to recognise the entire frontier , which stretches through europe , the middle east and north africa .
unlike hadrian 's wall in the south , the antonine wall was abandoned by the romans after about 20 years despite the huge effort that would have gone into its construction .
the scale of the structure that was imposed on the landscape would have been dramatic for people in the area dr george findlater wall gains world heritage status it was built by soldiers on stone foundations , topped with turf and stood about 4m -lrb- 13ft -rrb- high and would have been a formidable sight for locals .
it was also fronted by a huge ditch thought to be about 4m -lrb- 13ft -rrb- deep and anything up to 12m -lrb- 39.3ft -rrb- wide .
experts believe the structure , which ran from bo 'ness near falkirk to old kilpatrick in west dunbartonshire , probably carried a wooden walkway protected by a wooden breastwork .
it was also linked by a road so soldiers could be easily be moved to trouble spots quickly .
forts were constructed along its length at two-mile intervals , resulting in a total of 19 .
just under two miles west of the centre of falkirk is one of the best preserved forts at rough castle .
' roman power ' here visitors can get a real impression of what the wall would have looked like , and what life would have been like for the troops manning it .
at this fort , the soldiers installed an additional line of defence consisting of pits of sharpened stakes concealed by brushwood .
known to the romans as lilia , their role was to break up any attack on the north gate of the fort before it reached the line of the wall itself .
dr george findlater , a senior inspector of monuments with historic scotland , said the wall was a potent symbol of roman power at the time .
he said : " the scale of the structure that was imposed on the landscape would have been dramatic for people in the area .
" society then would 've been tribal and family-based .
it is unlikely they would have seen anything like this before .
it would have been almost shocking for them to see . "
despite being an arresting structure , the wall did not fulfil its role for long and instead the romans fell back to their positions at hadrian 's wall .
the reasons for its abandonment remain unclear although some have speculated that constant attacks from the celts may have contributed .
the wall runs from the clyde to the forth across central scotland today however , the 22km -lrb- 13.6 miles -rrb- of the structure that remain , represent the most northerly walled frontier of the roman empire .
along with historic scotland , the successful bid to have the wall recognised was put forward by east and west dunbartonshire councils , falkirk council , glasgow city council and north lanarkshire council .
the benefits of being granted world heritage status , an accolade shared by such iconic landmarks as stonehenge and the great wall of china , are clear .
falkirk councillor , adrian mahoney said : " gaining world heritage status is a major achievement and there are so many new opportunities to maximise the benefit to our local area in the future .
" there will be many economic and tourism related advantages as the international interest in the wall and its significance increases .
" our local area has the most extensive parts of the wall remaining at rough castle near camelon , callendar park in falkirk and kinneil in bo 'ness .
" we would expect that these areas would attract the most interest , as would our museums at callendar house and kinneil .
" the significance of the announcement can not be underestimated . "

built in ad142 on the orders of then roman emperor antoninus pius as a defence against celtic tribes after the conquest of southern scotland , the wall spanned 37 miles -lrb- 59.5km -rrb- across central scotland .
the decision to grant it world heritage status also marks a further addition to the frontiers of the roman empire world heritage site , an ambitious international project to recognise the entire frontier , which stretches through europe , the middle east and north africa .
unlike hadrian 's wall in the south , the antonine wall was abandoned by the romans after about 20 years despite the huge effort that would have gone into its construction .
the scale of the structure that was imposed on the landscape would have been dramatic for people in the area dr george findlater wall gains world heritage status it was built by soldiers on stone foundations , topped with turf and stood about 4m -lrb- 13ft -rrb- high and would have been a formidable sight for locals .
it was also fronted by a huge ditch thought to be about 4m -lrb- 13ft -rrb- deep and anything up to 12m -lrb- 39.3ft -rrb- wide .
experts believe the structure , which ran from bo 'ness near falkirk to old kilpatrick in west dunbartonshire , probably carried a wooden walkway protected by a wooden breastwork .
it was also linked by a road so soldiers could be easily be moved to trouble spots quickly .
forts were constructed along its length at two-mile intervals , resulting in a total of 19 .
just under two miles west of the centre of falkirk is one of the best preserved forts at rough castle .
' roman power ' here visitors can get a real impression of what the wall would have looked like , and what life would have been like for the troops manning it .
at this fort , the soldiers installed an additional line of defence consisting of pits of sharpened stakes concealed by brushwood .
known to the romans as lilia , their role was to break up any attack on the north gate of the fort before it reached the line of the wall itself .
dr george findlater , a senior inspector of monuments with historic scotland , said the wall was a potent symbol of roman power at the time .
he said : " the scale of the structure that was imposed on the landscape would have been dramatic for people in the area .
" society then would 've been tribal and family-based .
it is unlikely they would have seen anything like this before .
it would have been almost shocking for them to see . "
despite being an arresting structure , the wall did not fulfil its role for long and instead the romans fell back to their positions at hadrian 's wall .
the reasons for its abandonment remain unclear although some have speculated that constant attacks from the celts may have contributed .
the wall runs from the clyde to the forth across central scotland today however , the 22km -lrb- 13.6 miles -rrb- of the structure that remain , represent the most northerly walled frontier of the roman empire .
along with historic scotland , the successful bid to have the wall recognised was put forward by east and west dunbartonshire councils , falkirk council , glasgow city council and north lanarkshire council .
the benefits of being granted world heritage status , an accolade shared by such iconic landmarks as stonehenge and the great wall of china , are clear .
falkirk councillor , adrian mahoney said : " gaining world heritage status is a major achievement and there are so many new opportunities to maximise the benefit to our local area in the future .
" there will be many economic and tourism related advantages as the international interest in the wall and its significance increases .
" our local area has the most extensive parts of the wall remaining at rough castle near camelon , callendar park in falkirk and kinneil in bo 'ness .
" we would expect that these areas would attract the most interest , as would our museums at callendar house and kinneil .
" the significance of the announcement can not be underestimated . "

the scale of the structure that was imposed on the landscape would have been dramatic for people in the area " dr george findlater wall gains world heritage status it was built by soldiers on stone foundations , topped with turf and stood about 4m -lrb- 13ft -rrb- high and would have been a formidable sight for locals .
it was also fronted by a huge ditch thought to be about 4m -lrb- 13ft -rrb- deep and anything up to 12m -lrb- 39.3ft -rrb- wide .
experts believe the structure , which ran from bo 'ness near falkirk to old kilpatrick in west dunbartonshire , probably carried a wooden walkway protected by a wooden breastwork .
it was also linked by a road so soldiers could be easily be moved to trouble spots quickly .
forts were constructed along its length at two-mile intervals , resulting in a total of 19 .
just under two miles west of the centre of falkirk is one of the best preserved forts at rough castle .
' roman power ' here visitors can get a real impression of what the wall would have looked like , and what life would have been like for the troops manning it .
at this fort , the soldiers installed an additional line of defence consisting of pits of sharpened stakes concealed by brushwood .
known to the romans as lilia , their role was to break up any attack on the north gate of the fort before it reached the line of the wall itself .
dr george findlater , a senior inspector of monuments with historic scotland , said the wall was a potent symbol of roman power at the time .
he said : " the scale of the structure that was imposed on the landscape would have been dramatic for people in the area .
" society then would 've been tribal and family-based .
it is unlikely they would have seen anything like this before .
it would have been almost shocking for them to see . "
despite being an arresting structure , the wall did not fulfil its role for long and instead the romans fell back to their positions at hadrian 's wall .
the reasons for its abandonment remain unclear although some have speculated that constant attacks from the celts may have contributed .
today however , the 22km -lrb- 13.6 miles -rrb- of the structure that remain , represent the most northerly walled frontier of the roman empire .
along with historic scotland , the successful bid to have the wall recognised was put forward by east and west dunbartonshire councils , falkirk council , glasgow city council and north lanarkshire council .
the benefits of being granted world heritage status , an accolade shared by such iconic landmarks as stonehenge and the great wall of china , are clear .
falkirk councillor , adrian mahoney said : " gaining world heritage status is a major achievement and there are so many new opportunities to maximise the benefit to our local area in the future .
" there will be many economic and tourism related advantages as the international interest in the wall and its significance increases .
" our local area has the most extensive parts of the wall remaining at rough castle near camelon , callendar park in falkirk and kinneil in bo 'ness .
" we would expect that these areas would attract the most interest , as would our museums at callendar house and kinneil .
" the significance of the announcement can not be underestimated . "

the antonine wall , which stretched 37 miles across scotland 's central belt , was given the status at a summit of the un cultural body in canada .
it joins a host of renowned sites across the world including the great wall of china and stonehenge .
the wall was built 20 years after hadrian 's wall and 100 miles north .
it runs from the clyde in the west to the firth of forth in the east .
although much of it was destroyed over time , sections of the fortification can still be seen at several points .
it is now hoped the world heritage status will bring with it a tourism renaissance to museums and roman sites in the area .
the wall , which was completed in 142 ad , takes its name from emperor antoninus pius .
he ordered its construction in a bid to halt the advance of caledonian tribes into southern scotland , then under roman rule .
built of a rampart of soil and turf and resting on a stone foundation , it stood 12ft tall and was dotted with 19 forts .
it was occupied for about 20 years , until the romans retreated around 160 ad to hadrian 's wall , a stone structure straddling northern england .
the bid for world heritage status was launched in 2003 by the uk government and was also backed by the scottish government .
scottish culture minister linda fabiani said the announcement represented " the highest accolade of a nation 's heritage " .
some of the wall 's best-preserved remains are in the falkirk council area and council chiefs expressed hopes the status would boost tourism .

a church group will now draw up a draft of the code to put before the synod next february .
however , it will not include safeguards demanded by traditionalists , such as allowing male " super-bishops " to cater for those opposing the change .
liberals said such moves would have created a two-tier episcopacy .
some 1,300 clergy opposed to consecrating women as bishops had threatened to leave the church if the safeguards they wanted were not agreed .
they made the threat to leave in a letter to the archbishops of canterbury and york , but critics said many of the signatories were retired rather than serving clergy .
the pressure group women in the church had said any compromise allowing traditionalists to go to super-bishops instead of female bishops would create second-class clergy and institutionalise division .
following six hours of debate on monday , which saw one bishop in tears , the synod rejected both the super-bishops proposal and the traditionalists ' preferred option of new dioceses for objectors . "
if there is n't proper provision for us to live in dignity , inevitably we 're driven out " the right reverend john broadhurst bishop of fulham q & a : vote over women bishops guide to church of england factions bbc religious affairs correspondent robert pigott said the vote had been conclusive and was accompanied by emotional scenes .
but traditionalists have warned that the decision could hasten the prospect of a split within the church .
' navel-gazing ' during the debate at the university of york , the archbishop of canterbury , dr rowan williams , said he would be in favour of " a more rather than a less robust " form of accommodating traditionalists .
he added : " i am deeply unhappy with any scheme or any solution to this which ends up , as it were , structurally humiliating women who might be nominated to the episcopate . "
" it is very good for the church and very good for women and also good for the whole nation " christina rees women and the church analysis : ' debate rumbles on ' send us your comments tory mp and synod member robert key , who supported the reforms , said afterwards it was time for the church to move beyond " navel-gazing " .
he added : " it is a good day for the church of england , and it is a good day for the country because our national church , the church by law established , is actually now in step with most of the country and what people feel . "
synod member and traditionalist gerry o 'brien was hissed during the debate as he alluded to the american and canadian churches , from whom traditionalists have split in protest at the ordination of an openly gay bishop in 2003 .
mr o 'brien said : " we can force people out of the church of england but i think the experience in america says you ca n't force people out of the anglican communion , because there are a lot of archbishops elsewhere in the world who will be more than ready to provide the support . "
the bishop of fulham , the right reverend john broadhurst , who is a traditionalist , told newsnight that the vote could lead to a split .
" i think a lot of us have made it quite clear if there is n't proper provision for us to live in dignity , inevitably we 're driven out , " he said .
" it 's not a case of walking away . "
christina rees , chairwoman of women and the church , which supports female ordination , said she welcomed the decision .
she added : " it is very good for the church and very good for women and also good for the whole nation . "
the first women priests in the church of england were ordained in 1994 .
the episcopal church in scotland has already cleared the way for ordaining women bishops , as have churches in america , canada , new zealand and australia .

campaigners for women bishops have welcomed the decision the bishop of fulham , the right reverend john broadhurst , who is a traditionalist , told newsnight that the vote could lead to a split .
" i think a lot of us have made it quite clear if there is n't proper provision for us to live in dignity , inevitably we 're driven out , " he said .
" it 's not a case of walking away . "
christina rees , chairwoman of women and the church , which supports female ordination , said she welcomed the decision .
she added : " it is very good for the church and very good for women and also good for the whole nation . "
the first women priests in the church of england were ordained in 1994 .
the episcopal church in scotland has already cleared the way for ordaining women bishops , as have churches in america , canada , new zealand and australia .

a church group will now draw up a draft of the code to put before the synod next february .
however , it will not include safeguards demanded by traditionalists , such as allowing male " super-bishops " to cater for those opposing the change .
liberals said such moves would have created a two-tier episcopacy .
some 1,300 clergy opposed to consecrating women as bishops had threatened to leave the church if the safeguards they wanted were not agreed .

the venerable christine hardman and the right reverend john broadhurst react they made the threat to leave in a letter to the archbishops of canterbury and york , but critics said many of the signatories were retired rather than serving clergy .
the pressure group women in the church had said any compromise allowing traditionalists to go to super-bishops instead of female bishops would create second-class clergy and institutionalise division .
following six hours of debate on monday , which saw one bishop in tears , the synod rejected both the super-bishops proposal and the traditionalists ' preferred option of new dioceses for objectors .
if there is n't proper provision for us to live in dignity , inevitably we 're driven out the right reverend john broadhurst bishop of fulham q & a : vote over women bishops guide to church of england factions bbc religious affairs correspondent robert pigott said the vote had been conclusive and was accompanied by emotional scenes .
but traditionalists have warned that the decision could hasten the prospect of a split within the church .
' navel-gazing ' during the debate at the university of york , the archbishop of canterbury , dr rowan williams , said he would be in favour of " a more rather than a less robust " form of accommodating traditionalists .
he added : " i am deeply unhappy with any scheme or any solution to this which ends up , as it were , structurally humiliating women who might be nominated to the episcopate . "
it is very good for the church and very good for women and also good for the whole nation christina rees women and the church analysis : ' debate rumbles on ' send us your comments tory mp and synod member robert key , who supported the reforms , said afterwards it was time for the church to move beyond " navel-gazing " .
he added : " it is a good day for the church of england , and it is a good day for the country because our national church , the church by law established , is actually now in step with most of the country and what people feel . "
synod member and traditionalist gerry o 'brien was hissed during the debate as he alluded to the american and canadian churches , from whom traditionalists have split in protest at the ordination of an openly gay bishop in 2003 .
mr o 'brien said : " we can force people out of the church of england but i think the experience in america says you ca n't force people out of the anglican communion , because there are a lot of archbishops elsewhere in the world who will be more than ready to provide the support . "
campaigners for women bishops have welcomed the decision the bishop of fulham , the right reverend john broadhurst , who is a traditionalist , told newsnight that the vote could lead to a split .
" i think a lot of us have made it quite clear if there is n't proper provision for us to live in dignity , inevitably we 're driven out , " he said .
" it 's not a case of walking away . "
christina rees , chairwoman of women and the church , which supports female ordination , said she welcomed the decision .
she added : " it is very good for the church and very good for women and also good for the whole nation . "
the first women priests in the church of england were ordained in 1994 .
the episcopal church in scotland has already cleared the way for ordaining women bishops , as have churches in america , canada , new zealand and australia .
